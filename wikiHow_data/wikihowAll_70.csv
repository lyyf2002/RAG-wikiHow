Keep pushing yourself.",How to Be Adventurous," Inhibitions are feelings that make you self-conscious and unable to act in a relaxed and natural way.Perhaps you are shy, inexperienced or fearful. In order to let go of what is holding you back you must feel safe with yourself, your surroundings and the people around you.


Ask yourself why you want to be adventurous. What do you think it will provide to you? Do you want to be open to all possibilities? If so, you are correct.
Conquering physical challenges requires you to overcome mental challenges as well. For example, if you train for and climb a mountain it will challenge your physical abilities and show you how physically and mentally strong you are.
Do you think you have something to prove? Are you starved for attention? Why are you seeking a thrill? Do you think it will build your self-esteem? Do you just want to have more fun?
Take a few minutes to answer these questions as it will help you craft a plan for action.;
, If you haven’t been adventurous to this point in your life, then fear has likely been holding you back. Identifying your fears might be simple, or it might take a bit more introspection (the process of directly attempting to access your own internal processes).Your feelings, thoughts, wishes and fantasies cannot be seen, but they are very real.


Your fears might include public speaking, snakes, or high places. They may also include talking to strangers, being fired, or flunking a class. They may be rooted in a deeper fear of looking ignorant, being abandoned, or losing your sense of safety.
Conquering fear leads to building trust in yourself, your thoughts and actions. You will learn that you can take care of yourself. For example, you may be too afraid to move out of your parent’s house because you don’t think you can do it. If you choose to be adventurous and move out and see that you can do it, you have conquered your fear.
Use visualization techniques. Imagine yourself doing activities that challenge you to be adventurous and you coming out of it alive and healthy. These scenarios can be surfing, racing horses, exploring your musical talents or something smaller like asking an athlete for an autograph. Adventures can be big and small.
You may be avoiding adventure due to a fear of uncertainty. You must tip the scales from certain toward uncertain to remove mental obstacles preventing you from being adventurous. For example, if you avoid or procrastinate participating in events because you don't know what is going to happen, then set up small excursions that slowly build a tolerance., Being adventurous entails feeling mentally free, open and willing to experience life. Opening your heart by being kind to yourself will help you build personal strengths.If you need to feel safe before you are comfortable doing something new, use meditation and yoga to calm you and relieve stress.Once you establish a sense of safety and calm you will be more open to adventure. For example, you will go on vacation by yourself to Portugal despite not knowing any Portuguese.
Give yourself a push toward feeling free. It can be helpful to say self-affirmations like, ""Everything is going to be okay; I'm ready to get started; or this change is going to be good for me!"" Being vocal helps as well. Simply yelling at that moment works to expend the energy to move you forward.
Take safety precautions. Being adventurous does not mean that you do things that are unsafe. Physically demanding adventures must include a deliberate evaluation of the dangers involved. For example, if you want to learn to race a boat, you must research the safety requirements. Consulting with a professional is advised., There are times in life when you get too busy to think about what interests you. If you want to be more adventurous, then you need to take the time to have some fun and explore. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to travel or spend a school semester in a foreign country. Maybe designing sets for stage plays has always intrigued you.


If you want to be adventurous in your career, access questionnaires online that help identify your interests.Talk to people who are doing the things that interest you. Ask them if they have any tips for getting involved.
You might discover new interests that you didn’t even know about. For example, there might be a martial arts studio that you drive by each day. One day you decide to be adventurous and make a visit. You observe a class and like what you see, and sign up for a class.

, She might be a person who seems fearless and accomplishes what she sets out to do. She spends her vacations building houses for the poor, whitewater rafting, and scuba diving in the ocean. You admire this person and you would like to learn from them about being adventurous.


Choose a mentor to help you. A mentor can be a friend, family member or someone you are acquainted with at work. Talk to the person and ask, “I am trying to be more adventurous in my life and it seems like you do that really well. Is there any advice you can give me? Would you mind if I checked in with you periodically to talk about this?”
You can model your behavior after a professional you don’t know. For example, if there is an oceanographer you admire who has a TV show you can watch the show and follow the person on social media. You can ask the person questions via social media channels.

, Lay out your plans to take a trip, make a change or try something new. Determine how often you want to do these things. Commit to doing something new once a day, week or month. If you schedule your events, making them a “to do list,” you are more likely to carry them out.It could be fun to plan an adventure with friends. Discuss and agree to have each person take responsibility for a task that needs to be accomplished. For example, one person can check on airline ticket prices; another person identifies things to do when you are at your destination.
Travel around the world. With proper planning it is possible to travel the world in cost-effective ways. It may be cheaper to do than you think. Investigate costs before you allow it to deter you from being adventurous., You can't be adventurous if you sit around doing nothing. Even the quest to become more adventurous, is in fact an adventure. Like any other change in life, you must take action for it to happen. Start with small steps and build to larger ones. Recognize that each step is movement toward your goal.


Set your limits and boundaries.Being adventurous will involve doing things that are outside your comfort zone. You may be comfortable hiking in nature, but you have no interest in skydiving. Be reasonable with yourself and know your limits. Don’t be afraid to tell others that you have limits as well.
One way to take action is to vary your routine. Avoid getting stuck in a rut doing the same things the same way over and over. Even something as simple as shopping for groceries in a new market will give you a new perspective. Being adventurous can open you to new possibilities. For example, you go to the new market and meet someone who turns out to offer you a job, take you on a date, or he knows someone you grew up with that you haven’t seen in years. This would not have happened without you taking adventurous action.

, Humans are drawn to people who share a common interest and have fun together.Enthusiasm for life is contagious. If you find a group of people who share your interest in adventure, you will almost never feel alone.


Locate groups online and screen them for compatibility. For example, if you like computer animation, perhaps you could find a local animation film festival and volunteer to work there. You will meet people who not only share an interest in animation, but you get to learn about the film festival process.
Observe bulletin boards at school or in public places. There are groups that meet and are always looking for new members. Take a chance. It might change your life.
Attend an event and ask questions. For example, you attend a motorcycle show and ask one of the curators, “This show is fantastic. How does someone get involved in putting something like this on?” Most people will have a short conversation with you that might lead you to something exciting.

, You can maintain your enthusiasm for adventure by constantly asking questions. How do things work? What does it take to do that? Why do we have to always do it that way? When can we make a change for the better? Curiosity is at the root of being adventurous.


Create situations for yourself that will force you out of your comfort zone. Awkwardness is the first step toward learning something new.
Read books about things you know nothing about, then make a point to talk to others about it.
Talk to people doing jobs that you have never done.Observe people at play, doing their job, or relaxing with friends and family. Notice the things they do that are similar and different than the way you do them., If you are feeling stifled by your job, then take steps to find a new job that interests you. Financial support is a key factor in exploring new jobs. You want to make sure that you have the financial means to support yourself through your adventure.


Develop your resume and examine the skills that you have an how they might apply to a new career.
You may need to take additional classes to complete a certificate or degree to enter your new field of interest. This may take time, but the rewards will pay off as long as you see it as a great adventure to make you happy.

, Sometimes a change in scenery is just what you need. With proper planning, you can make anything happen as long as you stay the course and make smart choices.

, A bucket list contains all the things you want to do before you pass away. Fill it with everything you've ever wanted to do. It may include visiting every baseball stadium in the U.S., swimming across a large body of water, skiing in the Swiss Alps, or meeting a sports figure. Every item on your list guarantees to be packed with adventures.

, It is never too late to do something over. Whether you were too shy to try out for a play, or you struck out in a baseball game on the final out of the game, you would likely benefit from a little bit of redemption.


Make a list of the things in your life that made you feel bad, or caused you to be fearful and added to your lack of adventure. Then, one by one recreate the situations and make things right. If you struck out in a game, join a recreation team and with diligent practice you will be hitting in clutch situations in no time. The key will be for you to acknowledge your efforts even if you aren't a star player.

, Once you have felt the benefits of being adventurous, you will notice that it takes energy to do it. The promise of the reward is motivating, and you must continue to push yourself toward new adventures. Being adventurous is invigorating and you can use it as a tool to enhance your life.


If you feel yourself settling into a down mood, push yourself to take on a new adventure. Let the rewards boost your mood.
Praise yourself for the work you do to be adventurous. Motivate yourself by saying, “You’re adventurous because you are living life to the fullest. Congratulations.”"

Use an over-the-counter acne lotion or cream per the label directions. Do not overuse as they may dry your skin.
If over-the-counter creams do not work, your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, a topical antibiotic, a topical retinoid, sulfur, resorcinol, or an oral medication (such as antibiotics, hormonal contraceptive or isotretinoin).Consult your doctor if your acne does not get better after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment or if you suffer from severe acne.

, You might be tempted to scrub the skin to remove the spots but this can actually worsen the condition and prolong their duration.

Niacinamide (a form of vitamin B) acts like soy and is used in many cosmetics.
Ellagic acid, derived from strawberries, pomegranates, and cherries, works as an antioxidant and inhibits enzyme needed for melanin production.Lignin peroxidase (enzyme derived from a fungus) breaks down melanin in the skin and may have skin-lightening properties.Arbutin (a natural derivative of hydroquinone) is available in many skin-lightening cosmetics up to 3% concentration.Kojic acid (derived from a fungus) is an antioxidant that works by breaking down melanin. It is available in skin-lightening cosmetics in 1-4% concentrations.Licorice extracts (such as liquiritin) have been shown to lighten skin and are available in some cosmetics.Use these products according to the product labels and consult your doctor if you have any questions or side effects.

The citric acid in lemon juice has bleaching qualities, while the catecholates in potatoes help lighten the skin. Blend the juices and apply the mixture over the pigmentation.
Alternatively, use the lemon juice alone or in combination with almond or coconut oil..
Lemon, milk, honey and orange peels. The combination of citric acids, fruit peels, honey and milk make a paste that soothes your skin and may help lighten hyperpigmentation spots. Make a powder using dried orange peels by adding lemon juice, milk and enough honey to create a proper consistency for a mask. .
Honey and almond. Make a mask by mixing together a tablespoon of almond powder, a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of lemon. Apply the mask over the affected area for 15 minutes, then rinse away with water.
Cucumber and mint. Make a mixture using six leaves of fresh mint and one raw egg white beaten until frothy. Crush a half of a cucumber to form a fine paste, then add it to the mint-egg mixture and blend. Apply the mask over the affected area for 15 minutes and wash away with water.

Cystic acne tends to run in families and starts during puberty, often resulting in scarring.Cystic acne pimples are raised, red bumps that affect the deep layers of skin.They can become very large and deep.
They often do not have the whitehead-looking appearance.
They are often felt before they are seen and are almost always painful.

, Photodynamic treatment is an in-office dermatological therapy that consists of using a medication that is activated by a light or a laser to shrink sebaceous glands, therefore limiting oil secretions that cause acne.


Your dermatologist coats the affected area with a photosensitizing ointment that is absorbed into the skin for 30 minutes to three hours. From there, you sit underneath a lamp or have a laser treatment that causes your sebaceous glands to dry out and therefore shrink. This treatment takes place up to three to five times with a few weeks between each session.
This treatment is both effective at addressing current acne concerns and also serves as preventative maintenance.

, Isolaz is a laser-based therapy that targets bacteria that causes acne.

See the transformation as a process, not a quick change.,
Before decorating it's important to make sure your room is organized.,
Evaluate what you already have.,
Develop a theme (optional).,
Rearrange your furniture.,
Consider painting your walls.,
Change the lighting.,
Add some flavor to your walls.,
Get some different comforter and pillows.,
Hang up some mirrors.,
Line your drawers.,
Brighten up your windows.,
Put a nice rug on the floor to make the room look cozy.",How to Make Your Bedroom Unique," Redecorating a room can take a lot of work. You don't have to follow all the suggestions in this article but if you do, it'll probably take you awhile. Try to be patient.;
, Small drawers and dividers can make it easier to be organized and quicker to put stuff away.

, Look around your house and see what materials you already have on-hand. Cool holiday lights, lengths of fabric, paint, unwanted furniture, bulletin boards, pillows, and mirrors can all be fun additions to your room that your family might have sitting around unused. Pick out some items that you might want to include in your new room.  ** Throw away stuff you DO NOT need. **

, A theme can be as simple as a color or a mood, or it can center on a certain time period or fictional character. Whatever you choose, it should make your room feel like your own, individualized space.

, Changing the positioning of your room can help it feel different and more unique in very little time. Think about ways to maximize your space and leave more room open in the middle. (If you're out of ideas, check out Ikea or other department stores, and pay attention to how they arrange furniture to maximize space.)

, If your parents or landlord will allow it, try painting your walls to change the look of your room. Here are some ideas to consider:


If you want your room to look bigger, use light colors. Dark colors will make the walls look smaller and more confining.
Some people think that the color of a room can influence your mood. If you want a calming space, try blue, green or purple; for an area that's energizing, look into red, orange and yellow.
Try putting chalkboard paint on one of your walls. Chalkboard paint turns your wall into a literal chalkboard, where you can draw with chalk and erase when you're ready for a change. It comes in several colors beside black. While you might not want to paint all four walls in chalkboard paint, one wall (or a small wall that's by a door or closet) could be fun.
Brighten up your baseboards, window frames and door frames. For some fun contrast, consider painting your frames and baseboards a different color than your walls. Stark white is popular, but you can always try other options.
Use stencils. If you want to put a favorite phrase on your wall, or just fun patterns and designs, buy stencils. They're sold online and at most home décor stores.
Use stickers. If you don't like the permanency of painting with stencils, buy wall stickers. These are usually fun phrases or flourishes that you can put on your wall temporarily and peel off when you're over it.
Look into stick-on wallpaper. Stick-on wallpaper can be expensive, but it's a fun way to decorate one wall. Search online for fun patterns.

, Another quick and dramatic way to change the way your room looks is to alter the lighting. Try these things:


Find a new lamp. Consider changing up your desk lamp or the lighting on your bedside table.
Buy colored light bulbs for your lamps. While these might be a bit much for your main overhead light, they can be a fun way to change up your smaller light sources.
Use Christmas lights to punch up your room. If you have old Christmas lights sitting in your house, use them to liven up your room. Pin them up around the border of the ceiling using thumb tacks, or wrap them around your headboard.
Buy fairy lights. Fairy lights are strings of dainty, clear-colored lights that are often used at restaurants or special events. Get help festooning them across your ceiling from one side to the other, pinning up the middle of the strand.

, If your walls are bare, liven them up with some new wall-hangings. Here are some suggestions:


Purchase a fun print and have it framed. Or, look through thrift and consignment stores for retro prints.
Hang up a bulletin board. If you don't like the cork board look, try stretching fabric over it and stapling the edges of the fabric to the back of the board. Either way, pin fun pictures, magazine clippings you like, or other memorabilia on the board. You can also hang your jewelry on it.
Tape glow-in-the-dark stars to your ceiling or walls. They'll absorb the light that comes into your room during the day, and glow at night.
Make CD wallpaper. Basically, it's CD covers you hang on your wall. You can use it to show off photos, stamps, CDs, tickets, or anything else you can think of. Disco Ball's are also a unique way to liven up your bedroom.

, Change the way your bed looks by finding a different comforter and some new pillows for it. Shop online or at a store, or browse through a thrift store. If you're feeling industrious, you can even sew your own.

, Find lots of differently shaped mirrors. Circles, rectangles, or random shapes. Hang them up at different angles and levels around your room. This can make you room seem bigger, more fun and maybe like a mirror maze at the fair.

, You can use old wrapping paper, wallpaper, or specially-made drawer liners to give your desk or dresser drawers a fun touch.

, Swap out your old curtains for something new, or hang up little things that catch the light in your window or even stained glass your window. Make a reflective mobile out of some of those old CDs.

, Even if you already have carpet, a rug can add a unique touch to the room.

Get cool wall hangings.",How to Make Your Room Cool," The first step towards a cool room is a color scheme. Decide what your tastes are. Do you like bright colors or darker ones? Do you like solids or patterns? This will help you as you try to decorate the rest of the room.


For boys, black, blue, and brown are popular colors. Red, orange, yellow, and green can also make a cool room.For girls, shades of pink are always a great choice. Brightly colored patterns also liven up a girl's room.Lime, turquoise, and other bright colors make great accents for any room.;
, If you're gonna have the cool room that all your friends want to hang out in, you need the proper seating. If you don't, you won't have anywhere for your friends to sit. Seating options can range from a futon to a sofa to butterfly chairs.


Place a swing chair in the corner of the room. If you can, mount the swing chair in the ceiling.Set out ottomans or poufs. These seats are small so they don't take up much space, and they can be used as tables, chairs, or footstools. You can even make your own poufs and ottomans.Get a beanbag chair and place it in front of your television.
If your room is large enough, get a sofa or love seat. Place it along a far wall and make a separate sitting area in your room. Or place it in front of the television for watching movies and playing video games.

, Instead of having a boring nightstand that matches your bed, repurpose something you already own or that you find at a thrift store. All that a nightstand has to do is hold your alarm clock, cell phone, maybe a lamp, and a glass of water. Think outside the box to get a cool nightstand for your room.If you're into music, stack two drums on top of one another to make a nightstand. You can even paint and decorate them to make them even cooler.
If you're short on space, use a chair as a nightstand. When friends come over, you have a chair for them to sit on. When you're alone, the chair can hold your cell phone while you sleep.
If you own a lot of books or magazines, use those as a nightstand. Stack them against the wall so they are tall enough to be reached. This is a good way to get clutter out of the way and make a unique nightstand!
Make your nightstand double as storage space. If your bed is along the wall, try mounting a shelf and using it. Place a trunk beside your bed to use as a nightstand while using the inside for storage. Plus, a trunk just looks cool., Another way to make your room cool and reflect your personality is to get throw pillows. Throw pillows can be solid bold colors, geometric patterns, or have printed pictures on them. Match them to your hobbies and interests for some fun self-expression.


Try throw pillows with flowers, trees, feathers, or animals on them. You can also get them with sports team logos or sports-related art. Go for a pillow with the British flag on it, or go for one that is video game related.Sites like Society6 allow you to print custom art from artists on throw pillows. You can buy a pillow printed with a skeleton, mushroom, or guitar. You can also buy pillows with fanart of TV shows, movies, video games, and other pop culture references.

, Drawers are boring. To add a unique, funky twist to the drawers in your dresser or desk, paint the inside with bright colors. If you can, paint your dresser or desk a bright color that complements the color inside the drawer.


If you don't want to mess with paint, line them with patterned contact paper., Shelves don't have to be boring anymore. Many furniture stores and major retailers carry funky shelves in modern designs. You can set them on the floor, stack them, or mount them above your bed.Display all your cool stuff on these shelves. Put out books, records, CDs, action figures, photos with friends, knickknacks - anything you want.

, No cool room is complete without a TV to watch movies on. This will be the center of your room when your friends come over. You also want speakers so you can listen to music from the TV, laptop, or stereo. A gaming system (or several) is the finishing touch for your cool room.

, Your room is your space, so it should reflect what you like. If you like baseball, mount a bat, a glove, and a team hat. Put up posters, pennants, or flags from your favorite team. If you like surfing and the beach, put up mirrors lined with shells, make your name out of seashells, mount a surfboard, and stick decals of orchids around the room. It's up to your interests and what you think is cool.Decide if you like music, stars and the moon, or dogs. Maybe choose to decorate plainly and have a few pillows that say ""cool"" and ""awesome.""

, A great way to decorate your room is to add wall decals. Decals come in just about every style, shape, and image imaginable. You can get sports players who look like they're in the middle of a play. You can get bands, actors, and movie characters. You can also get bicycles, balloons, words, and animals.


These wall decals are removable, so it's easy to change them out without messing up your walls., If you have a lot of photos or postcards you want to display in your room, try hanging them from rows of string. This lets you place a lot of photos side by side without taping or pinning them to the wall. You can change out the photos for a bit of variety.


Use pushpins to place the string along the wall. Use binder clips to connect the photos to the string.
Place 2, 3, or even 10 strings around your room for photos. You can stack them on top of one another, or spread them around on different walls.To add even more pizzazz to the photos, hang twinkle lights along the strings to illuminate the photos., Japanese Washi tape is masking tape made out of washi paper that is used for crafts and décor. The tape is transparent, plus it is removable and reusable. It comes in different colors and styles, such as floral patterns, geometric shapes, graffiti, and bold colors. Since it's removable, you can change the tape if you get tired of it.Use Washi tape to put frames around your photos, posters, and artwork.Make shapes on your walls using Washi tape. Create a group of hexagons, hearts, stars, or diamonds.Use Washi tape to spell out words or letters. Put your initials on the wall, or put words like ""Dream"" or ""Live"" over your desk.

, If you can't paint the wall, or want to liven up blank walls with something fun, try hanging a rug, flag, or sheet on the wall. The great thing about hanging these is that you don't have to paint intricate designs on the wall, and you can change the design whenever you tire of it.You can also take a white sheet and paint it to make your very own tapestry., If you want to change a wall, but hanging cloth isn't your thing, try putting up removable wallpaper instead. Chasing Paper sells removable wallpaper that you can use to decorate your room.Choose a design that compliments your interests and the room's color palette. You have many options for designs: geometric, basic patterns, graphics, and even flora and fauna.
You can also buy headboard decals to stick on the wall behind your bed.Put the wallpaper on the ceiling for a cool way to tie the room together., Chalkboard wallpaper panels let you create your own art and to-do lists, in addition to letting you and your friends write messages on your wall. Cover a small section or an entire wall and buy some colored chalk for a cool addition to your room.You can also get chalkboard paint and chalkboard stickers.

, Use marker pens to draw shapes and colors on your light bulbs. When you turn on your lights, the shapes you drew will cast those same shapes on the walls and around the room.


If you don't want to draw with markers, try painting the light bulbs instead., Are you into music? Paris? Sports? Fishing? The beach? Whatever you are into, find cool wall hangings that go along with your interests. Find a metal sign that looks like a sign from a beach front surf shop. Buy a wooden sign that talks about fishing. Hang a metal sign with a picture of the Eiffel Tower.You can also make your own wall hangings. Get some cardboard, paint, foam paint brushes, and stencils, and have fun.

Look around your room.,

Start shifting the items into the separate piles.,
Plop yourself down on your bed and look around, what do you see so far?,
Rearrange the room as much as you can.,
Change the walls.,
Buy new items.,
Add new soft furnishings.,
Finish up by putting out all the objects, books and nick-knacks.,
Sit back and look at your brand new room after everything has already been placed, sorted, and categorized.",How to Make Over Your Bedroom as a Teenager," Determine what doesn't work at all for you anymore. This includes:


Walls––wallpaper, friezes, color. Each of these needs to be assessed for appropriateness.
Window dressings––are those teddy bear curtains still you?
Beds and bed coverings––do you still want a bunk bed, does the bed still fit and are those coverings with unicorns in racing cars truly you?
Decorations––check the posters, nick-knacks and stuff here and there. Is it still reflective of you?;
, Once you've determined what you do and don't like, try to clear out the objects that you no longer need or want. Grab some boxes, donation bags and a garbage bag. It's time to spring clean. Make piles as follows:


Keep/sentimental––you know for sure that the item is still wanted and/or needed.
School––okay, maybe you don't want to keep it but you have to keep it for educational purposes. Place it in this pile.
Not sure––this is the ""I need to think about it"" pile. It can be gone through later, after some reflection time.
No way––these are the things you've outgrown. These can be passed on to siblings, donated or, if they're in bad shape, tossed into the garbage.
Garbage or identifiable stuff growing in corners––straight to the garbage bin.

, Use the boxes and bags to help with the piles. Once sorted, you will find you've a lot of free space to experiment with. Whether you've a small or large space, this clean slate will help you to feel much more motivated.


Take out the donations and garbage immediately.
Put the ""decide later"" box in a spare room to give yourself a clean slate. You can go there later and work through the undecided items.

, A clean room, exactly. Clean, pristine, and ready to fulfill your dream. Every new room design has to start from somewhere so go ahead and think in your mind how would you like your new room to look.


Sketch out a simple design on paper. It doesn't need to be high quality. Basically, all you need is to know what you want in your room and where. You might want to shift the bed to a different corner, make a study nook or create a music space. Add these things into the design.

, Following your design, make the rearrangements that you can make using existing furniture. How does it look so far? Still need to do more? Keep going.

, Provided your parents/guardians have given the go ahead, repaint the walls or change them in some way. Ask for help from your friends––painting is messy but fun and satisfying and walls aren't too hard once you get the hang of it. However, be sure to cover everything really well because paint stains are near impossible to get off carpet and objects.

, Use this design plan that you created to decide whether or not there are big ticket items missing, such as paint for the walls or new bedroom furniture. You'll be able to show your parents or guardians this design when asking them to fork out the money for the changes, or to at least help you in some way. They may have furniture stored in the attic that you can repurpose, for example.


Don't forget the wonder of the thrift store. Even if your parents aren't keen to pitch in financially, you might find old pieces of furniture at a thrift store that you can give a second lease of life to. Or, see if other family members have pieces of furniture they no longer want.
Paint, decoupage, stenciling and other decorative effects can turn something ugly into something brand new, so have your creative spectacles on when assessing secondhand options.
Buy new additions over time, if that makes the change more affordable.
If your parents or guardians offer to buy new items for your room, make sure it's what you want in your room. After all, this is your personal realm where you are king or queen as soon as that door shuts.

, Change the curtains, bedding and cushions to really move your room forward. If you can't afford new items, sew your own––use YouTube or online tutorials to know how, or ask a parent, sibling or friend to show you what to do. Sewing's a useful skill for every person to have.

, Place everything where you want it, but remember, treat your room with respect. You'll appreciate it even more when everything has a place. But it is entirely up to you to figure out that place.

, Wasn't it worth the hard work? You now have achieved your dream room, congratulations!

Paint the walls pink.,
Get a few pieces of girly furniture.,
Decorate with girly accessories.",How to Make Your Bedroom Look Girly1," Pink comes in a variety of shades — from hot pink to bubblegum pink — so choose a shade that reflects your personality. If you can’t decide between bright pink or muted pink, you can always mix and match.;
, Certain pieces of furniture are must-haves for any girly girl’s bedroom. For a classic girly look, white furniture works best; it’s versatile and it complements all shades of pink. Furniture in a natural wood finish will also do. Examples of classic girly furniture include:


A vanity table with mirror and chair.
A cute dresser. Your dresser can have ornate detailing or simple, clean lines — whichever you prefer.
A chaise lounge, if you have the space.

, Select white or pink accessories that coordinate with a classic girly theme. Classic girly accessories include:


Frilly or ruffled bedding. A pink bedspread is an important design element for a classic girly look. A matching ruffled or frilly bed skirt and pillow shams will further accentuate a classic girly theme.
Throw pillows. Nothing says girly like a lot of throw pillows. Silky, cushy throw pillows in assorted shades of pink are particularly girly.
Rugs. Choose one large rug in a shade that goes well with your bedding. If you prefer, choose two matching rugs — one can be placed at the end of your bed, while the other can be placed under the chair of your vanity or near your bedroom door.
Wall hangings. Hang photos of you and your family or friends in feminine frames. Other types of wall hangings that would look great in a classic girly bedroom include sculptural pieces or posters with flower motifs.
Lamps. Table lamps with ruffled shades in pink hues add girly detail.
Curtains. Soft, pretty curtains in sheer material adds a classic girly touch.

Stuffed animals. Arrange them on your bed or place them on your vanity.

Don't look like you're trying too hard.",How to Make Your Bedroom Classy Chic," The basics include your bed and nightstand, your desk and closet. Make sure they look good. They don't even have to look incredibly expensive, but just make sure they look decent and clean. Also make sure the color of the basics and the style sort of match.;
, It's best to have 2 or 3 colors in your bedroom. It is advisable to look to the furniture. If all your 'basics' are white and you have a wood floor or neutral carpet, you're lucky. You can put any colors with it.


If, for instance, your carpet is dark blue, start from there. Add whites and black and keep it in those colors. If your walls are for instance yellow(like mine ones were) add white/black or other pastel colors. That way, you make sure your bedroom looks more chic and mature if the colors match and if you use the least amount of color.

, No clutter, don't stuff it with furniture. In this case less really is more. The less you have in your room, the better. So don't be afraid to throw away stuff you don't need or doesn't look good anymore or just looks messy. And if you have doubts about putting in an extra decoration, you probably shouldn't.

, Try to keep out the little clutter-y knickknack decoration thingies. Those look childish, messy and just makes it look like you're trying too hard.


For example, instead of having a lot of posters or postcards on your walls, put up one or two big black-and-white pictures in a frame. Or try to hang a couple of matching photo- frames in one area instead.

, Make sure everything has its place. For example, if you used to have your shoes laying around in your bedroom or just standing in a line on the floor, buy a shoe rack and they will get much more positive attention.


Same goes for makeup and hair-products. It's so much better to put them in a drawer than to have them standing on that dresser while you could have just put your prettiest perfumes on a platter with a pretty vase and flowers on there. Try to keep a lot of stuff in your drawers to make it look as if it's a hotel room.

, They don't have to be expensive. But just look for the stuff that looks the most expensive. Examples of expensive looking things in your bedroom are silk bedding, mirrored surfaces, crystal lamps, white flowers, big statement pieces like a big bedside lamp, etc. You can find these type of things at stores like Ikea and others for low prices.

, Except if it's a decoration like a floor lamp or a tower of boxes. Keep your shoes in a shoe rack or in your closet, keep piles of schoolbooks in your dressers etc.

, For instance, if you have a trashcan with an open top, keep it behind the door instead of at the wall you see when you walk in. Put all the beauty products in drawers. Make sure you show people the prettiest things you own only.

, It's one of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to get a chic bedroom. Don't make your bed too neatly. Don't try to over decorate your room with cheap-looking things like Christmas-lights, or put a lot of decorations on your bedside-table.


Remember that less is more. Don't make your bed too neat, if you are going for the effortless chic look. Statement pieces are gold.

This is just what it sounds like a collection of images patched together in whatever design you choose. These can be personal photos, pictures cut from magazines, or even original pieces of artwork you've created. There's no limit to the size of your collage besides the edges of your wall, so get creative!


For the purposes of this article, let's follow along with a few running examples. Let's say that three young adults, David, Kim, and Luis, are trying to turn their boring bedrooms into awesome Tumblr rooms. By following along as these people add Tumblr style to their rooms, we can get a sense for the sort of decisions you can make when you're fixing up your own room.
Let's start with David. David has a habit of documenting every event in his and his friends' lives with the camera on his phone. Since David's going to leave for college in a year, he might choose to have his vast collection of photos developed at the local pharmacy so that he can make a collage dedicated to his time growing up. When he gets his photos back, David has enough to cover one entire wall, so he does, creating a sort of ""wall of memories"".;
, Your bed is the centerpiece of your Tumblr room, so make sure it's presentable. Your sheets don't necessarily have to be very expensive no one on the internet will be able to tell what your thread count is just from looking on your pictures, but they should be clean, stain-free, and match well with the other decorations in your room. If you're not sure what color of sheets will fit your room, try to match the color of your sheets to your wall, trim, or other furniture in the room.Neutral colors like white almost always work well.


Let's switch our focus to Kim. Kim's current bed is a little ratty-looking she's still using an old, worn-out duvet cover that leaks feathers from her comforter and one of her sheets has an embarrassing cranberry juice stain that she hasn't been able to get out. To cheaply spruce up her bed, she might want to get a new duvet cover (usually much cheaper than an entire comforter) with a checkerboard pattern that matches her bedside table, plus a basic set of versatile white sheets.

, Another common trend in Tumblr rooms is the use of hung or draped decorations. Tumblr users often string up flags, blankets, beads, old clothes, quilts, and so on as improvised drapes, bed curtains, or room dividers. These sorts of hanging decorations give your room added flair, plus an extra degree of privacy.


Let's meet Luis. Luis is an exchange student from Peru with lots of pride for their native country. A logical choice for Luis might be to drape an old Peruvian flag over their doorway as a curtain. As long as they're not concerned about disrespecting their flag, this is a great way to advertise their love for their home on Tumblr.

, Tumblr rooms often use unconventional lighting to great effect. It's not rare to see rooms that use Christmas lights, LED strips, or other decorative hanging lights to give their room a unique cozy glow. Even ordinary lamps can be made interesting by using a decorative lampshade or screen you can make these yourself or pick them up at thrift stores for cheap.


Kim's family hasn't taken down its Christmas lights yet, so she'll borrow a string of these and run it above the headboard of her bed in addition to looking cool, she'll also be able to use the light from these to read in bed at night. She might also plant her aunt's old lava lamp on her bedside table for some old-school cool.

, The furniture in Tumblr rooms doesn't have to look like it came from an IKEA catalog in fact, if you're looking to make a unique impression, old oddball pieces of furniture can be a big plus. Old furniture can be used to give your room an air of classy sophistication, a bit of retro charm, or even an ironic twist (especially if you pair it with decidedly plain or modern elements). Best of all, used furniture is often much cheaper (though high-quality antiques can be very expensive).


David doesn't have a big budget to buy furniture for his Tumblr room, so he takes $20 to the second-hand store and picks out a ridiculous-looking old chair: one from the 1970s with garish orange fringe running along the bottom. He decides to place it at his modern office desk to use as his computer chair not because it matches, but because it clashes so awfully that it makes an unforgettable impression.

, It's not all about what you have in your room it's also about how you use what you've got. Try to position your furniture and decorations so that they're visible from the angles you're going to be taking pictures and that they make a striking impression. In addition, for your own sake, you'll want to make sure the arrangement you choose is one that's possible for you to navigate easily (it doesn't matter how good your room looks if you're tripping over your decorations).


If you're unsure of how to proceed, you may want to consider researching basic interior design theories. For instance, Feng Shui is a Chinese design system that involves carefully placing furniture in a room for a pleasing ""balanced"" effect., If you have the time, money, and willpower, giving your Tumblr room a new set of walls can completely transform the way it looks. These are major projects, however, which means that they'll require not just the know-how to do them but also the permission of your parents or the property owner. If you hate your current walls but you can't change them, don't worry you can simply cover them up with decorations.


Luis wants a creative solution to give their room's plain white walls a little personality. After much deliberation, they decide to divide one of their walls into thirds by painting a thick red vertical stripe on each side. When they're done, their wall looks like a giant Peruvian flag.

, Though there are trends that many Tumblr rooms share in common, there is no single ""right"" way to make a Tumblr room. Since every room on Tumblr is slightly different, one of the best way to get ideas is to look for ideas is simply to get on Tumblr and start looking at pictures! Don't be afraid to get style ideas from other users all great artists have their own sources of inspiration. Below is a Tumblr you may want to start with:


http://tumblr-rooms.tumblr.com/

, One decoration trend that's taken off on Tumblr is posting quotes to a bedroom's wall. These quotes are often sentimental or inspirational, but it's not impossible to find funny or bizarre wall quotes on Tumblr. To make your room reflect your own personality, choose a quote that's meaningful or profound to you.


David has always loved a Vince Lombardi quote his old football coach once told him: ""Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.""However, with his wall-size collage, there's not any room to post this quote on his wall. David gets creative by cutting the letters of each word out of his collage he makes a breathtaking design with the wall's negative space.

, As people age, grow, and have adventures, they naturally accumulate knick-knacks, mementos, and other small but meaningful tokens of the things they've done. If you're taking a picture of your room for Tumblr, prominently displaying a few of these sorts of items can give your room a unique ""lived-in"" look. Plus, on a simpler level, this is a great way to show off all of your cool stuff!


Be cautious about personally-identifying information. Don't display anything that contains your real name, address, phone number, or financial info unless you're comfortable with this information being available to strangers on Tumblr.
For example, Luis might want to set an old, handwritten leather-bound recipe book that their grandmother gave to them on their desk to show their love for Peruvian cuisine. However, they probably wouldn't want to show its cover, which is labeled ""To Luis Quispe. Love, Abuela Flores."" Since having their real name in the picture might expose their identity to random internet users, Luis decides to open the book to a lomo saltado recipe for their picture instead.

, Posters proudly and directly display your interests for all to see. Including posters in your Tumblr photos is a great way to show what sorts of things you enjoy without advertising your identity or having to carefully arrange personal mementos around your room. On top of this, because they're usually fairly large, posters can be be used to cover barren wall space that might otherwise look boring.


Kim loves almost all classic rock music, so she has no shortage of posters to put up. After a day of shopping online, she gets a few deals on vintage posters, and soon, her walls are adorned with images of the Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin, and Chuck Berry rocking out.

, Books, albums, movies, and other types of media can show off your good taste if you include them in your pictures. Try conspicuously leaving a few of your favorite vinyl albums on your bed or taking a close-up of the books in your bookcase to show the world what you're into!


With her love for rock and roll, Kim has plenty of albums in her room, so she scatters them into her photos at random to show off her music knowledge. She even takes it one step further, pinning her favorite album art to her walls.

, Having your fashion on display can be a way to leave clues about your personality or simply just a way of showing off some neat threads you've picked up people often use their fashion to change the way others think of them or express the way they feel, but sometimes it's just about looking good. Make sure any clothes you leave out are clean and wrinkle-free.


David prides himself on his fashion sense, so he leaves a vintage disco shirt draped over his door in a few of his shots. He also leaves his closet door open whenever he can what better way to show that he's got an entire wardrobe of awesome swag?

, If you're taking Tumblr pictures with a webcam or a camera embedded in your computer, positioning is key. You don't have the freedom to move and shoot pictures as you please with these sorts of cameras, so you'll want all of your interesting furniture and decorations positioned behind your computer desk. Cameras in laptops offer a little more freedom, but you'll still need to stick the angles that are possible to shoot through the embedded camera's lens.


Working with these sorts of constrained cameras can make it tricky to get your whole room in the shot. This can actually work to your advantage if you're willing to put in a little extra work cycling interesting furniture and decorations into the frame can allow you to make interesting combinations.

, If your room has windows that face the sun, try opening them during the day to give your room some natural light. Bright daytime shots can turn a dark dingy bedroom into a clean, open-looking space. However, sunlight can also illuminate unflattering details that aren't visible when your room is dark, so make sure your room is clean and tidy before snapping your shot.


Be careful when shooting directly into the light from the window if the sun is bright, this can make it difficult for your camera to pick up detail in the rest of the frame. A sideways or diagonal may be a better choice in this case. Try to position close-up shots so that the focal object is against a shaded backdrop, rather than a bright light., Make full use of your lamps and decorative lights at night. Try to light your room just brightly enough that your camera picks up a reasonable amount of detail. You won't want your room so well-let that you lose the smokey, shadowy quality of a dimly lit room, but you also don't want your room so dark that the contrast between shadow and light isn't clear. This may require a little experimenting to get just-right.


Don't use a flash when shooting your room at night often, this can create intense, uneven lighting patterns and harsh glare on shiny objects. Unfortunately, without a flash, the camera's shutter has to stay open for longer to get an image, which can lead to blurry pictures. If you can't get clear shots without a flash, try lighting the room more brightly or using a tripod so that your camera is held perfectly still., Bedrooms can sometimes be cramped, claustrophobic spaces. If this describes your room, try using volume-increasing visual tricks to make your room look as big as possible. With the right color choices and positioning, you can make your tiny room much, much bigger. Below are just a few types of things you may want to try:Use light colors whites, pastels, and other neutral colors create the impression of wide, open spaces.
Avoid leaving lots of items on shelves and tables this can create a cluttered look.
Add mirrors, which reflect both light and color to make the room look much bigger.
Space your furniture out to create open floor spaces.

, For the best photos, you won't want to use a webcam, a computer-embedded camera, or a phone camera. Instead, you'll want to use a high-quality digital camera. It's hard to beat the clarity and detail of a great camera, but keep in mind that this added level of detail will capture everything even crumbs, stains, and other ugly blemishes, so you'll need to keep your room clean accordingly.


With digital cameras, you’ll usually want to keep your ISO setting below 800 when shooting indoors. It's usually possible to adjust this setting manually consult your camera's instruction for more information."

Clean your room.,

Add some artwork.,

Get some new furniture.,
Play a little music.",How to Make a Room Gothic," Gothic and messy do not mix. It is absolutely essential that you remove all clutter, unnecessary objects and completely clean up the room. A good way to start is to create some piles: a ""keep"" pile, ""throw away"" pile and a ""maybe"" pile. Arrange everything into those three piles and go from there. Remember to clean the room very thoroughly- dusting, washing, vacuuming, polishing...whatever needs to be done.;
, There is not only one style for a Gothic room, which gives you a little diversity and freedom of choice while decorating. Before you jump into things, have a good think about what style, effect and message you're going for. Remember that the room still needs to be comfortable and you need to create an environment that you feel happy and safe in, while also being appealing and attractive to others. You may want to create a fantasy room, complete with silver walls and stars, or a darker room, with black walls and haunted pictures. There are many other styles you can go for, but feel free to create your own.

, One of the easiest ways to pull off one of the biggest effects is to paint the walls. Don't fall into the stereotyped trap and immediately buy fifty cans of black paint. Take some time to decide what kind of color you would like. You could also create a mural, and make a feature wall. Some suggestions for colors would be silver, deep purple, black, or maybe even a royal red or blue.

, Ornaments are essential for a Gothic room, as they beautify it and add whatever the desired effect. Some ornaments are designed to suit the Gothic style, while others simply slide in accidentally. Browse the shops and online for things that catch your eye. Some suggestions would be:



Candles. Candles will always give you a great effect, because they come in so many different styles. Silver, black or red candles are all good. Cream colored or yellow/gold candles can also set off a very romantic look. Scented candles are also extremely effective.

Candle holders. Majestic, silver candle holders will add a great decoration to any style of gothic room, with or without candles.

Plants. Don't think of the immediate plant: green and leafy, filling the pot. Try other plants, or even fake ones, in pretty silver, white, or dark pots. Plants with white or red flowers are good for a romantic goth look. You can also try the fake plants, which are much easier to look after, and are designed in a variety of styles.You could also cut off rose petals on a rose ala Morticia Addams !

Cushions. Black silk, silver embroidery, crystal white... cushions create a relaxed, comfy and beautiful environment. Gothic cushions are not difficult to find, either.

, Beautiful paintings or other mysterious works of art will always have a big impact on a room. If you're an artist, get creative and make your own things. If not, shop around and see what you can find. Masks, mosaics and paintings are all very good.

, Ditch the plain bedsheets for something more dark or romantic. Black silk is perfect, as is velvet, plain white, silver, and if you're looking for more color, purples, reds and blues. Have a good browse and find something that works for you. Remember to get something comfortable and easy to look after, and try to match it with the colour theme. You can also get some bed hangings- white lace is perfect.

, Look around for colours that suit your room. Try getting something unique and interesting, something that will catch people's eye. Remember to make sure you buy one that isn't high maintenance and won't wear out over the years.

, If you want, you can simply paint your old furniture, or even leave it as it is. But if you can afford to, why not get some new things? Dark marble and other stones, as well as wood, are good materials for Gothic furniture. White, black, silver, or dark, deep woody browns are good colors.

, Set up a CD player or stereo and mystify or rock people's minds with your choice of music. Keep your CDs on display so people can see what kind of stuff you like.

Take the girl's tastes into consideration.,
While shopping for furniture, remember that there are three necessities when it comes to a teenager's room.,
Flesh out the room's style.,
Follow through on your chosen color scheme and add a few matching, decorative touches to the room.,
Add your finishing touches.",How to Make a Very Modern Room for a Teen Girl Inexpensively," Though you may assume all teenage girls appreciate similar things, you could be drastically wrong. Ask her what favorite colors, bands, celebrities, hobbies, patterns, and room styles are. Get as much information about the girl as possible before beginning. Though not all of it may seem useful, any shred of information can help.;
, One, a comfortable bed. Two, a desk and chair to do homework and keep up on hobbies. Three, storage. Think wall-shelves, bookshelves, bins, and dressers with plenty of drawers. Teens are known for their messy habits, and if you have not given them a place to put their things...well, don't expect the room to remain clean. Beyond that, good lighting (especially around the desk) and other sitting (who doesn't love beanbags?) for friends are nice to have. Like a lounge area almost.

, A bedspread is a good place to start with the room's color scheme. Make sure it doesn't clash with the wall/carpet color, it's comfortable, and the girl will like the colors. Obviously, stay away from any colors or patterns she particularly dislikes.

, Bright drapes/curtains, rugs, desk accessories, and new lampshades are easy ways to add color. One great idea that many ""hip"" teens do is to put up white holiday lights in their room. It works best if the strands are white and that the lights have a swag to make it look better. Another great idea is to write her favorite song or poem in another language such as Japanese or Chinese and hang it above her desk. Don't forget, this is a teen, so keep it funky! How about some lava lamps or funky wall art?

, This is where the girl's interests can come into play. A few choice posters and photographs on the wall really add character to the room, and will make your teen feel right at home. Get her 2 or 3 posters (that she can hang up herself in case she wants them in a special place) of her favorite band, celebrity, movie, or anything else she may have mentioned to you!

Write down your plan.,
Tell someone.,
Make up a reward system.",How to Change Your Whole Personality1," This is a two-fold action: what you're looking to change and what you're looking to become. You can't have one without the other. This is a huge endeavor to accomplish; you'll need to know the battle you're picking before you begin.


How will your projected new character contribute towards your development as a person? Many people will at this stage come to the conclusion that a personality change is not needed, but rather one small habit that has a negative effect on your interactions with others. Would just a tweak do the trick?
If there is someone you wish you were more like, distinguish what is it you want to emulate. Don't just look at a person and say ""Yes, I want to be like that."" Find out exactly what it is that you admire -- is it how they handle situations? Their manner of speaking? How they walk or, move? More importantly, how does this contribute to their well being?;
, Part of the reason Alcoholics Anonymous is said to be successful is because you take something you wouldn't usually talk about, and you put it out in the open. Having someone else hold you accountable provides you with an extrinsic motivation you wouldn't otherwise have.


Talk to a friend about what you're looking to accomplish. If they're a trusted confidante, they'll be able to prod you in the right direction (either by telling you that you're being ridiculous or by keeping you on track). The extra brain power and set of eyes a little bit farther away from the painting, if you will, can help you see how you should behave and what impression you're giving off.

, This can be absolutely anything. Anything. It could be as small as moving marbles from one pocket to the other or as large as a vacation. Whatever it is, make it worth it to you.


And set up checkpoints while you're at it. If you walk up to that beautiful girl or handsome guy and get one word out, fantastic. That's something. If, the next week you walk up to her and get out a whole anecdote, great! Have rewards for everything; it's all a challenge.

Stop labeling yourself.,
Quit thinking in ""fixed"" terms.,
Stomp out negative thoughts.",How to Change Your Whole Personality2," When you think of yourself as shy and reserved, you'll use it as a crutch. Why aren't you going to that party on Friday? ...Exactly. You've no reason. When you stop thinking of yourself as one way or the other, the world opens up to you.


You are constantly morphing. If you think of yourself as a band geek, you may find yourself embracing those characteristics. But if you realize that you're always growing and changing, you may open up to opportunities that inspire that growth, opportunities you would otherwise shy away from.

, Along the same lines as labels, stop thinking in black and white. Boys are not scary, authority is not evil, and textbooks do have their uses. Once you realize that it's your perception of a thing that determines what it is to you, you'll see more possibilities and, therefore, more options for behavior.


Some people view certain traits as ""fixed,"" and that significantly impacts how they behave. The opposite of this would be a ""growth"" mindset, where the viewer thinks traits are malleable and morph constantly. These mindsets develop early in childhood and can greatly factor into personality. If you think things are ""fixed,"" you don't believe you can change them. How do you see the world? It can determine how you see yourself in relationships, how you solve conflicts, and how and how quickly you bounce back from setbacks., Just stop. The beauty of your brain is that it is part of you, and you, therefore, control it. If you find yourself thinking, ""Oh my God, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't,"" you probably won't be able to. When the voice starts going, put a sock in it. It's not doing you any good.


When the voice acts up, make it sound like Donald Duck. It's a lot harder to take seriously.

This is 24/7. You must adopt the habits of this new character in every situation. How do they sit? What's the resting position of their face? What are their concerns? How do they kill time? Who do they associate with?

, Alright, so telling you to completely abandon who you are and adopt a new persona by the simple power of thought and habit is ridiculous. There's no way you can keep it up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Therefore, give yourself a scheduled time to feel how you want.


If you have a party on Friday that you are absolutely dreading, tell yourself on Friday night or Saturday morning you can take 20 minutes just to freak out completely about it. 20 minutes of absolutely illogical, non-productivity. But beyond that, nothing. Stick to it. You know what'll happen? You'll find that you don't need to take the time after all.

Throw yourself into new environments.,
Keep a journal.,
Say ""yes.""",How to Change Your Whole Personality4," Truly, the only way you'll see change in yourself is if you add something new into your life. To do this, you'll need to pick up new behaviors, new people, and new activities. You can't do the same things over and over and expect different results.


Start out small. Join a club. Get a job outside your skill set. Start reading up on the subject. What's more, keep yourself out of old environments. You don't want to hang out with people who do the opposite of whatever it is you're trying to achieve.
Condition yourself. If you're afraid of spiders, put yourself in a room with one. Day by day, inch closer to it. Eventually, you'll be sitting next to it. Even later, you'll be holding it. Constant exposure dulls the brain from feeling fear. Now take ""spiders"" and replace it with whatever your goal may be.

, You'll need some pretty intense self-awareness to stay on track. Keeping a journal will help you sort your thoughts and analyze how you've been handling this change. Write down what's been working and what hasn't to fine-tune your method.

, If throwing yourself into new environments is hard, think of it this way: stop turning opportunities down. If you see a sign that the old you would deem uninteresting, give it a second look. If a friend asks you to do something you know absolutely zero about, agree. You'll be all the more better for it.


That being said, make safe decisions. If someone asks you to go jump off a cliff, don't do it. Use your brain.

Don the clothes.,
Pick up the habits.,
Settle in.,
Reflect on your new personality.",How to Change Your Whole Personality5," Alright, so clothes don't make the man, but they can help put you in the right mindset. Though this by no means changes your personality, it may help serve as a reminder to you of the person you are trying to become.


This can be as small as wearing a hat. If there is something that, to you, is indicative of this new person, keep it on your radar. You'll be more likely to stay in tune with yourself to reduce cognitive dissonance.

, The clothes and thought patterns may not be enough. Think about what this new person would do and do it. Would they seek out social interaction? Shun social media? Read The Economist? Whatever it is, do it.


You don't have to stay big -- the small things work too. Would she carry around a pink purse? Would he listen to a specific band? Get into character as much as possible.

, Now that you're picking up these new habits and probably these new friends and routines, you may feel a little jostled. What's important now is to embrace yourself, whatever and wherever you are. Sink your nails in and decide that you're staying.


Uprooting yourself psychologically is risky. If you've succeeded, you may need time to feel like you're truly ""you."" Relax. This feeling will come as long as you keep this desire close to your well-being.

, Did you really achieve what you wanted to achieve? Do other people think more positively about you now that you act and wear different? Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for a fake imitation of the ideal person?

Some people will decide that what they need is not a personality change, but an acceptance of who they are and a willingness to try to improve themselves instead of a full personality makeover but its up to you to make that personal choice. Make sure you are doing this for all the right reasons.

Go through your stuff.,
Choose your color themes.,
Make a list of stuff you need to get and do.,
Go online shopping.,
Makeover your room!,
When your room is completely made over, be sure all your clothes are either folded or hung up nicely.,
Keep your room clean!",How to Have a Room Like Blair Fowler (Juicystar07) from Youtube," This is a very important first step, because you may find things you never knew you had. You can also get rid of clutter and old junk, which will help your room to stay neat and tidy like Blair's!;
, Choose two colors - one a little more neutral, and one bright one. Blair's color theme is hot pink and rainbow, which are both bright. If you enjoy a lot of bright color, go for it. If you prefer to be more subtle, go with the recommendation; one light/neutral color, and one bright one. Such as a light blue and hot pink or baby pink and neon green... the possibilities are endless. Also be sure you have your furniture color theme picked out. Blair's furniture is all antique-looking wood, but you can pick anything, from white, to chrome... etc.

, Will you need to repaint anything? This could include furniture, walls, lamps, etc. Do you need more lighting? Put that down on your list. Do you need a place to store jewelry, makeup, books, school stuff and the likes? Or perhaps just a new bedspread? Good places to go for bedroom furniture and accessories are Pier 1 Imports, Target, occasionally Walmart and IKEA. Also whatever local stores you have.

, Find out the general price range of the stuff you will need to get and make a list. Be sure to stick to your budget. Try to get the total amount by rounding a bit. If you find specific things you want, make a note of what store you found them in next to the item it is on your list.

, Try to get an adult or a mature friend (immature friend + paint = you trying to get rid of them) to help you, unless of course you won't need much help.

, Your jewelry and makeup should be organized. Make your bed!! This can get annoying, but have Blair's room tour video (linked below) playing to inspire you.

, Every time you take something out, put it away as soon as you're done! Pretend that a big news company is coming to show your room the world any random day, and that you need to keep it tidy for when they finally come.

Think what type of hippie room you want.,
Search up hippie rooms.,
Buy or make the items.,
Design!,
Plan the colour theme.,
Put everything in place.",How to Make a Hippie Bedroom," Do you want a light room with open curtains and lots of lamps? Or a dark mysterious room, with black lights and strobe lights?
, Search pictures of hippie rooms to get a picture planted in your mind, or do your own thing completely., Hippies tend to save money and buy cheap or make their stuff. You can buy mandala wall tapestries off eBay from as little as £6 pounds ($7.90) and strobe lights basically anywhere. Hippies had lots of posters of bands like The Beatles, Sum 41, Nirvana, John Lennon, and many other bands and people. They had lots of dream catchers too, because that's what they believed., Plan where you want your items to go. Lots of people tend to actually have mandalas on every wall and the ceiling, but if you want that light airy room then have one or two, so they don't clog up the room too much. Do you want black lights? Strobe lights? Mandalas? Dream catchers? Posters? Pin boards? Stickers? Concert tickets? Put anything up that you think may compliment the room., Although most hippie style rooms don't have a colour theme, it will look good on your walls if you plan to have mandalas. So if you're getting a colour theme, get one solid colour. For airy rooms get a cream, white, grey, green or blue, and for darker rooms get navy, grey, deep red or dark purple. Never get black as the room will start to feel closed up., Put your mandalas up, stick that pinboard you've had in the loft next to the door. Adorn your ceiling with dream catchers. Whatever you want to completely fulfill your hippie bedroom."

Paint your room or wallpaper it or use both if you want to and you are able.,
Make your bedroom comfortable.,
Get some seating.,
Have a place to study.,
Don't forget the lights.,
Have some storage space.,
Make it personal.,
Keep your room clean and tidy.",How to Have a Perfect Bedroom (Teen Girls)," Paint and wallpaper can really help you achieve your perfect room, however, it isn't necessary. If you're allowed to paint your room, choose a colour that you like and that reflects you. If you aren't allowed to paint/wallpaper your room, hang some fabric on the walls, or just put up some posters and pictures that you like. You could also buy removable wall stickers to help give your walls some interest. These stickers are easily removable, and you can switch them around as much as you'd like.


Don't think you want to stick with a color for long? Instead of painting the walls a bold color, paint them white. What you can do is buy some blinds and put transparent curtains (of your favorite color) over them so when the sun seeps through, the color reflects on the walls.
Alternatively, use posters not paint. Right now you might want to get a soccer ball painted up on your wall. But what if you don't want it there later? What can you do? To avoid permanent change, put posters up instead. That way you can change it up all the time.;
, Your room is where you can be alone and have personal time. You want to be comfortable in your room, so buy some blankets, rugs, curtains, and pillows that are your favorite colors. You could also experiment and have a colorful room. It's all your decision! If you want to save some money, you could make your own throw pillows and curtains. Make sure you get your parents' permission, fluffy cushions work well for a cozy feel.

, When your friends come over, you don't want to have them sit on the floor! Buy a chair or two for you and your friends to sit in. Consider buying a beanbag chair. They're comfy and they look good in bedrooms. If you can't buy one, ask someone to sew you one. You could also buy a moon chair. They're also very comfy and give your room a modern look. Another good option is an ottoman, especially if it doubles as a storage space!

, You're a teen, so the homework load is starting to increase, and you have exams to study for. Rather than studying in your kitchen, have a study space in your bedroom. Get a desk and a chair for you to sit in and do your homework.

, Have some good lighting in your room. Have a desk lamp so that you have good light when you're studying, but have some other cool lights too. You can buy lanterns, fairy lights, or lamps in different shapes, sizes, and colors to really make a statement in your room.

, You totally need storage in your room! Have some big funky containers in your room or display your stuff on shelves. Either way is awesome. Also, you'll need a closet to keep your clothes. Don't have a messy closet. Keep it organized and clean. Make sure you have special places for your shoes, hats, purses, and clothes. Don't mix them up. Put your sweaters in drawers so they don't get wrecked , corner cupboards work well in small rooms.


Don't overdo it. Make sure you don't junk up your room with a ton of stuff. Put one or two ten-cubbie shelves against the wall and put stuff in bins. That also works with clothes if you can't find a cheap new dresser.

, By now, your room looks great, but it probably looks more like a bedroom in a furniture showroom than your very own room. The simple answer to this problem is to personalize it! Buy a bulletin board to keep concert tickets, awards, special papers, pictures, and certificates on. Buy some picture frames and have pictures of you, your friends, your family, your boyfriend, etc. on your desk and walls. Put stuff in your bedroom that defines you and your personality! This will make your room more personal.


Make sure you can always see a picture of your family. It's just nice to have.
Don't be too exotic. Make sure you pick out bedding that doesn't have the whole rainbow and unicorns on it. Stick to three colors. Blues and greens are good. So are light pinks, yellows, and dull reds. You don't want to get something you'll be bored with in a couple months.

, This is very important. Do you want your friends to come over and think you're a slob? Not to mention you'll lose half your stuff! Use a hamper for clothes, cups and bins for school supplies, and shelves with cube bins for miscellaneous things.

Admire your handiwork.",How to Have a Cute Teenage Bedroom," Many parents or guardians don't mind if you just rearrange the furniture in your room, but anything more than that and they'd most likely raise an eyebrow (or get angry). Ask them for permission to redecorate your room before you get started on it; tell them what you want to do with your room and ask them if that would be something that could be done. Asking your parents about making a change can be a big help when it comes to getting new room décor!


If your parents say no, ask them why, rather than getting upset or angry. There are many reasons they might not want you to change your room, from money to concerns about what you want to do. This can make it easier to figure out how to compromise with them.
Oftentimes, it's easier to convince your parents to allow things like small and easily portable furniture, rather than large furniture or repainting the room. Small, portable furniture doesn't require a lot of effort on behalf of your parents to get into the room and set up, and is usually less expensive.;
, A large amount of your room's style will be based off of your version of ""cute"" - so think about it. What do you think is cute? Remember, it's your room, not anybody else's, and you're free to decorate it the way you want to. Considering your interests and your definition of ""cute"" is important to show off your own style.


While you're welcome to think that anything is cute, ""dark"" themes (such as the color black or maroon, ""scene"" or ""emo"" styles, typically dark symbols such as a skull and crossbones, etc.) are usually not considered cute. Cuteness is typically associated with innocence and cheerfulness, not a cynical or jaded outlook on life.
Things like lighter shades of colors (such as blue, pink, yellow, or purple) or pastel colors, stuffed animals, fluffy things (like fluffy pillows, rugs, blankets, etc.), fake flowers, and anything that's often considered a toned-down version of ""girly girl"" themes are often considered cute.

, There are many themes out there that you could base your room off of, from themes about things you're interested in, to cultural themes, to themes of characters or certain media. Decorating your room around that theme could give you a good starting point.


Don't go overboard - it's one thing to have a few of your sports trophies up on a shelf and posters on the walls, but it's another to have your room be completely dominated by sports to the point where there's no variation at all. Mix it up a bit.

, There are many people who have ideas for ways that you could change up your bedroom. Some people are inspired by social media to create certain styles of rooms (such as ""Tumblr rooms""), while others are inspired to arrange their room a certain way or to make a certain craft for it. Running a Google search for ""room decoration ideas"" could be a great way of finding inspiration.

, Once you've decided what kind of look you want your room to have, create a drawing of your room and how you want it to be set up. Doing this will allow you to visualize your room's future appearance more easily and know where you want things to go.

, Chances are, you're planning to buy new things in order to redecorate your room. However, not everyone has the money to buy absolutely everything they want, and you may fall into that category. It's best to set up a maximum amount of money you'll spend on redecorating your room, and designate amounts that you're willing to spend on every aspect of decorating. It might be disappointing to not have a lot of money to spend, but it's better than spending what you don't have.


Budget your time, too - unless you're on a school vacation, you're most likely not going to be able to devote all of your waking hours to decorating your room (and neither can your parents or guardians). In addition, if you plan on decorating walls, keep in mind that it can take several hours for paint or wallpaper paste to dry, and even longer to get the smell of paint out of the room. Redecorating a room isn't a task that can often be completed in under an hour.

, If you're just the kind of person who prefers to make things rather than buy things, consider trying out do-it-yourself projects. There are guides everywhere online, even here on wikiHow, to make crafty projects that can make your room a lot cuter. DIY projects can also show anyone who enters your room that you're a fan of crafting things on your own, rather than buying them.


DIYs can be expensive, depending on the materials you need, and are often time-consuming. In some cases, it may be better to buy something pre-made than to make it yourself, since some projects can become pricey and take a lot of time to complete.

, If you can't decorate your room in a certain way, don't panic - there are ways to make your room look better, even if it's not in the way you originally planned. It's possible to find alternatives to what you were originally planning to do. In fact, you may even end up liking the new idea better than what you wanted to do before that! Get creative and see what you can come up with - you can look online for ideas or work with friends or family to figure out some new ways to brighten up your room.


If you can't paint your walls a different color, change the bedspread to match it so it won't look so bad. You could also consider placing decorations that cover a fair amount of the wall, such as a bulletin board or posters.
Change up your existing furniture. Find stickers or paints and decorate your desk, throw a blanket over your desk chair, and decorate and hang up your old picture frames.
If you're the crafty type, you can find ways to repurpose what you already have with DIY, which can be quite cheap if you have all the supplies on hand.

, Costs add up quickly. When you're going out and buying things for your room, it's very important to make sure you don't overspend. Use a piece of paper and a pen, or a smartphone, to write down your budget, and then write down the cost of everything you plan to buy. If anything you want to buy will put you over the budget, either don't buy it, or put some other items back.


Keep sales tax in mind - things often cost more than you think due to sales tax.
Think about the necessity of something you want to buy. When you find yourself thinking that what you see is cute, think logistically about whether you have a need for it. If it's a borderline case, such as buying a pillow when you're going to make a pillow pile, take factors like price into account - you don't need a 50-dollar pillow when there are far cheaper ones of the same quality right next to it.
Try to aim for cheaper decorations rather than the more expensive ones. But be careful not to buy lower-quality decorations just because they're cheaper - you don't want to buy a beanbag chair and have it split open as soon as someone sits on it!

, It might be more convenient to buy things for your room online, but it's better to see potential decorations in person. Especially for things like bedding and seating, you'll want to be able to see how it looks up close, and test some things out, with the ability to easily return it if something's wrong with it. And plus, it's possible to go out to the store with friends, making the trip a lot more fun!


Oftentimes, things from generic stores can be just as good as brand-name products. There's no need to go on a giant mall trip just to buy stuff for your room - unless you want to, of course.

, Those pillows might seem like they'd be perfect for your room, but if you need to replace your broken desk chair, a desk chair should be the first thing you look for. The functionality of your room should be priority over the cuteness of it, so buy furniture you need rather than furniture you just want. If you can't use your room, there's not much of a point in making it look cute!

, Cute furniture doesn't have to be bulky and heavy - lightweight decorative furniture can help you to accomplish your goal of having a cute room, while simultaneously making it easy to rearrange. Oftentimes, they're not very expensive, either. There are many examples of lightweight furniture that would fit the ""cute"" theme very well; look around and see what you can find.


Beanbag chairs or bungee chairs are easy to move and still look great.
Pillows and fluffy blankets are fantastic for room decoration and can be quickly tossed aside or moved. Blankets can easily be folded up, too.
A small table lamp is a good choice for your desk, and is movable. Lava lamps can also look quite cool when matched with the color theme of the room.
Rugs are easy to move when rolled up, and are a nice way to put a touch of color on the floor of your room.
Small bins are a cute choice for storage, and some can even be folded up. Canvas bins in particular can be sold in pretty patterns.

, Your walls can't be completely devoid of anything other than paint. Picture frames, inspirational quotes, and other decorations can be found at many stores and can be easily attached to a wall. On a larger scale, you can also get posters or bulletin boards - they take up more space, but that can be a good thing.


On a cheaper scale, you can also print some pictures or motivational quotes on paper and hang them on your wall.

, Do you need a desk lamp for late at night when you're doing homework? An alarm clock since you struggle to get out of bed in the mornings for school? If you can find things you need that can rest on your desk or nightstand and are within the budget, that's a win-win!

, While bedding isn't the most necessary of things for a cute room, it can definitely help. A duvet cover or new sheets can have great designs on them that help enhance your room's appearance, and pillows are always useful, whether for sleeping or for a comfortable sitting spot. Soft, fluffy blankets can also be placed on chairs or thrown over your sheets as a decoration.

, Even if you don't have many hobbies that require physical storage, you still get homework, right? Plastic bins, pen and pencil holders, small drawers or baskets, or canvas bins are convenient options for storage and are often portable and easily stored. They're also often ""blank slates"", which make them prime candidates for decoration, or they have designs, which can really help your room look better.


While it's not exactly storage, search for a small trash can. A trash bin can be stored somewhere like under a desk, which is convenient for rooms that aren't the biggest in size, and can be found in many styles.

, Don't complain - just clean it. It makes your bedroom look ten times better. Plus, cleaning out your room will give you more space for decorating it, which is always helpful. Find some time when you're not busy and dedicate it to cleaning out your room.


Take four bins or boxes and label them as Trash, Recycle, Donate, and Keep. Sort the things in your room into these bins. (Avoid just making piles and thinking that you'll figure out which is which - aside from this just being harder to carry out of the room if you need to, it's possible to forget which pile is what, or for the piles to mix together.)
Clean out objects and papers in your room first. These are often the easiest to find and decide what to do with. And chances are, you don't need your year's worth of assignments from sixth grade or your old collection of pizza tables, anyway.
Go through your closet. Take out the clothes you don't wear anymore or don't fit you anymore and donate them, or throw them away if they're in very poor condition. Be honest with yourself on if you ever wear it!
Get all the places you usually don't clean up, like under your bed or desk, in your drawers for storage, and so forth. If you can't remember the last time you cleaned it out, it's probably a good idea to go through it.

, Think about how you planned out you room earlier, and whether it would look good. Prioritize what you want to decorate or move around first, and tell anyone who's helping you. This way, you can get the most important tasks of the decoration done, and not spend nearly as much time moving things again and again because you don't think it looks right!


If you're going to paint or put wallpaper on your walls, you're going to have to remove the furniture from the room. It would be a good idea to do this now. Get an adult's help to get heavier furniture out of the room.

, If you're going to redecorate your walls, prepare the room, get your supplies, and have at it. Get at least one other person to help you so that the job goes quicker.


It may take quite some time for paint to dry, as well as for the fumes to go away; be prepared to wait awhile before being able to proceed with decorating your room.

, Heavy furniture is harder to move, so placing it is the first task you should get out of the way. If you need to move things like your bed frame, bookshelves, a desk, or a dresser, now's the time to move them. Get someone's help and move the heavy furniture to where you want it. You should also set up any new furniture you might have gotten, and place it where you want it (but be careful not to lose any of the small pieces while assembling it!).

, Once the heavier furniture has been placed, spend some time putting up your wall decorations. These can add a sweet, more personal touch to your room. Be sure that you're placing them where you want them, though - wall decorations requiring nails or thumbtacks can leave a mildly annoying hole in the wall, and you don't want to string lights across the upper portion of your wall only to realize that you hung them backwards by mistake!


If you're hanging curtains or heavy objects like a bulletin board, you may want to get an adult to help.
When it comes to hanging any electronics on the wall, such as lights or a TV, you may want to get help to make sure you're plugging in components right (and in the case of heavier things like a TV, ensure that it's secure, so it won't fall).

, Once the major decoration process is out of the way and you've had some time to breathe, it's time to take any lightweight furniture you may have and put it in your room. Arrange it to your liking, and make it look its best.

, If you moved your bed in the process of redecorating your room, it's most likely unmade, or at least pretty rumpled. This is the perfect time to remake your bed - preferably, with fresh sheets and any decorative blankets or pillows that you might have.

, Place any small decorations (like small picture frames) or things you may need, like lamps or a small clock, on your desk. Organize any office supplies you have, too, such as pens and papers, to give your desk a neater appearance.


Place storage bins on or under your desk. This is often convenient for saving space.

, Once you've finished with the main work of your room, the more minor stuff can come in. If you want to place decorative things in your room - like a pile of stuffed animals or pillows - have at it! Sometimes, it's not the functionality that makes it look the best, after all.

, After you've finished putting your room together, take a step back and check out what you've done. Make any finishing touches you may need. And feel good about it - you've managed to make your room a whole lot cuter, after all!

, If you wear too much make up or dress goth, stop. Gradually start wearing nicer clothes, and don't put on so much make up and products. Choose lighter, happier colors, and you may end up with a changed stereotype just because of the way you look. It's stupid, but make up really has an effect in today's world.

Live a good life.,
Have a good attitude and personality.,
Listen to good music.,
Watch good TV shows.,
Watch good movies.,
Try going without makeup.,
Don't go overboard with your hair.,
Be Yourself.,
Be simple.",How to Become Like a Kid," When you're a kid, you love to have fun-but you always do the right thing, and never have ""too much"" fun. Kids just love to be silly, happy, and goofy. They live a good life-which means getting good grades, doing well in school, and surrounding themselves with the people who love them-like their friends and family.;
, In order to embrace being a kid, you must ditch the drama! Be and act happy, carefree, silly, funny, and just be yourself. Don't care what others think-because your opinion is the only one that counts. Have a positive attitude and always think good thoughts-this will always help you through your life!

, Listen to good country and pop music: songs with uplifting, spiritual, happy, and peaceful lyrics, and pick artists that have stayed true to their ""good girl"" image. Artists like: Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, The Rubyz, and Jasmine are all good options for us kids!

, The average kid of this day is now switching from watching innocent shows to darker shows that portray kids badly. It's best to stick to the image of the kid who is worry-free and innocent for this reason. Watch shows with only a TV-G or TV-PG rating. Pick programs with good storylines and plots, and ones that have good characters and that have a lesson or moral value tied into it. Shows like: Wizards of Waverly Place, Hannah Montana, Sonny With A Chance, iCarly, Full House, and MONK are all great options for kids! Regular Show, a Cartoon Network TV show, is a great option for younger and older teenage kids! (For both boys and girls!)

Five Regular Show episodes were rated TV-14, which were meant for older audiences and were sometimes inappropriate for younger audiences. Regular Show episodes now have a PG rating and are appropriate for everyone to watch!, Only watch movies with a G or PG rating. Stay away from PG-13 and R-rated movies (even if your at the age where your allowed to see them). Pick out movies with good storylines, happy endings, and that involve fun, silly characters. Movies like: Raise Your Voice, Another Cinderella Story, Princess Protection Program, Ice Princess and A Walk To Remember are awesome choices for kids!

, Makeup can actually damage your skin, rather than improve it. Stay away from it. The only thing to use is lip balm (daily) and lip gloss (on special occasions). Also, take special care of your skin-which means that if you have acne, get a couple different treatments: a gel treatment (for night) and a tinted acne medication (for daytime).

, Hair care for kids is simple and easy. Most kids wear their hair in a ponytail or bun. For special occasions, sometimes wear your hair down (in its natural state). We don't spend hours straightening or curling it- because that's dumb and not practical.

, Being a kid can be tough. You have to stay strong, and stay true to your heart, mind, body, soul, faith and to your family. You have to believe in yourself and always trust that things will be okay.

, Children don't like complicated things. They prefer to think about things in the simplest form possible. Dwell on trying to put things into their simplest form as a thinking process.

The first thing you need to do is stop worrying, be brave, and learn to go with flow.,
Dress Spontaneous.,
Here are some spontaneous things to do!",How to Become a Spontaneous Teenager,"

Don't overanalyze things.
Stop planning things.
Play fun games like: Spin the bottle, Truth or Dare, 7 minutes in Heaven, Strip Poker, The Nervous Game.
Think about how your going to miss out.
Think like a little kid. All kids want to do is have fun so make that your main goal with everything that you're doing.
Don't be lazy, make everything you do active. Limits your hours watching TV being on the computer. Laying in your bed all day isn't spontaneous.

Do things just so you know you'll have a crazy story to tell.

This is a life style. You can fit it into everything you do.;
,


Wear anything different.

Bring old styles from other years (like 60's, 70's, 80's) back that no one wears any more. Who knows you might start a new trend.
Have lots of fun accessories.
You can find bold items at places like Forever21, Urban Outfitters, PacSun, local thrift shops, online stores, etc. *Don't buy the same things over and over again have variety styles and colors! Don't buy things everyone at your school would buy/wear.
Still stay true to yourself.

Get the attitude.,
Stop swearing.,
Wear the clothes.,
Note that a conservative or preppy look is best for this time of your life, when you are at your most vulnerable.,
Wear stuff that is clean, doesn't reveal too much, fits and suits you, and isn't too harsh.,
Shower every day.,
Make sure your hair is nice.,
Don't comb or brush your hair too much, and don't use too many hair products.,
Keep in mind that medium length is quite nice, and a bob is cute and neat.,
Maintain your nails.,
Do not be involved in immoral and promiscuous activity, such as sexual activities, drinking and smoking.,
Participate in quiet activities.,
Keep a low profile.,
Act like you're innocent.,
Always be nice and generous.,
Be nice to everyone, even people who you think are losers, because nobody is a loser and everyone is a human being.,
Be graceful.,
As for sports, just make sure you drink plenty of water to keep off red faces and sweat, and try your hardest.,
Do not insult, gossip, or slander.,
Compliment everyone, but not too much.,
At home, try your best to please your parents.,
Make sure your belongings are neat.,
Concentrate in School.,
At school try to get a seat where you can clearly hear and see the teacher and chalkboard and pay attention.",How to Be Wholesome and Chaste," Be modest and ladylike. To look virtuous and sweet, don't yell or scream. Don't curse or be disrespectful. Just be kind to others and be nice. Courtesy and confidence is key.;
, It may be hard to cut out, but swearing is one of the worst things you could do if you're trying to be ladylike. Try making a deal with your friends about not swearing for a day. Just think about proving to everyone you have the will power and self control to actually control and think about what comes out of your mouth. If you're a person who swears loads, this is not a ladylike thing. Definitely say things like ""shoot"" and ""idiot"". Try not to use crude words like ""crap"" or ""retarded"". They're not okay. Try to make very calm and civil comebacks, not the regular old stuff. It'll take practice, but it's a huge step towards being innocent.

, Wear pastel clothes, like white, pink, grey, orange and brown. This will enhance your look of vulnerability and will make you look innocent.

, Make sure hemlines reach at least your fingertips and necklines reach the collarbone area. Invest your hard-earned money in a few quality clothing and jewelry pieces that you will need your whole life.

, Sounds complicated, but it's not. You could also try wearing a really light and clean top over a long sleeved white top. If the top you're wearing over it is very pretty and gives off the ""baby doll"" theme, you'll get the perfect, ladylike look. Experiment and play around.

, Make sure you use a conditioner and a shampoo that's right for your hair type (i.e. if you have thin hair, don't use a shampoo designed for thick hair).

, Don't leave too much hair on your face unless you have bangs. Don't feel like you have to pin your bangs off your face and do an old fashioned style -you don't. Just make sure your hair looks sleek and well looked after. Wash your hair a couple of times a week, and use a good and sweet smelling shampoo.

, They damage your hair. Try not to curl or straighten too much, don't use it too much unless it's a special occasion. Your hair can be any length, it doesn't have to be very long.

, As for hairstyles, you can do anything. Side ponytails, braids, buns, anything. Just make sure the style won't come out during P.E or anything, and that you won't have to keep adjusting it. Add a white, pink, or gold ribbon for a nice effect, and matching hair clips. The headbands with little bows on the side are very sweet and lady like.

, Clear coat on your fingernails; color or french pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, and stop biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish. Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long.

, This will give you a bad reputation, and will harm you eventually.

, Try quiet and leisurely activities, such as reading, writing, listening to the radio and talking on the phone(not to much or it will annoy your parents).

, When you are at parties or at social events, you can flirt, but not too much. Just say hi and chat about nice things, like concerts, movies and television shows.

, Develop this kind of attitude.

, Having a selfish and nasty attitude towards others will drag you very far away from being sweet or lady like. Always have a smile on your face, and be willing to let people borrow things from you (but not to the point that they're using you).

, Everyone deserves a chance, so make sure you give it to them. Don't exclude people from games, gifts, or secrets, keep your promises and don't gossip. When someone gossips about someone else, politely tell them you find gossiping rather mean and would prefer not to. Don't be mean or hotheaded, always keep your cool.

, This is a difficult step, but also a crucial one. Being graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe. Just make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders rolled back and your back straight. Don't swagger, or swing your hips. It looks exaggerated and weird. Don't swing your arms either - keep them by your side.

, Don't drag your team down, participate.

, When necessary, voice your opinions appropriately and constructively. This encourages your audience to listen carefully when you speak. But if someone is bulling you you have the right to insult.

, You don't want to come off as creepy. Compliment people you wouldn't normally talk to, it's a good way to make new friends.

, i.e. Go to bed on time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, clean up after dinner, etc. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's something you should be doing (no matter how badly you don't want to do it), do it! They will trust you and let you do more things.

, Make sure you label and cover all of your school and text books. Try just covering them with clear contact paper,it looks a lot neater. If you really like patterned contact paper, try the metallic looking ones that come in red, silver, blue and gold. Label your things and look after them to make sure they don't get lost or damaged. Buy some nice pencils and pens, fancy pen or a cute- colored pencil. Make sure you always have enough of everything, constantly asking to borrow things isn't very lady like or innocent. When buying a school bag, go for light and neutral colors and posh brands, stuff that's good quality.

, It's important to be looked on as intelligent and keen at school. Try hard in every single, solitary subject and class you take, and always hand in homework(on time!). Don't talk during class(you have loads of time for that later, don't pass notes either-it gets very embarrassing if you're caught). Ask questions and participate in class discussions. Try to get involved with the school and its' activities, too. Reading up on background information about a topic you're studying is good too, and can actually be interesting. Help others if they're struggling, and don't suck up to your teachers. Just try hard, be punctual in everything and share your knowledge.

, A good goal to set for yourself is to try to get mostly A's in everything you do at school, including homework. Take notes, study for tests, focus, but most of all, come to school ready to learn and try not to worry about the social scene too much, after all, that's not what school is for. try to join extra curricular activities but only if you know it will not bring your grades down."

Talk to a fashionable friend.,
Follow trends appropriately.,
Subscribe to fashion magazines.,
Follow fashion bloggers on Instagram.,
Add to what you have.",How to Be Trendy1," If you want to be more fashion forward, reach out to a friend whose style you admire. Being trendy and fashionable takes a certain amount of work. You can learn a lot from someone who knows how to follow the latest styles.


Ask your friend how he or she stays up to date with the latest fashions. Ask him about what blogs you should follow to keep yourself fashion forward. You can also use your friend as a source. Certain trend forecast websites have big user fees. It can much easier to lean on a well informed friend to keep track of the latest in fashion.Remember, you should never copy someone's style. While you can ask your friend for advice, try not to become a copy of that person. Being trendy does not mean blindly following every trend. It simply means being aware of a variety of styles and following trends that flatter you.;
, Not every trend works for every person. People can often be guilty of overdoing it when it comes to trends as well, resulting in unflattering fashion choices.


Pick what works for you and what you feel comfortable with. You're unlikely to look good in a trendy outfit if it doesn't flatter your body type and if it makes you uncomfortable. For example, if a certain style of dress looks bulky on you simply follow a different fashion trend. There's no reason to wear certain clothes simply because they're trendy.Do not overdo it. Leggings may be in at the moment but that does not mean a pair of casual leggings looks good with every outfit. A pair of black leggings coupled with a long sweater might look great. However, leggings with a more formal top may look tacky. Use discretion when following trends and don't be afraid to simplify or adjust given the occasion., Subscribing to fashion magazines, both print and online, can help you be more fashionable. Fashion on the Street blogs, such as the Sartorialist, can be a fun, cheap way to keep up with trends. You could also buy a subscription for a magazine like Vogue, Seventeen, or Marie Claire to keep up on seasonal fashion trends., Instagram is a great tool for those wanting a trendy style. Look up lists of fashion bloggers to follow on Instagram and search hashtags like #ootd (outfit of the day) to get a sense of what people are wearing. Follow people whose style closely matches your personality. If you like minimalist outfits, for example, look for Instagram users who dress in this style., If you're on a budget, or just want to spend more practically, try reviewing your current wardrobe. See how current, trendy items could be mixed and matched with your current clothing and accessories.


Make a quick list of what you have, including outfits you wear to work, school, hanging out with friends, and so on. Then, look at what's currently fashionable. Would an infinity scarf go well with that nice, swoop neck blouse you have? Would a nice, trendy cardigan wrap match well with that old t-shirt you love to wear? Incorporating trendy items into your current wardrobe means you can get by with only purchasing a few new items each fashion season.Pay special attention to items you own that are neutral shades. A black pair of jeans, for example, can go with many different colors, allowing you to keep up on fall and winter shades without investing in new pants. A white or black cardigan is also helpful, as this can be matched with many different trendy items.
Accessorize. If you don't want to revamp your wardrobe entirely, you can accessorize to stay trendy. What kind of sunglasses are in season this year? What kind of jewelry? A new necklace or pair of shades is less costly than an entire new outfit.

We go through a lot of pain, both mentally and physically, simply because we are women. A lot is expected out of us in life, especially in this day and age. We go through childbirth.

Try to have good posture.",How to Be the Perfect Teen Girl," Smiling helps you stay positive and also encourages others to feel less intimidated by you. Returning other's smiles really does boost both their confidence and yours and may even help you make a new friend.;
, Don't fail your classes just to seem cute, because your future is more important than a boy. Some people like smart girls! Study hard and if you're going to a party or going out, do your homework before! It may not seem that fun to study and do homework but it will help you become a successful woman. Don't let your social life get in the way. Work hard in class and be consistent.


Try to get the best grades that you possibly can because your teenage years are when it all counts. High school is especially important because it's when you figure out where you want to go in life. It will pay off in the long run!

, Don't become someone you're not. Not every person is going to accept you but you should love yourself anyway. Just know that there will always be someone else who will love you for who you are. They might love the quirky little things about you and you should never change who you are just because you want to fit the image someone else is creating for you.

, If someone made you upset or angry, don't just yell at them or ignore them. Control yourself and talk it out in a calm and rational way. Try to tell them why you're upset. Don't talk behind peoples backs, either. Most girls love to gossip, and almost everyone is guilty of it at one time or another, but it's immature and hurts other people's feelings. The best way to keep yourself from gossiping is to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Would you like others gossiping about you?

, Smile if you catch someone's eye across the classroom. Hold doors open for people, and say thank you when they do it for you. If someone says hi to you, say hi back and turn it into a conversation - ask how they are, what class are they in next etc. Look people in the eye and smile when you talk to them, and avoid folding your arms, because it makes you seem frosty and unwelcoming. If the weird kid comes up and starts talking to you, don't laugh and walk away - attempt to start a conversation!

, Some people find that cursing makes you seem trashy or unintelligent, so avoid swearing around people you know feel uncomfortable. No matter how gorgeous you are or how perfect you are, if you swear a lot it will make you seem unattractive to some. Definitely avoid swearing around children, especially ones that aren't your family.

, If you're a shy person it might be a little harder, but go out there and meet new people. Don't try to just stick to one type of clique. Hang out with new people. Do some crazy stuff you would never think of doing. You can even dress up as Jesus! After all, you want to grow up and have amazing memories to remember. If you're invited to a friends party, make an effort to go, even if you'd rather sit at home watching Netflix. You might end up having fun!

, Go shopping, to the cinemas, or just hang at each other's houses. Organise and plan events to look forward to. Sometimes you need to take a break from all the schoolwork and extracurricular activities for some down time with your bffs.

, Getting into a relationship can really help your self esteem if you feel a little low. But remember that a relationship with someone (no matter how cute they are) can't fix everything - you need to know and accept yourself before expecting someone else to.

, Being mean to your parents/brothers or sisters may be fun to do for a little while, but there is more of a possibility that you'll be grounded and unable to do anything cool with your mates! Listen to your parents, be patient with your siblings.

, If you have a boyfriend, don't try to take over and do everything. Have fun and don't be to uptight. Try new things that they suggest. Listen to them and try to understand where they are coming from. Your non-romantic relationships are important as well. Keep in touch with your friends and communicate with your parents. Tell them how school was that day, ask them what they've been up to lately. Communication is key in any strong relationship.

, Cut back on the junk food. Instead of chips or ice cream, have a fruit smoothie or low fat yogurt. It's OK to treat yourself one in a while, but eating fatty foods every day is not healthy. Attempt to excercise a few times a week, whether it be jogging, jumping jacks, or lifting weights. Avoid smoking, drinking, and drugs. Do some research to find out how much water you should be drinking daily (around 2 liters)

, As mentioned before, try exercising a few times a week but be comfortable with the size you are. Try playing a sport to stay in good physical condition and to make new friends.

, Sleep at least 8-10 hours every night. Sometimes it's hard because teenagers have many responsibilities, such as school and sports, but in the end, you and your body will thank you for being well rested.

, You want to keep your teeth in the best possible condition and also avoid scaring off other people with your bad breath. Try keeping gum or mints in your bag to freshen your breath (This is also a great way to strike up a conversation with others!). To keep your teeth healthy, brush them 2-3 times a day. If you want to whiten them, brush them with baking soda.

, Don't slouch when sitting or standing. You will look taller and also give off the impression that you're confident, even if you aren't. Tip: If you have back issues, consider seeing a chiropractor.

Do well in school.,
Join extracurricular activities (if possible).,
Keep organized the night before school, lay out your clothes, sort your books and get a good nights sleep.,
Be clean!,
Accept who you are.,
Don't be shy.,
Exercise.,
Prepare for your first period if you're female.,
Keep your parents updated with your life.,
Explore different sides of yourself.,
Do group work wisely.",How to Be the Perfect Preteen," Obviously, if you're under the age of fourteen, you're too young to get a job and prove to your parents you are responsible that way. Fortunately for you, this way works just as well. If you have chores, do them twice as well as you did before and even try to do extra. If you do not have chores, try things like vacuuming, dusting and so on. This will get your parents' trust, and it will burn way more calories than watching TV.;
, It may sound impossible, but try to keep your room (and playroom, if you still have one) as neat as your parents' room. Obviously, if their room is, and stays very neat, then those are their expectations. Imagine if your friends walk in your room and find out you're a total slob! And if you keep your room clean, cockroaches will not come live in it.


Shoving things under your bed or to the back of your closet does not count as cleaning your room.

, There's a reason they're asking you to do it, and it will pay off later. Your parents will give you their trust, and respect you because you listen to everything that they say. When you really want them to buy you something, they will most likely buy it for you, but don't take advantage of them.

, Participate in class and volunteer to stay after school to help sharpen pencils or wipe down tables (assuming it's okay with your parents). Little things like that will earn you huge brownie points with teachers. Put your best effort into your schoolwork and ask for help if you're unsure about concepts. This shows your parents that you are trying to be responsible in all areas of your life.

, Try having a variety of interests. However; do not let these new activities interfere with doing your best work at school. The trick is to find a balance between in-school and out-of-school activities. If possible try to join two artsy activities (band, library assistant, debate club) and two sporty activities (soccer, volleyball, basketball) for girls and vice versa for boys.

, You need your beauty sleep, and then you don't have to be in a dump in the morning when you're trying to find where your left sock is.

, Nobody likes a pig. Brush your hair every day, shower at least every other day, brush your teeth two times a day, gently clean your nose every morning (you don't want your best friend finding out what's in your nose do you?), etc. You want to look as neat as possible.


Take care of your skin. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water and wash your face at least once every day. If you need it, get some acne cream.
Wash your hair every two days unless it gets greasy or oily before then. You can also go for a longer amount of time without washing your hair if it is still relatively clean, but don't go for too long without washing it!

, Believe in yourself and accept who you are. Sure, you may not have the greatest nose ever, but people don't judge by appearance.

, Socialize a bit more. Hang out with your friends, and make some new friends too! Be nice to everyone, even if you don't like them and share with people! Be very polite and not haughty or rude.

, In your pre-teen and tween years, you may gain more weight than usual. It is important to work out every day for at least 30 minutes. So you can jump on your trampoline 10 minutes, stretch for 5, maybe go jogging for 15 and you have your 30 minutes.

, This is a significant part of being a preteen. Your period is most likely coming in soon, and you need to prepare. Buy some pads and tampons just in case. If you started having discharge, wear pantiliners every day.

, If you know it, they should know it. Tell them that you just got off the phone with Kayla or that Jen spilled her milk today, or tell them how Taryn got an A on her Science paper. Even how cute Justin looked in his shorts in gym class. They like to know these things. After all, they are your parents, and they like to know what's going on with your life.


Be informative. Remember the four W's. Who, what, when and where. Your parents should always know these things no matter what the occasion. For example tell them your going to the movies (what), with Christine, Jesse, and Emma (who), that the movie runs from 7-9 (when), and that it's at the Galaxy Theatre by Walmart (where).

, Make new friends and discover who you really are. You may have been hanging out with the ""kids that can't grow up the crowd"" and think you're ready for something new. You can also try new activities.

, For group projects at school, try to get into a group with people who you know keep up their grades and don't fall behind in school. When working on the project with them, you will be less likely to spend your time goofing off and more time putting your best efforts into the project.

,
Remember who you are.,
Kill others with kindness.,
Don't get sucked in.,
Realize who your real friends really are.",How to Be the Nice Girl," Always aim to make a good impression on other people by being upbeat and having something positive to bring to the conversation. This will help others to think of you as a nice person and not another one of those mean girls who trash talk or give them a hard time.


Have kind words to say to others. Be ready to compliment people on the good things you notice about them, even if it's just one thing.;
, People enjoy being around someone who is happy more than someone who acts like the world is ending.

, For one thing, it feels good, and for another, it makes others feel good. Don't laugh at others though. Making fun of other people isn't funny.

, Pay attention in class and be on good terms with your teachers.

, People like those who are quieter and have respect for what another person has to say.

, Especially befriend the other nice people. Make friends with people who are mostly honest and friendly, or who stick up for other people in a friendly way.

, Make friends with everyone you possibly can.

, Everyone wants to be wanted, and you are making sure that they are want

, This way, people will get to know you for who you really are.

,, If somebody is mean to you, give yourself a minute to cool off, don't go right ahead and punch them. This will give a bad impression on your side.

, If someone is mean to you, send them a gift or a card for no reason or speak up for them in class or in the school grounds. They will be so dumbfounded that they will likely realize how mean they have been.

, If somebody you know, like a friend, is trash talking somebody else, don't be afraid to step forward and say ""Hey I don't think you should be talking about that person that way"" or ""Why don't we let this drop, it wasn't a big deal anyway"". Stopping mean-spirited gossip is a role a nice person will always take on.

, If your friends support you in any way they can or always is nice to you, you know they are your true friends. But if somebody is making you chose sides or is sucking you into drama, they aren't your real friend... trust me I know.

Make a list of all the un-innocent things you do: Do you swear?,
Be virtuous.,

Speak with eloquence.,
Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and feminine.,

Treasure your innocence.,
Remember your virtues and morals.,
Start to work on your appearance.,

Don't be afraid of your emotions - you're a girl and it's OK to cry sometimes.,
Make sure you get enough sleep.,
Be extra careful on the internet.",How to Be the Epitome of Old Fashioned Innocence (Teen Girls)," Do you deliberately set out to look sexy or provocative? Do you smoke? Stay up too late? Drink alcohol? Write all these down and reflect on them. Now, one by one, eliminate these bad habits.

. Instead, start to think about, and develop, your virtuous side
, The most important virtues are:



Selflessness - always think of others first, so people start to regard you as a nice girl who is a role model for others

Modesty - think about your appearance. You should aim to be feminine and demure - not provocative

Chastity - treasure the ambition of being a virgin on your wedding night

Charity - always think of others - and there are many - who are in a worse position than you - and give money and time to help them. If you have spare time, consider volunteering somewhere useful

Patience - don't be in too much of a hurry to be an adult; you have plenty of time

, Address them with respect. Do what they tell you to even if you think they are treating you like a child - remember they only want to protect you. Return their unconditional love. They will be proud of your new approach to life and will love to help you. Never disrespect your parents by criticizing them to your friends

, Be sure in your opinions, but never express a negative opinion if it will hurt someone. Choose your words - and your battles - wisely.

, Embrace being a girl - and never try to be one of the guys. Ask for help when lifting heavy objects, bat those lovely eyes. Always try to be cute, but don't take it too far, that will get annoying, but don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Don't be afraid to embrace your shy side either; it isn't a weakness and will make you seem cute and adorable

, Don't associate with those who may lead you into temptation. Instead, find friends who also are trying to live wholesome and fulfilling lives. It’s much easier to feel innocent and sweet when you hang out with like-minded people. Spend time with kids and interact with them to see how they act. Try to understand how they see the world and try to learn from them. Enjoy children's activities and the things that innocent people enjoy. Don't worry if you find you are much happier around younger girls - it's fun and quite normal.

, Be proud of the fact that you will be a virgin on your wedding night. Although it is a test of patience and endurance you will find it a beautiful and uplifting ambition. Friends will respect and secretly envy you even if they don't say so.. By all means, kiss a few frogs...but don't make little tadpoles! A purity ring may serve as a useful reminder to yourself that you have made this promise.

, Be a girl who doesn't compromise them and never do anything you know your parents would not approve of. They brought you into this world. You are theirs to love and protect, do not disappoint them.

, Begin by throwing any trousers and jeans away - wearing your skirts helps define you as a girl and you will look and feel completely different.. Black or navy are great as they help project your image as that of a demure and classy girl. Don't have hems too much above the knee. But your top should be in a color associated with innocence. White symbolizes purity, pink symbolizes youth, yellow symbolizes hope. Look for lace and ruffles. Don't let your tops expose any breast - your lowest neck-line should be at least two centimeters above your breast.

, Firstly, your hair. Don't dye it, instead keep it natural with no highlights. However, make sure it is exquisitely styled. Buns, plaits, headbands and ribbons are now your friends. As for make-up, keep it to a minimum. Piercings? Ears only - never your tongue, face or belly-button. Avoid tattoos completely; they look crude - and you will regret having them later

, Cut down on TV watching - and don't be afraid to ask advice from parents about whether something is suitable for you. You want to avoid sex, and violence for example, or shows which make bad behavior seem cool or exciting. Instead, read, write poetry, brush your hair, sing, or learn a musical instrument. Take up simple hobbies. Send thank-you letters when you receive a gift. Write letters rather than e-mails - your friends will think this is really cute. Try to use the house-phone more, you may not really need a mobile phone as much as you think you do.

, Never bully. Be ready to defend the victim if you see somebody being bullied, but never throw a punch. If someone hits you, do not hit back. Doing so would make you just as guilty. Go and find somebody in authority and show them your wound, giving an honest account of the events. Do not embellish or elaborate. Try to remain as calm as possible wile still showing that you are upset.

, Express your feelings freely, but in a polite and civilized manner. Try to keep composure, but voice your opinions as you have a right to them!

, Agree a bedtime with your parents (9.30 or 10.00 might be good on school nights, a bit later at weekends) and ask them to make you stick to it even if sometime you would rather not. Don't worry that other girls are out partying while you're getting ready for bed - you're not like other girls now. Here are some tips to help you enjoy your bedtime:


Wear a pretty nightdress rather than pajamas
It's no fun getting into a cold bed, so in winter ask your Mom to put a hot water bottle in your bed so it's lovely and warm for you.
Then ask her to come and kiss you goodnight.

, There is a lot of scary stuff with sex, violence, and drugs that you could stumble upon which is not good for the new you. Ask your parents to install parental control software on your PC and phone if you have one. They can configure this to prevent you from seeing webpages or doing things which are inappropriate for you. They will be very happy to do this for you as they know it will help you to be the sweet and innocent girl you want to be. You will feel much safer and more protected too. Don't stress that your friends know about this - they will think it's cute and a sign that your parents care for you.

Put your cards in sets.",How to Make Money With Pokémon Cards," Post pictures of your cards on ebay. You’ll need pictures to show buyers exactly what they will be purchasing. Be sure that your pictures include any imperfections your cards may have so that your buyers are aware of them. Make sure your pictures show the front and back of your card. Offer buyers free shipping to give them extra incentive.


Online sales increase dramatically on free shipping day.When you offer free shipping on ebay, you also automatically get a five-star shipping cost rating.;
, There are websites that specialize in buying and selling Pokémon cards. Most of these will have listings to let you know exactly how much they’ll pay you for certain cards. These companies will save you time by buying your cards outright, but they’ll likely only pay you a fraction of what your cards are worth.


Know the condition of your cards. Some sites, like professor-oak.com, will only accept cards that are in mint condition., Never sell giant lots of random cards. You will make far more money if you list your cards individually, in completed sets or in random sets with two rare cards and a few regular ones., Make sure to include all the pertinent information relating to your card in your listing. For example if you list your card as simply a “Charizard Pokémon card,” your listing won’t attract too much attention. Some things you should include in your listing are:


The rarity of your card.
Whether or not your card is shadowless or holographic.
The condition of your card. Is your card used, in good condition or even in mint condition?
The set number of your card. For example, the Charizard card would be “base set 4/102”.

, It can be wise to price your card very low initially. Try making the starting bid for you card ninety-nine cents to get some easy bids. After a few people bid on your card, they’ll likely fight over it with competing bids raising your profit.


This strategy can backfire if your card is very valuable. For extremely rare cards, you should start the bidding at the price you want for them.

, Be sure to put clear packing tape over the address you’re sending the package to as well as your own address. The tape will protect the writing from getting smudged if the package gets wet. If both addresses are unreadable, you could lose your card, your potential profit and your high seller rating on ebay.

, Find a store that specializes in trading card games. Bring your well preserved cards and see how much they’ll pay you for them. Be sure to know the value of your cards and how much you’ll accept for them before doing business.


Call ahead to make sure the store accepts Pokémon cards.

, Card shows will be filled with collectors and dealers who may be willing to purchase your cards. You may have to approach a few dealers before you find one who’s familiar with Pokémon cards.Search the internet to find a list of upcoming trading card shows in your area.

, There’s plenty of public groups that meet every so often to play the Pokémon card game. Players may be willing to pay you if you have a certain card they need to complete their deck.


Card game players usually won’t pay as much for rare cards as collectors because they plan on using them.

, Write down the contact information of the dealers and collectors who you sell your cards to. Shoot them an email whenever you come across rare or interesting cards they might be interested in.


Your relationships may even refer customers looking for rare cards to you., Look for reasonably priced Pokémon cards you can sort through. You’ll likely have the best luck searching at thrift stores or online. For example: Booster boxes that contain thirty-six unopened packs of Pokémon cards will cost about one hundred and forty dollars at most local stores, but you can buy them for about eighty dollars on a website like yuckygamers.com.Buy in bulk. Find sellers that are looking to get rid of their Pokémon cards and are offering a good price.
When buying older Pokémon cards, make sure they’ve been well maintained as the slightest damage to a card can drastically decrease its value.

, Fake cards are worthless and illegal to sell. It can be very difficult to tell a fake Pokémon card from a real one, but there are a few dead giveaways.


On the back of a real card, there will be a crisp border. On the back of a fake card, the border will look faded.
On the front of a fake card, there will likely be no accent mark over the “e” in Pokémon., The rarer the card, the more it will be worth. There will be a number that reads like a fraction at the bottom right corner of every card that tells you what number the card is in its set. Next to that number, there should be a tiny shape that tells you how rare the card is.


A circle indicates that the card is common and likely not worth much money.
A diamond indicates that the card is uncommon.
A star indicates that the card is rare.
If there is no shape or a different illustration, then the card is part of a promotional set. Promotional cards can be more or less rare depending on what promotion they are a part of., There’s few different card designs and markings that can make your card more valuable. Make sure you know if your card is special so you can price it appropriately.


If there is a black circle with the number one inside of it and the word “edition” wrapped around it next to the description of the pokémon, then your card is a first edition Pokémon card.
If your card has shiny reflective foil around the picture, then you have a “holographic” card. If the holographic design is on the entire front of the card, then the card is a “reverse-holographic” card and is even more valuable.
If there is a copyright of “95,96,98,99” at the bottom of your card and there is no shadow at the edge of the picture, then you have a rare shadowless card.

, You want to make sure no further damage comes to your cards until you have the opportunity to sell them. You can buy plastic sleeves in bulk for about a cent a sleeve that will protect your cards from scratches.


Buy toploaders for the cards that are more valuable. Toploaders are more rigid than plastic sleeves and prevent your cards from being creased., Examine your cards carefully to see what kind of condition they’re in. Look for creases, smudges, tears and bent corners. Separate your cards into three categories: the cards in good condition, the cards in fair condition and the cards in poor condition. Separating your cards will make it easier to value them.

, There are some Pokémon cards that can be worth thousands of dollars if they are in pristine condition. If you come across an extremely rare card that you suspect is in perfect condition, you can send it to the PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) at psa.com to verify its worth. Having proof that you’re card is in great condition will dramatically increase its value.


Only send cards you believe are in mint condition. The process can be expensive.
The PSA scale ranges from ten for a card in mint condition to one for a card in poor condition. Even the tiniest smudge or scratch can drop a card from mint condition to one in good condition, dropping it in value substantially.There are only five mint condition, edition one Charizard cards in circulation, making them worth over a thousand dollars each.

, Collectors are always looking to buy things in sets. You’ll have an easier time selling your cards if you sell them in sets. You can tell what set your cards belong to by looking at the tiny number in the bottom right hand corner of your card that is written like a fraction. The first number is the number your card is in the set and the second number is the number of total cards in the set.The base set has one hundred and two cards.
The jungle set has sixty-four cards.
The fossil set has sixty-two cards.
The team rocket set has eighty-three cards.
You can also group your cards in sets of holographic, shadowless or rare cards.

Work on seeing the real beauty in people and things. Admit that you're not perfect and that nobody will ever be. try not to think of someone negatively. Only think of someone negatively if you have a VERY good reason and even then try to think of their good qualities or, if you can't think of very many good qualities about that person, try using pity instead of hate. For example, if someone is very mean, think, ""Wow, something bad must have happened to them for them to be like this,"" instead of ""I hate them. They're always so mean to me."" Also, always treat people with respect and kindness even if you don't think that they deserve it.;
, Being confident can make a great difference in your life and personality. It makes you look and feel happier. People can tell when you're confident and when you are not confident. If you like someone, get to know them, talk to them, and, if you want to, ask them out. If you're going into a job interview and the manager/boss immediately says, ""I don't think you can do this job,"" or ""This is no resume. What makes you think you can do this job?"" disagree with them and tell them that you CAN do the job (it might not sound like a good plan, but it can land you the job.) Take criticism with respect. If someone tries to insult you, don't listen to them and be the bigger person by not causing a scene and ignoring the insult. Be social and don't care what others think of you. Oh, and at parties, don't be afraid to dance.

, Do this for yourself as well as others. Take daily showers, wash your hair, brush your teeth, floss, brush your hair, use deodorant, don't wear dirty clothing, and wear light perfume. Taking care of yourself using good hygiene boosts self esteem and overall image.

, Wash your hair every other day. If you wash it everyday you will, at best, get flaky hair. make sure to use shampoo and conditioner suited for your hair type. Brush your hair out and, if you want, style it cutely. Just don't use hair products using heat (hair dryer, curling iron, straightener, etc) every day. Healthy hair will make anyone look better.


Be careful when considering chemical alterations to your hair (colouring, perms, chemical straightening, etc.) If you constantly shove colour into your hair or perm it, you run the risk of frying your hair.






Style and cut your hair in a way that flatters your face. Ask a stylist or fashion-forward friend for help if you need it.







, Express your inner style and people will appreciate it. It doesn't matter what you wear, as long as it fits, is clean, is not too tight, and doesn't show an insane amount of skin.


Some great stores to shop at are Forever 21, DEB, Wet Seal, Pac Sun, Walmart, Target, and Factory Connection. Thrift stores and consignment shops can also be great places to find a deal on fashionable clothes.

, Get your homework in on time, study, and pay attention in school while remembering to take notes. Ask your teacher any questions you may have; you'll never know what you'll learn or who will benefit. Pay extra attention to classes that you struggle in.


If something doesn't make sense to you, don't hesitate to get your friends (or a tutor) together for a study session! You can have fun and learn at the same time.







, Don't make your mother cook dinner all alone. Even offering to do the dishes afterwards is help enough. Make a deal with your dad, you'll mow half the yard and so will he. If your parents give you money for chores, accept it graciously and don't nag them for a raise. If you don't get an allowance for doing chores, don't ask for any! Maybe your parents are going through a tough time for money or they're saving up for something big that you don't know about. If you want money, get a part-time job instead. Your parent's respect and love is the most crucial thing that you, or any teen, can have to thrive.

, No matter where you live, take the time to learn how to drive as soon as you can. You'll regret having to beg your friends or parents for rides to the mall or work if you don't.

, Work hard and show up on time. Be polite to customers and other co-workers. Save the money you earn to buy important things like a car or money for college or university.

, For some, this may be easier said than done. If you're one of these types, do some research into your favourite drug or drink, and the long-term effects. Unless you want to end up in jail with major health conditions, drugs are not the choice. If you really need it, go into rehab and/or go to an alcoholics or drug addict therapy group.

, Life can get stressful. Every now and then, slow down and relax. Read your favourite book, have a long talk with a friend, or paint your nails. If you have the money, buy yourself some clothes at the mall or get a facial at the spa or at home. Do something that relaxes you and you'll feel ten times better.

Sit down with your parents and discuss the possibility of getting paid for doing chores. Negotiate with them by noting how hard you work and how you are trying to earn your own money. You may point out that because you are only 11 or younger, your options for employment are limited and getting paid to do household chores is a safe and reasonable option.


You may also propose an hourly wage, for example, five to eight dollars an hour, or a wage per task, for example, five dollars for every chore completed. You can then negotiate with your parents to find a wage that they think is fair.;
, This can be a great way to earn money during the warmer months of the year. It is best to do this with your parents so that they can show exactly how they want their car(s) to be washed. You will need to find access to a water hose, usually found at the back of the house. The hose will also need to have a hand sprayer attached to the end.Fill a bucket with water. As you are filling the bucket up, add in some soap that is safe to wash a car with (see instructions on the bottle and/or ask your parents for instructions on how to do this). The soap should bubble up.
Dip a sponge or soft washcloth in the water. Wash a 2-3 foot section of the car at a time. Scrub gently against the car using circular motions, making sure to get all of the dirt and bugs off. After you have completed one section, spray the soap off with your hose. Continue to scrub 2-3 feet sections at a time. Spray each section with water after you are done, so that the soap does not harden. You may wish to stand on a step-stool or get your parents to help you reach the top of the car.
The tires will also need to be washed. You can use your normal sponge/cloth or use a specialized brush to help you scrub the dirt and grime within the rim. For more information on how to wash a car, please see: How to Wash a Car by Hand.

, On the floors with carpet, use your vacuum. If you are not strong enough to handle the large, bulky vacuum cleaner, ask your parents to buy a smaller, lighter vacuum. Make sure to get the living room, bedrooms, and any other room with carpet. Work across areas at least twice to make sure that dirt and dust isn't picked up the first time through.Pull the hose out from the vacuum cleaner and use the available attachments. Get in the corners of each room, particularly those areas which were not reached by the first pass through. Brush attachments also allow you to vacuum cushions, and upholstered furniture.
Get out a broom and clean the floors which are not carpeted (linoleum, hardwood, etc.). Place the broom ahead of the dirt and pull it towards one direction. Make sure to get in the corners and edges of the floor where dirt and dust gets trapped.
Sweep the dirt into one pile. Then sweep that pile into a dustpan, and toss the dirt into the trashcan.

, Ask your parents how you can help prepare. This might mean using safe knives to cut up vegetables, fruit, and/or meat. Your parents might be making a stew, in which case you can be responsible for occasionally stirring the pot. You can also be responsible for wiping down the table before you begin cooking, and after everything is complete.If you are making cookies, help your parents out by rolling out the cookie dough. You can then pick out different cookie cutters to cut out the cookies. Spray cookie sheets down with some Pam (or generic anti-stick spray) and lay the cookies on the sheets a few inches apart from one another. Your parents can place the sheets in the oven, and you can be responsible for watching them so that they don't burn.
You might want to help out either one of your parents set up a date night with the other parent. Help them make the food, organize the dishes on the table, and decorate for the romantic evening.

, After a meal is over, whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner, take the dishes and place them next to the sink. Plug up the sink using a stopper. Run warm water into the sink until it is filled up. As the water is running, put in a few drops of dish detergent into the water. You will see bubbles form as the water comes down. Once the sink is pretty full, turn off the water.Dip in each dish one at a time. Use a sponge or washcloth to scrub off the food and grime. Make sure to use plenty of soap and water. Use an elongated brush to clean out glasses.
Once you are done with each dish, place them somewhere near the sink. After you have washed them all, dry them off with a tea towel, and put them away where they belong. If you are unsure where a particular dish goes, ask your parents.
If your parents would rather have them washed in the dish washer, you will still need to hand wash them first. After you have hand washed, put them in the dish washer: large items on the bottom rack, smaller items on the top rack, and utensils in the utensil-holder.
Put dishwasher detergent in the holder, and close the dishwasher. Ask your parents what setting they would like the dishwasher to be set on. After the dishwasher is done washing, take the dishes out and put them away where they belong.

, Gather up all of your dirty clothes into one basket. Take them to the washer. Separate out the lights from the darks, and the heavy clothes (shirts, pants) from the light clothes (undergarments, socks). Take one group of these clothes and put them in the washer. Make sure that they aren't bunched up when you put them inside of the washer.Put one cup of safe dish detergent in either the detergent dispenser (located inside of the washer) or directly on top of the clothes. Make sure to consult with your parents as to what detergent to use and where to put it.
Close the washer and turn the washer on. Ask your parents what setting a particular group of clothes usually washes on. Turn the setting, and then turn the washer on.
Check with your parents to see what clothes go in the dryer, and what clothes are hung up to dry. Take the clothes out of the washer, and place them in the dryer (the ones that can be dried). Turn the dryer to the appropriate setting (check with your parents), and allow your clothes to dry.
Once the clothes are done drying, hanged or in the dryer, make sure to fold them up. Then put them away in either your dresser or closet.

, Go around, with your parents, and ask neighbors whether they have pets. Tell them that you are offering a pet-sitting service where you will watch over their pets for an hourly price. Your neighbors can go on a vacation, or go out to dinner, and feel safe that you are watching over their pets.Before they leave the house, make sure the neighbors leave a list of exactly how to handle each pet. For example, your neighbors should list how much food to feed a fish, how many times a day to walk a dog, and/or what types of treats to give a cat.
If you do not feel safe by yourself, ask your parents to go along with you to do your daily tasks of taking care of pets.
Try to limit it to two or three neighbors at a time. You do not want to overdo yourself, and forget about a particular pet. Make a list of all of your pet-sitting responsibilities so that you take care of every pet, each and every day.

, While you may be too young to babysit for your neighbours, your parents may agree to let you be a paid helper for them. This means that you will watch over your siblings for your parents while they are at home doing chores or working from a home office. You may negotiate with your parents so you get paid by the hour or in a lump sum every time you offer to be a paid helper for them.If you're in the United States, 11 to 15 year old children can get an American Red Cross babysitting certification license after you participate in their class. You can then use these skills to help take care of your siblings while your parents are busy at home.

, This includes mowing lawns, trimming hedges, pulling weeds, and watering flowers. Offer a different price to each person based how much they would like to have done. You can also have add-ons such as spraying weed killer, taking down limbs from trees, and/or using a weed-whacker.Check with them ahead of time if there is anything that you should take note of. For example, they might ask you to not mow near the edge of the house because a power cord is lying there. They might also tell you to watch out for a tree stump as you are riding/pushing the grass mower.
Raking leaves is also an option during the Fall months. Bring a rake with you and charge depending on the size of each yard. Check ahead of time where they would like the leaves to be raked to (towards the house, in the middle of the yard, towards the driveway, etc.).

, This is a great way to quickly make money, especially in the winter time. Make sure that you or your parents own a shovel beforehand. Charge a set amount for each driveway. Check ahead of time with the person so that you know where a ditch might be, and where the edge of the driveway is. You don't want any accidents happening.


You might also think about charging for cleaning off someone's car after it snows. This is a great way to make a bit more money, and it wouldn't take that much additional time. Make sure you bring along a brush, and an ice scraper with you.
Make sure that you do not jab at the ice and snow on someone's car too forcefully. Do slow brushing movements so that you don't accidentally damage someone's car.

, You can set up your own lemonade stand in front of your house. This can be a great refreshing drink on a hot Summer day. By selling each glass of lemonade for 50 cents you can make a decent amount of money. For more information on this, visit: How to Open a Lemonade Stand.Another option is to sell hot chocolate on a cold Fall or Winter day. You can make a batch of hot chocolate with your parents, and sell it for the same price, 50 cents a piece, as you would lemonade. For more information about how to make hot chocolate, visit: How to Make Hot Chocolate.
You can also sell things like cookies or brownies. Young children will love buying sweets, especially if you sell them for 25 or 50 cents a piece. Ice cream is also another option, although you will have to find a way to keep it cool. Bazaars at a local church or school can help raise money quickly and easily.

, Clearing out your old clothes, toys and games is a great way to make space and make some money. Ask your parents for help laying out the items on the driveway or in your yard. Write on poster board big signs drawing willing customers towards your yard sale. It will also help if you can post some signs around your community.Place a sticker on each of your items labeling the price. Have you or your parents manage a money box filled up with change to give your customers. For more information about how to set up a garage sale, see: How to Have a Garage Sale.
You can also ask your parents to help you sell old items online. Sites like Ebay allow you to sell items for discounted prices, while customers can bid the price to go even higher.
If you have really valuable items, taking them to consignment shops might be a good idea too. They tend to stick you with a lower price than you might desire, but it is a quick way to make a buck. Just make sure you go in knowing the value of the item beforehand. Ask your parents to help you research prices online.

, You might be a very good painter, or perhaps you are great at needlepoint. Creating collages are always fun and creative, as well as shadow boxes. The possibilities when it comes to crafts are nearly endless. You can sell them individually, or as a group. Keeping them at a lower price will allow you to sell more quickly.Bring your crafts to local church bazaars, or the local farmer's market. This will introduce your product to the community, and get people talking.
Have your parents post your items to sites like Etsy and Pinterest so that you can advertise to a broader audience of customers.
Try selling them to your friends at school or in your neighborhood. They will love that you made them the craft and it's a unique thing to make them stand out.
For a few craft ideas to start off with, visit these sites: How to Build a Popsicle House, How to Crochet for Kids, and How to Make a Braided Paper Bracelet.

, This could be cherries, apples, oranges, apricots, raspberries, blackberries, roses, lilies, squash, tomatoes, cucumber, etc. The possibilities are nearly endless when it comes to planting and growing. First you need to set aside a plot of land in your back yard. Ask your parents where it is safe to grow plants and crops.You will then have to purchase seeds from your local plant or harvest store. Till the ground before planting your seeds. Make sure to water them every day, or when each plant needs water (check seed packaging).
As the plants and crops grow, you can sell them at a stand in front of your house, or at your local farmer's market. Ask your parents to go online and check what the going rate is for each item you wish to sell.

, Offer to donate ten percent of your monthly earnings to the school. This way you can't get in trouble, and you're still making money.

, Some things that children might like include chewing gum, candy, drinks and all different kinds of things. Just ask your principal beforehand if it is okay to sell a certain product.

, Store them in your backpack, pockets, or locker. Let's say gum is what everybody in your school wants but they aren't able to buy it. All you need to do is go to the store and buy a pack of gum.

, You might not be able to, but you are selling convenience as well as your items. Charging a little bit of profit is acceptable. If it's higher, then people will just go to the store, rather than buying from you. Say it costs 75 cents. You will have to raise the price by 10-20 cents to achieve profit, or for an example if your school has vending machines buy people soda and have them pay you back plus give the returnable can back so you make a 10 cent profit and make them pay an additional ten cents for labor since you are taking garbage off their hands.

, You should sell these to the rest and use the money obtained to repeat the previous step. If you have enough money, take higher risks, go to a wholesale store that sell things cheaper than normal stores and buy a whole box of gum instead, there may be 25 to 30 packs of gum in one box.

, Since you are well known as a young entrepreneur in your school now, you may be a target of thieves, bullies, and other students in your school. You may want to hire a trustworthy ""bodyguard"" near you so that he/she will take care of your money while you will serve the customers.

, Now that you know the whole process, be innovative in what you sell. Make the strangest item that people would ever buy. Maybe marshmallows dipped in chocolate? A pen gun? Think of something creative. Nowadays, these are the kinds of ideas the market wants.

, Find some kids that will work for free. Use them to sell the stuff. But you be the treasurer. Even though they may be good workers, you might not be able to trust them with your money.

, People will want to buy from you and you only if you have items no one else has. For instance, If you were selling baseball cards, sell the good ones that people want. Also, never sell fakes. Or if you're selling candy/gum, sell some candy from a specialty shop, or some imported candy from Japan or something.

, Never be pleased. Remember, you are making money. If someone pays you a lot of money, take it. Just make sure you are not ripping the person off really badly.

, Make sure you are keeping track of your earnings in a notebook.

, Make sure that you have fun making a little cash but not to brag about this, or else you will see a big decrease of buyers!

, If not, do not take the risk.

Decide how much money you would like to invest.,
Selling merchandise to people can be the hardest part.,
Once you have established with some people that you are selling sweets, they might come back asking for some more.

,
Ask how much money people are willing to spend if they offer to buy, and try to sell for more.,
Buy more expensive sweets to sell at higher prices when your budget increases.,
Try to get a fan base not only in your year-group, but also both the higher and lower ones.,
You should also try to record what you have sold, what profit you have made and so on.,
Sell things that you think people will want on that day (e.g if it is a boiling hot day then lemonade or water sell really well).

,
Sell separate pieces of gum from a packet.,
Sell things you will make most profit on (e.g if you buy a pack of 4 chocolates for $1 in a shop, then sell them for 50 cents each and you will make 100% profit).

,
Get supplies/stock to sell at school.,
Advertise.,
Know your friends and enemies.,
Be friendly to customers.",How to Make Money Selling Sweets," After you have done this look at different options on sweets. Let's say you have 5 dollars and you want to make 10 dollars, what do you do? You could buy 50 10-cent sweets and sell them for twenty cents, or 100 5-cent candies and sell them for 10 cents, etc. It is your choice. If you don't think that you can sell a high volume, go for sweets with greater profit and sell fewer.;
, Depending on the person they might want more sweets than someone else. Choose wisely, try not to sell to someone who will scam you.

,, Lower a bit if they aren't willing to spend as much, but try to stay in control of your prices.

, This will increase your profits.

, e.g if you're in year 10, sell to years 7,8, and 9, and also 11.

, It helps.

,, These are easy to sell, and can produce a lot of money (especially if gum is banned in school) . If you can get away with selling gum for 10 cents apiece, and a pack of gum with 5 pieces costs 17 cents, you will make 50 cents, or a net profit of 33 cents easily.

,, Go to shops like the 99c stores. They usually have good deals on sweets and they also sell big packs of sweets for cheap prices.

, Tell everyone by word and mouth about your 'business', If you make a facebook page and it all goes downhill, you'll look like an idiot! Spread the word to all your mates and tell them to tell all their mates too!

, Try not to fall out with friends who know about your 'business', rumours could break out and your business will fold like a mum doing the ironing! Keep the sweets hidden, not somewhere obvious that people (who don't particularly like you) can find and steal for their personal gain.

, Just like at restaurants, you don't see staff being rude, do you? Treat them right otherwise you could get a bad name for yourself and it won't work out!

Decide what you want to sell.,
Make the initial investment.,
Spread the word.,
Pick a place to sell your items.,
Start selling your goods.,
Track the money you make.",How to Make Money in Middle School1," Food items or crafts, such as handmade jewelry, are two great options.


Snacks, such as baked goods or beverages can be fun to make and often only require ingredients that are already in your pantry.
If you are an aspiring artist or enjoy making crafts, you can earn money by selling your handmade items. These custom made crafts also make great gifts which add to their appeal. Materials for crafts and jewelry making are often cheap and easy to buy at hobby shops.;
, If you don't have money to spend on your first batch of food ingredients or crafting materials, then ask your parents or someone else to lend you money (but be sure to pay them back).

, Let your friends and others know about your plans. Generating excitement beforehand is a great way to gather potential customers.


If you’re allowed to, you may even want to make signs to hang up at school to let as many people as possible know about your new business. Just be sure to ask a teacher for permission first.

, You could sell your items at a physical location, for example, at a local farmer’s market or even online.


If you would like to sell your goods at a farmer’s market, search online or ask in person at the market to find more information about how to become an official vendor.
Look for websites, such as Etsy, that will allow you to set up an online shop. Etsyand other websites often require parents or legal guardians to manage the account, so enlist the help of your parents if you choose this route.

, Be sure to clearly label the prices of what you’re selling and have a friendly, approachable manner to attract customers.

, One simple way to this is by writing down your income and expenses in a notebook.


Keeping track of your budget and income is essential to make sure that you are actually making money. For example, if you are making and selling jewelry, figure out how much you are spending on materials and keep that in mind when deciding how much to charge for each piece. You don’t want to end up actually losing money by charging too little!

Get a real job.",How to Make Money at Boarding School1," This might sound hard, and it is. Simple stuff like handing out flyers and brochures on your way to the shopping centre is a possibility. Just make sure that you don't put any in a box labeled ""No Junk Mail"" (see warnings for details). It has to be a quick job, as you normally can't be away from the boarding house for more than an hour or so.;
"
"
Decide what kind of work you would like to do.,
Decide what a fair asking rate would be.,
Start advertising.,
Be a hard worker.,
Ask for referrals.",How to Make Money in Middle School2," Opportunities to make money are often right in your neighborhood, from mowing people’s lawns, washing cars, dog walking, or babysitting.


Think about what your strengths are. Do you have experience watching over younger siblings? Are you an animal lover? Do you like getting out and being active? Reflecting on these kinds of questions will help you pursue a job that not only pays but is emotionally rewarding for you.

, Ask your friends or parents to find out what average rates are for each job. For example, babysitting can bring in anywhere from $10-25 per hourso be sure to do your research before telling customers! Feel free to negotiate with your customers if you feel like your services are worth more than they are offering.

, Tell your friends and parents and ask them to spread the word that you are available and looking for a certain type of work. Most people find jobs through words of mouthbut you can also reach more potential customers through other advertising means.


Printing out fliers offering your services and putting them up around your neighborhood with contact information can be a great way to reach people who might not otherwise know about your offering. You can also advertise online by posting on social media sites.

, Always be punctual, respectful, and try your best.


If you have any questions, it’s always best to ask sooner than later. For example, if you become a dog walker, make sure to ask lots of questions about the dog’s behavior so you don’t have any nasty surprises or accidents while on the job.

, After completing jobs, ask your customers if they will be willing to refer you to others. Referrals are the best way to increase your profits as people are more likely to hire you once someone else has vouched for you.

Brainstorm what your skills are.,
Help older people with technology.,
Offer to clean or organize.,
Become an event photographer.,
Offer to help advertise for a local business.,
Find an internship.,
Work as a translator.,
Advertise your skills.,
Start working.,
Ask for referrals.",How to Make Money in Middle School3," Just because you are in middle school, that doesn’t mean you don’t already have specialized skills to offer. With some creative thinking, you might discover you already have a skill you can profit from.


Write down a list of your skills, hobbies, or interests. Maybe you are an aspiring photographer, enjoy fixing broken electronics, or like to code in your spare time. Even activities that you consider to be hobbies, such as using Photoshop to edit your photos, could be a service people are willing to pay you for.
If you are feeling stuck, go and ask a parent or someone else who knows you well. They might surprise you by pointing out a skill you didn’t even notice you had.

, A lot of skills you might take for granted, such as the ability to navigate the Internet and other programs such as Word and Photoshop, are actually very difficult for older people to pick up on. You could offer to help older people learn how to use their computers more effectively or how to use certain programs for an hourly fee.

, Did you know that there are professional organizers, who work to clean or organize homes, office spaces, and more? If you are a neat and detail-oriented person, de-cluttering other people’s living spaces could be a perfect side job.

, If photography is a hobby of yours, you could offer to be an official photographer for a birthday party, wedding, or other kind of celebration. Many people hire photographers for special events and pay well for it too.


If you know any professional photographers, ask them to take you along on their next photo shoot so you can watch and learn.

, If you know how to make logos or fliers, these are great skills you could offer to help out a local business. Don’t be afraid to walk into a store and ask to talk to the manager. Be sure to emphasize what specific skills you could offer to help their business grow.

, Maybe you have a specific interest but know that you don’t have the necessary experience to find work in that area quite yet. A paid internship could be a great opportunity because, not only will you earn money, but you will also be getting paid to learn about your passion and gain valuable work experience.


Ask at your school, local businesses, or online to find internships. For example, if you’re interested in botany, you could try visiting different florists, botanical gardens, and the like to see if they would be willing to take on an intern.

, Did you grow up speaking two or more languages? If so, you’ve already got an incredible skill others have to spend years learning. You might be surprised to learn how many people need help translating bills and other documents or even in everyday conversations.

, Again, word of mouth can work wonders along with hanging up fliers and advertising online.

, Once you have found someone interested in your service, negotiate a fair rate. Ask around or check online to find out what the average going rates are.


If you are just starting out, you may want to charge less in the beginning. Getting exposure and experience are more important at the beginning stage. Once you have a satisfied customer base, you can start charging more for your services.

, Once you start getting clients, ask them for testimonials or if they would be willing to serve as references.


As a middle schooler, you may run into people who doubt your abilities because you are young. Having references will be extremely useful as they prove that you are serious about your work.
The more experience you have, the bigger your network of clients will get and eventually you may even start getting people coming to ask you for your services.

Reduce redness.,
Try fade creams.,
Use retinoids.,
Use vitamin C. Ascorbic acid, or simply vitamin C, may be an effective way to fade or even remove acne scars and can be found in something as simply as lemon juice.,
Avoid creams with vitamin E. Creams with vitamin E may actually do more harm than good.",How to Erase a Pimple Scar1," Fight the redness of a blemish by applying cortisone cream. Cortisone will help to fight inflammation and will reduce the surrounding redness of the scar, making it appear less noticeable.You will be able to buy cortisone cream without a prescription, at most pharmacies. It should cost about $10.Look for creams that are labelled as “non-comedogenic,” which means that they avoid ingredients that can clog pores, like cocoa butter, coal tar, isopropyl myristate, and pigments and dyes.Treating your scars while at the same time causing more acne is like fighting a losing battle.;
, Another tool in your arsenal is fade creams. Fade creams that contain kojic acid or arbutin will help to lighten the pigment of the blemished skin, and therefore reduce its visibility.


Such creams, again, should be available at your local pharmacy for a fairly low cost.
Be careful of hydroquinone. Hydroquinone skin fading topicals are fade creams that lighten pigments in the skin; however, they have recently fallen out of favor due to concerns about possible cancer-causing properties.

, Retinoids are topical or oral products that normalize “hyperkeratinisation,” meaning they help your skin cells slough off at a normal rate, which prevents them from clogging pores and causing acne. They also have anti-inflammatory qualities and can improve the look of the skin by promoting healing.Topical retinoids like Retin-A or Tazorac are used in the treatment of acne as well as scarring. Alpha-hydroxy acids and Beta-hydroxy acids, on the other hand, are chemical peels that remove the top layer of dead skin, revealing the newer, less blemished skin underneath.
You can usually buy retinoids in a cream or serum without a prescription.
Pregnant women should avoid them retinoids, as they are not safe for the fetus., Vitamin C not only contains antioxidants and reduces inflammation but it is essential in the production of collagen, which the body uses to heal connective tissue.You can buy specially formulated vitamin C skin creams or serums at drugstores and pharmacies.
An even simpler method is to apply lemon juice to your face with a cotton swab, after a thorough cleansing, leaving it for no longer than a half hour. You may feel some stinging or discomfort. Your skin may also dry out, so you should apply moisturizer afterward.Another variation of this home remedy is to mix lemon juice with honey and milk in a proportion of 1:2:3 and to apply it as a mask after cleansing. Remove after no more than one half hour.Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun while using lemon juice to lighten your skin. Prolonged sunlight is bad for your acne scars as it is, but with lemon juice on your skin, it's particularly bad.
Like many topical treatments, results are not immediate but regular safe use can help prevent and treat acne.

, Because it's a vitamin, we're tempted to think that it will be either beneficial or harmless. In fact, one University of Miami study reported that vitamin E treatment had no effect or worsened the appearance of scars in 90% of subjects, with improvement in only 10% of cases."

Consult your doctor.,
Consider a chemical peel.,
Undergo dermabrasion or microdermabrasion.,
Talk to your doctor about laser resurfacing.,
Consider cosmetic surgery.",How to Erase a Pimple Scar2," Many recommended treatments for pronounced acne scars must be administered by a doctor. This may seem like a hassle — why can’t you do it at home? —however, the risk and potency of these methods mean that they should always be done with proper medical supervision.


Make an appointment with a dermatologist. A specialist in skin problems, called a dermatologist, can give you informed advice on how to treat your acne scars.
If you don’t already have a dermatologist, you might make an appointment with your general practitioner and ask for a referral.

, Talk to your doctor about administering a stronger chemical peel. Using potent acid formulas, these procedures lift off the top layer or layers of skin, thereby minimizing the appearance of scars.Stronger chemical peels always need to be done under a doctor’s supervision. Depending on acne severity, skin type, and other factors, your doctor will advise a specific kind of peel, as well as give you instructions for after-care.

, “Dermabrasion” is the process of sloughing off top layers of skin with a rapidly rotating wire brush. Usually, this procedure removes blemishes on the skin surface and reduces the appearance of deeper scars.


Dermabrasion is not without risks. The procedure may can temporary redness or swelling, enlarged pores, infection, and, rarely, scarring. It can also cause changes in skin pigment for patients with darker skin.
Microdermabrasion is a lighter procedure that applies small crystals onto the top layer of skin, which are then vacuumed up, along with dead skin cells.Because the procedure only removes the top layer of skin, results are generally far less pronounced than dermabrasion.

, In laser resurfacing, the doctor uses a laser to remove the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis) and tightens the middle layer. The skin normally grows back looking smoother, usually in three to 10 days. Sometimes, multiple treatments are needed to reduce the acne scars.Laser treatments do not work for everyone, and can have unpredictable results. Doctors do not yet know why laser treatments are effective for some but ineffective for others.Many people are satisfied with the procedure, but few patients will see a 100% elimination of scars.Although it helps reduce the visibility of scars, it is almost never completely effective and it needs to be used along with other treatments.

, As a last resort, consult with a medical professional about surgery for large, deep lesions or scars. In this procedure, a doctor will use a punch excision to cut out the scar and replace it with stitching or a skin graft. Smaller lesions require only stitching, while large lesions may require a skin graft from another part of your body.Consider this option carefully and consult with your doctor before proceeding. Remember, this is a minor surgery and carries risk. It may require anaesthesia and a surgical facility and could prove quite expensive. You will also require time to heal.

Avoid exposure to sunlight.,
Don’t pick or squeeze pimples.,
Have good hygiene.,
Avoid makeup products with alcohol.,
Pursue a focused treatment plan.",How to Erase a Pimple Scar3," Exposure to excessive amounts of sunlight will cause acne scars to darken (hyper-pigmentation) while hindering the healing process — this includes tanning and sunbathing. Be careful to avoid direct sunlight, especially during peak hours in the afternoon.


Apply sunscreen (broad-spectrum SPF 30) liberally before you go out, and reapply two hours later. Try to find brands that will not clog skin pores.
Wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses for extra protection. If your scars are on your arms, neck, or back, cover those with clothing as well.

, Largely made from collagen, scars are the body's natural way of healing itself. Picking and squeezing your acne or acne scars will further irritate the skin tissue and keep it from properly healing.


Instead, wash with a gentle cleanser to get rid of the oils and dirt that cause acne. You might also try over-the-counter acne products. Look for products that have benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient.Watch what touches your skin. Keep your hair clean and swept away from your face, and avoid resting hands or objects like phones on your face.

, There is a balance between under-washing and over-washing skin. Under-washing leaves excess skin cells, oil, bacteria, and other debris on the skin, potentially clogging pores and creating blemishes. Over-washing irritates and dries the skin, contributing to excess oil production and more breakouts. Refrain from washing problem areas more than twice a day. When washing, use gentle cleansers with smooth grains and light scrubbing to exfoliate. Avoid products containing large grains, such as almond or apricot shell fragments, that will potentially damage or irritate the skin.


Showering is especially important following exercise and/or heavy perspiration to prevent bacterial growth on the skin.

Wash your hands when soiled and avoid touching your face or other problem areas. Touch can drive bacteria and debris into hair follicles, causing acne.

, Products containing isopropyl alcohol will strip the top layer of skin and dry it out. As a result sebaceous glands in the skin will produce more oil, possibly worsening or causing more breakouts.

, It is tempting to just throw anything and everything at your acne and acne scars. This, however, is usually not effective. Talk with your dermatologist and devise a targeted plan for attacking your scars.


Your plan might involve an oral antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and a fade cream. Your doctor might also prescribe something to bring your acne under long-term control.
Treat your scars with your doctor’s guidance. Most of all, be patient as your skin gets clearer.

Apply for a job at a store.,
Consider applying for a job at a restaurant.,
Work as a pizza delivery person or a caterer.,
Try doing some errands for your neighbors.,
Make crafts to sell online.,
Volunteer for medical and psychological studies.",How to Earn Money While Studying1," Most stores are open late, which will allow you to work a few hours after school. They also tend to have flexible working hours, and are almost always looking for people to work weekends. Look for stores that have a ""Hiring"" sign in the window, go inside, and ask how you can apply to work there. Some places require paper applications, while others will make you apply online. Whenever you send in an application, be sure to include a cover letter and a resume.


Your resume should include your skills, past work experience, contact information, and two non-family references (such as teachers or coaches). If you have no past work experience, try to list all of your relevant skills.
Cover letters are not absolutely necessary, but they can help you get the job. Use a cover letter to introduce yourself, explain why you want the job, and why you would be a good fit for the position.
If you are going to apply in person, be sure to dress nice and smile. Be formal and polite, but also relaxed. Also, try to speak with the store manager, especially when turning in your application.;
, Food service is especially popular for high school and college students: servers, hosts, and bartenders (though in some states you must be over a certain age to serve alcohol). The minimum wage for waiters might be less than the state-wide minimum wage, but you may make up for that with the money you earn from tips. Because of this, good customer service is important. The nicer you are, the larger your tips will be. Here is a list to get you started:


Dress nice, smile, and have good manners. Make sure to say ""thank you"" or ""thanks.""
If you are going to be late, call and over-quote the time by a few minutes.
Ask the customer how their day has been. This will show the customer that you care.
If you have an elderly or disabled customer, offer to take the order to where they want.

, Much like retail, you will have flexible work hours. And like working at a restaurant, you will earn money from tips. Be polite, on time, smile, and give great customer service.

, Chores, such as lawn mowing and shoveling snow, don't have to be just for kids. You can also offer to mow lawns, baby-sit kids and/or pets, paint fences, and so forth. Print out a few fliers with tear-away tabs on the bottom containing your contact information. Post these fliers throughout your neighborhood, especially in cafes, libraries, and parks.


Try posting your fliers where your customers will go. For example, if you want to do babysitting, post some fliers in the library or the park. If you can do painting or lawn mowing, try posting your fliers near a home improvement store.

, There are many websites out there that allow artists to sell their work. Many of these websites also offer some form of protection to both the artist and customer, in the event payment doesn't go through or something gets lost in the mail. Here is a list of things you can sell:


If you are good at knitting or crochet, you can make some scarves, hats, or arm warmers.
If you are good at drawing or painting, sell prints of your artwork. You can also offer to take requests.
If you like to sew, try making bags or laptop cases.
You can also sculpt figurines to sell as keychains, or make jewelry out of beads.

, Many research centers need participants for their studies. Sometimes they do not pay, but many times they do offer some reimbursement for your time.

Keep your money safe.,
Offer good customer service.",How to Create a Business at School," The first thing you need to do is figure out what your peers want to purchase. This can include a wide variety of things. In order to do this, spend some time observing what your friends and peers buy, what is popular, and what people want. Consider making a list of popular items.


Clothes.
Food.
Games, toys, or collectables.
Information like study guides.
Services like tutoring or dog walking.;
, Now that you’ve got an idea of what your peers would like to purchase, you need to figure out what they can and will buy from you. Needless to say, monetary constraints might be an issue. While some of your potential customers might have their own money saved up – from allowances, odd jobs, or other sources – many of them will probably be relying on money from their parents or financial aid if they’re in college.

, Knowing the resources of your potential customers will help inform your choice of goods or services (and help set your prices). You should consider a number of things when you picking and pricing your goods and services:


A low price means more potential customers.
A larger customer base means higher profits at a lower margin.
If you do pick a higher price point or more premium goods or services, make sure that the margin or markup is high enough to make it worth the fact that you’ll be relying on a much smaller pool of potential customers., You’ve got an idea of what people want, you know what your peers can spend, now you just need to narrow down the list of what you could sell. When doing this, you need to consider a few factors:


Going with a high volume, low margin product. This might include candy, food, or similar items. These are items that you won’t make too much money on, but that people will buy repeatedly from you, possibly several times a week.
Picking a low volume, high margin product. This could include tennis shoes, collectables, or clothes. These are items you’ll only sell a few of, but you’ll make decent money selling them.
Selling a number of things that are “hot.” There might be a new toy, game, or electronic that everyone wants for Christmas but is sold out in your area. If you have the ability and resources, you can travel to a neighboring city and purchase these products there. Then, at home, you can resell them to people at school.
Offering a service, like tutoring or something similar, that will gain you reliable and repeat customers., Most people today know about the success story of Facebook. Facebook represents possibly the most successful business that was started at a school. Consider embracing this type of innovation in order to create a successful business.


Don’t limit yourself to just selling products out of your backpack.
Consider selling information, like notes, test-tips, or similar services.
Consider creating a webpage that offers a novel service if you’re in a school that is large enough., Now that you’ve identified your market and you know what you want to sell, you need to make sure it’s actually legal and permissible to do so before you do anything else.


If you’re offering a good or service on a college campus, you should contact the appropriate authority on campus to see if you can exchange goods or services on campus.
Consider advertising at school, but exchanging money for goods or services elsewhere. This might enable you to get around any rules or regulations your college or school might have.
Make sure you don’t need a business license to operate. In many places, you can do a certain amount of business (under a certain dollar figure) without actually having to apply for a business license. However, if your business is successful and you want to expand, you might need to apply for a license.

, Do a little forecasting of how much you might sell. You want to be able to have some sort of idea of the product volume or amount of services you can actually sell. This will give you a better idea of how much product you need to have in stock and how you will need to allocate other resources.


If you’re selling a product, make sure you have enough on hand to meet daily or weekly demand without investing too much money in stock that you might not sell if your business fails.
You should be very cautious at first before you know the market and specific demand for your product. Don’t over invest – you might wind up eating those 500 candy bars instead of selling them.
If you’re offering a service, like tutoring or mowing lawns, you need to figure out the maximum amount of time you can devote to your business. You definitely have other obligations, so don’t over-extend yourself.
If you think you’ll be booked up right away, consider hiring someone else to share the work with., Now that you’ve identified your market and thought a bit about what you’ll be selling, you need to decide on price points for your goods or services. This is important because you want to be able to actually sell a product or service while making a profit.


Price your product or service competitively with others who offer the same product or service.
If you think your product or service is better, price it somewhat higher, but make sure you can communicate to customers why your product or service is better than that of the competition.
Keep cost and profit in mind., When it comes to purchasing the product or products you’ll be selling, you need to make sure you pay wholesale pricing rather than retail pricing. You'll be selling at retail, so you don't want to pay retail for your product. Otherwise, you’ll be paying too much and your potential profits will disappear before you’ve sold anything. Consider:


Compiling a list of potential vendors for the product you want to buy, then calling them to see who sells cheaper.
Traveling outside your city to buy your products at wholesale pricing.
Ordering your products from an internet wholesaler., Your ""lead time"" -- the time in between needing and ordering goods and the actual time you'll acquire them -- is very important. If you get a good grasp of your lead time, you'll always have enough product to satisfy demand at any given moment., If you’ve chosen to offer a service instead of selling actual goods, then you need to prepare your service before you do anything else. There are a number of things you need to do to prepare your service. Consider:


Practice offering your service to someone. If you’ll be tutoring, tutor a friend a couple of times so you’ve worked out the kinks in your tutoring approach. If you’ll be offering dog walking or lawn care services to your peers parents, practice those services before you even have your first customer.
Make sure you’ve sat down and thought about all the questions potential customers might have about your service. You don’t want to be left not being able to answer a question from a potential customer.
If you have one, check out your website and test it for kinks. If you’re doing something web-based, make sure you’ve tested your website several times before opening it to the public. Invite all of your friends and family on to the website as testers. Chances are, they’ll find something you might not have thought about., Now that you’ve got your products and services set up and you have price points and everything, you need to go about the task of finding customers. After all, customers are going to make your business. Without them, your business is a failure. There are several things you can do to find customers.


Print off flyers and pass them out to your friends and peers at school. Make sure that this is okay with the school authorities before you do this.
Put up posters or flyers on designated advertising boards at your school or on your campus. Often times, schools and colleges will designate certain areas for the posting of advertisements. Post your flyers there.
Advertise your business through word of mouth. Tell everyone about the service your offering or the product you’re selling. After all, it might be your friends and the people you see every day who wind up making up your customer base. Rely on these people, and ask them to tell others they know.
Promote your business on social media. Use social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to advertise your business. This will probably help you get the word out the quickest, especially if you have friends promoting your business for you., Make sure you carry around product samples or a flyer explaining your service and prices with you wherever you go. You never know when you’ll run into someone who is interested in your business. Be able to show and explain your product or service in a quick and concise manor. Also, be able to explain why they should do business with you without sounding pushy or overbearing.

, Chances are, due to the nature of your business, you’ll be accepting cash from your customers. As a result, you’re going to need to be able to provide change. This is important, because if you don’t have change, you might lose business or lose money.


Go to the bank and get plenty of cents, quarters, dimes and nickels.
You don't want to be given a $5 bill, and not have the change.
To avoid the problem of change, try to price your product in a way that will make it easier for people to pay. Avoid selling a candy bar for 95 cents when you can charge a dollar. Don’t sell something for $4.35 when you can sell it for $4 or $4.50.

, Keeping your money safe is also keeping you and your livelihood safe. You need to make sure that your money is secure at all times and that people don’t know how much money you carry at any given time. There are a number of things you can do to minimize your risk of a bully taking your money or you being robbed by someone randomly:


Never carry more money than you need on any given day.
If you’ve had a lucrative morning, lunch period, or afternoon, deposit excess money somewhere safe if you can. At the very least, separate larger bills from smaller bills and put them somewhere different than where you keep your change.
Don’t keep your change in your wallet or purse. Make sure you have something specific, like a money pouch that you use to hold the money you’ll need for your business.
Don’t flash your money around or tell your friends or anyone else how much you make every day. The less people know, the better.
If someone tries to rob you, don’t fight them. It’s better to lose a day’s worth of money than to have a trip to the hospital or infirmary., In order to get repeat business, you need to offer the best customer service possible. After all, a happy customer is a good customer. Don’t view your customers just as sources of income, but rather as members of your community and as part of a fair exchange that you are engaging in.


Do the math on faulty products. How often do you expect to sell something that unbeknownst to you is broken or spoiled? In the course of normal business, you will definitely come across customers who will come to you wanting a refund for something that is “not right.”
If it makes economic sense, offer your customers a replacement and a refund. This will make them extremely happy, and chances are they’ll come back to you again.
Always apologize and never blame the customer. Arguing or being rude to your customer will just lose you business.
Accept feedback and ask for feedback. No matter whether your customer is offering negative or positive feedback, you should accept it and try to internalize it. Also, if you have regular customers, ask them for feedback about how you can better serve them.

Try applying for a job at your college.,
Sell non-perishable food to other students.,
Offer private, peer tutoring.,
Try to get a scholarship or grant.,
Consider getting an internship.",How to Earn Money While Studying2," Many colleges offer jobs to students, including jobs at the student bookstore and cafeteria, tutoring jobs, and office work. Visit your school's website, and go to the careers section. There should be a section for student employment. Here are some other types of jobs you might find at your college:


Working as a food server in the dining hall.
Helping out with building and campus maintenance.
Working as a receptionist in a residence hall or office, or a tour guide in the admissions office.
Helping with research or working as a lab assistant.

, You can keep packaged snacks, such as chips, granola bars, bottled water, and soda inside your locker. The next time someone mentions that they forgot to pack a snack and how hungry they are, offer to sell them a snack out of your locker. Word will get around, and you may soon find classmates waiting outside your locker for snacks. Try to keep your prices lower than the cafeteria, but don't keep them too low or you won't be making any money.


Consider buying the food when it is on sale, or in bulk; the prices will be cheaper and you will make some profit.
Try to sell stuff that your classmates won't be able to buy in the cafeteria.
Keep in mind, however, that this might get you in trouble with the school.

, This will allow you to set your own hours, location, and wage. Print off a few fliers and post them around your school. If your school has a message board, be sure to post a flier there as well.


You can also print and sell class notes and study material, but make sure that the notes are very good and clear.

, By getting good grades, you may be able to get some money from your school. Some scholarships and grants can only be applied towards tuition, but some will arrive to you in the form of a check; you can do whatever you want with that money.

, Not all internships are paid, but they will give you valuable experience that you can use when applying for jobs after graduating from college. Most internships will also count towards school credit and can be used in the place of some classes.

Treat your pimples soon after they appear.,
Avoid too much sun exposure.,
Use over-the-counter skin-lightening agents.,
Use over-the-counter exfoliating compounds.,
Use natural plant-based products.,
Consult with your doctor about prescription retinoids.,
Ask about prescription antibiotics.,
Consider laser treatment.,
Consider steroid injections as a last resort.",How to Fade Blemishes," Dermatologists don't recommend letting acne run its course, because without treatment, dark spots, blemishes and permanent scars can appear on the skin as the acne clears.As such, address any acne soon after it appears on your face or any other exposed area you don't want blemishes. However, don't prick or squeeze pimples or try to extract blackheads forcefully or prematurely. Instead, keep the pores of your skin clean with cleansing soap or facial wash and wait until the white-headed pustule (dead white blood cells) or blackhead (compacted oil and dirt) comes closer to the surface of the skin. Once that occurs, gently exfoliate it away with a mildly abrasive moistened facial pad, or carefully squeeze it with the sides of your clean fingers or sanitized metal tool designed for the task.


Try an over-the-counter facial wash containing 2% salicylic acid or 5-10% benzoyl peroxide. You can also try baking soda and lemon for gentle and natural exfoliation and blemish fading treatment.
Try to get all of the pus or blackhead material out of the pore, as it will heal quicker.
Disinfect the inflamed pore immediately afterwards with some antiseptic solution, preferably one that is alcohol-free.
Don't squeeze pimples or blackheads with your fingernails because the surrounding tissue can get damaged and infected — a major cause of post-acne blemishes.
Many dermatologists recommend not popping or squeezing your own blemishes. Instead, they suggest leaving it to a skin specialist.;
, Sun block is one of the most important measures to prevent acne as well as fade the related blemishes. Radiation from the sun not only irritates acne in some cases, but it can sunburn sensitive tissue associated with inflamed or healing pimples, causing discoloration (hyper-pigmentation, the darkening of the skin) and leading to long-term blemish marks.Hyper-pigmentation of the skin occurs due to increased production of melanin, which is responsible for the skins pigment or color. Aside from sun exposure, other common causes of skin hyper-pigmentation include pregnancy, hormone imbalance, certain skin diseases and side effects from taking certain medications.


To combat sun damage and hyper-pigmentation, apply an oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF of at least 15) on your exposed skin, especially your face.
The best sunscreens to use to protect from darkening blemishes are those that contain either titanium or zinc oxide.
To further protect your face, considered wearing a wide-brimmed hat when in the sun, particularly at the beach or near bodies of water.
Keep in mind that some acne medications and antibiotics may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn. So if you're on medication, consult with your doctor or pharmacist to determine whether you need to be more proactive in avoiding sun exposure.

, In addition to trying to prevent blemishes, there are many types of chemicals that can help fade them. For examples, hydroquinone and 8-hydroxyquinoline are both skin lightening agents that can quickly fade acne marks, dark age spots and hyper-pigmentation.Although applying over-the-counter creams with 2% hydroquinone can be effective for fading blemishes fairly quickly (within a few weeks), it can also cause skin sensitivity and lighten normal skin surrounding the blemish. Topical 8-hydroxyquinoline is a good alternative to hydroquinone as it works by targeting pigment clusters and helps lighten blemishes and dark spots without whitening or fading surrounding skin.


Topical hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin in order to quicken the lightening process.
Benzoyl peroxide also bleaches skin, but it has many other properties that help combat blemishes too (see below).
A more natural and inexpensive lightening agent for blemishes is regular 3% hydrogen peroxide, which is widely available in pharmacies. Hydrogen peroxide is also effective at killing bacteria and preventing skin infections, but be prepared for a slight stinging sensation when you apply it.
Some creams contain alpha and beta hydroxy acids which can also help to even skin tone and lighten blemishes.

, In addition to whitening agents, another way to fade blemishes is to exfoliate (remove) the dead skin layers covering the hyper-pigmented mark. Exfoliating agents include manual exfoliants such as walnut shell, hydrated silica, or sand and chemical exfoliants such as alpha hydroxy acids, which remove dead skin cells and encourage new cell turnover.As such, the blemish discoloration fades and becomes a little less noticeable each time you exfoliate and reveal newer, clearer skin. Benzoyl peroxide also removes dead skin cells, as well as kills bacteria and removes excess oil from skin pores. Keep in mind that these compounds cause dead skin to be shed from the blemish and very little or no physical scrubbing is needed. Consequently, it's best to apply these products (as ointments, lotions or creams) in the evening before bedtime and let them work overnight.


Benzoyl peroxide products are available in strengths from 2.5% - 10% and may also sting upon skin application. Common side effects include dry skin, scaling and redness.
Alpha hydroxy acids are synthetic compounds derived from citrus fruit. The two alpha hydroxy acids used in nonprescription acne products are glycolic acid and lactic acid.Glycolic acid peel can be helpful in fading blemishes.
Jessner peel is one of the best treatments to fade blemishes. It generally contains salicylic acid, lactic acid, and resorcinol. It can also decrease fine lines, wrinkles and soften acne scars. Salicylic acid and sulfur compounds are also exfoliators which clean pores and prevent them from getting clogged. Nonprescription salicylic acid products are available in strengths from 0.5% - 5%, whereas sulfur compounds are typically combined with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.
Even when combining compounds that have numerous helpful properties (benzoyl peroxide with salicylic acid, for example), it can still take between 4-8 weeks to see significant fading of blemishes., Aside from pharmaceutical products, there are numerous herbal or plant-based remedies that have a well-established track record for being able to combat skin blemishes. These natural alternatives can sometimes prevent blemishes (due to antibacterial and immune stimulating properties) or fade existing marks and spots either by lightening the skin, exfoliating it and/or reducing inflammation. Commonly used natural remedies for blemishes include: tea tree oil extract, lemon / lime extracts, azelaic acid cream, licorice root extract, raw (unripe) papaya fruit, green tea extract and aloe vera gel.Apply these products directly to your blemish, preferably at night, and give it a few weeks before making a judgement on effectiveness.


For active (acute) and inflamed blemishes, aloe vera may be your best bet because of its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, as well as its powerful ability to heal skin.Anecdotal reports suggest that rubbing a piece of raw potato on your skin blemishes 2-3x daily may reduce hyper-pigmentation. It's certainly safe for most people, cheap and worth an experiment if you're on a budget.
Mixing together natural compounds which have complimenting properties is a smart idea. Try mixing raw honey (antiseptic properties), with fresh squeezed lemon juice (contains natural whitening acids and vitamin C) and turmeric powder (strong anti-oxidant with anti-inflammatory properties). Apply in the evening, cover with a hypoallergenic bandage overnight and wash off in the morning. Remember, before using any new skin product, even if it is entirely natural, it is wise to do a patch test first.

, Retinoid medications are derived from vitamin A and include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage).Retinoids work on blemishes by increasing cell turn-over and by preventing clogging of skin pores and hair follicles. Retinoid drugs come as creams, gels and lotions (in various strengths), and are applied in the evening beginning with 3 times per week, then daily as your skin becomes accustomed to it.


Research suggests that tazarotene (0.1% cream) may be most effective for treating pustules (white heads).Tretinoin is recommended to help reverse photo-damage or age spots from the sun, as well as freckles.
Retinoids should never be combined with products that contain benzoic acid — the side effects are compounded and can exacerbate the irritation of skin.
Retinoids make your skin susceptible to sunburn, so you will need to wear sunscreen and consider wearing a wide-brimmed hat when using these products.

, Bacterial growth within skin pores is a primary cause of white-headed pimples or pustules. As such, the application of topical antibiotic creams or ointments can be helpful in treating acute inflamed pimples or longer-term blemishes that still are triggering an immune response.In many cases, when topical antibiotics kill bacteria within an inflamed pore, the redness of the blemish reduces. Topical antibiotics are often combined with retinoids during the first few months of treatments — sort of a 1-2 punch for skin blemishes. When combined together, the topical antibiotic is applied in the morning and the topical retinoid in the evening.


Topical antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide in order to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.Combo products include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, Acanya) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin).
Oral antibiotics (in pill form) are often prescribed for moderate-to-severe acne, with the most common type being tetracyclines, such as minocycline and doxycycline.
Keep in mind that antibiotic use (topical and oral) for acne makes your skin much more sensitive to sun exposure and (perhaps ironically) more susceptible to other types of blemishes such as sun spots, freckles and age spots.
Topical and oral antibiotics are only used for short-term treatment and cannot be used long-term or very frequently since you may develop resistance to their effects.

, A variety of light-based therapies have been tried on different types of skin blemishes with well-documented success. The type of laser and dose that's most effective depends on the cause of the blemish, so consult with a dermatologist or aesthetician to get the most current advice. Some forms of laser therapy target the bacteria that cause acne inflammation, whereas other types either remove the top layer of skin (epidermis) or heat the underlying dermis layer of the skin and cause new tissue to form — often referred to as laser resurfacing.After several treatments, acne blemishes and scars typically appear far less noticeable.


Some types of light therapy, such as intense pulsed light (IPL) or Laser Genesis, are usually done in a doctor's office under the supervision of a dermatologist, whereas other types are done in beauty salons or can be purchased for home use (such as blue-light therapy).
Not all light therapy is hot or produces burning sensations; some are pulsed (less heat) or cold lasers that produce no heat.
Apply numbing cream to your blemish at least 45 minutes prior to getting hot laser therapy, as it will greatly reduce the discomfort, and don't forget to always wear protective glasses with any type of light therapy.
Potential side effects of laser therapy include pain, temporary redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight.

, For more serious and deeper acne blemishes, such as nodular and cystic lesions, injections of corticosteroid drugs directly into the lesions can significantly improve the appearance without the need for invasive extraction.Corticosteroids (such as prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone) are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that reduce swelling, redness and pain. However, the needle itself may cause redness and scarring where it pierces the skin, so injections are usually only reserved for large, deep and painful acne-related blemishes, cysts or carbuncles.


Side effects of corticosteroid injections include thinning of the skin, lighter skin pigmentation around the blemish and the appearance of small blood vessels on the treated area.
Repeated use of corticosteroid injections can reduce immune functions and lead to greater risk of infections.

Use a color corrector.,
Use high-end concealers.,
Apply more intense coverage.",How to Conceal Red Spots on Your Face1," When choosing a concealer, opt for those that are green-tinted; green is the opposite of red, which is why a green concealer offsets and neutralizes red spots.Apply the concealer to the area you wish to neutralize and blend the edges for an even finish
Make sure to work with thin layers of the product. It will be just as difficult to cover massive amounts of green as it is to cover the redness.
Once you apply the product, go over with your regular foundation. Or apply the foundation first and then the concealer (see next section for full steps).;
, These type of concealers cover up red spots resulting from acne breakouts or scars or even skin conditions, such as rosacea.Apply the concealer directly over red skin imperfections and blend together to create evenness.

, Applying a color corrector under your foundation can mask red spots and other hyperpigmentation marks. This technique will lighten the dark area and improve an uneven skin tone.Lightly, dab the corrector to the discolored area.

, Inexpensive products rarely help conceal large areas of red spots. These include concealers that are thin and runny and while they may hide small imperfections, they might not disguise darker spots. High-quality concealers, such as the Dermablend Cover Creme True Beige, are heavier and made to cover darker spots, acting both as a concealer and a foundation at the same time.Take a small amount of the product and heat it between your fingertips to soften.
Apply directly over imperfection.

Put together a garage sale.,
Use the internet to sell items.,
Sell home-made crafts and jewelry.,
Purchase and re-sell snacks and supplies at school.",How to Make Money As a Child2," If you live in a fast-paced town or city, take advantage of this by setting up a small stand or shop. Offer convenient goods that are easy to take on the go.Consider the climate. Spring and summer would be best to offer iced tea, lemonade, or cold water bottles paired with fruit, ice-pops, or granola. Where as fall and winter would be better for hot cocoa or coffee with donuts and bagels.
Use the time of day to your advantage; a lot of people forget to eat breakfast or need an after-work snack during traffic.

, Make some extra cash by selling stuff that accumulates around the house. Start with your own belongings such as books, video games, toys, and clothing.

Then, advertise the garage sale with flyers around the neighborhood or an ad in the newspaper., Times have a changed, and you have many online websites that do a lot of the work for you when it comes to selling your things. Some websites specialize in specific items. A site such as Etsy would be best for antiques, jewelry, clothing, and hand-crafted items; where as Ebay or Craigslist would be better for collectibles, DVDs, video games, cell phones, and computers. Be sure to consult with a parent or older sibling when considering uncommon websites; some sites have ill-intentions with peoples' goods and money.

, If you have an artistic or crafty side, put it to use to earn some extra cash.

Recycle different materials.",How to Make Money As a Child3," Maintaining a yard is important for people, but finding the time to do so can be difficult. If you are old enough to do the maintenance around your own yard, offer to do work for neighbors at a reasonable price (either hourly rates or a flat-rate for duties). Fortunately, the different times of the year will leave various jobs and tasks for you to do.Rake the leaves and clean gutters during fall.
Shovel snow in the early mornings during winter.
Water and mow the yard during the hot seasons.

, Sitting services for your family and neighbors often means watching after people, pets, and things. Each form of sitting takes a lot of responsibility and experience that usually starts at home. Pick the sitting that you have the most comfort and experience with.If you have all the responsibilities of the family pet, offer pet sitting to neighbors, especially during holidays; you can also help with taking dogs for walks.

, Assisting others with house work can earn you some cash. Check with neighbors who are very busy to see if they'd be willing to pay you for services; anything from house cleaning to taking out the trash can be a good help to others. Also, check to see if any elderly individuals live in your neighborhood. Many elderly need extra help for very common tasks such as checking the mail, cleaning dishes, or tiding up around the house.Try to be creative with the types of services to offer (buying groceries, repainting rooms, hanging up pictures, preparing meals, decorating for holidays).

, Trying to earn cash can also mean helping out the environment. Even though some cities have a regular recycling pickup for aluminum cans, several other metals and items can be sold to recycling yards. First, figure out what you wish to recycle. You can collect different metals such as copper, brass, and steel. Some companies buy used batteries and computer parts, too. Once you figure out which good or goods to recycle, get your services out to people. Go door to door, put up signs, hand out flyers, set up bins at school, or create a website. "

, Foundation is used to cover up uneven skin tones, red spots, or acne lesions. You may apply concealer before your foundation but adding foundation first allows you to really see where you need to use the concealer.Prep your skin with a primer to smoothen everything so that the base glides on and doesn’t settle into lines, dry patches, or rough areas.
Let primer dry before adding foundation.
Apply a dime-sized amount of foundation to your hands and use your fingers to dot it on your forehead, nose, and chin.
Smooth the product all around, generally working from the center outward.

Use vigorous, yet gentle, circular motions to apply to the skin.
Rinse well.
To remove heavy makeup, repeat or use with a clean, wet washcloth.

, AHA (alpha hydroxy acids) comes from fruits, nuts, milk or sugars. They break down the bonds between cells, allowing for easier exfoliation. BHA or salicylic acid is found in willow tree bark, wintergreen oil, or sweet birch. Salicylic acid is able to penetrate the oils in the skin and clear out follicles of excess debris and skin cells. It is also a potent anti-inflammatory agent that reduces redness.Apply a dime-sized amount over the entire face but avoid direct contact with the eyes and lips.
Do not rinse.Use once or twice daily after cleansing and toning.
For daytime use apply a sunscreen rated SPF 25 or higher

Pay close attention to how your skin responds and adjust, use accordingly.If sensitization occurs (redness, flaking, tenderness, or drying of skin), reduce frequency of use or mix one pump of the retinol treatment with your favorite serum or PM moisturizer.

, You may also want to use skin lighteners, such as tumeric, licorice, or lemon juice, to reduce the appearance of red spots. However, always use home remedies with the understanding that there is little scientific evidence to support their effectiveness.Turmeric contains a substance called curcumin that lowers the rate of melanin production. Mix turmeric powder with lemon and cucumber juice and apply to the skin. Leave in for 15 minutes and rinse off.Mix a small amount of licorice extract powder, which contains a compound called Glabridin that has skin-lightening effects, in distilled water. Soak a cloth into the mixture and apply it to the red spots.Apply freshly-squeezed lemon juice on the skin with a cotton ball. You can also mix lemon, lime and grapefruit juice..

, Research shows that red or brown discolorations respond well to a series of Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatments. Your dermatologist would perform this method.Another option is a monthly BHA or AHA peel performed by a cosmetic dermatologist.

Use salicylic acid products.,
Discuss antibiotics with your doctor.,
Try benzoyl peroxide products.,
Consider oral contraceptives.,
Cleanse your face.",How to Dry Out a Pimple1," Topical retinoids are gels or creams that you apply to your face as an acne treatment. They are an effective treatment for reducing acne. These medications require a prescription from your doctor or dermatologist.You will need to apply the medicine three times per week at first and then work up to applying it once per day as your skin adjusts to it.
The medicine will prevent your hair follicles from becoming clogged, which is a common cause of acne.;
, Salicylic acid is one of the best products to help treat acne and dry out pimples. It helps to dry out the oils that cause the pimples. Look for products that have salicylic acid in them, including over the counter facial products.


These products may be concentrated between 0.5% to 5%. Common side effects of salicylic acid include stinging at the site of application and skin irritation., If your acne is really red and irritated, then your doctor may decide to prescribe an antibiotic. Antibiotics are often combined with other medications such as retinoids or benzoyl peroxide products to help clear up and prevent infections caused by acne.Make sure that you use the antibiotic exactly as instructed by your doctor. Improper use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistant infections.

, Benzoyl peroxide is a substance that eliminates the bacteria on the face that causes acne. It also helps remove excess oils as well as dead skin on your face, which will dry out the pimples quickly. Over the counter products have benzoyl peroxide in concentrations of 2.5% to 10%. Look for one with a concentration that matches the severity of your pimple.


In addition to drying out the pimple, benzoyl peroxide may cause burning, scaling, stinging, and irritation on your skin where you apply these products., If you are female, then you can also consider taking an oral contraceptive to help dry out pimples and fight acne. Oral contraceptives are often effective at treating acne, but talk with your doctor about the potential side effects of these medications.If you already take birth control, then consider asking your doctor about switching to one that will help with acne as well, such as Yaz, Ortho-Tricyclen, or Estrostep.

, Although it is not a medical treatment option, it is important to wash your face twice a day. This will help dry out the pimples you have as well as prevent any more from cropping up.


Always use gentle pressure when you cleanse your face to avoid hurting your skin.

This can be either physical beauty or your personality traits. Do you like your figure or your hair? Are you smart or funny? If you're having difficulty thinking of good things about yourself to focus on, ask your friends, family or teachers what they like about you. A question such as ""What do you think my best features are?"" can give you a great place to start focusing on the positive.;
, While it may sometimes seem that you're the only one with pimples, the truth is that a majority of people deal with acne at some point. 70-87% of teenagers have acne in some form or another,and many adults also get pimples.Acne is the most common skin problem in the US., Too frequently, we are our own worst critics. Unfortunately, the severity of both self-criticism and acne tend to peak at around the same time during adolescence. Remember that even though your acne may look horrible to you, most people may not even notice. Think about your friends who also have acne. Do you think they look ugly? Probably not!

, There's a good chance that your acne will eventually go away. Most people only get acne during adolescenceand it generally clears up by the time they reach their twenties. While this can seem like an eternity, telling yourself that it's a passing problem can help it seem like less of a big deal. Think about the fact that your acne will probably clear up around the same time that your parents will stop being able to tell you what to do.


Even if you are an adult with acne, it's rarely a permanent situation. Some people's acne just takes longer to clear than others'. Even if your pimples don't go away completely, most people find that their severity decreases over time. Additionally, you may find that certain treatments are more effective than they were when you were a teenager.
If you are a transgender adult on testosterone therapy, keep in mind that it is very common for you to start getting pimples or for existing acne to get worse. Just like acne during puberty, it sometimes clears up on its own over time., Acne is not your fault. It's a normal part of life that affects almost everyone at some point. There are many mythsabout what causes acne, often blaming poor diet. However, there is no solid evidence linking foods like chocolate to breakouts.While some basic steps can help minimize acne, in reality there is little you can do to prevent pimples other than tackling the problem once it occurs.

, There is a widespread idea that makeup causes acne. While some sources dispute this,it pays to be careful with anything you put on your face. Any makeup which is ""non-comedogenic"" is always a good bet. This means it will not clog your pores. Look for makeup labeled as ""hypoallergenic."" Things to avoid are:


Thick or solid makeup.
Greasy or oil-based makeup.
Anything that you're allergic to. If you have allergies, check the product's ingredient list., Always apply makeup gently and lightly. It doesn't need to be rubbed into your skin, just onto it. Apply a primer, foundation and pressed powder, in that order. If your pimples still show through, you can also use a concealer.It may be helpful to pick a tinted concealer to help offset the red of the pimple. Depending on your skin tone, yellow, brown or green can be good options.

, Makeup doesn't always conceal acne perfectly, especially when it comes to big breakouts. Do your best to avoid drawing the eye to your acne.


If you have pimples near your mouth or chin, avoid bold lip colors.
If your acne is worst around your cheeks, you may want to avoid bronzers or contouring. However, pink-toned blushes may help pimples to blend in better.
If you have a bad breakout on your forehead, stick to neutral eye shadow and avoid bold eyebrows.

, While there is some debate over whether wearing makeup can cause acne, forgetting to take it off most certainly does. Be sure to scrub your face every night before bed.


Many dermatologists recommend using exfoliating wipes, which remove both makeup and dead skin cells that can clog pores.Also, because they're easy to use, disposable wipes are more likely to get you to stick to this nightly ritual.

, Makeup brushes and applicators should be cleaned at least once per week. These tools harbor bacteria and yeast, which can infect and irritate your skin.If you wear makeup infrequently, it's best to clean your brushes after each use.

, If your acne is making you afraid to have your picture taken, remember that pimples can be easily removed with digital image editing software. It may seem like celebrities never get pimples, but the reality is that their imperfections are usually airbrushed out. Some things you can do to prevent circulation of unedited photos from a special event are:


Offer your camera for the pictures, and then edit the photo before you send it out to others.
Build up a reputation as a person who takes good pictures and makes sure everyone has a copy soon after the event.
Call in the help of close friends and family to get the picture edited before it's distributed, or ask the photographer if they are willing to help.
If you don't have a photo-editing program, you can download an open-source version free online. Because touching up blemishes is a very common use for such software, there are many tutorials online on how to do this.

, If you don't want people to notice your acne, try making other aspects of your appearance noteworthy. Some possibilities are:



Put your hair up in an elaborate way.
Dress nicely.
Make bold fashion choices.

, It may be tempting to pick at or pop pimples, but this always leads to more redness and a longer healing time. You should also avoid scrubbing your face too hard, as this can cause more inflammation.Downplay the visibility of your acne by not making it any redder.

, If your acne is seriously affecting your self-confidence enough to cause depression or anxiety, you should talk to your doctor about getting it treated. You've probably already tried over-the-counter remedies in the past, but a dermatologist can prescribe medication that is likely to be more effective. There are generally three major medical treatment types that may be used in combination:



Antibiotics: These drugs kill bacteria and help to reduce inflammation. Antibiotics can be topical (applied directly to your skin) or oral (taken as a pill).

Topical ointments: Common topical medications include retinoids (the most popular of which is known by the brand name Retin-A), benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid. Even though some of these can be found over-the-counter, their prescription strength versions tends to be more potent.

Hormone therapy: Because acne can be caused by a hormonal imbalance, women may choose to take hormonal birth control and/or antiandrogens (testosterone blockers)., These are generally done in combination with prescription drug treatments. While potentially effective, they also tend to be more expensive and time consuming. Popular procedures include:



Light therapy: Using lasers and other types of antibacterial light, these therapies can kill the bacteria that are partially responsible for acne.

Chemical peels: These are used to exfoliate and smooth your skin. Dermatologists use chemical peels that are much stronger than those available at your local pharmacy.

Direct acne removal: If you experience large cysts that don't go away with medication, your dermatologist may choose to drain them. Unlike when you pop your pimples yourself, your dermatologist will perform this procedure using sterile instruments that will prevent scarring., You may also want to try some less common home therapies. If you have trouble finding these products at your regular pharmacy, try a looking in a local health foods store.


Turmeric, the yellow spice mostly known for its use in curries, has been used in folk medicine for centuries. Recently, modern science has revealed its potential as an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agent, marking it as a likely acne treatment.Try making a turmeric face mask at home.

Tea tree oil is known to possess antimicrobial properties and is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for a variety of skin problems, including acne.It can be used as a spot treatment or added to a face mask. There are also tea tree oil soaps and shampoos available.
Topical green tea extract has also shown promise as a potential acne treatment.You can buy commercially available green tea lotions and face scrubs, or you can make your own treatments at home.

, Popularly known by its brand name ""Accutane,"" isotretinoin is a potent drug that often completely clears up acne.Due to its common and sometimes severe side-effects, dermatologists typically wait to prescribe this drug until all other reasonable methods have failed. Common side effects include dry skin, joint pain, and frequent nosebleeds. Rare but serious side effects include changes in visionand digestive problems that can possibly lead to inflammatory bowel disease.While these usually go away after a patient has finished taking the drug, some side effects persist for years.Despite these risks, most patients are happy with the end result. Just be sure to make an informed decision when speaking with your doctor about treatment.


Under no circumstances should you take isotretinoin if you are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant. This drug causes severe birth defects.
If you live in the United States and can become pregnant, keep in mind that obtaining an isotretinoin prescription has additional hurdles. By law, you must see your prescribing physician once a month and undergo a pregnancy test. Additionally, you must agree to use two forms of birth control or pledge to remain abstinent from 30 days prior to taking isotretinoin to 30 days after your course is finished.Although the possible side-effects of depression and suicide has been widely publicized, the correlation remains controversial.Do not donate blood while on this drug."

Picking may help diminish the appearance of zits at first, but it can cause inflammation and permanent scarring.Instead of picking at your zits, use a spot treatment, such as tea tree oil.

Get a part-time job.,
Make money by sharing your knowledge and skills.,
Be a care-taker.,
Get more money at your current job.,
Earn money online.",How to Earn Extra Money1," The easiest way to earn extra money is to get a part-time job to supplement your income. Even if you only work a few hours a day or a week, a part-time job can make a big difference in your bank account. Here are some examples of part-time jobs you could do:



Deliver pizza. If you have a reliable car and are a good driver, you can make extra money by delivering pizza. You won't make a lot of money by the hour for delivering pizza, but you can earn extra cash in tips.
Wait tables. Working in the service industry is a good way to gain experience, interact with customers, and get tips.
Be a bartender. Some venues allow bartenders to be new to bar tending, or accept applications from anyone over 18. Not all bars require experience or require for you to be over 21, so it's worth checking out! Plus, in large venues where the bar isn't the main attraction, the work is laid-back, if not a little boring.
Deliver papers or phone books. Delivering papers or phone books isn't just for teenagers. Anyone can do this to make a little money and get to know his neighborhood in the process.
Be a personal shopper. Find a person who is low on time, or who has difficulty leaving the house, and offer to do his/her grocery shopping or run errands for them.
Check out the part-time jobs listed on craigslist or reputable websites that are specifically tailored for people who are looking for part-time jobs. ;
, Getting a random part-time job can be fun, but if you can get a job that allows you to make use of your skills, then you may be able to earn a bit more money than you would during an ordinary part-time job and to build your resume in the process.



Teach. If you're an expert in a certain subject, see if the community, local colleges, or even the private high schools in your area are looking for a teacher in your field. If you can pick up just one night class per week, it can make a difference in your income. Though you'll need certification to be a traditional teacher most of the time, to teach part-time you may only need a Master's degree and proof of your expertise.
Be a tutor. If you can get a private tutoring gig in a subject you know well, such as American History or Geometry, you will be able to make a fair amount of extra cash. If you had a great SAT score, try getting a tutoring job at Kaplan or Princeton Review.

It may be easier to find work if you snag a job at a tutoring company, but if you can find clients yourself, you'll be able to set your own rates and make more of a profit. To advertise your skills, you can post on craigslist, or post ads in coffee shops or other places where students are likely to be.


Be a coach in your area of expertise. If you've been helping your friends accomplish a variety of skills for free, start charging for your services. If you've been helping your friends organize their closets, buy the perfect wardrobe, or cook amazing meals, it's time to get some money for your skills. If you're uncomfortable about asking your friends for money, ask them if they know anyone who could use your skills and would be able to pay.
Be a mystery shopper. To be a mystery shopper, you just have to be a savvy shopper and be able to communicate clearly and give your honest opinion. You can find mystery shopper gigs online.

, Taking just a few hours of your week to care for your neighbor's kids, pets, or homes can make a big difference in your income. People who are going out of town and need people to take care of the things they've left behind may be willing to pay a generous amount of money for your help as well. Here's how you can make money by being a caretaker:



Baby-sit. If you're comfortable with children, spend a few hours a week or a weekend to take care of them. Spending time with children is a lot of fun. If you end up babysitting for a child who sleeps a lot, you may find some time to do work.
Be a dog-walker or a dog-sitter. Walking dogs in your neighborhood can help improve your health and give you a comfortable routine to follow. If your neighbors are out of town and need you to walk and take care of their dog, you can earn a lot of money.
Cat-sit. Though cats don't require as much maintenance as dogs, if your neighbors or someone you know are going away for a while, you can earn some money just by checking up on their cat once a day.
House sit. Some people who go on vacation for an extended amount of time don't want to leave their house unattended, so if you offer to check on their house from time to time and water their plants and do whatever else they need, you can earn some quick and easy spending money.

, If you're looking for ways to make extra money, then chances are that your current job isn't giving you the pay that you need. Though you may not be able to earn more money at your current position, there are a few things you can try.


Ask if you can take on more hours at your job, whether you want to convert part-time work to full-time work, or just to work overtime.
Talk to your boss about getting a promotion. If a promotion comes your way, you will be earning more money.
If you can only get a promotion at your current job if you get an additional degree, this can be worth pursuing, and your company may even pay for it.

, Finding jobs online is an excellent way to supplement your income. If you know where to look, you can earn money by sharing your skills from the comfort of your home. Here are a few things to try:


Teach online. Many colleges have online components. See if you can snag a job at one of them.
Use your writing skills online. If you have strong writing skills, you may be able to find work as a proofreader, freelance writer, or an editor online.
Be a blogger. Though blogging is hard work, there are companies that will pay for you to write a substantial blog on a topic you know a lot about.
Write online reviews. There are companies that will pay you to write reviews of their products.
Beware of scams. Online ""get rich quick"" schemes are incredibly common. Beware of any company that asks you to pay a fee or give out your credit card information before you get to work.

Ice the pimple to relieve some of the inflammation.,
Use eye drops.,
Use an aspirin mask.,
Dab a little bit of toothpaste on the pimple.,
Use a little bit of lemon juice.,
Apply a hot washcloth or warm tea bag to the pimple.,
Go to a grocery store pharmacy for a redness-reducing product to put on your pimple.,
Use concealer to hide the redness immediately.,
Wash your face daily with a quality face wash. Wash once in the morning and once at night.,
Drink lots of water.,
Make sure your body is getting its proper vitamins.,
Exfoliate every week.,
Find healthy outlets for your stress.",How to Remove the Redness of a Pimple," Wrap a few ice cubes in a thin, clean cloth and apply directly to acne, making sure not to put too much pressure on your skin. Too much pressure can cause the pimple to break, causing even more redness and spreading bacteria.


Cool temperatures slow local blood circulation, reducing swelling and redness in the injured tissue. Many athletes use cold treatments (ice baths, localized ice, etc.) in order to treat inflammation caused by injury.;
, Eye drops are made to remove redness. They contain tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, which helps get rid of redness (usually in the eyes).


Put a small amount of the eye drop solution on a Q-Tip and apply it gently to the pimple.
Alternately, freeze a Q-Tip that's been soaked in eye drop solution overnight. Apply it gently to the pimple. The cold will suppress the inflammation, and the tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride in the eye drops should help relieve redness.
Rubbing it on your entire face can cause more irritation. Only rub on affected areas. Don't use this technique too often or it could have an adverse effect.

, Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which is one of the main ingredients in many scrubs and topical ointments used to treat acne. Salicylic acid produces its anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing an enzyme responsible for inflammation.


Mix together crushed aspirin with a little water to form a paste. Apply to the inflamed area gently with a Q-Tip and rinse off once dry. While not an immediate fix, this will help with redness.

, Most toothpaste contains silica, which helps to dry out pimples. Silica is the same thing that is found in tiny white packets because it keeps dry food snacks, such as jerky, thereby slowing spoilage.


Cover the pimple completely with a thin film of toothpaste right before bed, let dry, and leave on overnight. Wash off in the morning.
Don't use toothpaste that has menthol or fluoride. These ingredients may worsen redness and cause more pimples to appear.

, Lemon juice contains citric acid, which could help fight acne bacteria, and studies suggest that citric acid has natural skin-lightening components, which could help with redness. Wring out a little bit of lemon juice from a lemon, soak it in a cotton ball, and apply to pimples at night.


Lemon juice will lighten your skin. It will take a long time and repeated uses for it to show, but it will lighten the pigments in your skin. If you only use lemon juice sparingly, however, and evenly over your face, it shouldn't be noticeable.
Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight after applying lemon juice. Because lemon juice tends to dry out skin, it's especially susceptible to sun damage. Apply lemon juice only at night, wash your face in the morning, and always wear noncomedogenic sunscreen.
Lemon juice may interfere with other acne medications. Like all home remedies, its effectiveness is not necessarily scientifically proven, and care should be taken using it. Talk with your doctor or dermatologist about combining lemon juice with other topical products.

, Basically, compress applied to the acne will open up the pores, potentially drawing bacteria or pus to the surface, and allow for the cleansing of oils, dirt, and dead skin.


Get water that is almost too hot to touch. On your face, it should feel a little uncomfortable at first, but pleasant after a while. Soak your washcloth in the hot water, or take your hot teabag, and hold gently over your acne for 30-60 seconds.
Follow your warm compress with a good old-fashioned face wash. Facial scrub or wash will help remove some of the oil and bacteria that was drawn out by the warm compress.

, Find an 'Immediate Response' product; a pharmacist may be able to help you.

, There are concealers that contain salicylic acid to help dry the zit out while covering it.


Green colored concealers will take the redness out of your skin, a skin tone liquid make-up or powder then needs to be applied on top of it.

, Always moisturize your face after washing, and apply topical creams afterward.


Don't scrub too hard or use a rough-surfaced implement like a loofah or washcloth to wash your face. Your hands will work just fine. When drying your face, gently pat dry with a towel (or air-dry). Don't wipe your face too vigorously with a towel.
If you've been using over-the-counter treatments and home remedies for two months and see no real improvement in your acne, go visit a dermatologist, or skin doctor.

, Many doctors recommend drinking at least 3 liters (13 cups) of water per day for men, and 2.2 liters (9 cups) of water per day for women.Because it's easy to remember, the ""8 by 8"" rule is another recommendation: Drink 8 glasses of 8 oz. water per day.


When dehydrated, we lose moisture in our skin. This means that there is less circulation to the skin area to provide essential nutrients.When your body is not properly hydrated, your skin is the first places on your body to feel the deficit.

, Studies suggest that certain vitamins can help fight against inflammation and encourage healthier skin.Here are three vitamins that you might trying to fight against acne in general and redness in particular:



Vitamin A. A lack of vitamin A in the body has been linked to inflammation in the intestines, lungs, and skin.Vitamin A is an antioxidant, meaning it helps limit damaging cells called free radicals that harm skin cells and hasten signs of aging.Foods that are rich in vitamin A: Liver (pâté), carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, squash, apricots, and cantaloupe.Vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 is water soluble, meaning you lose it as water in your body evaporates or is used.This means you should be restocking your body daily, preferably with foods rich in vitamin B6 instead of supplements. Foods that are rich in vitamin B6: Beef, turkey, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fish.Vitamin C. Vitamin C is instrumental in producing collagen, the basic building block of skin, among other things. Vitamin C also protects against harmful substances that contribute to disease and is another antioxidant. Studies suggest that it has some anti-inflammatory benefits.Foods that are rich in vitamin C: Hot chili peppers, guava, members of the citrus family (lemons, oranges, grapefruit), kale, broccoli, kiwi, and strawberries.

, Exfoliating means using a scrub or a mask to wipe away the layers of dead skin that accumulate over the course of the day or several days. Exfoliate once a week for skin that is brighter, healthier, and cleaner.


You can easily buy exfoliants at your local drugstore, or you can make simple ones at home.

, Scientists don't know exactly how stress causes acne, but they do know that there's a link: Cells that produce sebum have receptors for stress hormones, meaning that when you're stressed those sebum cells become unregulated.Sebum is the oily substance that clogs pores and leads to pimples.


Exercise. Even walking 20 minutes per day is a healthy way to exercise. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Volunteer to walk the dog. Exercise will decrease your stress levels, giving you a better chance at better skin.
Get involved in sports. Sports aren't just for jocks; there's virtually a sport out there for every kind of person. The most important thing is that you have fun, burn some energy, and give yourself a nice outlet for your stress.

Sell your stuff.,
Sell parts of your body.,
Rent your stuff.",How to Earn Extra Money2," You can also make a little extra money by selling your old things. There may be a lot of items sitting around in your house that you hardly ever think about, but which can earn you some serious cash. You shouldn't have to part with anything you love or need for sentimental reasons, but if you can get rid of some things you don't really care about, you can earn some extra cash while also doing some inadvertent clean-up around the house. Here are a few things to sell:


Sell old books you haven't seen in years to a used book store.
Sell your gold jewelry to a reputable store.
In a pinch, you can sell your stuff to a pawn shop.
Sell Girl Scout cookies or brownies, or set up a lemonade stand in your neighborhood.
You could also sell some of your old stuff in a garage sale, or online at a site like Ebay.


, This doesn't mean that you should do anything scandalous, but that you could earn good money and help the health of others if you sell your blood or other parts of your body. Here are some things to sell:


You can get money from giving plasma, blood and maybe even hair, if you have long, healthy hair.
Sell your sperm or eggs, but be aware that it can be a painful process and that you should only do this in a very safe environment.

, There's also something to be said for renting your stuff. This is an easy way to make money and to make use of the space or things you don't really need. Here's what you can do:



Rent out a empty room. If you have an extra room in your house that you don't really need, rent it to a person you trust.
Rent half of your space. Instead of renting a room, you can find a roommate to share your home with you. Having the right roommate will not only cut your rent costs in half, but you will have a new companion, and be able to save on your groceries if you decide to share meals.
""Rent"" the space in your car. If you're giving your friend a ride, make sure your friend actually pays for your gas. Don't rent your car because you can get in a lot of trouble if something goes wrong when your friend is driving it.

Save money on transportation.,
Save money on shopping.,
Save money on entertainment.",How to Earn Extra Money3," Saving money on transportation is easy and can actually make your life more convenient. Though many people are reluctant to give up sitting cozily behind the wheel of their car, cutting costs on transportation can help you save a lot of extra money each week. Here's what you can do:


When you can, walk instead of drive. Instead of driving to the grocery store that is five minutes away, take a nice leisurely walk. This will not only save you gas money, but it will give you great exercise and will keep you from buying more than you need.
Take public transportation instead of driving. If this is an option, take it. Not only will you save money, but you will be able to avoid traffic and read a good book while you travel.
Carpool. Carpooling will save you money and it will help you get places faster if you're driving on a highway with a carpool lane.

, You will be amazed by how much extra cash you have left over if you pay attention to how you spend money when you're shopping. Whether you're looking for a new outfit or buying your weekly groceries, there are always a few things you can do to save money:


Instead of shopping at a fancy name-brand store, check out the funky clothes at your local thrift store.
Buy things used instead of new. If you don't really care if the item is new, get the old version on Amazon or at a used book or thrift store. Buying your textbooks or books for reading pleasure used will save you a lot of money.

Save money on groceries. Make a point of shopping at reasonably-priced store in your area, to stock up on items you use that are on sale, and of buying only what you need.

, You may be spending more money than you think on entertainment such as the movies, shows, or going out to bars or restaurants. It's easy to forget how much you're spending when you're out having fun, but keeping an eye on how you spend money on entertainment will lead to some serious savings.


Make a point of only eating out on special occasions. If you eat out all the time, set a goal to eat out just once or twice a week, and see if you can trim down that figure as you go along. In some cases, going out for a nice dinner can cost as much as a week of groceries, and you have to ask yourself if its worth it.
Rent a movie in the comfort of your own home instead of going to the movies. You will save big and be about to avoid buying that ridiculously overpriced tub of popcorn that you can't live without at your local theatre.
Minimize your time at bars and go to house parties instead. Going out to bars with your friends is a great way to unwind, but if you do it too often, you can rack up quite a bill. Just one fancy cocktail can cost more than an hour of hard work at your part-time job. If you do go out, try to pick cheaper bars with happy hours, or to drink a little bit before you head out (as long as you aren't driving) so you don't have to spend as much money on booze when you're there.

Be aware of the false myths around blackheads.,
Keep excess oil off your face.,
Clean your pillowcases at least once a week.,
Keep your hair away from your face and try not to touch your face with your hands.,
Never pick or squeeze your blackheads.",How to Remove Blackheads on Your Nose2," Part of why it is simply not possible to wipe away your blackheads is because they are not caused by a buildup of dirt. Instead, they are created by a buildup of dead skin/sebum, which then reacts with oxygen and turns the substance in your pores black.As well, it is impossible to shrink, close or open your pores, as your pores are not muscles. They are simply holes that house the hair follicles and sebaceous glands on your body.
While some substances, like lemon or mint, can make your pores appear smaller, in reality your pores are not shrinking.
Other factors like genetics, age, and sun exposure all play a role in how large your pores appear, but there is no magic cure to making them shrink.

, Do this by washing your face no more than twice a day with a gentle facial cleanser that is oil free. Make sure you wash your face if you use makeup on a daily basis, as makeup residue can cause oil buildup on your face.Be sure to exfoliate your face with a natural or professional method and use a natural or commercial toner on a daily basis.

, Washing your pillowcases will remove any dead skin cells and oils your face leaves behind on the fabric every night., Hair can carry germs and bacteria that could end up on your face and/or nose.Avoid touching your face or nose with your hands. Your hands can carry dirt, germs and bacteria that can then end up on your face and cause a buildup of oil that can lead to blackheads.

, This can cause the skin on your nose to become inflamed, infected, and even cause scarring.As well, when using scrubs, avoid scrubbing your blackheads too hard as this can lead to irritation and inflammation.

Use a cleanser with salicylic acid and glycolic acid.,
Buy pore strips.,
Talk to a dermatologist about retinoids.,
Ask your dermatologist about microdermabrasion.",How to Remove Blackheads on Your Nose3," The best way to break down any oil in clogged pores is to use products that contain beta-hydroxy acid, or salicylic acid. Consistent use of a cleanser with salicylic acid will help to prevent blackheads before they form and clear your pores of oil.Salicylic acid works with glycolic acid to help clear dead skin and debris on the surface of your skin.Acne products like Proactiv, Benzac, and PanOxyl all contain these ingredients.

, Over the counter medicated pore strips can work to remove oil plugs in your nose and as a result, remove blackheads., Retinoids contain Vitamin A and work to clear clogged pores and prevent blackheads from forming.Prescription strength retinoids are the most effective and come in pill form.

Use sunscreen.,
Remove your makeup.,
Shower after exercising.,
Blot sweat during exercise.,
Avoid touching your face.",How to Avoid Exercise‐Related Acne1," If you exercise outside, you need to protect your skin from the damaging effects of the skin's rays. Wear sunscreen every time you're going outside, even on days when it's cold or overcast.Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. You may want to go higher if you have extremely pale skin, if you're prone to getting burned, or if you have a history or genetic predisposition to skin cancer.
To avoid acne as a result of your sunscreen, make sure the brand you choose is oil-free, non-acnegenic, and non-comedogenic.;
, If you wear makeup during the day, make sure you take all of it off before you work out. Makeup can clog your pores while you're exercising, and your skin won't be able to sweat properly.If you have time limitations and don't have time to fully wash your face, pack makeup-removal wipes in your gym bag so you'll always have them with you.

, To keep your skin clean and fresh, take a shower as soon as possible after exercising. While sweat doesn't cause acne in and of itself, it can irritate your skin. The friction of clothing against moist skin can lead to breakouts.After your shower, dry your skin thoroughly before putting on clean, dry clothes. Remember that you're trying to eliminate the friction of clothing against moist skin – it doesn't matter if that moisture comes from sweat or from the shower.
If your schedule simply doesn't allow even a quick shower after exercising, pack along some cleansing wipes so you can blot off your skin after exercise. Make sure your skin is completely dry before you put on clean clothes.

, Especially during high-intensity exercise, you may need to keep sweat from running into your eyes, or dripping down your arms or legs and making body positioning difficult.To avoid exercise-related acne, don't wipe yourself down with a towel. Rather, you should blot or dab the sweat away.
Use a different towel for your face than you use for other parts of your body, which may be dirty.

, If you are prone to face breakouts, you've probably been told before to stop touching your face. This is no less true while exercising, when your hands come into contact with more unsanitary surfaces.For example, if you're doing bodyweight exercises on the floor and then swipe or scratch your face with your hand, you're essentially wiping your face with the floor.
Keep a facial towel on hand, and use it when you need to blot sweat, or if you have an itch.

Create a distraction by accentuating other features.",How to Apply Makeup when You Have Acne1," Applying makeup over acne starts with preparing the skin properly beforehand. Clean, smooth and moisturized skin creates a healthy looking complexion.Wash your face well with warm water and a facewash to clean dirt and impurities off your skin.


Wash with just your hands rather than a wash cloth to avoid over exfoliating, which can cause worse skin irritation and more acne.;
, It’s tough to apply foundation over flaky skin. If your wash didn’t remove all flakes, try simply patting your skin with Scotch tape to gently remove flakes., Over flaky areas, dab a small amount onto the area with your ring finger and let sit for 5 minutes before continuing your makeup routine.

, Acne scars and pimples can make a bumpy surface that draws attention to problem areas when it catches the light. Use a silicone primer to smooth and fill in fine lines.

, Avoid a caked-on look by using clean, bare hands and a light touch to apply a sheer foundation.Overloading skin with too many layers will block pores, encourage breakouts, and actually emphasize your skin’s texture and acne.


Pick the correct shade of foundation for your skin by selecting two shades that come closest to your skin tone, applying each of them to your jawline, and comparing them in a mirror outside in natural light.Match your foundation shade to the skin on your neck so that your face and body turn out the same color., Add a small dot of concealer over each blemish and lightly tap it with your ring finger until it blends with your foundation.Using concealer over your whole face will look cakey. Let your healthy skin shine through by using concealer only as needed.


You want to detract attention from pimples, and covering a pimple with light concealer actually highlights it. Use a concealer that is slightly darker than your foundation but will still blend with it., Otherwise carry blotting papers with you to gently remove excess oil without smearing makeup throughout the day.

, Paint over each scar with a color corrector then tap it with your ring finger to blend. For instance green counteracts red, so a green tinted concealer can cover redness from acne. Peach, tangerine, and deeper orange shades neutralize acne scars well.,, Use lid liner, eye shadow, mascara, blush, or lipstick to highlight and create focal points around eyes, lips or cheeks and draw attention away from the blemished areas.If your pimple is on your chin or cheeks, focus on your eye makeup. Avoid glosses or bright lipstick as this will draw attention to your lips.
If your zit is on your forehead or upper cheek, a dramatic lip shade will direct attention to the lower part of your face."

Limit what touches your skin.,
Clean your skin regularly.,
Eat healthy.,
Limit stress.,
Avoid picking or popping your acne.,
Visit a dermatologist.",How to Stop Getting Acne in the Same Spot1," If you repeatedly get acne on specific parts of your body, think about what touches that area regularly. You may find that your hands or an article of clothing may be touching that area and causing breakouts. To prevent this, avoid touching your face with dirty hands or wearing tight fitting or dirty clothes.


For example, if you wear a baseball cap and regularly get acne on your forehead, try not wearing the hat and see if the acne clears up.
Acne can also appear in places that are regularly in contact with your hair (for example, on the forehead, under your bangs). This can be a particular problem if you use oily hair care products. Try keeping your hair off of the affected area, and stick to hair products that are oil-free.;
, To avoid acne, you should wash acne-prone areas only twice a day. Washing your skin removes oil and dead skin that can lead to breakouts. When you are looking for acne creams or gels, look for something with either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as the active ingredient.Avoid over washing your skin, which can dry out and irritate it.
If you are unsure about what kind of wash to get, talk to your doctor or dermatologist.

, Although the idea that eating certain foods, like chocolate, can lead to acne is a myth, diet does influence the body’s hormone levels, which can cause breakouts. In order to avoid breakouts, try to eat a balanced diet that is high in fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and whole grains. You should also avoid fatty, sugary, or processed foods. Eating a healthy and balanced diet will help regulate your hormones and prevent problematic breakouts., Although anxiety does not cause acne, it can make it worse. Stress causes your body to release hormones that can cause breakouts. To limit anxiety’s impact on your acne, try to relax and practice mindfulness. You can also exercise, which helps reduce anxiety., If you do get acne, picking or popping your pimples can lead to infections and scarring. Messing with your blemishes also slows down their ability to heal and go away. If the unsightliness of the acne is bothering you, use a concealer to cover the blemish until it has healed., If you are having a hard time dealing with or managing your acne, you should talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. It is important that your acne is treated in order to prevent any scarring. They may prescribe medications, ointments, or washes designed to help deal with your acne. There are also various therapies, such as chemical peels and steroid injections, for more severe cases of acne.Many prescribed treatments may take as many as weeks to work, so be patient.

Similarly, avoid sharing daily things and tools with siblings who have acne.,
Wash your pillowcases frequently.,
Pay attention to your hair routine, especially if your skin is oily.,
Watch out about applying too much product in your hair.,
Stay out of direct sunlight.",How to Prevent Acne1," When you wash your face, wash it gently and with warm (but not hot) water. The heat will open your pores and make the cleaning process more effective. Make sure your water is not too hot, so you won't burn your skin.









Make sure your cleanser is suited for your skin. Select a hypoallergenic or acne-formulated product. A highly perfumed, harsh soap will often make acne worse.
In America and some other countries, the following are excellent and usually widely available: Cetaphil, Dove Sensitive, Neutrogena brand cleansers, and Basis. However, there are many ""store brands"" that may be less expensive and about as good. If you can afford them, higher-end brands like Boscia, Fresh, and Murad are good.;
, Both extremes need special care.


Too much washing is sometimes as bad as not enough. Acne is not caused by dirty skin. Washing once in the morning, once at night, and if the face is very sweaty or to wash off make-up is plenty. Too much washing can irritate acne, actually making it worse.
Dry skin can benefit from a face wash or soap that is oil-based or contains a moisturizer.
Oily skin does not usually need extra moisturizer in its cleanser. However, be careful not to go extremely drying, either. If your face feels tight after washing, the cleanser may be too harsh.

, If your hands are oily and dirty to begin, you will not get the best results. Wash your hands before you wash your face for best results.









Do not wash or scrub too hard. Some people prefer to wash their face with a washcloth but this can potentially irritate your skin more, making it more prone to acne. Gently washing your face with your hands is the best way to go.

, When you wash your face, you strip it out of oils and moisture, causing your skin to produce more oil and sebum to compensate for the dryness. Your skin needs moisture. Help it replenish that moisture by moisturizing after each wash.








, Depending on your skin type, you may want to choose a different moisturizer. The following are general guidelines, but everyone's skin is different, and you should feel free to experiment and find what works for you:


Oily skin: Choose a gel-based moisturizer.Gel-based moisturizers are usually better for oily skin, as they provide essential moisture without overdoing it.
Dry skin: Choose a cream-based moisturizer.Cream-based moisturizers are heavier and longer-lasting than gel-based ones. Doctors usually recommend these for skin that needs something a little more heavy-duty.

, Exfoliating means gently wiping off the outer layer of the skin (called the epidermis) in order to help slough off dead skin and unclog pores. See if exfoliating once a week improves the complexion of your skin. You can buy a commercial exfoliating product, or you can make one on your own. Whatever you do, don't over-exfoliate. Exfoliating once a week is plenty.









For some people with acne, physical exfoliation (e.g., with a scrub) can make the problem worse. Chemical exfoliants can be gentler on the skin, and some of them can be used daily (generally overnight). AHAs are chemical exfoliants that slough off dead skin, while BHAs clean out your pores. You can use one or both.

, Avoid going to sleep with makeup on. If you wear makeup, get into the habit of removing it before you go to bed. Make-up that stays on your face can clog pores, leading to acne. If you wear makeup make sure you get oil free foundation of any other makeups If you don't have oil free or can't get some use face powder. Face powder will soak up all the oils from your makeup or face If you know you're prone to leaving makeup on and you don't want to go through the hassle of washing your face, invest in some skin-cleaning wipes that you can use in a pinch.









Also be sure to wash off other cosmetics, such as sunscreen.

, Your hands are breeding grounds for bacteria because we use them to touch so many things. Touching your face is a big no-no because it cuts down on bacteria transmission. The less bacteria on your face, the lower your chances that you'll develop nasty breakouts.

, These include: towels, make-up brushes or kits, hair bands, etc.

, The oils on your pillowcases can cause acne by spreading dirt, grime, and dead skin. At the least, do it weekly, but you can do it every day if you find this tip makes a big difference. Consider having two pairs of pillowcases that you can switch out at the end of each week so that you avoid doing laundry constantly.


Try to avoid detergents with fragrances and dryer sheets. Both can trigger acne for some people.

, How you treat your hair can have a big impact on acne, especially around your forehead. Your scalp releases natural oils to keep your hair lustrous. But too much oil in and around your scalp, while healthy for your hair, can be dangerous for your skin. For this reason, wash your hair at least every other day. Try to strike a good balance between healthy hair and healthy skin.

, Gels, mousses, and sprays can get into the pores of your skin, clog them, and create pimples. Be selective about how much product you put into your hair, especially if you have acne around your forehead.

, Exposure to too much sunlight can be harmful to the skin. You probably already know that it can cause skin cancer, but did you know that it can exacerbate acne?When you go outside or expect to be in the sun for a long period of time, wear some noncomedogenic sunscreen to help block out harmful rays. Noncomedogenic just means that the sunscreen will not clog your pores. Wear a hat, too. Note that many acne topical treatments can make sun damage more likely.

Wear natural fabrics.,
Keep your equipment and accessories clean.,
Bring more than one towel.,
Wash workout clothes after every session.",How to Avoid Exercise‐Related Acne2," Generally, synthetic fabrics such as nylon or rayon trap heat and moisture close to your skin. Bacteria develops rapidly in this environment, and can lead to exercise-related acne.Choose light, breathable garments for exercising. You may have to experiment to find the right combination or fabric blend that works best for you.
If you're prone to acne, lightweight cotton garments that fit loosely may be your best option to avoid exercise-related acne.
There are active fabrics that are specifically designed to wick moisture away from the body. Since clothing made from these fabrics may be more expensive, try them first and see if you notice any benefit from them. For example, you might buy a moisture-wicking shirt and monitor your skin over the course of a week.

, If your skin has repeated contact with surfaces that haven't been cleaned or sanitized, you could be introducing bacteria that can seep into your pores and cause exercise-related acne.This is particularly true in gyms, where there are many different people using the machines and other equipment. Make sure you wipe down any surface your skin will touch, including handles, before you start exercising. The same applies to your own equipment in your home.
You may want to bring along inexpensive anti-bacterial wipes with you in case the gym doesn't have any available. Don't just use a towel – especially not one that you later use to blot sweat from your skin.
You also want to wipe down any equipment or accessories that you wear on your body, such as headphones or a helmet you wear while cycling. When these materials get sweaty, they can become a breeding ground for bacteria and cause breakouts.

, If you have towels to blot sweat, don't use the same towel for your face as you use for other parts of your body. Gym towels typically are white, but finding a colored one for your face can help you keep them separate.If you're a member of a gym that supplies towels, you may want to bring your own facial towel so that you don't mix them up, and you can be sure that it's clean.
Don't use the same gym towel for more than one exercise session. That sweaty towel from yesterday is growing bacteria and yeast while it sits in your gym bag, which could lead to breakouts if you use it again.
If you're exercising outdoors during a hot day, or doing particularly high-intensity exercise, you may want several towels so you can swap them out when one gets too damp.

, Bacteria and yeast will grow on your dirty, sweaty clothing. Wearing the same clothes for more than one exercise session without washing them can cause exercise-related acne.There may be some items, such as an exercise bra, that you routinely wear for several sessions before washing. Bacteria may build up, especially with the friction of the garment rubbing against your sweaty body, leading to breakouts.
The sooner you can wash your clothes after your workout, the better. Wash in cool water with a strong detergent that will kill the bacteria.
If you don't want to run the washing machine or go to the laundromat after every session, you can wash the garments in the sink if you need to wear them the next day.

Exfoliate regularly.,
Spot-treat with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.,
Use medicated shampoos or shower gels.,
Take a look at your diet.",How to Avoid Exercise‐Related Acne3," If you have clogged pores that are leading to breakouts, exfoliate your skin at least three times a week to release the bacteria and thoroughly clean your skin. Choose a gentle exfoliating cleanser that won't further damage your skin.Exfoliation is just as important for body acne as it is for facial acne. If you break out on your back, buy a sponge or loofa with a handle so you have the reach to exfoliate your back properly.
It's important not to over-exfoliate your skin, since that can cause micro-tears and abrasions on the surface of the skin and lead to more serious irritation.

, Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are effective spot treatments that can help dry up acne and reduce the duration of a breakout. However, it's important not to overdo it.Read the label of any spot treatment you buy carefully, and follow the dosage instructions carefully.
Remember that these drugs are drying agents, and will dry out your skin. In most cases, you'll need to combine them with a moisturizer unless you want to cause other skin problems when your skin responds to the dryness by producing more oil.
Use a spot treatment as just that – dab it on individual zits, but don't slather it all over your face.

, If your skin has already erupted, or if you're acne-prone, a gentle medicated cleanser can help keep your skin clear. Use medicated cleansers during your shower immediately after your workout.When you lather up with a medicated cleanser, step out from under the water and let the product sit on your skin for five minutes. You may want to gently massage it in using a circular motion – don't just scrub your skin up and down.
After five minutes, thoroughly rinse all the lather. Pat yourself dry after your shower, and follow up with a light moisturizer.
Avoid using medicated cleansers every time you shower, as it can lead to excessive dryness. Only use them during the shower immediately following your workout.

, If you've eliminated irritants and are taking good care of your skin, and yet you still continue to breakout, something you're eating might be the culprit. This is particularly true if you've recently made significant dietary changes.For example, whey protein may cause some people to break out. If you didn't have any problems with exercise-related acne until you started drinking a whey protein shake before each training session, that may be why you've started breaking out. Discontinue the whey protein for a week or two and see if you notice any changes.
Various performance enhancers and supplements also can contribute to acne. This is particularly true of those that may create hormone imbalances.
You also should evaluate the types of foods you're eating. Some foods, particularly greasy foods, are thought by some to contribute to acne."

Remove makeup before bedtime.,
Clean your makeup tools.,
Select acne-safe products.,
Look for makeup containing acne treatment.",How to Apply Makeup when You Have Acne2," Removing your makeup at the end of the day is one of the best ways to avoid further breakouts. Get into a good routine of cleansing and moisturizing before bed.Very gently wash off makeup using your bare hands with warm water and a facial cleanser for 10 seconds or less.


Avoid towelettes, makeup-removing wipes, washcloths, or scrubbers, as these can further irritate your skin., Wash your brushes and makeup tools with a mild shampoo or brush cleaner, and replace sponges regularly.Acne is caused by bacteria and keeping clean tools can help minimize breakouts.


Wash your pillowcases and towels often.Items that touch your face should be kept clean and bacteria-free.

, Choosing makeup made for acne-prone or sensitive skin will help prevent breakouts caused by some makeup. Try to choose sheer or light coverage varieties that are non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores) and fragrance-free.Look for products with these guidelines:


Avoid products with thick or very creamy texture, which will clog pores more easily.
Gels, light serums and fluids are better for pores than thicker makeup.
Oils don’t clog the pores but can make your skin appear greasy.
Avoid products that contain irritants such as alcohol, menthol, peppermint, eucalyptus, camphor, lemon, grapefruit, or lime., Some cosmetics brands have lines of makeup containing salicylic acid, an ingredient in acne medications.These are not proven to be more effective at preventing acne, but may be worth trying out.

Wash problem areas with a gentle cleanser twice daily.,
Avoid products that irritate skin.,
Use an oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen.,
Watch what touches your skin.,
Shower after you exercise.",How to Apply Makeup when You Have Acne3," Use your hands to wash your face with a mild soap and warm water.


If you often get acne around your hairline, shampoo your hair every day.
Guys, be gentle while shaving affected skin.

, Stay away from oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products and concealers. Avoid facial scrubs, astringents, and masks, which can irritate skin and worsen acne.

, For some people the sun worsens acne, and some acne medications make you more sensitive to sunlight. Your healthcare provider can warn you if your medication is one of these. If it is, stay out of the sun as much as possible. Regularly use a non-oily moisturizer that includes a sunscreen.

, Keep your hair clean and off your face and avoid resting your hands, phone, or other objects on your face.


Don't pick or squeeze blemishes. This can cause infection or scarring., Oil and sweat on your skin can worsen breakouts."
"
Purchase over-the-counter products with acne-fighting ingredients.,
See your healthcare provider for stronger medications.,
Visit a specialist if your acne persists or is severe.",How to Apply Makeup when You Have Acne4," Look for products with the following in the first seven items on their list of ingredients:


Benzoyl peroxide: kills the bacteria that cause acne, helps remove oil from the skin and removes dead skin cells that can clog pores.
Salicylic acid: helps prevent pores from becoming plugged.
Alpha hydroxy acids: help to remove dead skin cells and reduce inflammation, and stimulate the growth of newer smoother skin. Two types of alpha hydroxy acids that are used in nonprescription acne products are glycolic acid and lactic acid.
Sulfur: helps removes dead skin cells and excess oil. Some products have an unpleasant smell.If you have a mild reaction to the product, switch to something new. Some products can cause dryness, redness, mild stinging or irritation, especially when you first start using them. Be aware of skin changes with new products and try a different product if you don’t react well.

, If home care remedies and over-the-counter products don't work to clear up your acne, see your family doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications and discuss the risks and benefits with you.

, Request a referral from your family doctor to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin problems."

Pop whitehead pimples.,
Don't pop new pimples.,
Don’t pop pimples that are big, red, or sore.,
Visit a dermatologist.,
Limit pimples by washing regularly.",How to Pop a Pimple1," Whitehead pimples have usually been around for a few days, and they have a white tip where pus has collected underneath the skin. These pimples are easy to pop, and when treated with care they can be safely removed without causing scarring or an infection., Pimples that have just appeared in the past day or two aren't ready to pop yet. Wait until the whitehead appears at the tip of the blemish., There's too great a risk that an infection could occur, and popping a pimple this big will almost definitely lead to a scar. Only a pimple with white pus is ready to pop., Dermatologists can determine the best way to treat your acne. They can prescribe creams that will eliminate your pimples. There are also several procedures they can perform which will remove bad acne.The most commonly prescribed dermatologist treatment is a topical cream, rubbed on the pimples, that will remove oil from the skin and slowly kill pimples.
For red, swollen pimples an oral antibiotic might be prescribed to kill bacteria.
Dermatologists can also directly remove pimples with procedures including laser therapies and chemical peels. They will often use a pin to pop a pimple, if you are too squeamish to do it yourself.

, Pimples are caused by sweat sitting on your face. Anytime you sweat, wash your face gently with lukewarm water to remove dirt and grime. Do not be harsh or scrub, just wash off sweat.Scrubbing roughly can worsen acne.
Do not use rough cleaners, like astringents, toners, or exfoliants.

Try different makeups.,
Change your hair products.,
Try not to touch your face.,
Wear contacts instead of glasses.,
Limit plucking and facial waxing.,
Prepare and treat your skin properly, if you do pluck or wax.,
Put down your phone.",How to Stop Getting Acne in the Same Spot2," Although makeup can be great for hiding acne, it can also cause breakouts. Over applying makeups or using particularly oily products can clog your pores and lead to infections. If you are getting breakouts on certain parts of your face, try a different product and see if it clears up.In general, try to use products that are oil-free or noncomedogenic. You should also look for makeups that contain acne-fighting ingredients.
Always remove your makeup before you go to bed. If your skin is particularly oily, you may need to use a special makeup remover instead of simply washing your face.

, If you suffer from breakouts on your forehead, scalp, neck, and back, the culprit may be your hair products. Products like gels, pomades, and sprays tend to block pores and irritate your skin. They can also cause allergic reactions that can result in acne. To avoid acne, experiment with different products to find one that does not irritate your skin.In general, look for products with shorter and more natural ingredient lists. In particular, look for products that are fragrance-free and noncomedogenic (non-pore clogging).
To avoid using too much product, consider washing your hair two or three times a week or rinse it with conditioner daily. You might also want to consider sleeping with your hair up to avoid rolling around in your dirty hair all night.
If you believe that you are having an allergic reaction to a certain product, quit using it and talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. You may want to be tested so you know what to avoid in the future.

, Because your hands come in contact with numerous objects during the day, they can transfer countless bacteria to your face, resulting in breakouts. If you rest your head in your hands, you may get breakouts on your chin or cheeks. To avoid this, wash your hands regularly and try to touch your face as little as possible., If you tend to get breakouts around your nose, your glasses may be the culprit. Your glasses house bacteria that can cause infections. In addition, they rub and put pressure on your skin, which can irritate it and stimulate oil production. If your glasses are causing you acne, consider using a spot treatment or ditching your glasses entirely and wear contacts.Be sure to regularly clean the nose pads of your glasses by washing them with hot soapy water. This remove any bacteria that might cause a breakout.

, Whenever you pull hairs from a follicle, you create an opening that is susceptible to infection. If you have your eyebrows plucked or any facial hair waxed, such as around your mouth and chin, you might see some breakouts. To avoid this, limit how often you pluck or wax any facial hairs.Shaving can have a similar effect, especially if you use a dull razor that pulls the hairs from the follicle instead of cutting them.
Try sugaring or threading as alternatives to plucking or waxing.

, If you must pluck or wax your hair, use some basic precautions to avoid potential breakouts:Gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin before plucking or waxing. Use an anti-microbial pre-wax cleanser.
Carefully clean your hands and nails before plucking and waxing, and wear disposable gloves during waxing and cleanup.
Cleanse again after plucking or waxing, and gently exfoliate the next day. Keep the freshly waxed or plucked areas clean and free from sweat, dirt, or irritating products.

, Because most people take them everywhere (even to the bathroom) and touch them constantly, cellular phones are covered in bacteria. Whenever you talk on your phones, you are rubbing those bacteria all over your face. This can lead to breakouts on your cheeks and chin. To avoid any phone-related breakouts, consider using your phone's speaker function or getting a hands-free Bluetooth headpiece.
You can also minimize phone-related breakouts by regularly cleaning your phone with antibacterial wipes."

Wear breathable clothes.,
Shower immediately after working out.,
Remove body hair gently.,
Do your laundry regularly.",How to Stop Getting Acne in the Same Spot3," If you get acne on your chest, back, or butt, consider wearing clothes that allow your skin to breathe. Tight-fitting clothes can trap moisture and irritate your skin, leading to breakouts. Instead, wear clothes made from natural fibers, such as cotton or silk, which allow airflow and wick away moisture.This is particularly important when it comes to clothes that you sweat in a lot, such as your exercise gear.
If you get acne on your back from wearing a backpack, consider using a handbag or satchel instead.

, Once you finish working out, you should always take off your sweaty exercise clothes and take a shower. This allows your skin to breathe and washes away the oil and sweat that can cause breakouts. If your gym does not have a locker room with showers, make sure that you shower right away when you get home.If you cannot shower immediately, consider using travel wipes that contain salicylic acid.

, Because it leaves pores and follicles susceptible to bacteria, removing body hair, by either shaving or waxing, can lead to breakouts. Instead, you might want to consider laser hair removal, which is less irritating to the skin. If you do have to shave, make sure that you use a shaving cream designed for sensitive skin.This is particularly important if you get acne around your bikini line.
You can also try gentler alternatives, like sugaring and threading.

, Because bacteria can hang out on your clothes and bedding, you should regularly wash all fabrics that come in contact with your skin. Bacteria on pillows can cause your face to break out and unwashed clothes can lead to body acne. Make sure you wash your clothes regularly and your bedding at least every two weeks.If you wear any hats, be sure to wash them regularly to prevent any breakouts on your forehead.

Drink enough water to stay hydrated.,
Eat healthy.,
Stay away from problem-creating foods and diets.,
Milk and other dairy products are laden with hormones (testosterone or androgens), which can increase insulin levels, just like sugar and starchy (high-glycemic) foods do.Scientists are now unraveling the very real link between dairy and acne.You don't necessarily have to cut dairy out of your diet, but be careful about overindulging in dairy if you're worried about acne.

,
Stay away from excessive alcohol and smoking.,
Exercise to reduce stress and prevent acne.,
To help cut down on stress, be sure to sleep enough.",How to Prevent Acne2," Staying hydrated may help you maintain your clear skin. While there is conflicting scientific evidence supporting the claim that water helps clear toxins out of your body, most scientist agree that drinking water is net-beneficial to your skin instead of net-neutral or net-negative.You do not need to necessarily drink eight glasses of water per day, but drink enough to replenish what you might have lost in exercise, and drink when you are thirsty.

, Doctors are beginning to understand, after decades of inconclusive evidence, that diet does play a difference in whether you get acne and how severe it is.Eating a balanced diet rich in vegetables and fruits, lean protein, whole wheats and grains, nuts and seeds, and healthy fats (omega-3 fatty acids, for example) should help your body fight acne. At the same time, it will make you healthier and give you more energy. In addition to the foods listed above, try to get enough:


Vitamin A. Vitamin helps your body flush out acne-causing proteins and oil from the skin cycle.Take either 10,000 UI of vitamin A supplements, or eat foods that are high in vitamin A, which include fish oil, salmon, carrots, spinach, and broccoli.
Zinc. Some evidence suggests that people with acne don't have enough zinc in their systems.Scientists think that zinc creates an inhospitable environment for the acne-causing bacteria. Foods that are high in zinc include: turkey, wheat germ, oysters, pumpkin seeds, and peanuts.Omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids promote healthy cell turnover and cut down on inflammation.Examples of omega-3 fatty acids include flax seed, salmon, sunflower seeds, and almonds.

, Scientists believe that high-glycemic diets — chocolate, French fries, pizza, etc. — are linked to acne vulgaris.In addition to high-glycemic foods, milk might also be a major culprit in causing acne, doctors have found:

,, These drugs aren't good for your complexion. Studies around the world have linked toxins like tobacco and alcohol to acne.If you are a regular smoker or drinker and worried about acne, consider cutting down on these habits if you're serious about seeing an uptick in overall health.

, Exercise is really helpful for avoiding acne because it lowers the amount of stress that your body goes through. Unfortunately, stress is a significant cause of acne, both in children and adults.Therefore, any way that you can remove stress from your life is a ""win"" for clear skin. Exercise is one of those ways.








, Studies have shown that not getting enough sleep can seriously increase the amount of stress a person goes through, sometimes up for 15% more stress for each hour of sleep lost beyond their normal allotment.Shoot to get between 9 and 10 hours if you're younger than 18 and between 7 and 8 hours if you're an adult.Additionally, sleep is when most of the body's healing, including skin repair, takes place.

Use benzoyl peroxide.,
Use salicylic acid.,
Consider using tea tree oil.,
If things get serious, consult your doctor.,
Use manuka honey.",How to Prevent Acne3," Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but studies show that benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions while being less irritating to the skin.Additionally, benzoyl peroxide helps peel away layers of dead skin on the epidermis, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated skin in its place.

, Like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid kills bacteria responsible for pimple growth. It also causes skin cells to shed more rapidly, promoting the growth of new skin. Put small amounts of salicylic acid onto affected areas before you go asleep, after you have washed your face.

, While this is not specifically bottled for acne, it is a very effective home remedy. Tea tree oil has anti-inflammatory properties that can make the redness and size of pimples less noticeable.In one study, tea tree oil proved to be just as effective as benzoyl peroxide in reducing inflamed lesions of acne patients.Because tea tree oil is very strong, dilute it first in a little bit of water before applying to the skin with a Q-Tip or similar instrument. Too much tea tree oil may irritate skin.

, A dermatologist is trained to spot and treat skin disorders. The doctor may recommend a prescription containing clindamycin phosphate or benzoyl peroxide, both very popular acne deterrents. Prescription strength medicines are often much stronger than solutions you can buy over the counter.

, Manuka honey is another natural remedy that many people find very effective for acne, while also being exceptionally gentle on skin compared to most other acne treatments. It has potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, it helps reduce and prevent scarring, and it helps soothe and hydrate the skin, too. You can use it as your face wash (but if you need to wash off makeup, you'll need to use an actual soap or cleanser first), as a mask, and/or as a spot treatment.

Wear a clean bra.,
Wear breathable, clean, loose clothes.,
Shower after sweating.,
When you do shower, be sure to rinse conditioner out of your hair.,
Change your laundry detergent.,
Wash your sheets regularly.",How to Get Rid of Bacne1," If you wear a bra, it is extremely important it should be clean. Try to wear a fresh one each day. Your straps should be tight enough so as they do not rub against the acne when you move, which irritates it. If possible, wear a strapless bra as this reduces redness on your shoulder blades.;
, Ensure any material touching your back is clean and, if possible, made of primarily natural fibers such as cotton. Try to avoid tight-fitting clothing. Finally, the clothes should be laundered regularly--preferably after each wearing.


Try to wash clothes in a gentle detergent with minimal or no scent. Acne can be caused or worsened by overly harsh or highly perfumed detergents.
If possible, bleach your whites. Bleach kills any lingering bacteria on your clothing and impedes acne growth. Be sure to rinse completely to prevent the bleach from irritating your skin chemically.

, After going for a run or basketball practice, remember to hit the showers. Sweat that's not washed off your skin after exercise effectively creates a summer playground for bacteria that cause acne. Additionally, this sweat can also clog pores, causing acne to rear its ugly little head.

, One potential cause of bacne is conditioner that hasn't been properly washed from hair. Conditioner is great for your hair, but not so great for your back. There are several ways that you can help keep conditioner from invading your back and causing nasty little zits:


Turn the water temperature down before you rinse conditioner out of your hair. Warm water will open up pores, while cool water will close them. Having open pores right when your conditioner is slurrying down your hair is not a good recipe for a pimple-free back.
Wash your back last, after you have shampooed and conditioned.
Instead of conditioning your hair in the shower, condition it after you get out with a leave-in conditioner.

, If you have sensitive skin, the laundry detergent you use may be irritating your skin. Try switching detergents. Or try selecting a laundry detergent that is unscented, or even designed for babies with more sensitive skin.

, Dead skin cells and dust collect quickly on sheets. Pets that sleep on the bed will also be tracking in dirt. Remove the sheets and wash them twice weekly or change them twice weekly.


If you can bleach your sheets, doing so eliminates any acne bacteria still lingering through washing. Be sure they are rinsed completely to avoid any chemical-based irritation.
Be sure to wash blankets, comforters, and other bedclothes regularly as well.

Brainstorm.,
Establish your market.,
Mass produce.,
Advertise.,
Price your merchandise.,
Be patient.,
Keep records.,
Congratulations!",How to Turn a Hobby Into a Successful Business As a Teen," As is the case with any newborn business, you're going to need a lot of preparatory brainstorming before you even think about peddling your wares. Now is the time to think about big picture issues, like where you will get your supplies and how you plan to advertise. Most important of all is the question of whether or not you really have the time and means to start a small business. If you're keeping your grades up with ease and still have time to kill,have at it! However, if you're already juggling school, friends, part time jobs, and household responsibilities, taking on anything else will burn you out. Small businesses are a labor of love, but are nonetheless demanding of time and resources. Ideas could be: Sew things, Make clay pots, etc.;
, Who will be buying your product? How will you get it to them? What's more, how will you inform them that your business exists in the first place? High school is a great market for most crafts, since teenagers seem to go through spending money like water. Just make sure you narrow down your field of potential customers, or you'll be wasting precious time marketing your punk fashions to the Preps, or vice versa. By thinking in advance about your clientele, you'll spare yourself the hassle of working low traffic venues and marketing to the wrong crowd.

, If you're confident that your product will be profitable, it's time to start mass-producing your product. Get your supplies together (you may need an initial loan from Mom and Dad to get your business off the ground, which is perfectly fine so long as you repay them in a timely manner), then get busy! Come up with several basic prototypes, then replicate them over and over and over again. Once you have a significant inventory, you don't have to worry about crocheting in the wee hours of the morning to fill your orders.

, Come up with a catchy name and slogan for your business (e.g. Precision Gadget Cases- Precise quality and value), then print up flyers, signs, any ad that's within your means. These can easily be created on most home computers; if you've got a privileged friend with a color printer, have them hook you up with some nice, professional-looking business cards (make sure they include your name and some sort of contact number, at the very least). This is when you can utilize those computer wiz friends of yours to their full potential; have them set up a nice website for your business (offer them a nominal reward in return; if you act professional, your friends will treat you like one). Ebay and Craig's List are also options if you don't mind individual piece-work. Make sure you get permission before posting ads in public. Remember, the simplest way to advertise is to carry your merchandise with you. If you make jewelry, wear it!

, Make sure that you price your wares so that each piece is increasing your income. A good way to price is to calculate how much you spend on the materials per each item, then double it. This is a 50% profit margin, which is a good starting place. If you find that your business competitors are getting better business than you, see how they're pricing theirs, and offer a slightly lower price (just make sure you still have a profit margin!). Overpricing is bad, but underpricing is worse.

, Now that you've developed and inventory and your name is out there in the open, all you can do is wait for interest in your product. Hand out flyers, business cards, etc. when you can, but don't be too pushy. You may be raking in the greenbacks in a seeming matter of minutes, or it may take a little longer; every business is unique in this respect.

, Eventually, whether you make money or not, you'll have to face the monetary music sooner or later. This can be a lot less painful if you make an effort early on to keep track of every sale and expenditure you make (this means throwing away receipts is strictly taboo). This way, you won't be suckered into thinking you made $5 grand when it was really more like $50, and you'll know where your money went. Every so often, check the numbers to make sure that your income is greater than your expenditure, or you're in for a lot of trouble when the time comes to pay off your overhead and other debts. Make it a habit of putting 50% of your net income (income minus overhead and expenses)into a savings account, which will help you resist the temptation to blow your entire profit margin in one fell swoop. All you really need to keep is enough to cover your past overhead and another shipment or two of supplies., You've launched your very own business!

Wash your hands.,
Cover your hands.,
Clean the skin surrounding the pimple with a face cleanser or rubbing alcohol.",How to Pop a Pimple2," This is a very important step, so do it thoroughly, especially underneath the nails, and use plenty of soap and warm water. You'll want to avoid touching the pimple with your finger nails, but just in case you do, having them clean will reduce the likelihood of irritation and infection.Consider using a fingernail brush to get dirt out from under your fingernails.

, Put on disposable gloves just before you're ready to pop the pimple. Not only will this put a barrier between any remaining bacteria on your fingers (and in your fingernails) and your skin, but it will also prevent the sharp edges of your nails from impacting the pimple.


If you don't have disposable gloves, you can cover your fingers with clean tissues., Apply cleanser to a cotton ball and spread it. When you pop the pimple, you'll be opening the skin, creating a way for bacteria to enter. The pimple will heal faster if you don't give bacteria a chance to settle in and create an infection.


Don't scrub the area too hard, or you'll irritate it further. Gently cleanse the area, rinse it with warm water, and pat it dry with a towel.

Wipe the area with alcohol.",How to Pop a Pimple5," Place one fingertip on either side, just below the tip of the whitehead. You should be able to feel the sebum-filled area easily. After you've located the sebum-filed area, very gently wiggle your fingers together to coax the fluid out.


If no pus comes out, position your fingertips in a slightly different place around the pimple, then try again.
If the pus still remains in the pimple, stop trying to pop it. The pimple is not yet ready to be popped; either wait a few days or let it go away on its own., This will encourage the remaining pus to come out; keep doing it until the pimple is completely drained. Don't touch the pimple itself, except to blot away the pus with tissues. There may be some bleeding. If you see blood, stop pushing at the pimple, and leave it alone - it will only put more pressure on the swollen area, and may cause scarring.

, Again, the important thing is to make sure bacteria doesn't invade the opening in the skin. Also, consider applying a small amount of bacitracin ointment to protect it."

Don't pop your pimples.,
Consider going without makeup for a while.,
Another disadvantage of popping pimples is that the skin around the pimple, and the pimple itself, will become inflamed.,
Try not to touch your face.,
Drink enough water.,
Cut sweet, sugary drinks like sodas, juices, and smoothies out of your diet.,
Drink less milk.,
Unsweetened green tea may be helpful, too.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
People who eat more fruits and veggies, and less milk and sugar, tend to have less acne.Make sure you get 5 to 9 servings of healthy vegetables (especially leafy greens) per day.

,
Eat omega-3 fatty acids.,
Consider probiotics.,
Eat the right vitamins, in moderation.,
Try evening primrose oil.,
Try zinc citrate.,
Try vitamin-E. Critical for skin health, vitamin-E is low in many acne sufferers.Take 400 IU (international units) a day.

,
Don't try to wash your face more than twice a day.,
Moisturize after each time you wash your face.,
Use moisturizers that are non-comedogenic.,
If you do happen to have naturally oily skin, try looking for a gel-based moisturizer.,
Use a toner for oily skin.,
Remove as much unhealthy stress from your life as possible.,
Find creative outlets for your stress.,
Try meditation techniques.,
Make sure you're getting enough sleep.,
Young and elderly people need more sleep than adults.,

Store bought astringents.,
Natural astringents may also work in a pinch.,
Lemon juice.,
Banana peel.,
Witch hazel.,
Green tea.,
Apply ice cubes if necessary.,
As mentioned above, ice will help diminish the size of the pores by constricting the blood vessels underneath the skin.,
If you have a lot of acne, work in sections.,
Repeat this process around your face.

,
Use eye-drops on the affected area.,
Because cold also helps reduce inflammation in acne, place the Q-Tip soaked in eye-drops into the freezer for an hour before applying.,
Try some natural antihistamines.,
Stinging nettle.,
Coltsfoot may be effective as a natural antihistamine.,
Basil may also work as a natural antihistamine.,
If after all this, you still have some acne, consult a dermatologist.",How to Have an Acne Free Face," This is the number one rule! Pimples contain nasty bacteria. If you pop your pimples, that bacteria has a chance of getting inside other pores and giving them a place to stay without charging rent, so to speak. Make sure your pimples pay rent.;
, Foundation and lipstick can be harmful to the skin. Although it may be a bit embarrassing going fresh faced if you have bad skin, going ""bare"" will definitely help your skin clear up.

, Inflammation will cause even more redness and pain.

, Your hands (no matter how many times you wash them) have oils and dirt on them, and are vectors for bacteria. If you're constantly wiping that dirt, oil, and bacteria back onto your face, chances are it's not going to respond too well and you will also end up spreading even more the bacteria to other areas of your face.

, Many doctors recommend that you drink between 9 and 12 cups of water per day (2.2 to 3 liters), depending on whether you are a girl or guy.(Women should drink 9 cups, men should drink 12.) Your skin is an organ in your body, too, and like your kidney, it needs adequate amounts of water to function properly.

, Although the evidence has been disputed for decades, new reports seem to indicate that diets do have a substantial effect on acne, listing sugar as a trigger.Sugars cause a spike in insulin, which in turn stimulates certain pimple producing hormones.

, Milk, too, has recently been implicated as an acne-producing agent. Milk stimulates male sex hormones — testosterone and androgens — that, along with insulin, cause nasty pimples., Green tea contains tons of antioxidants that help fight free radicals; free radicals affect the cells that may be responsible for signs of aging in the skin. For a healthy alternative to water, brew some tasty and healthy green tea!

, Diet can help your complexion look its best if you let it. There's nothing amazing about the following sentence, and you can probably guess what it's going to be: eat more fruits and vegetables, more healthy fats, and experiment with probiotics

,, There's fat, and then there's healthy fat. Healthy fats, like omega-3s, help fight inflammation and promote healthy cells.Omega-3s are damaged by oxygen, meaning if you eat foods that are rich in omega-3s, try to eat them raw. In a pinch, baked or broiled is better than boiling or fried. Foods rich in omega-3s include:


Fish, particularly salmon, sardines, and herring.Seeds and nuts, particularly flaxseed.Leafy greens, particularly spinach and arugula., Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in certain foods, such as kombucha, that promote good digestive health and cut down inflammation. Probiotics such as lactobacillus may improve acne. Look for probiotics at your local grocer's or natural health store.

, This one is another no-brainer. The right kind of vitamins will help your body create vibrant, wonderful skin and fight acne to boot. Vitamin-A has been particularly effective in promoting healthy skin. Do not take vitamin-A if you are pregnant.

, Evening primrose oil is an anti-inflammatory omega-6 fat, a deficiency of which may cause acne.Take 1000 to 1500mg twice a day.

, Zinc citrate helps with protein synthesis, wound healing, and normal tissue function. Take 30 mg a day.

,, Washing your face too much will only make your face dry, causing your face to produce more oils, which unfortunately equals more acne.

, Washing strips the moisture from your skin as it fights the acne-producing bacteria. Ensure that you give your skin the moisture it needs, even if you have naturally oily skin.

, This simply means that they won't clog your pores. You don't want your moisturizer to clog pores right after you've cleaned them.

, These kinds of moisturizers, as opposed to cream-based moisturizers, won't make your skin feel as clammy and oily.

, What is a toner? A toner is a lotion or wash that helps shrink your pores while cleaning grime and dirt away. Be careful about toners with alcohol because they will wipe away the oil from your face. This causes more oil to be produced, along with more acne. Find a toner that is low on alcohol but still effective.

, Doctors aren't completely sure why, but they do know that there is a link between stress and skin disorders, specifically stress and acne. Somehow, the cells that produce sebum, which is the stuff that ultimately causes acne, become unregulated when a person experiences a lot of stress., Some people detach from stressful situations by taking a walk. Others pour their stress out onto a canvas by painting. Whatever it is that you do to decompress, do it early and do it often.

, There are numerous meditation techniques, so find the one(s) that work for you. Some people choose yoga for meditation.

, Being sleep deprived can cause stress and increase acneAs we learned above, stress can have a deleterious effect on skin, causing acne.
Speaking of sleep, change your pillowcase on a regular basis. Consider wrapping your pillowcase in a towel to absorb oil. You can flip the towel over the next night.

, Teenagers should try to get between 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night., For pretty much any ailment aside from muscle or bone damage, exercise is a panacea. Exercise is a great option for getting your circulation going, and anything that promotes good circulation also helps keep your skin healthy and vibrant-looking.A couple things to remember when you exercise:

, The benefits of getting your circulation jump started can be outweighed by the disadvantages of sun damage if you're not careful. Wear sunscreen that is light and doesn't irritate or sting your skin.

, When you sweat, your pores can get clogged with salty, dirty residue that's leftover from your workout. Be sure to wash your body, and especially your face, after you exercise.

, Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that contribute to acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions, and it's less irritating to the skin to boot. Benzoyl peroxide also helps peel away layers of dead skin, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated skin in its place.

, Like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid kills bacteria responsible for pimple growth. It also causes skin cells to shed more rapidly, promoting the growth of new skin. Put small amounts of salicylic acid onto affected areas before you go asleep, after you have washed your face.

, Toothpaste contains silica, which is the drying agent you find in bags of beef jerky, among other things. Basically, toothpaste will dry out your pimple overnight, reducing it in size.

, Some toothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate can irritate the skin. Watch out for it before applying.

, Tea tree oil is an antibacterial essential oil that can blast the microbes that have started to make a home inside of your pores. With a dropper, dab a Q-Tip with a bit of tea tree oil and apply to pimples as needed, being careful not to put on too much.

,, Crush up an aspirin tablet and add just enough water to make it into a paste. With a Q-Tip, add the aspirin paste to the pimple(s) lightly, covering entirely. Let dry. Aspirin is another anti-inflammatory, meaning it will help the skin fight against inflammation, making the pimple less visible. Let the aspirin paste fight the pimple overnight.

, Astringents are agents that cause the skin to contract or get smaller. Some pharmaceutical astringents contain antimicrobial ingredients that will help fight the pimple in addition to reducing the size of the pimple. Here are some astringents to consider using:

, These come in different types and sizes. Look for one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Ask for astringents that are gentle on the skin.

, They include:

, The citric acid here kills the bacteria that cause acne and act as a skin-tightener. Many people swear by it. Slice a lemon and gently rub it over the affected area.

, Banana peels are helpful in treating insect and mosquito bites, and may be helpful in reducing the size of some pimples. Gently rub the banana peel over the affected area.

, Another great astringent with a ton of applications. Look for witch hazel that doesn't contain alcohol. Apply a small bit over affected area and let dry.

, Green tea is an astringent that's packed with lots of antioxidants, which help reduce signs of aging by fighting free radicals. Steep a tea bag in some hot water, remove the tea bag along with all the liquid, and place onto affected area briefly.

, Rub an ice cube over the acne on your face until the area goes numb. When your face goes numb, stop; leave your face alone until it's warm again.

, If your acne is painful, it should help ease the pain.

, When one section goes numb, move to the next section.

,, Eye drops, at least the ones that reduce redness in the eyes, can be helpful in reducing redness and signs of irritation in acne. Drop a few eye-drops onto a Q-Tip and apply as necessary onto the pimple(s).

, The cold Q-Tip will soothe as it reduces inflammation.

, Antihistamines suppress the swelling effect in the skin tissue of people. Most of these remedies can be ingested in pill form, but some can be consumed as tea or used as a topical agent. These should offer a reduction in redness. Natural herbal antihistamines include:

, This may sound weird, because touching nettles in the wild can produce a rash not unlike small pimples. Some doctors, however, recommend taking a freeze-dried preparation of stinging nettle, which is known for its ability to reduce the amount of histamine the body produces.

, Europeans have a long history of using the plant to cure skin conditions. The leaves can either be ground up into a paste or coltsfoot extract can be ingested in pill form.

, Heat a couple sprigs of basil leaves up under some steam and apply gently to the hives. Basil may help reassure the body that the foreign agent causing the hives is not something it should be fighting.

, There are antibiotics and other oral acne medications that can target infected skin and clear it up very fast.

Wash your whole body with an oil-free, medicated body wash. You want one with an active ingredient of 2% salicylic acid.,
Moisturize with an oil-free, medicated lotion.,
Spot treat with acne medication cream.,
Apply retinol cream.,
Use AHAs and BHAs.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Bacne2," Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash is a particularly good product with this. Concentrate on the areas with pimples and wait a minute or so before rinsing to get rid of all the oil. Let the medicine sink in and do its work.

, Your skin is an organ in your body. Not figuratively, but literally. And like other organs in your body, it needs water and other nutrients in order to look and feel its best. Use lotion on your back whenever you've washed it (daily).


Alternatively, use a non-medicated lotion, but be sure that it is guaranteed to be non-comedogenic. This is necessary because salicylic acid dries out your skin.

, Since you are already using salicylic acid to wash and moisturize, use a different medicine for spot treatment, such as 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Do not use 5% or 10% benzoyl peroxide if you have extremely sensitive skin because this will increase irritation. If you're sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, a 10% sulfur solution may work for you instead.

, Put a retinol cream on your back at night. This exfoliates your skin and prevents breakouts in tough places.

, Alpha Hydroxy Acids are essentially exfoliants, sloughing off dead skin that tends to clog pores and cause acne. Beta Hydroxy Acids fight the acne bacteria from the inside out. If you can, try to find a body scrub with AHAs and wash with that scrub three times per week. After showering and moisturizing, wipe your back with BHA-medicated pads., It's entirely possible that this is a condition which requires prescription acne pills or topical creams. Don't be afraid to see a dermatologist to make sure.

"
"
Exfoliate by using an abrasive sponge or a loofah.,
Go to the beach.,
Try out zinc.,
Make a natural exfoliating scrub.,
Change your skin's pH.",How to Get Rid of Bacne3," However, don't scrub too hard, or you'll increase irritation.

, Have your back submerged within the salt water of the beach for about 10 minutes. Sit in the sun for 10-15 minutes. The sun will dry out the pimples. Do not do this for longer though because if you get burnt, it will make your acne a lot worse. Repeat this process a few times more and you will notice results within the first two days.

, Not a common household cure for acne, but certainly effective in some cases, zinc is a known enemy of acne.Zinc is a metal that humans need in small doses to perform essential functions. In addition to treating acne, it is used to boost the human immune system. Zinc can be used to treat bacne in two different ways:


Apply zinc directly to skin. Try finding a lotion with 1.2% zinc acetate and erythromycin 4% and rub it into the skin twice daily. If you can't find this, puncture a zinc gel tablet, squeeze some of the gel onto your clean finger or a Q-tip, and apply directly to your back.
Ingest zinc as a part of your daily vitamin regimen. Try taking zinc picolinate daily, about 25 to 45 mg. Do not take more than 50 mg daily, as this could put you at risk of copper deficiency, as larger doses of zinc interfere with copper absorption., This will help remove dead skin cells that can clog pores and cause breakouts. Squeeze one grapefruit into a bowl with 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of coarse sea salt. Massage into the affected areas, then pat dry.

, pH is another word for the alkalinity of your skin. Scientists have determined that a skin pH of below 5 — the ideal being 4.7 — is beneficial to overall skin health and bacterial flora that help the skin.Showering and using soap, in particular, can cause the skin's pH to go above 5, leading to dryness, scaliness, and breakouts.


Consider changing your shower head. Invest in a shower head that filters out the chlorine in your water. Your skin will thank you for it. Very decent shower head pre-equipped with filters only cost $25 to $50 and can have a profound impact on your skin.
Prepare a mix of one part apple cider vinegar and one part filtered drinking water in a spray bottle. After showering and before bed, spray the vinegar solution on your skin and let dry. This process will naturally lower your skin's pH.Instead of apple cider vinegar, use equal parts witch hazel and filtered water for the same effect.

Make a list of things you like to do and are good at.,
Consider how you can make your product unique, high quality, and something people might want or need.,
Write down your ideas.,
Name your business/brand and products.,
Do some market research.,
Determine shipping costs.,
Send out your orders as fast as you can.,
Take advantage of postal discounts.,
Think about where on the Internet you will sell your product or service.,
Plan on how you will accept payment.",How to Start an Online Business As a Kid1,"


Go over your list and write down any ideas you can come up with to turn your knowledge and talents into money.
Think about the things you want to sell first. Is it a physical product? Is it a digital product that can be sent over the Internet, like a game or an image file?;
,


Make rough sketches showing you how you want your product to look if you think this might help you. Include inner parts and mechanisms if there are any. Make notes of the function and operation.

,


Writing down your ideas is a good practice even if your business has already developed.
Write down the materials you will need to make your products.

, Come up with catchy descriptive names that people will remember. You want repeat customers, so help them find you again.


Create a logo.You can create a logo that describes and gives off the feel of your business.
Write good product descriptions for everything you want to sell.

, Search for similar products and note the design, materials, finished product, and price points.


Set your prices. Consider the cost of materials, how much time it takes you to make it, and take into consideration what your competitors are charging.
Make sure your price is fair to your customer, and also fair to you. Don't just sell something really cheap thinking you'll sell more. If it's too cheap people will think the quality is bad and won't buy from you. Of course, when you're selling to people in your school you can make cheap prices because they'll see exactly what they're getting, not just a picture.

, Weigh your item, along with the packaging you'll use to ship it. Then look up postage on the post office website.


Use a postal scale to get the right weight so you can estimate the cost of postage. If you don't have access to a postal scale, see if your parents can weigh it at work, or go to the post office... they'll be happy to weigh it for you even if you aren't sending it out that day.
Consider the cost of packaging. The post office has free boxes for priority mail, but if you're sending first class to save money you'll need to furnish your own boxes or padded envelopes. Add these costs to your shipping price. You don't want to spend all your profits on shipping.

, People who shop on-line expect fast delivery. Make sure you do this if you want repeat customers. Keep them happy.

, If you're paid by PayPal, you should go into your account and click on ""Print Shipping Label"" next to your customer's name to buy your postage.


This saves you from needing to go to the post office, and you'll get free tracking, plus a postage discount of about $1. Plus, when you buy tracking at the post office it costs about $1, so by printing postage on-line you will save about $2 for each package... this is profit... more money in your pocket for each order. It adds up! (Or you can pass the savings along to your customers.)
If you buy your postage labels from PayPal you also get $50 free insurance, just in case your package gets lost or damaged. Plus all you have to do is put your package in your mail box and the postman does the rest, no more trips to the post office.
Ask your friends and family to save boxes for you. When you reuse boxes make sure you cover up any bar codes on the outside so they don't get scanned at the post office. Only use boxes that don't show pictures of food or other products. You won't want to use a cereal box or pizza box, it looks unclean and unprofessional... remember, this is a business and you want to make a good impression.
Take care to protect your product from damage in transit. Ask family and friends to save bubble wrap and packing peanuts for you.
Get tracking numbers, and share them with your customer. This way you have proof of delivery if someone tries to scam you.

, Look at the different options for selling venues.

, PayPal is good but you'll need a parent to set up an account for you. Accounts need to be linked to a checking account, so if you don't have one, you'll need to either get one or use your parents.

Discuss every detail of your plans with your parents.,
Start making your on-line store.,
Keep business records.,
Design your on-line store to represent your product and personality but keep the extras in your design minimal.",How to Start an Online Business As a Kid2," This includes your product, how you will get your materials and pay for them, where you will sell your product, how you will brand it, your shipping plans, and of course how you will take payment.


If you show your parents that you've thought out every aspect of your business and have planned for everything, they'll be more likely to support you in your venture. They will probably have some good Ideas to help you too.
If you're selling on-line, you will NEED your parents support. They'll have to either set you up to take payments, or allow you to take payment through their account. Think about it, how will you cash a check or take a credit card if you're too young? You need your parents for this.
If your parents disagree, try to find a compromise. Maybe only work on your business after your homework and chores are done during the week. Use your weekends to do everything you weren't able to get done during the week for your business.
Let your parents know that you understand that running your business will cut into your social life and playing video games and that you're willing to let that happen, within reason. Your parents will want you to do other fun things and enjoy being a kid, so be prepared to show them how you will balance out your activities.
Maybe you can make a deal to earn the right to start your business by promising to show them you can act mature in every aspect of your life, and improve your grades in every subject. Sure, this means you can't start selling right away, but if you're completely sure that you're going to take your business seriously you can use this time to do everything that needs to be done to start your business.

This will show your parents that you're really serious.

, There are many options.


Search Google for free site hosting services. Evaluate each option by reading their terms of use, and learning about all the services they offer. For a stand alone website, you will need the freedom to take payments and do SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so you're found in search.
Check into selling on an established high traffic platform, like eBay or Etsy. They already have a lot of customers on their sites and they make selling easier since you don't need to make a website or do any SEO. They also keep business records for you, so you can go in any time and look at what items sell and what doesn't. Then base your future products on those market trends. Simple.

, Write down everything you spend for your business, all materials, your shipping costs, and how much you sell. Compare your expenses to your income to make sure you're making a profit.

,


No one wants to hear music, don't use it. Remember, that song you like so much will really bother a potential customer if they go to your website when they're at work. They will immediately click away to stop the music and you just lost a sale. You don't want that.
Use a subtle background. You want your products to catch your customers eye, not the background.
Never use anything distracting, like animated gifs or unnecessary flash. Remember, keep focused on your product. You need to look professional if you want people to hand over their hard earned money.
Make sure you have a contacts page, an about page, and a policy page. Your policies will tell customers how you ship and when, what your return policy is if any, and if you take custom orders. For example, if you're making friendship bracelets, tell people you'll make them any color they want or in a different style.
Once your business starts taking off, maybe you can order inexpensive business cards from a site like Vista print and use your logo. Include a card in every order you send so they can remember where they got that great item when it comes time for them to shop for a gift. Of course you can make your own business cards, but make sure they look professional and are cut straight. If you don't have a paper cutter for this, have someone take you to a Kinko's where you can use theirs for free. Before printing out a lot of cards, print out one sample page to show your parents. They will tell you if your cards look professional or if you need to make changes.

Furthermore, many lenders may be hesitant to give a minor a business loan.In addition, you need to think about how much time you have available to dedicate to a business. If you are a student, how will you balance your business and schoolwork? Do you have transportation? Are you able to devote time every day to running a business?

Ask yourself why you wish to start a business. If you simply wish to earn money, then getting a job is a much better option. It will allow you to gain valuable experience and generate income until you turn 18 and can begin a business without the considerable roadblocks you will face as a minor.
The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a good deal of information for young entrepreneurs, such as whether or not entrepreneurship is right for you, how to write a business plan, find a sponsor, register your business, and apply for any necessary permits. You can find this information on their website here: https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/how-start-business/business-types/young-entrepreneurs

, If you have a supportive parent, they may be able to assist you with certain parts of the process. For instance, you can apply for a credit card under a parent or guardian's account. Or they may agree to act as an authorized signer so you can establish a corporation or LLC, which allows you to separate your personal and business assets.They may also help you open a bank account

Keep in mind that the adult who signs for you is liable should you fail to make payments or fulfill other duties of the business.
While you may want to incorporate your business as an LLC, keep in mind that this may be unnecessary. You can have a successful business that operates as a sole proprietorship. This will eliminate the need for a parent or guardian to sign for you.

, Unless your business is mowing lawns or babysitting, if you made a profit you may have to pay income tax and self-employment tax to the IRS. If your profit is over $400, you may owe self-employment tax, which means paying your share of Social Security and Medicaid taxes as well as the Social Security and Medicaid taxes for any employees."

Choose a business location.",How to Start a Business As a Teenager," One of the simplest ways for teenagers to start a business is to turn assigned tasks around the house, in to a service that can be offered to others. Chances are if your parents find value in you doing a particular task, others will too.


Start a pet walking service. There are many people who are not able to come home during the day to let their pets out. By offering to walk their dog (or another pet) for a small fee, you will not only be providing a valuable service, but will get exercise in the process.
Clean houses. You're probably already a pro at keeping your room tidy, so why not help others organize and clean their own houses. Start small, by offering to clean or organize one room, before moving on to the whole house.
Do yard work. Every season provides an opportunity to work outside. Whether it's shoveling snow in the winter, raking leaves in the fall or planting flowers in the spring, there are no shortages of outdoor tasks that you can do for a fee.;
, Turn your skill of painting or sewing into a business that can reach others on a larger scope. With sites such as Etsy, launching a successful online business, is easy and accessible to anyone with a computer and internet.


Set up an account on an online site such as Etsy. Listings are active for four months or until they sell. Once purchased, there is a small commission fee and a standard PayPal payment processing fee. Take pictures of your artwork or crafts. You'll need a digital camera which can take high resolution shots, as customers will want to see the quality of your work.

, Keep in mind that the name of your business will serve as a first impression to your customers. The name has to encapsulate the practical usefulness of your products or services for your customers, signal your differentiation from competitors and embody the philosophy of your business. Brainstorm potential names for your product or service, remembering that, the more your name communicates to consumers about your business, the less effort you must exert to explain it. Once you have a name in mind, be sure to research whether an existing business or product goes by the same name. More than likely you will be able to find this information by doing a few, simple searches online, but just in case, you can always use a tool such as The Thomas Registrar, a particularly useful (and free) resource for finding unregistered trademarks Consult with friends and family before finalizing the name. Have them write down what comes to mind when they hear the name of your business.
Revise the name, if necessary, based on feedback you have received.

, Find out who your competitors are and what the need is for your chosen product/service. Remember to be specific when doing your research. Even if your product or service fills a unique gap in the market, there are always other companies offering something similar, or there are other ways to satisfy the same customer’s need. The key when thinking about your competition is to learn what makes the customer choose one product or service over another Spend some time online looking for initial information regarding your competition and also the market as a whole. For example, do a quick Google search for, “dog walkers near me,” and see what comes up. You’ll get a fairly good idea of how popular the idea is, based on the results.
Once you’ve determined who your competitors are, don’t be shy about reaching out to them, as they can be a valuable resource for gaining a better understanding as to what to expect and what the actual need is in the market.

, It is crucial to the success of your business, to figure out who can benefit the most from your product or service. The better you understand your customer, the faster your business will grow. When determining your target audience, you will need to consider demographics such as age, gender, race, etc.


Create an initial list of potential customers including as much detail as you can think of. For example, my customers will be local families, with two incomes, who own a dog and work long hours. There is no such thing as including too much detail when it comes to defining your audience!
Survey your target audience to get a sense for whether or not they would use your product or service. Be sure to ask lots of questions to determine the usefulness of your product, with respect to your target population.

, If you are not able to fund the startup of your business from money you have saved, you will need to find someone who can help you with financing. Before reaching out to a parent, guardian or another adult for help, be sure to have an outline of how much money you will need, how it will be spent and what your plan is for reimbursing any borrowed funds.


Create a simple, but detailed budget for your business.
Assess how much money you already have and what additional funds you will need, based on your budget.
Detail how you plan to generate money and reimburse investors.
Present both your business plan and budget to potential investors.

, This can be anything from actual equipment you may need, to personnel you may need to hire. A less is more approach is often useful when initially starting out, particularly when it comes to staying on track with your budget, but do be sure you have the adequate tools needed in order to be successful.


Don’t hesitate to purchase pre-owned equipment, if applicable, and make use of existing equipment when possible.
Seek help from friends and family for temporary staffing solutions. This may not be a long term solution, particularly if your business is successful, but initially, volunteers can be a great way to affordably grow your business.

, Spreading the word about your business is another crucial step to ensuring your venture is a successful one. These days it is easier than ever to market your product or service, thanks to the internet.


Start by creating a website for your business. There are many sites available, which are free and easy to use, such as WordPress or Tumblr.
Utilize social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to spread the word. It’s essentially free advertising and is a great way to spread the word quickly and easily.
Create a business card, which contains a few pertinent details about your business, including the website and your contact information.
Reach out to local businesses. Ask if you can post a flyer with your information, so that other people in the community can contact you.

, After putting in the hard work and long hours it takes to launch a new business, you deserve to celebrate. If you're introducing a new product in a physical location, throw a launch party. Similarly, you can offer a ""new business special,"" which features reduced rates, for any services you're providing.


Contact your neighbors. One of the easiest ways to launch your new business is to reach out to the people next door (literally). Provide your neighbors with a list of your services, a flyer or a business card and ask them to spread the word.
Have fun! You have successfully started a business as a teenager. You deserve to enjoy the moment and take pride in what you have created.

, If you plan on taking your business to the next level, you'll need to have a plan in place. Using what you learned in the research phase, create a business plan, which is a written description of your business's future, a document that tells what you plan to do and how you plan to do it. Not only will having a business plan help you to stay focused, but it will also serve as a valuable tool for growing your business.


Gather all of your materials from the research phase, including information about your target audience and market.
Consult online resources, such as, https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Business-Plan, for how to write the plan and what to include.

, As your business continues to grow and becomes more than just a hobby, you may be required to register it. Additionally, to run your business legally, there are certain federal and state licenses and permits you will need to obtain. Seek the help of a parent, legal guardian or another trusted adult to help you determine if your business does in fact need to be registered.


Start by consulting online resources such as wikiHow to learn more about the process: https://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Company

Before registering your business with state agencies, you will also need to determine if you fit into one of the following categories:

A corporation
A nonprofit organization
A limited-liability company or partnership


It might be best to hire an attorney to help you sort out the legal side of your business, but remember to consider your financial situation before doing so and to involve your parent or guardian in the process, as well.

, These days, businesses can be run from just about anywhere. Some businesses can be run successfully from out of the home, while others need a physical location in order to run smoothly.


Consider what will work best for your business, with respect to your target audience, also keeping in mind your finances.
If a physical location is necessary, be sure to choose a location that is close to your target audience. You may want to utilize a space that is either free or low in cost, when initially getting your business off the ground. Consider sharing a space. Retail space sharing helps small business owners pool their resources and support each other for shared success. "

Start planning some salary intake.,
Check the weather.,
Get a small table.,
Make flyers or spread it by word of mouth.,
Start out by making the treats.,
Make your delicious lemonade!,
Keep a cooler under the table with extra lemonade.,
Offer to-go service or for people to sit down to enjoy their food with a refreshing drink.,
Make sure you keep a detailed schedule of your sales.,
Make sure everything looks clean, including yourself.",How to Start a Bake Sale/Lemonade Stand (Kids)," You can go near the baseball field, the basketball court, or your school (with permission), but preferably, the safest way to set up shop, is in your own front yard.;
, You're gonna wanna plan on how much you want to make in the course of a month. If you have friends helping you, you're gonna have to share or it's gonna be unfair. But if you are doing this by yourself, you're good to go!

, Remember, you don't wanna set up shop, and it starts to rain on everything. So check on your computer or phone for weather updates.

, Make sure it is clean. If not, just use some soap, and hose it off. Also, get a clean tablecloth, and two wooden dowels and glue them to the corners of your stand. You will need to make a sign (extra colorful and special!) so the dowels help it stay up. You could also try a large, sturdy box.

, Tell your friends, family, and anyone else you think of just so everyone could know about your awesome stand! Business is good, but it could always be better.

, The number one thing about this step: DON'T BUY! Homemade is key. It just won't be special if you buy Yodels, Twinkies, or Ho Ho's, when you can make your own version at home. Make mini cakes, brownies, Rice Krispie treats, doughnuts, and mini berry tarts.

, Again, homemade is key, so here is how to start out for a big 15 pitcher servings: Add 3 cups of water to 2 cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice to 2 and 1 half cups of sugar. You can perfect this recipe to your liking as business gets better.

, As the crowd gets bigger and heats up, you don't wanna run to the kitchen while a mob of thirsty people hound you over. Also, it may be a good idea to keep a bag of ice in the cooler and a plate of fresh mint leaves on the table. If you want, you can keep some lemon slices in a plastic bag in the cooler as well.

, Your parents may not approve of this so get their permission. If they say no,well they will just have to eat on the go!

, You don't have to do this, it is just to make you look more productive. You could record your profit. It could also be a notebook filled with scribbles not sales.

, After all the preparation you did, you may be a bit dirty. Take a quick shower before you start to sell the goods.

Inventory your skills and hobbies.,
Add up the cost of materials.,
Sell to your classmates.,
Promote your items online.",How to Start a Business as a Minor2," Maybe you like to cook. Perhaps you make earrings and necklaces in your spare time. A lot of people have a skill or two that most people don’t have. If that sounds like you, you might be able to start a business manufacturing something unique and selling it at a profit. Being able to sell something unique is the key. You’re probably never going to make plain white t-shirts and make any money selling them, because huge manufacturers already make plain white shirts and they sell them more cheaply than you can even make them. But no one can make exactly the same cookies you can make, and no one can make exactly the same custom earrings you make. It’s the uniqueness of these items that makes them worth more than generic items.

, If you don’t know how much you spend making what you sell, there’s no way to know how to price each item. Be very specific when you make calculations. You need to know the cost per unit of each and every item, and you need to know how much time it takes you to make each item.For instance, if you’re making cookies, you need to know how much flour, in dollars and cents, is in each cookie, and you need to know how much each cookie costs you to make. If each cookie costs you a dollar to make, and it takes you an hour to make and bake 24 cookies, you know you’re going to have to sell each cookie for at least three dollars and sell about fifty cookies to even make $100. Do you think you can sell fifty cookies before they go stale?

, When you’re just getting started, it’s a good idea to use your classmates to test out your products (as long as you’re selling the type of product they can afford). When you’re selling unique items, it’s very important to get feedback about what people like and don’t like about your products. After all, you have more control over your own products than anyone else, and you can modify them to make them more marketable .Some schools don’t allow this kind of thing, but sometimes are willing to grant more leeway with respect to selling unique, handcrafted items than they are selling things like candy. Even if you can’t sell on school property, you can still sell to classmates outside of school.

, While you might need a credit card to open a webpage with an online store, you won’t need one to post items for sale on Craigslist, Facebook, or even to advertise them on a free blog, like Tumblr. Take attractive, well lit pictures of your items, and post them in your advertisements along with descriptions that are clear and free of spelling and grammatical errors."

Watch people’s pets.,
Babysit people’s children.,
Provide neighborhood lawn care.,
Wash and detail people’s cars.,
Tutor other students.,
Be reliable.",How to Start a Business as a Minor3," If you’re good with animals, starting a petsitting service can be a good way to get into business. The costs to you are mostly limited to promoting the service by printing out fliers and business cards, and the pay can be decent--$10-$20 for a dog walk, double that for an overnight stay.When you’re advertising your business, start local, especially if you don’t have a car. Post your fliers in community clubhouses, and leave leaflets on people’s doors. Find out more about starting a petsitting business at Start a Pet Sitting Business.

, If you’re a little older and you like children, babysitting can be a good way to make money. A teenage babysitter won’t get paid as much as an adult would, but they can still make $10 or more an hour, and even more if there are multiple children involved.If you plan on babysitting for more than six months, you should invest in taking a CPR/First Aid class. Not only will it help you respond to an emergency, you’ll get paid more if you do. You can find a CPR class near you at http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/CPR_UCM_001118_SubHomePage.jsp.
Again, it’s a good idea to start in your neighborhood. However, a lot of babysitters are older teenagers who have cars, and many parents are willing to provide transportation to the right sitter, so you can advertise more widely within your local area.

, Another way to make money is by providing lawn care in your neighborhood. People are often willing to let a neighborhood kid cut their grass, and it will give you a way to get a little extra spending money.The downside to this is that lawn care is hard work. It takes a lot of hours and requires a lot of equipment. On top of everything, people won’t pay a minor the same rate as an adult. Add on the fact that you’re most likely confined to your neighborhood (unless you have transportation), and you'll see it’s hard to make a steady income from it.

, Another good neighborhood business to start is washing and detailing cars. You can usually charge at least as much to wash a car as you can to cut grass, it will take about the same amount of time, and you won’t need to buy as much equipment.The downside is, like lawn care, it can be physically demanding and take up a lot of your time.

, If you have good grades, you may be able to get a job tutoring other students who need help with school. You can help kids learn how to read, teach algebra to middle school students, or help high school students practice for their SATs.

Tutoring does not mean that you do the homework for clients or give test answers to other students. Instead, your job is to help them understand the concepts so that they can do the work themselves. Make sure you understand the line between teaching others and cheating.
You can advertise your services to both students and parents.

, While all business owners need to be reliable, those offering services need to be extra reliable. After all, few will notice if the kid selling candy on the subway misses a day of work, but everyone will notice if their babysitter doesn’t show up.


Keeping a calendar of your jobs and assignments is a good way of keeping on top of things so you can stay reliable. It also helps to tell your friends and family about upcoming jobs. That way, if it slips your mind, they might remember.

Provide a good more conveniently than it is currently being provided.,
Buy in bulk to get the best price.,
Don’t squander your profits.,
Keep records.,
Try new things and take risks.",How to Start a Business as a Minor4," The fancy word for buying low and selling high is “arbitrage.” All arbitrage means is buying something at one price and selling it somewhere else for a higher price. The biggest trick to pulling it off is finding a good that people want but have a hard time getting, and making it convenient for them to buy it.For example, if your school allows it, you can buy candy cheap in bulk, and sell it to your classmates during lunch. Make sure to buy candy and snacks that are not available at your school.
Wheeling and dealing like this is one of the best ways for a young person to get into business, because you don’t need to get a loan or sign a contract to start--anyone can do it. , In order to make a profit, you need to sell for more than you paid. The easiest way to do that is to buy in bulk—sellers charge less for high amounts of good than they do for small amounts. Buying in bulk is also called buying wholesale. Some notable wholesalers are Sam’s Club, Costco, and BJ’s, but you’ll need a membership, and you might not be able to get one as a minor. However, retailers like Amazon and Walmart have prices almost as low as wholesale.For example, if you buy a box containing thirty full-sized Reese’s, Hershey’s, and KitKat at $15, (the going price on Amazon), you can easily sell them for $1 apiece, which will double your money., After you do make a profit, you’ll probably be tempted to go spend your profits on something fun. While you should have a little reward for your hard work, keep the spending to a minimum. Since, as a minor, you probably don’t have many expenses, keep at least half of your profits to put towards your next purchase.The more money you have, the larger the quantities you can buy (meaning lower prices and more profit) and the more expensive items you can buy.

, It’s easy to fall into the trap of not keeping records. As a business person, it’s crucial that you do keep records. You need to record your total costs and sales, the length of time it took you to sell what you have, profits on each unit sold, and costs for each unit. This kind of information is vital to have, because it helps you minimize your own costs and adapt to what people want to buy.Don’t just get estimates of these numbers. You need to know all of them down to the cent. To get your total costs and sales, just add up how much money you spent and how much you took in. To get the per unit cost, take the total costs and divide it by the number you units you bought. To get the profit per unit, take the total sales and subtract the total costs. Next, divide it by the number of units.

, There’s no better time to try new business strategies than when you’re a minor and your parents are footing the bill for your basic expenses. There’s much less for you to risk when someone’s guaranteeing a roof over your head. Try selling in new locations and selling different items at different prices. Adopt the practices that work and discard the ones that don’t.It’s okay to risk, but don’t risk everything on a new strategy. Always keep whatever money you’ll need to maintain your current operations. Only spend what’s leftover on the new strategy.

Use good manners when you make a sale.",How to Run a Lemonade Stand," Did you know there are laws about where you can set up a stand? Before you even start considering setting up, make sure it isn't against the rules in your area. To find out if you're allowed to set up a stand, see if you need to get a permit or comply with any laws.Ask your parents to find out whether you can set up a stand. Let them know that you need a permit in many states.
Or find out yourself by calling your local Better Business Bureau to get more information.;
, If you live on a dead-end street or a small road, you might want to try a place that gets more foot traffic. Intersections are also good spots, since you have people passing from more than one direction. Make sure the spot you choose is safe. Don't set up too close to streets or highways.


You should seriously consider setting up in your front yard or home area. This works especially if you live on a busy street or in a big apartment complex. Plus you would be able to get supplies easily rather than carrying them all the way to another location.
Be careful about setting up in public parks or outside sporting events. Many states have passed laws against letting people sell lemonade in these areas without any sort of permission., Try to have someone help you so you can take turns doing different jobs. It's also more fun to have someone else there.


If you are planning a long day of selling, make sure you seriously trust the person taking shifts not to steal any money. An untrustworthy business-partner can ruin your stand!

, If it's a long day and you're thirsty, you'll end up drinking all the lemonade and eating all the snacks (if you made any)., You would want to make it not too expensive so no one would buy your products, and not too cheap so you would barely make any money. If you're using fresh lemons, fresh ice and large cups, you could probably charge $1.00 to $1.25 per cup. If you're using a powdered mix and serving up small cups, people probably won't pay more than $0.25 to $0.50. Often, lemonade stands are either under or over priced, and the kids running them don't earn much money. Be sure to start out with some coins and bills for change.

, Get some poster board and markers so you can make a big, inviting, and colorful sign to hang on your stand. The sign should say what you're selling and how much it costs. Use cheerful hand lettering that's neatly done. You might want to draw a picture of lemons or lemonade to make your sign more attractive.


You can also make signs to post around the neighborhood. Tell people where to go to buy lemonade.
If you do this, make sure you take down the signs when you take down your stand.

, This can include:

Multiple flavours of lemonade
Other beverages (such as soda)
Small treats (either homemade or storebought) such as cookies

, If it is a very hot day outside, you should consider putting up some shade, chairs, and foldable tables too. You won't believe how much more inviting your stand would look. If you can, you could even get a TV or a large tablet and hang it up so customers can watch any programs such as sports games going on. Get creative! The more creative, the more likely people will come to your stand!, A small card table should be big enough to fit your lemonade pitcher, cups, napkins and any treats you're offering. Get a chair for each person who will be running the stand with you. To attract more customers, use a pretty (but not distracting) tablecloth, and tape your sign to the front. Bright colors will get people to look at your table, and ponder whether or not they want to buy something.

, Not all lemonade is created equal. It's worth coming up with a tasty recipe so you don't disappoint your customers. Be sure to sample each batch to make sure it has just the right amount of sweet and sour flavors before you try to sell it. Always serve your lemonade with ice to keep it cold. Here are three ways to make lemonade:Make it from scratch with fresh-squeezed lemons. For one gallon of lemonade, you need 2 cups of fresh lemon juice and 2 cups of white sugar. Mix well so the sugar dissolves.
Make it from concentrate. You can buy a can of frozen lemonade concentrate in the freezer aisle of your grocery store. Mix it with water according to the instructions on the package.
Make it from powder. Get a can of powdered lemonade. Follow the instructions to dissolve the powder in cold water.

, Small paper cups are a popular choice, but you can use larger plastic cups if you'd like. One package of cups usually comes with enough to sell a days' worth of lemonade. Get a package of napkins, too.

, Why stop at lemonade? Since you're setting up a stand, you might as well offer other treats, too. Cookies, brownies and other baked goods are fun to sell. You could also offer a bigger variety of drinks. Strawberry lemonade, iced tea or fruit punch are refreshing drinks customers might enjoy. Some websites let you sign up to start a lemonade stand or bake stand, and donate part of your profit to help end hunger.

, If you sit quietly, they may not feel encouraged to come to your table and buy lemonade. Smile and say, ""would you like a cup of lemonade?"" That way people will notice your table and be more likely to buy something. Be prepared to answer questions if they ask. Make sure to talk loudly. Even if they don't buy anything, don't be shy to say ""Have a good day!"".

, Potential customers won't want to buy anything if you get irritated with them. If they have kids, talk to them and pay them a compliment. If they are just adults, act joyful and polite and just be yourself. If they decide not to buy anything, just smile and politely tell them ""Have a good day!"" as they leave.

, When customers want to buy some lemonade, carefully pour a cup and hand it to them with a napkin. Once they have the lemonade in their hands, take their money and place it in your cash register. Don't forget to tell them thank you! After all, they just bought something from your lemonade stand. With luck, they'll tell their friends to visit your stand. Remember to always be nice to your customers, a common expression is ""the customer is always right."" While they're good exceptions to this rule (like a customer asking you to fire a completely professional employee), it is a good guideline."

, Make it small, but allow yourself to work with it.

,, How much do other people providing that service charge?

, If low on money from your idea, then use word of mouth by telling your parents to tell your friend's parents. Your friend's parents will tell other people until a lot of people know about your business. If you still have money, print fliers and banners.

, I sell at weekly markets, and that's where I advertise. If one of your parents owns a shop at the mall, see if they will allow you to sell in front of it for a price, or if they will let you use one day a week also for a price

, Price your services accordingly. Don't be outrageous. If you see someone doing the same service as you, check their prices and go a little lower than that at first. When you gain experience you can raise the price. Let's say you made everything for 10.00, then you want to make 5.00 profit and want to make more for 10.00. Then you would price it at 25.00.

, Make money and remember to keep some profit to buy more of your product, get more of your invention, or enhance your service. Goodbye and good luck! May the money be with you!

, It's timeless. It's just country and it speaks for itself. Moreover, country is what you decide it is; after all, it's where you live or come from, so define it as you see and feel it. Maybe you have horses, hunt deer or wild hogs, see raccoons or possums in the yard, chase kangaroos off your garden, milk dairy cows, live among the tui or Kereru birds; whatever is around you can become part of your room's theme.

, It's easier to begin on paper, with a sketch and perhaps a list, so that when you're decorating, there is something to follow. This doesn't mean you're stuck making it exactly as you've drawn up; allow changes as you're decorating, as this is part of the creative process.

, Choose a color that suits both you and fits your idea of what is country. Perhaps you like eucalyptus green to represent gum trees. Maybe you'd like barnyard red trim around the window sills, to show off your love of all things in the barn.


Avoid bland colors or colors that are a bit too urban. Grey is a good color to avoid; it's too symbolic of concrete, a major city item.






Black and white might work if you're on a dairy farm but take care it doesn't look too stark; be sure to have plenty of dairy cow pieces to make it evident why you chose this combination.







, Once it's painted, you can start adding everything else.

, Choose wooden furniture; this speaks best to the idea of all things country. However, you could also choose things made from wool, leather, natural fibers, etc.


Log furniture is cozy country.







, Lamps, rugs, bedsheets, blankets, etc.. You will know if it matches the theme.


Choose thick, woven textures for soft furnishings. These will wear well, as things need to when living in the country.






Get a camouflage or horse bedspread. And choose country-themed pillows; covers can feature animals, plants and country objects.






Rugs could be real or imitation steer skin, place rabbit fur scraps on your wooden dresser, etc.







, These ""things"" can be varied, including paintings, banners, prizes, photos, wooden plaques, clothing, etc. Choose whatever you feel fits the theme.

Remember that pillows are your friend!",How to Give Your Bedroom an Underwater Theme," Do you want your room to look straight out of 'The Little Mermaid'? Do you want dolphins and whales galore? Or are you trying for a more subdued approach?;
, For an underwater theme, you should be looking into greens, blues, beige, creams, light pinks, yellows, etc;. Think of all of the colors commonly found in coral or the ocean!

, Nothing will add an underwater feel to a room more so than textures. Consider a sponge treatment on your walls, or hire a college student to paint something on one wall!

, Having a white ceiling can destroy any themed room. A light beige or cream, that is further mirrored in pillow cases or an area rug can really bring the room together.

, Collect seashells, sand, etc; and keep them in containers or in an empty fish tank in your room! For one step further, perhaps get a fish tank and fill it with your favorite fish! (Note: do not put fish into sand you took from the beach, it can kill the fish)

, A multi colored blue/beige comforter can really tie this room together.

, The more pillows the better! different textures, sizes, colors, shapes... Make your room feel comfortable for you.

Done.",How to Give Your Bedroom an Ocean Mermaid Theme," What colors are already okay for an ocean theme and would fit in well? Which colors would likely not work that well? After deciding this, work out what you are able to change and what you have to live with. For example, if your bright red desk is the only desk you can ever have, consider covering it with a muted cloth rather than demanding a new desk. Work around anything expensive that is unlikely to fit the theme, as you probably won't be able to replace it. For cheaper things, such as bedding and cushions, change should be fairly easy to achieve, as you can make your own items or embellish existing things to give them a mermaid touch.;
, If you're allowed to change the wall color, that's a major makeover. Or, you may just wish to change the bedding, curtains and a few pictures. Once you've decided which areas will be made over, you can draw up the new design ideas. Some things to consider include:


Painting the walls blue, aqua or light green, to represent the ocean.
Adding motifs to the walls, wardrobe doors and curtains, such as shells, mermaids, crabs, dolphins, seals, etc.
Buying or making a duvet cover with a mermaid or sea design. Adding matching sheets, etc.

, Use this to guide your makeover and to keep you within budget. Where possible, rely on reusing things you already own or creating your own items (such as drawings and sewing things).


Painting your bedhead blue, perhaps? Then adding a mermaid or sea decal to it?

, If you're allowed to change the wall color, get your parents and/or older siblings to help you to paint the walls a new color.


Another alternative is sea-colored wall paper with a mermaid, shell, dolphin or sea-related trim. Wallpapering is hard work and pricey though, so be sure to ask for your parent's opinion and permission before getting carried away with this idea.

, Whether newly painted or an existing wall color, you can add posters and wall decals. Grab some fish cutouts or any ocean cut outs and hang them on your walls and hanging from your ceiling. If you can find mermaid cut outs, hang those too. Also use your own mermaid and sea drawings and color them in before pinning them up.


Add posters depicting the sea, such as tropical islands, dolphins swimming, shells, the glistening ocean, etc.
Draw pictures of sharks, dolphins, whales, mermaids, etc.

, Either purchase ocean-themed curtains or make your own. You could jazz up existing curtains by stitching on fabric motifs with sea-related designs on them. Or, stitch on shells that hang from little holes pierced in them.

, Here are some ideas:


Get inflatable palm trees and hula girls for the tropical look from dollar stores. Or get beautiful murals of the ocean fish and of course, mermaids.
Add some starfish and shells around the room so it seems as if they washed up on shore. Also, you can collect mermaid figurines and put them on a special shelf very neatly or as if they are in the sea enjoying their time with each other.

, If you have your own tail(s), hang them on your walls to show you are a true mermaid. But, hang them up so that they are easy to get down when you want to go swimming.

, If you live near the beach, go outside often to collect extra sea-related items for your room. Shells, driftwood, sand and ocean water (in a little bottle) could all be incorporated into your room over time.

, Only do this if you know how to care for fish, like doing so and have a good budget for keeping fish. It's a time-consuming and pricey hobby, so your heart must be fully in it.

, Buy ocean/mermaid jewelry. For example, a necklace with a seashell on it.

, A perfect, ocean mermaid themed bedroom!

Clean out everything in your room.,
Think about the color scheme.,
Paint your walls in the color of your choice.,
Choose your furniture.,
Have a type of Storage.,
You can choose hundreds of furnishings and finishing touches for your bedroom.",How to Design a Stylish Tween Bedroom (Girls)," Sort out all the papers, furniture, toys, books, pens, pencils, clothes, EVERYTHING. This may take a while. Don't worry. Spread it out over a few days. You may have a pigsty of a room for a while, but at the end, your room will be spotless. Be sure to scrub the furniture, make the bed, wash your clothes, get rid of unwanted items and make your room clean. You could even get some friends to help, to make it quicker.;
, Try to pick a good colour scheme to make the room look stylish and well-coordinated. A great option is white walls with any other coloured furniture and furnishings. Remember that white goes with ANYTHING. If white isn't your style, why not opt for: pink and purple, blue and purple, yellow and orange, red and grey, green and pink or choose three colours that match. Choose a colour that you like, something vibrant that captures your attention, and you won't get bored of after a few months.

, Make sure you move any furniture out of the way so that it does not get covered in paint that won't wash off.

, Choose necessary, practical furniture for you age type. As a tween, here are some good furniture choices: bed (obviously) - either a single, double or daybed, desk - for all the homework you get, bookshelf - if you have a lot of books, this will be VERY handy, wardrobe - you can even add a full length mirror on the door if you want, bedside table - just in case you can't be bothered to get up! These are all smart ideas, but these are just basics! You may also want: armchair, beanbag, floor lamp, dressing table and many more!

, Tip: There is never too much storage space in a tween's room. Take this from me - I used to have no space for anything, so it ended up on the floor. Cram as many drawers, shelves, tables, cupboards, bins, bags and boxes as you can inside this bedroom. If there is nothing to put in your space, just leave it empty - I can nearly guarantee that there will come a day when there is something to put in them. Think - you need to have space for clothes, books, pens, pencils, make-up, hair accessories, toys and anything else you have. Bet that got you thinking, huh?

, Firstly, choose your bedding. Pick something that contrasts with the walls for a sophisticated look. Then, find/buy as many pillows and soft cushions as you can. Hang up any pictures you want in stylish frames, display your collections, make sure there is lots of cool lighting, and most of all.... CREATE A 'KEEP OUT' SIGN FOR THE DOOR!

",How to Give Your Teen's Room a Makeover," Incorporate details that they enjoy (Favourite colours, places, activities, patterns, etc.) into the room.;
, Make sure to include:


A Bed






A Dresser or Wardrobe
A Desk with a Matching Chair
A Bookshelf
A Mirror
Any Other Mandatory Furniture Pieces You Need.(Guitar stand, a rocking chair, etc.)

, For example, if your son/daughter has an old toy they never play with, ASK THEM IF IT IS OKAY to give to charity. If they say yes, put it in a cardboard box labeled ""For Charity"". If they say no, keep it. You do not want to rid them of a favourite object.

, Make sure it is small enough to fit in their bedroom. Stereotyped styles are white-painted wood for girls, darker-natural wood for boys. You do not have to stick to those styles, but the furniture showroom probably will have it organized that way.

, This is the time a basement or storage place comes in handy. Clean this way:


Remove all precious items first, like instruments, heirlooms, or stuffed animals.






Put pens, pencils, markers, crayons, hair accessories and brushes, and other small items in labeled plastic bags.
Put your clothes, shoes, socks, and other things your child wears in wardrobe boxes that you should put in the basement.
Take books, notepads, paper, notebooks, and other paper items to the basement or storage room.
Bring toys, video games, DVDs, CDs, and other non-electronic entertainment items to your storage area.
Turn off and unplug electronics and lighting and put them in your storage place.
Bring your furniture to your storage place.

, Vacuum and/or mop the floors, wash the windows, dust the ceiling fan; Do everything to get that old room clean.

, Make sure to choose a color that your child will grow with, because their tastes WILL change. Good colors for each gender can be found in the ""Tips"" section of this article.

, Wood has always been popular, but carpet can be good if your child is clumsy. See ""Tips"" for more information.

, Choose white, a timeless classic, for the ceiling fan paint, and a gender neutral light cover.

, Arrange the things you bought like in the floor plan. If you discover that it doesn't work, try another format.

, Put up the blinds and curtains (You will need both!), add the bedding, bring in some lamps that match the room, add some style to the bland, boring, teen-cave.

, If you redid the closet, place clothes and other associated items into their spots. Add books to the bookshelf. Place treasured toys and stuffed animals in discreet, opaque bins in the bookshelf. Put all of the stuff back.

",How to Design a New Bedroom (Teen Girls)," Will it be in your current bedroom, or in another room in your house? Make sure that your parents agree with this before making any other plans.;
, Good colours for teen girls are sky blue, pale green, lilac or red. Unless it is your favourite colour, try not to go for pink or yellow. These can come across as quite babyish. If you don't want a room that is completely one colour, try mixing two or three (see suggested list of matching colours in tips.) Bright carpets are not a good idea. This is because if you ever get bored of the colour of your room, the carpet will not match with whatever colour you choose. Find neutral colours e.g oatmeal, cream or maybe just pale wood.

, Any toys or items you don't want can be put in a car boot or jumble sale, or you could give them to a charity shop. Pack all of the things you do want into boxes. This includes books, notepads, CDs, magazines, general clutter and rarely used make up or jewellery. Protect the fragile things in bubble wrap, then take all the boxes out of your room and put them in a safe place that isn't in anyone's way. It is a good idea to do this before moving the furniture out, because it adds to the stress if you are the still sorting toys when the carpet fitters come.

, Take all your clothes out of your wardrobe and chest of drawers and put them in boxes. Take these into the spare room that you're staying in. Make them easy to get at.

, Many people don't consider curtains when they are adding up the price of their new room project, but they can be very expensive, especially if you have more than one window. Home Base, The Range, PB Teen and Laura Ashley sell high quality curtains. Also remember the curtain rail should match as well.

, Places like 'Home Base', 'B&Q' and 'Wickes' sell lots of paint and wallpaper. The colour of your walls is the base of the colour code of the room. If you have a large room, consider painting 2 of the walls your chosen colour, and paint the other two a neutral colour (see suggested list of matching colours)

, Choose what you want to keep and what to get rid of. Anything you don't want that is worth something can be sold on eBay, in newspaper ads or in a yard sale. Any furniture that is not worth anything can be taken to your local dump. You'll need a lot of space to put all of this while you are painting. Make sure that your room is completely empty of anything that blocks the walls and might get in the way.

, Places like Carpet Right or Hardy Carpets sell a range of many different colours. Get your parents to organize someone from your chosen carpet place to come and measure your room so the people know how big to make the carpet.

, Paint while your old carpet is still down, because you don't want paint splats on your new one. If you want to protect your old carpet, lay down sheets of linen or newspaper on the floor. Painting and putting up wallpaper can be fun and you can get your whole family to help (this gets it done a lot quicker!) Wear old clothes while painting or wallpapering. If you have black or wooden beams then paint them a matching colour. (see suggested list of matching colours.) You may need to apply two or even three coats of paint - it depends on the type.

, Get your parents to phone or visit your chosen carpet company to organise a date which they will come over and put your carpet down. Only when this is done can you move on to the next step.

, Once the carpet is down and the walls are done, move all your furniture back into your room. You may want to move it around to create a whole new design.

Start by getting rid of trash.,
Next, put all the clothes away.,
Go through your desk and bookshelf.,
Take your notebook and get drawing.,
Think about whether you need new furniture or if you can make do with what you have.,
Rearrange the room.,
Look at your walls.,
Look at the windows.,
Look at your bed.,
After a break or days later, organize smaller things.,
Take a step back.",How to Give Your Bedroom a Makeover (Kids)," Take a can or trash bag and go over everyplace in the room, throwing away all you see fit. Old crumpled papers, food wrappers, broken things all belong in the trash.;
, Maybe take this time to clean out your closet (weave link) and get rid of unused clothing. Some of the things in your closet will be trash, like clothes with holes: that goes in the trash bag. Others just don't fit you or are no longer in style; those go in a donation bag or box. Lastly, things you can save with some work go in a repair pile in the corner, like shirts with missing buttons. The good stuff goes back inside the closet but don't get too caught up in it. We'll return to it later. Take your notebook and note any closet supplies you may need like new hangers, door pull or shoe racks.

, Grab your trash and donation containers. Donate books you no longer read, binders in good shape you don't use and unused but unloved office supplies. Trash old papers, pens that don't write and torn or badly beaten school supplies. Write down on your notebook anything new you may need (new notebooks? magazine racks? Bookends?) Put things back in their place loosely: books in the shelves, pens in their containers, etc.

, Try drawing a top view, and shuffle furniture around for different looks. If you can, try to draw and paint several new looks for your room and choose your favorite. Keep in mind any rules you may have, such as not being allowed to paint walls.

, Even after tidying up, you may have too many books for your bookshelf and need a bigger one or want a desk to do homework in. Maybe a new light fixture could make your room much better! Before writing down your need as shopping needs, try to surf the web and you'll probably be able to DIY most of it. A new coat of paint can do wonders for old furniture, or tie a thrift shop find into your decor.

, According to your drawings, put furniture in its new places. This is when you'll be glad you put everything away before getting started because your room will be a mess until you put all in its new places. Keep your cleaning equipment at the ready because you'll find lots of hidden dirt when moving furniture.

, New artwork is very inexpensive to make and DIY works are often the best. Customize your art to the look you want your room to have to make it perfect. Search online for help on how to make your own wall art. If you aren't exactly artistic, you could try wall decals.

, Does the window treatment look old and dull? You may want to replace blinds, curtains, or valances with something more colorful, or just different. This can be a fairly inexpensive item, particularly if you have someone close to you who is able to help you make your own.

, The bed is the central piece of the bedroom and can be spruced up at low cost. Take this chance to change the sheets and flip the mattress. See if you can buy a new duvet or cover for your bed, and even some decorative pillows if you like it. Dyeing a duvet cover or pillow covers can be even cheaper. Adding or painting a headboard can also have a very powerful effect in the room. If you keep things under the bed in boxes, buy a simple bed skirt to make everything look more tidy.

, This will really give your room the finishing touch. After you've bought the new organizing supplies, put them to use. This is when you can organize your closet (weave link), organize your bookshelf, desk and home office (weave links) and other small things like office supplies (simple sort them in pretty containers), electronics like chargers and such, accessories and anything that look out of place.

, Compare with your pictures. Do you have a perfect bedroom or what? Reward yourself with something that smells nice like flowers or incense or another final touch for the room like a framed picture of your friends.

What would be realistic for you and what could fit in your space? Go to PBteen.com and search 'design.' Click on 'Plan Your Room.' This will give you an idea of how you can decorate your room. Also, you can Google search Black and White Bedrooms for more ideas.;
, Go to Ikea, Kohls, Target, or shop online. Walmart and Kmart sell cheap sheet sets if you have a small budget. Get a white feather quilt and a black sheet set, or vice versa. Add black, white, or silver pillows. If you have a favorite color, add some smaller pillows in that color. Pillows with rose or ruffly designs add a girly feel to your room.

, Get a large mirror. If you can afford one, wall mirrors(going from the ceiling to the floor) work well with the black and white color scheme. If that's not available, try an arrangement of mirrors. Get four or five smaller mirrors with different settings. For example, one should have a dark wood cubed look. The next can be faux iron, curly and floral looking. Put them on a boring or drab wall and make it instantly appealing.

, Get a mural with flowers or other designs. Nighttime Cityscapes look really amazing on a grey or silver wall. A green or purple pop on the wall will add color and pleasure to the room.

, You don't necessarily have to paint white or black. Black can make you feel wealthy, but it can really darken a room. Try silver, mocha, beige, purple, or black and white stripes(for a nautical/bohemian look). Paint each wall a new and distinct color.

, You're a teenager now, and homework and study time will take up space. So get a desk! Try a look with a black or brown desk and a modern white chair. Add a pillow to make the chair more comfortable. A small ottoman under the desk would be a nice touch, to give you storage space, fashion, and a place to rest your feet.

, Black and white rooms, especially modern-style, can make a room seem cold or unused. Decorations will help make it feel warm and comfortable. Put up pictures, posters, vases, and more. Try to decorate with colorful modern tones. If your old things don't really work, don't throw them out. Try painting or refurbishing them.

, Some of the most important ways of making a great room is the windows. Lightweight cotton curtains with a black rod(once again, paint your old one, don't buy new) look really nice.

, Put your bed near the window. Keep the bookshelf near your desk. Chairs and beanbags around the entertainment center. Make sure nothing is blocked or hard to get to. Never settle for less then the best!

Add a Christmas tree.,
Hang pine branches if you don't have room from a tree.,
Drape some pine garlands around your room.,
Decorate your tree, pine branches, and pine garlands.,
Hang up some tinsel.,
Put up some Christmas lights.",How to Decorate Your Room for Christmas1," Christmas trees come in all shapes and sizes, but a smaller one might look more proportionate in a bedroom. You might also want to get a fake tree as opposed to a real one. They are less likely to shed leaves and do not need to be watered.


Add a small craft tree if you have some desk or shelf space. Art and crafts stores often sell mini versions of Christmas trees, ranging between 8 and 12 inches (20.32 and 30.48 centimeters). You will also find mini lights and ornaments in the same area.
Get a 2 to 4 foot (0.61 to 1.22 meters) tall tree if you have a larger room or not a lot of furniture. You can stand the tree on a small table, a stool, or even a crate to give it extra height.
Get a ""pencil"" tree if you have a small room or a lot of furniture. Pencil trees can range from 3 to 9 feet (0.92 to 2.74 meters) tall, but they can be as narrow as 8 or 20 inches (20.32 or 50.8 centimeters). They don't take up a lot of space width-wise, and are perfect for corners.
If you yearn for that pine-scent, consider hiding a few real pine branches in your tree. You can also use a pine-scented spray as well.;
, If you don't have much floor space, you can hang pine branches from the ceiling in the corner of your room. You can also dress up these branches with mini battery-operated Christmas lights, tinsel, and ornaments. It might be a good idea to use plastic ornaments instead of glass ones, however.


Make sure to thoroughly rinse the branches so you don't bring home any insects.

, You can even decorate the garland with mini battery-operated Christmas lights, tinsel, and ornaments. Great places to hang such garlands include above your bed, over your window, around your ceiling, and draped over your bookshelves.

, Find some ornaments, lights, beaded garlands, and tinsel. Drape these around your tree, pine branches, or pine garland. If you are hanging your branches or garlands, consider using plastic ornaments instead of glass ones.


Mini Christmas ornaments might look better on pine garlands. You can find them in art and crafts stores, in the same section that sells mini/craft Christmas trees.
If your tree is less than 3 feet (0.92 meters) tall, use mini battery-operated Christmas lights. The plug-in lights might be too long for smaller trees.

, If you can't find any (or don't like) pin garlands, you can hang up some tinsel garlands instead. Great places to hang them include above windows and around ceilings. If you use tape to hang the garlands up, be sure to use clear tape. It will be less visible.

, Great places to hang up lights include above your bed, over your shelves, and around your window. You can get ones that plug into an outlet or battery-operated ones. If you use tape to hang up your lights, try to use clear; it will be less visible on your wall.


If your room has white walls, try to get Christmas lights with white wires instead of the traditional green ones. They will blend into your walls better and clash less.
Unless you are putting them up in your window, avoid getting blinking or flashing lights; those can be very distracting after a while.
Consider matching the lights to your room and decorations. For example, if your room has a lot of cool colors, try getting blue or clear lights. If your room has a lot of warm colors, try getting white or multi-colored lights.
Consider putting ""icicle"" style lights in your window.

Make your own Christmas decorations.",How to Decorate Your Room for Christmas2," You don't need to use curtains with Santas and snowmen on them, but red ones might look more festive than pink ones. Here are a few ideas to get your started:


Use colors such as red or green. Darker shades might look better than brighter ones.
For a rustic cabin feel, switch out your throw or blanket for a cozy quilt or sweater/knitted blanket. Anything made from plaid flannel will also work.
Make an easy sweater pillow by slipping a square-shaped pillow inside a bulky sweater and tying the sleeves in the back.

, If you can't put up a lot of decorations, you can still make your room feel more festive by bringing in scented candles, wax melts, or potpourri. You don't even have to light candles; many scented candles are potent enough on their own. If you are getting candles, consider displaying three different-sized ones on a red, green, gold, or silver candle charger/plate. Listed below are a few Christmas scents:


Gingerbread
Peppermint and Candy Cane
Winter Wonderland
Fireplace
Pine, Spruce, Balsam, and Cedar

, Shelves, dressers, and desks are great for displaying trinkets such as snow globes, nutcrackers, and figurines. If you already have some on your shelves, consider switching them out for Christmasy ones instead. Here are a few ideas to get you started:


If you like nature, put up some pine tree or reindeer figurines.
If you are religious, put up figurines related to the Nativity.
If you like the classical look, put up a snowman, a Santa Clause, or even a nutcracker.
If you don't want to put away any of your existing decorations, consider decorating them instead. For example, if you have a figurine of a cat, try putting a little Santa hat on it.

, If you don't have a lot of room for a tree, you can hang small decorations using thread or clear thread/fishing line instead. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Candy canes and jingle bells can be slung over doorknobs or strung from ribbon.
Christmas cards can be clipped to yarn, jute cord, or ribbon using wooden clothes pins.
Christmas stockings can be tacked to your wall using nails or thumbtacks/pushpins.
Ornaments, plastic icicles, and snowflakes (plastic or paper) can be suspended from thread. They'll look delightful against a wall or window.

, If you like to collect things, setting up a Nativity or Christmas Village scene on your desk or dresser can be just the thing for you. You'll have lots of fun buying figurines and arranging them. You can find them at most arts and crafts stores.


You can also make a Nativity scene at home using popsicle sticks, straw, and wood or clay figurines.

, Try to spray the frost towards the bottom corners of your window to make it look more realistic. Fake frost usually comes in a spray can, like spray paint, and washes off your window with soap and water. They are great for those who don't get snow for Christmas.

, Not all Christmas decorations have to be store-bought. Homemade ones can have their charm too. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, or just like to be crafty, you can make some of your own decorations and display them in your room. Here are a few ideas to get you started:


Find some pinecones outside and paint them with acrylic paint or glitter. Display them on your windowsill.
String cranberries and popcorn into thread to make garlands.
Make some paper chains using construction paper.
Cut out some paper snowflakes from white printer paper.
Make a gingerbread house and display it on your dresser or desk.
Cut out some letters from glitter paper to spell ""Merry Christmas"" and tack them to your wall.

Choose a color scheme that matches your existing room decor.,
Decide on a theme.,
Go window shopping.,
Consider having some background noise while you work.,
Work with your existing room decor.,
Look around your room for blank spaces.",How to Decorate Your Room for Christmas3," There are many color scheme that inspire Christmas, but not all of them might work with your room. For example, if your room has a lot of pink and white, the traditional red and green might clash. Red and white might be more suitable. Here are some common Christmas color schemes to get you started:


Red and green
Red, green, and white/gold
Blue and white/silver
Blue, white, and silver
White/ivory and gold
Red and white/gold
Green and white/gold

, Sometimes, having a set theme can help you choose which decorations to put up. It can also help your room look more unified and less cluttered. As with colors, choose a theme that matches your room. For example, if your room has a lot of heavy, Victorian-era furniture, a rustic or nature theme might clash. Themes that are more Victorian or ornate might work better with your room decor. Here are some common Christmas themes to get you started:


1900s, Charles Dickens, Victorian era, and Vintage inspired
Rustic, woodland cabin inspired, with lots of gingham, knit, wood, and burlap
Nature, with lots of snow, pine trees, pinecones, reindeer, and woodland creatures
Traditional/classic with lots of red and green, snowmen, and Santa Claus
Fancy/royal with lots of silver or gold, ornate scroll patterns, and lots of rich brocade
Winter wonderland, with lots of blue, silver, and white, snow, snowflakes, icicles, and pine trees

, Look at how stores step up their displays. If you see any you like, try to copy them. Take pictures, write down what your see, or make a quick sketch. You don't have to copy the display exactly; you can just use elements from it, such as silver ornaments and glittery snowflakes.


You can also get ideas from a nature walk as well.

, If you have a laptop, radio, or TV in your room, consider playing some Christmas music or a Christmas movie. They might inspire you or get you into the Christmas spirit.

, Sometimes, what you already have in your room might inspire your Christmas decorations. For example, if your room has a lot of wooden furniture in it, you can decorate it with some rustic Christmas decorations to make it look like a cozy, woodland cabin.


Keep the size of your room in mind. If your room is very small and cramped, it might not be a good candidate for a Christmas tree. Some pine garlands, however, would be perfect for it.

, If you don't know where to start decorating, take a look around your room. See if there are any blank spaces or surfaces, and start decorating there. For example:

Is there a bare wall in your room? If so, consider decorating it with some paper snowflakes or Christmas cards.
Is there a blank corner on your desk or dresser? What about on your shelf? These places are great for displaying mini trees, figurines, and scenes.
Curtain rods and doorknobs are great places to hang decorations from.
Windows are great places to hang decorations, such as lights and ornaments, from.

Ask your girl how she wants to ""feel"" in her room.,
Find out what in her room she loves and wants to keep, and what she wants to go.,

Glow it well, with some awesome new lighting.,
Rearrange the furniture.,
Change where you put your things.,

Put up a mirror.,
Tidy it, and keep it that way.

,
Stick ""window jellies"" on each window.,
Stick up posters.,
Whatever you do, DON'T spend a mint.",How to Decorate a Girl's Room Without Spending Too Much," Mood boards are always an excellent route, but the key to the process is to be able to keep in mind why the girl wants her room changed in the first place (particularly if she loved it before), and what vibe she wants it changed into.;
, Again, understanding the ""why"" is the key here, and the fact that your color palette (light vs bright vs dramatic vs romantic, etc) will largely be determined by those things is a huge bonus.

, It gives you the biggest bang for your buck every time. Also, keep in mind that although she wants change, it may not need to be something dramatically different to fit the bill. For example, going from a baby pink room to a hot pink one might enable her to keep her ""favorite color"" as the unifying feature, while still giving the space an entirely different spin. As a plus, those pastel items still look good against other clean colors (aka not muddied or grayed), and can actually make a space look far more complex and sophisticated than you could with all strongly colored décor.

, With a different range of pillow and quilt covers, you can change the colour scheme from without re-painting. A babyish - pink and purple can change to a more sophisticated blue and purple, or pink and green. Match a few other things too.

, Not only can you put up fairy lights instead of those dull, dull lamps - wrapped round the bedspread, I favour fuzzy fairy lights - but you can also change the shade to the main room light. These are cheap, and can alter a room a lot - maybe even changing the colour of the light that comes through.

, By moving your things about, you can give your room the impression of more space, less space or just a new feel. If you wake up at five every morning, with the sun on your face then move your bed. If you can't get to your draws, then move them. If something puts you off whenever you work, get rid of it...or move it.

, If something embarrasses you - say a photo, or a toy, then put it away. Dig out some awesome things from underneath the clutter, and enjoy.

, Make some cushions, or buy some beanbags. Get a furry rug and place it on the floor. Create a space to curl up and read, and put your mini-library-bookshelf near it.

, Not only can this give the illusion of a bigger room, but it can also add more light, and make the room seem less heavy. It is also useful for in the morning.

,, The light shines through, and makes them glow and scatter bright colours on the room. You can also alternate the colours, and patterns - from dolphins to friend messages.

, Not too many, this can make a room look over cluttered. A few - one or two - can not only make a room look nicer, it also says a lot about the individual. Art - your own art - can also be cool. You can buy mini canvases and acrylic paint pots, which are designed to go on your wall.

, Chances are she'll be bored of it again in a few years, so the bottom line is to find a way to change the look of the room while keeping most of the things in it the same. Painting the place is usually the most cost-efficient route.

Make sure that this is what you want to do with your room, and that it isn't a fad or anything.,

",How to Decorate a Room with a Hollister Theme,";
, You can paint walls alternative colors as well, like purple or burnt orange. A great painting technique would be drawing a mural of a sunset, writing ""Hollister,"" drawing a picture of a seagull, or just buying the stencil. But be careful: dark colors will possibly make rooms seem smaller. If painting isn't an option, hanging up scarves would be fine.

,, Use beige or navy blue colors for pillows, throws and comforters. A canopy is an optional piece that will improve the room.

, Remember to stick with chocolate brown woods. Seating is recommended as well. Leather would be great, but it really doesn't matter.

,, Try buying a pair of white curtains, which are usually not that expensive, or some roman shades. PBteen makes some nice twisted curtains that have a SoCal feel.

, To make this room clearly a Hollister luxury, you must have some sort of photo/poster. You can use their bags as storage. You can put up photos of their models (you can get these off the website's gallery) as art. Other fun art pieces would be putting up signs like ""Laguna Beach"" or ""Surf boards needed beyond this point.""

, You can add vanilla candles to add scent, as well as spraying their perfume as air freshener.

Empty the closets out.,
Sort the clothes.,
Grab a pile.,
Clean the closet.,
Fill the closet.,
Repeat with the other child.",How to Organize Your Twins' Closet," Before you can start organizing the closet(s), you will need to empty it out so you know how many clothes you have. Remember to keep one child's pile of clothes separate from the other child's clothes. This will reduce the chances of one child accidentally wearing the other child's clothes. If this step seems to long and like too much hard work, turn on some music to keep you motivated.;
, Now that all of the childrens' clothes are out of the closet, you will need to sort them out. Simple put them into piles of what they are. For example, put all of their jeans in one pile. Put all of their jumpers in another pile. This will help you to see exactly how many items you have of what type of clothing like jeans, t-shirts, hoodies etc. This will also make the next few steps funner and quicker.

, Pick up any of the piles that you've created. For example, the t-shirt pile. Now split that pile into three sub-piles. The first pile should be the pile of clothes that you want to keep. The next pile should have all the clothes you want to hand down, give to charity or sell. The last pile should have all the damaged clothes that you want to throw away.


The keep pile should have everything that you still want. Make sure that everything in this pile fits your child properly and don't keep something just because you paid a lot of money for it. If it doesn't fit the child, it doesn't belong in this pile. Also, make sure they like everything in this pile. When the rest of your clothes go, this is what they're going to be left with so consult them first.






The give away pile should have clothes that are too small for them. Since you may be giving these to charity, it's best to keep ripped, torn and stained clothes out of this pile. Even if you're going to hand them down, another one of your children may not appreciate a ripped up strip of denim that was once their big brother's favourite pair of jeans. Clothes that are in good condition but they don't like can also be put in this pile.
The throw away pile should have clothes that are beyond repair. This includes ripped up clothes, stained clothes, torn clothes and ""those DIY projects that went a little wrong"" clothes. All of these clothes will be thrown away. For this reason, anything that can be given to charity should be removed right away. This pile is strictly for clothes beyond repair. Ask the child to double-check this pile so that you don't throw away something that they like.

, With some wipes and a duster, clean out the interior of the closet. You don't want to put all of your newly organised clothes in a dirty old closet, do you? If there's any dust or spider webs still in there, get rid of them now. It's much easier to dust, clean and polish before the clothes go in for obvious reasons. If you were looking to paint the closet, now's the time to do that. Make sure that the is closet spotless.

, Now that you definitely know what you're keeping and what you're throwing/giving away, you can start re-filling the closet. Put one type of clothing on every shelf. If it's summer, the children won't be needing those jumpers any time soon. Put them on the top shelf. If it's winter, keep their summer clothes on the top shelf. Jeans and t-shirts should stay somewhere near the middle if they're pretty much worn all year round. Socks and underwear can stay somewhere near the bottom of the closet. If your closet has a hanging rail and no shelves, keep all the jeans together, all the t-shirts together, all the jumpers together etc.

, Now that you've done everything you need for one child, you will need to repeat these steps for the second one. If just one child took you a whole day, feel free to repeat the process for the other child tomorrow. If you think you can do it quicker because you know what you're doing now or because the have less clothes, feel free to attempt it today. Asking them to help can also speed up the process. Have fun with this project so you don't get burned out from the stress.

Purge once a year.",How to Organize a Walk in Closet," Whether you are moving into a new house or reorganizing an existing closet, you need to take everything out of it to assess it as a space. Removing all the items from the closet will help you pare down some of the possessions that you have.Be sure to vacuum or sweep the floor of the closet once it is empty. This will make sure your closet is in its best possible state before your reorganize it.
If you are having trouble organizing your closet, there is a good chance you have too many possessions. Research shows that modern consumers are driven by the desire to own new things, but buying new items does not necessarily satisfy our desire for more possessions.The consumer goods industry is the largest in the United States, where it generates more than $419 billion every year. The vast majority of this money is spent on non-essential goods that fill our closets.;
, One very popular and highly successful method for organizing is the method designed by Marie Kondo, a professional organizer from Japan. Her method is very simple and easy to follow.


After you have laid out all of your clothes from your closet in a pile on your floor, sit down and touch each item on the floor. As you touch the item, ask yourself ""Does this spark joy in me?"" Does the item make you happy? Or does it make you feel guilty for not having lost those ten pounds? Does it remind you of a stressful time in your life? If it doesn't spark joy in you, then prepare to donate or discard the item.After you have gone through your clothes, then apply the same method to your shoes, bedding, cosmetics, and any other items that might be in your closet.
If you share a closet with someone else, ask that person to also go through their items and discard any items that do not bring any joy.
This may take a few days to get through if you have a very large closet. You might plan to do this over the course of a long weekend or if you have an extended break, like the time between Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.
If your clothing, shoes, and jewelry are still in good condition, consider donating them to a local organization like Goodwill or the Salvation Army. You can also look into donating at a homeless shelter or a shelter for survivors of domestic violence.
You can read more about this method in Kondo's book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying-Up. (Ten Speed Press, 2014).

, With fewer possessions, you probably won't need as many boxes or shelves to hold all of your things. Put all of your remaining clothes back on their hangars and see how much space they take up in your closet., In your closet, you should generally put items that you use on a regular or daily basis at eye level. This will include things such as shirts, skirts, dresses and coats. Items that are used less frequently (like seasonal pairs of shoes) should go below eye level and items that are rarely used (like extra bedding or blankets or sporting equipment) should be stored above eye level.Before you install shelving, you should decide where you plan to put certain items in the closet. You will probably want your clothes to be at eye level whereas less essential items can go above or below your clothes.
Remove all of the items from your closet again. If you have anything in the closet, but sure to take it out before you install rods or shelves. The items could get in your way of making accurate measurements of your closet.

, Most closets need some sort of shelving. At the very minimum, you will need a rod to hang your clothes on. Many closets come with these items already installed but you may need to add some additional pieces depending on your needs., Before you install shelves, rods or drawers, you should know the dimensions of your closet. Measure the height and width of each wall, along with the dimensions of the door frame. This will determine the size of your storage options.


Using a tape measure, extend the tape across the length of the wall. Hold it level (or ask for assistance in holding it straight). Once the tape reaches the end of the wall, note the dimension in inches and centimeters (and write it down so you will remember).

, In your closet, you will generally need space for a ""long hang"" to accommodate items such as dresses, coats, dress pants and then a ""short hang"" for shorter items like shirts, skirts, and shorts.Install the rods according to the instructions on the package. Most rods can be purchased at a local hardware or home goods store. They are sometimes adjustable in length, but you should check the description on the item to make sure they are.
You will most likely need a drill, screws, and a level to make sure you are hanging your rod straight. Consult the instructions on your rod for the specific instruments you will need.

, Shelves can be a great addition to your closet. You can use them to hold shoes, extra bedding, or storage containers for seasonal clothes and decorations.


The method for installing shelves is similar to installing rods. You should be able to buy them at your local hardware or lumber store. Know the dimensions of the wall you intend to hang them on so that they will fit. You will also need a drill, screws and a level to make sure they hang straight and sturdy.
If you are hanging multiple shelves vertically, make sure you have enough room between them to hold bulky items, such as comforters or storage bins. Consider 18-24 inches for large items.

, Depending on the size of your closet, you can add stacked drawers to your storage options. This can be especially helpful if you do not have a chest of drawers in your bedroom.


You can often buy drawers with the parts pre-assembled. Check department stores or home good stores that offer organizational or storage options for their customers.
Consider buying a drawer unit that has wheels on it so you can move it in or out of our closet if you would like to have some flexibility with the layout of the space.

, Your closet will look its best when items are put into a bin and out of sight. Keep these on the upper shelves near the ceiling.


You can buy storage bins in a variety of materials. Some come in a plain, durable plastic any cost between $10-$15. But you can also buy bins or baskets in linen, cedar or leather materials.
Which ever storage option you choose, try to buy them all in the same type. This will give a clean, uniform sense of harmony to your closet.
You can use the bins to store items you don't use on a regular basis, such as extra bedding, seasonal clothing, seasonal decorations, etc.

, Once your shelves, rods and storage bins are ready to go, you can put your newly pared down items back into the closet.


Consider organizing your clothes by length, with long items like coats and dresses at the right side of the closet and then gradually moving to shorter items like shirts and skirts on the left end of the closet. This will naturally draw the eye upward in a pleasing way.You can also organize you closet by color, grouping dark and light colors together so your closet resembles a rainbow.

, The point of a walk-in closet is so you can actually walk into it! If you can, try to keep shoes off of the floor or against the wall and out of the main path as these can frequently trip you up.

, It might sound simple, but you have to keep your items in their proper place in your closet. Hang up clean clothes after you finish the laundry. Don't leave them in a pile on the floor of your closet.


If you take down a storage bin to retrieve an item, make sure you put it away as soon as get the object you need. If you don't, you may get in the habit of leaving bins and boxes out in the open instead of stored away.
You might want to keep a small step ladder in your closet so you can easily rich items that are above you in height.

, One way to reduce all the excessive possession cluttering your closet it to simply buy less. Before you buy a new sweater or jacket, ask yourself if you truly love the item and if it will add to your daily wardrobe. Are you buying it because you need a new jacket or are you simply browsing in a store to pass the time? , After completing the KonMari method of organization, you will probably find that you have significantly fewer items crowding out your closet. And if your closet is filled with only things you love, you may not feel the need to buy extra items. But you should still occasionally go through the items in you closet and only keep the items that bring you joy.


Consider going through a closet after seasonal shifts. For instance, if you have children who have outgrown their winter sweaters, this would be a good time to pass on these articles to friends with younger children or donate them to a charity.

You may want to plan for a space to do homework or crafts, choose a spot for playing video games or watching television, designate an area for practicing a musical instrument, or set aside a space for doing your hair or makeup., Think about what items you already have that you want to reuse. If you love your bedspread, choose colors that match or accent it for painting or accessories. If your favorite color is red, choose one or two light accent colors to go with it. Be sure to thoroughly consider what colors or theme you want, and think about if you will still like it in a few months or even a few years.A few ideas for themes include: music, sports, technology, nautical, retro, modern, metropolitan, and boho.

, Changing the wall color can give your room a whole new feel. You can paint your walls or put up temporary wallpaper. Feel free to paint only one wall, all of them, or even the ceiling. If you choose a dark color, it’s best to use it on an accent wall rather than for your entire room. Be sure to get your parents’ permission, follow all directions, and ventilate the area., A desk is an essential part of your room. You can use it to do your homework, surf the web, write in your journal, etc. Choose one that fits your needs as well as your personal style; maybe you want a simple, streamlined desk or perhaps you need one with lots of drawers or built-in shelves. Don’t forget to pick a chair to go with your desk, and ensure it is the right height for writing or typing comfortably.

, An interesting bed frame is a great way to personalize your room; consider a funky headboard or even a sleigh bed, depending on your style. A bedspread or comforter can also be a statement piece for your room. Choose a bold pattern or a fun texture to add personality to your room. If your walls are patterned or filled with poster and photos, you may want to stick with a solid bedspread to keep the room from becoming too busy.


Add fun throw pillows for extra comfort and style.

, You’ll likely want a space other than your bed for you or your guests to sit on. Beanbag chairs are relatively cheap and are super comfy. Gaming chairs are great for those who love to play, or you could add ottomans that open for extra seating as well as storage. Pillows also make great seating, so set out some colorful or printed pillows if you can’t get new chairs., It’s usually best to start with your bed and move on from there. Keep in mind those activities you thought of when planning your new space. Create zones for different purposes, such as sleeping, working, relaxing, and playing. You can use a curtain, or even furniture, to separate the spaces, like putting a desk in the middle of your room to separate your sleeping area from the space in which you watch television or play video games., Blinds or drapes can help block out the light at night as well as give you some privacy. Choose blinds or curtains that fit your style and the theme or colors you chose for your room.Even if you can’t change your window coverings completely, you can still add your own style. For example, consider adding a sheer curtain over your blinds for a pop of color. You could even hang beads over your windows or in your doorway.

, Lamps or lanterns are essential for your room. Not only will they give you extra lighting, but they are a great way to tie in accent colors or personalize your space. You could even go with a neon sign for an extra cool touch., Rugs are a nice way to change the look and feel of your bedroom. A fun and funky print can liven up your space as well as add some extra padding if you have hardwood floors.

Choose a dreamy landscape to help you relax, or an informational poster, like the periodic table, to keep your mind sharp. You can also put up maps, calendars, or cork boards. Add pictures of yourself, your pets, your friends, and your family to make the room your own.

Account for what's on the inside.,
Walk with confidence.,
Dress well.,
Focus on your character strengths versus superficial traits.,
Improve your speaking skills.","How to Be Proud, Not Cocky and Conceited1"," Confidence does not come from a specific look, brand, or attitude. Confidence is natural and should come from inside you. When you fake confidence, it can come off as conceited, especially if you think your purchases or style are your primary value. Take a look at what you have to offer as a person, and build confidence from there., Pride is just another way of saying you have high self-worth. There’s no better way to display this than your walk. You come across as insecure when you walk with your shoulders slumped and your face turned towards the ground beneath you. Instead, pull your shoulders back, lift your chin, and walk with your head held high.For extra points, smile at everyone you meet. Doing so helps you show confidence while still being friendly and approachable.

, How you dress sends a message to the outside world about how you want to be perceived. Everyone has their own individual style, of course. Whether you enjoy dressing in business suits or tattered jeans, you can make it your business to wear clothes that are clean and well-fitting.


When you shop, go for quality over quantity. You may be able to splurge on only one dress, but if it is of high-quality it may last far longer than cheaper pieces. No need to wear flashy logos or accessories.Dressing extends to your hygiene, too. Keep your hair cut and styled. Manicure, or at the very least, clip your nails regularly. Find a signature scent that speaks to you and wear it often.

, Cocky people often boast about superficial aspects of their lives like money, clothes, cars, or dates. To demonstrate pride without arrogance, highlight your meaningful strengths.Think about what makes you a great person beyond those superficial things. Maybe you’re a great listener, an excellent problem-solver, or super creative.
Make a list of your positive traits and accomplishments. Review it regularly to feel pride about yourself., There’s hardly a better way to feel pride about yourself than being an effective communicator. Effective communicators understand how to carefully balance speaking and listening so that they do not dominate conversations. Here are a few tips to be a more effective communicator.


Have open body language. Leave your arms and legs uncrossed and relaxed at your sides.
Remove any distractions when you’re communicating such as cell phones or televisions.
Make regular eye contact. Smile, nod, or gesture as appropriate.Don’t interrupt—wait until the speaker is finished before replying.
Remember that part of being a good speaker is being a good listener. Allow others to engage you or an audience without cutting them off or ignoring them.

Keep your closet organized!",How to Organize a Teen's Closet," Make three piles: keep, donate and trash. Put clothes that are too small in the donate pile, and throw the moth-eaten sweaters that are beyond repair out. If you're debating whether something should go into the keep or donate pile, consider what you'd need to do to make it wearable. For instance, if a raincoat is missing a button, and you lost the matching button, go to a craft store and replace all of the buttons.;
, Clear plastic boxes work well for shoes; or, if your daughter is the type who has shoes and handbags that ""go together,"" invest in a set of hanging sweater shelves and put the matching purses/shoes together on each shelf. It's all about being organized.

, By putting in a few items that make you smile, your whole day and mood will be brighter! Additionally, a small memento can provide inspiration for your outfit!

, If the hamper is in the bathroom down the hall, those dirty clothes are just going to accumulate on the bedroom floor. If you have a large family, it's a good idea to get your own hamper, and simply empty your clothes into the family hamper once your hamper is full.

, If you really want to be organized, color code them. Make green shirts in one section, purple in another, etc. For skirts, there are special hangers that can clip on to the top that are available at any drugstore. Organize clothes by jeans, t-shirts, long sleeve shirts, skirts, and dresses. If you live in an area where the climate changes dramatically with the seasons, organize clothes by season, and store off-season clothes in Space Bags under the bed or in the garage. A big puffy parka in the summer just takes up space.

, You can buy these at a local Walmart, Target, etc. If you have closet doors on tracks and can't do this, a multi-level shoe rack on the floor is useful for organizing shoes that are worn frequently. Put the ones most often worn on the top level. With the shoe organizer on the back of the door, you should put the shoes you wear most often at eye level so they are the first thing you see.

, It can be frustrating or disturbing mentally to see a pile of clothes laying on the floor of your closet. Trust me, once you start folded or hanging them up, you'll feel as if you accomplished something; you'll feel great! Though if you're one of the lazy types, considering having a rule when you have to fold clothes. For instance, if 5 pieces of clothing are on the ground you HAVE to fold them up. At the same time, you become more responsible!

Not only will you stay healthy and fit, but you’ll also be alert and ready for anything! Proper hygiene is also essential for good health, and it will make you feel better about yourself.


Shower daily, keep your hair clean, floss every day, and brush your teeth at least twice a day. Keep your nails trimmed and clean. You don’t have to go overboard with the lotions, creams, exfoliants, and other beauty products, either: a good bar of soap, face cloth, and moisturizer can go a long way.
Eat a healthy breakfast. This is especially important for younger children and adolescents, because it gives you energy for the day, and leads to better academic and athletic performance.It’s ok to indulge in junk food once in a while, but overall, strive to make healthy food choices.
Exercise in the morning. It may be difficult at first, but your body will adjust. Morning workouts kick start your metabolism and give you a rush of endorphins that will improve your mood, wake you up, and help you focus.Teens and young adults require between 7 and 10 hours of sleep per night, so don’t sacrifice rest on account of friends, work, or anything else.;
, Sophistication and maturity come from being independent, self-confident, and in control. You’ve probably heard the saying “everything in moderation,” and this applies to all aspects of life. Life is all about finding a balance between things you like and those you must do, things you should do and those you shouldn’t, and things that are fun and those that are necessary. Give yourself the same opportunities as everyone else, by educating yourself and staying in school, setting goals, and having expectations of yourself and others, but enjoy life along the way as well.


The decision to wear cosmetics is yours alone, but if you choose to, use tones and colors that complement and highlight your natural beauty, and remember that less is more. Wearing or not wearing makeup doesn’t make you any more or less of a lady. The same holds true for jewelry and accessories.
Working hard is important, but it’s equally important to relax and have fun. An intelligent and mature lady knows when to take time for herself.

, Loving and respecting yourself means appreciating that you are unique and being true to yourself. Don’t compromise your values for someone else, and don’t try to change who you are to impress anyone. Be confident in who you are and people will be drawn to your strength.


Learn how to say “no,” and don’t be afraid to say it if you aren’t comfortable with something. Peer pressure is a strong force, but resisting the temptation to do something just to fit in is all part of knowing who you are and sticking to your guns.

, Life is going to throw many dress codes at you, and school, work, clubs, meetings, and other places will all have different expectations regarding clothing. The important thing is to dress in a way that makes you comfortable. Part of showing self-respect and self-confidence is dressing for yourself and in a way that shows your personality, not dressing immodestly or wearing revealing clothes to just gain attention from others.Clothing doesn’t have any intrinsic value, but it can make you feel confident, smart, and powerful.


Clothes should always be clean, neat, and pressed if necessary.
Well-made garments in high-quality fabrics are an investment, but they will last longer and make more of an impression.
Neutral and pastel colors are timeless and won’t go out of fashion.

, You don’t have to share everyone else’s values or traditions, but strive to recognize and accept the differences that make people unique. Be tolerant of other people’s customs and lifestyles and they will do the same for you! People come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors, and have many backgrounds and beliefs, but for every difference there is also a commonality. Acceptance and tolerance are all about appreciating what makes us individual, and not disliking someone else just because she’s different.


Have the courage to stand up against intolerance and oppression. This can come in the form of racism, sexism, ageism, religious intolerance, or any other form of bigotry. Let people know if they are acting unfairly or being prejudiced, and encourage them to be more open. Write letters or use social media to alert the government, newspapers, businesses, or human rights groups about unjust practices or policies.
Don’t judge others before you get to know them, and try not to make assumptions. If you are curious about someone, ask her a question. She may not be comfortable answering you (especially if you are strangers), but asking won’t hurt, and she’ll appreciate your effort.
Promote peace by offering to moderate discussions if you see friends or classmates arguing. A moderator helps people communicate more effectively by ensuring speakers get their turns and aren’t interrupted, and making sure things don’t get too heated.

, Nobody likes a rude or insulting person. Stick with the old adage: if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all. If somebody is rude to you, the classiest thing you can do is walk away. Tell her you don’t appreciate her behavior, but don’t provoke her further or dignify her behavior by returning it.


Don’t make fun of others, and don’t laugh at the expense of someone else’s feelings.
Avoid cursing and telling offensive jokes. Avoid jokes that poke fun at others because of culture, appearance, sex, sexual orientation, or other personal matters.
Be sensitive to the needs of others, and don’t deliberately make others uncomfortable. For instance, if your friend is extremely shy, don’t put her on the spot as the center of attention, because she’ll be embarrassed.

, You can show respect for others by being considerate of their feelings, and by being honest, open, and fair. This tells them that you care, that you are a good person, and that you are deserving of their respect. And this doesn’t just apply to parents, teachers, and people older than you: everyone deserves respect, the elderly and the young, and you can provide it by being polite, courteous, and trustworthy.


One of the easiest ways to show respect is by respecting someone else’s time and being punctual.
Address people with the proper titles of respect, such as Mr. and Ms.
Keep your promises.

, Practice active listening by paying attention to what people say and striving to understand what they mean.People aren’t always up front with their feelings or intentions, and it’s ok to ask for clarification if you’re unsure. During a conversation with someone:


Put your phone away and give her your undivided attention.
Make eye contact, and acknowledge what she says.
Be aware of your body language. Crossed arms indicate guardedness. Practice keeping your arms naturally at your sides.
Don’t interrupt: you’ll get your turn! And once you’ve made your point, give her a chance to respond.
Show you are engaged and interested. You can do this by not making everything about yourself, and not trying to outdo her stories. It also helps to smile when appropriate and react with subtle facial expressions.

, Don’t brag about things you have, like friends or money, because it is boastful. Similarly, avoid talking about all the great things you’ve done, because it will make people uncomfortable. People say that honesty is the best policy, and this is true when it comes to friends, family, co-workers, fellow students, and everyone else in your life. Lying is rude, disrespectful, and embarrassing when you get caught, so the truth is always a better option.

, Courtesy isn’t always something that people detect, but they certainly take notice when it’s lacking. Manners and etiquette are important in all parts of life, whether you’re at school, work, out to dinner with friends, in a business meeting, or even just on the phone. Being polite tells somebody that you are respectful and considerate.


Enroll yourself in an etiquette class if you feel you are lacking in this department.
Hold the door for people.
Remember the names of new people you meet. Call them by their names when you address them. When you are first introduced to a new person, repeat her name to yourself three times if you have trouble remembering names.
Don’t participate in gossip.

, Introduce yourself to new people, and make introductions for people who don’t know each other but with whom you are acquainted. Don’t be afraid to make the first move with a new person in a social setting! Chances are she might be too shy to come up to you, and she’ll appreciate that you had the courage to approach her.


Compliments are a great way to start a conversation. Tell her you like her boots, or her hair, or her shirt, or say something else nice about her.
Ask her something about herself to get the ball rolling. When appropriate, reciprocate and tell her something personal (but not overly intimate) about yourself so that it feels like a conversation and not an interrogation.
Steer clear of sensitive topics like religion and politics. Start with small talk and keep the conversation light.

, If you ask someone for a favor, say “please,” even if you’re just asking her to pass the pepper. When she does, say “thank you.” It’s sweet, simple, and goes a long way to show appreciation. Congratulate people when they accomplish their goals, because everyone likes being recognized for hard work. If you make a mistake, don’t be afraid to apologize. You don’t have to apologize for every little thing, but a simple “I’m sorry” when you’re wrong can mend relationships, and shows others that you care about their feelings, and that you are strong enough to admit when you’re wrong.Be genuine when you express gratitude and compliments. People will pick up on your insincerity if you say things without meaning them.

, Table etiquette can be quite complicated, especially in a fine dining establishment with multiple courses that require numerous utensils. But every meal deserves the respect of some basic etiquette, and the ground rules include:


Chew with your mouth closed, and don’t speak with your mouth full.
Ask people to pass items you cannot reach. If you have to reach over someone to get it, you can’t reach it.
Cut food one bite at a time, and only eat one bite at a time.
Sit up straight, and keep your elbows off the table.
Use your napkin to delicately wipe your face.
Say “excuse me” before leaving the table.
Don’t take a sip of your drink until you have finished chewing., Being a lady doesn’t have anything to do with how nice your house is, what kind of car you or your parents drive, or how much money you have. Instead, being a lady, like being a gentleman, has to do with your kindness and character.Donate old clothes to charities.
Stay active in your community. Get to know your neighbours.
Help out if you see someone in need, even if it’s just helping a young child across the street safely.
Welcome new people who move into your neighbourhood.

, Not everyone has the resources to give money to charities, but a good cause always needs people who can lend a hand. Volunteerism is a great way to get involved, meet new people, help out in your community, and it will show prospective employers that you are dedicated and generous.


Food banks are in need of helping hands and food year-round (not just around the holidays). Help out on weekends if you can, or talk to your school about organizing a food drive.
Spend time with the elderly. It can get lonely at home, in the hospital, or at a care facility, and elderly citizens often appreciate having someone to talk to, play games with, or just spend time with.
Check with your local animal shelter to see if there are tasks you can help with.
Find something you are passionate about and research charities and organizations that you can volunteer with.

, This can be as simple as tutoring fellow students in subjects you excel at, or helping friends study for tests and exams.


Help younger children in your school or community who are learning to read and write. Become pen pals with a few of them so they can practice these skills.
Provide lessons to older people in your community who want to learn to use computers or other technology.
Teach younger children how to play a sport you are good at, or help out a coach in your community.

, Talking to strangers can be difficult, but you will get comfortable the more you do it. Give others a chance to talk, and if you get stuck for something to discuss, ask a couple questions. People like to talk about themselves, and it’s polite to show genuine interest in what they say. One of the most important aspects of carrying on a conversation is your ability to listen.


Try to find hobbies that you share that you can discuss.
Keep apprised of the news and world events. This is important for your own knowledge, but these subjects also come up in conversation frequently.
Speak slowly, clearly, and eloquently; avoid curse words, contractions, and slang.
Knowledge is key: the more you know, the more likely you are to find common ground with strangers.
Avoid boring or negative topics that might bring down the mood of the conversation, such as death, war, violence, or drugs. Keep things light."
"
Acknowledge your accomplishments, but be human, too.,
Be punctual and reliable.,
Admit when you’re wrong.,
Avoid bad-mouthing others.","How to Be Proud, Not Cocky and Conceited2"," You come off as doubting yourself when you undermine your accomplishments or speak negatively about yourself. When you speak well of yourself you seem prideful, but you have to navigate this part carefully to prevent coming off as conceited. Be humble but genuine, and others will take note.


Rather than self-deprecate yourself to make others like you, be willing to show your human side. Share stories about struggles or mistakes to let others know that you are a work in progress, just like they are.
For example, a coworker tells you “You can’t relate to my situation. You’ve never had a negative performance review.” Respond with “That’s not true. When I first started here, it took me several months to get the hang of things. Our supervisor was actually thinking about letting me go. I guess I just never shared that with anyone.”, Cocky people often behave like the world revolves around them. They may show up late and shove their responsibilities onto the laps of others because they think the work is beneath them. Exhibit pride in yourself by being the opposite—show up early (or on time) to commitments and be consistent in your efforts., If you’re ever running late or default on a promise, apologize and try to rectify the situation. Cocky people just go on with their lives, with little to no concern for other’s feelings. Apologizing shows empathy and lets people see your flawed, human side.If you’re late for a meeting, you might say, “Hey, everyone, I just wanted to apologize for my tardiness. I know each of you have things to do, so I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again.”

, Gossiping makes you look insecure and jealous. To show pride in yourself, never engage in belittling others or sharing their secrets and scandals. Conduct yourself with integrity by keeping most of your language positive about others, particularly if they are not present to defend themselves.If you find yourself in the midst of gossip, leave the environment or try to change the subject.

"
"
Avoid criticizing others.,
Focus on others in conversation.,
Applaud other’s successes.,
Be willing to share the credit.,
Help others without asking for anything in return.","How to Be Proud, Not Cocky and Conceited3"," Confident people don't feel the need to criticize others to make themselves look better. When trying to correct someone or help them out, be sure to provide constructive criticism.Praise others for what they did right, and when necessary, offer feedback about the topic you're addressing rather than about them as a person.

, Arrogance is often indicated by a tendency to hog the attention. Cocky and conceited people may dominate conversations discussing their own achievements. A person with the right degree of pride understands that you become more likeable when you share the spotlight in conversation. People like to talk about themselves, so be generous and give them the opportunity.


When you find yourself talking about your own achievements, subtly redirect the topic back to the other person. You might say, “Enough about me. Please do share with me how you managed to get that project in a week before deadline. That was unprecedented!”, Boastful people want to dwell on their own talents while minimizing others’. Counteract that tendency by uplifting others when they do well. Friends, family, and coworkers will all view you more favorably when you praise them for their successes. It shows that you can see the best in others without feeling threatened.Prevent coming off as smug or jealous by being there to pat others on the back. You don’t have to exaggerate it, but do make a point to extend your well-wishes to someone who excels. Take them out to lunch. Buy them a drink. Or, brag on them a little to others.

, Cocky people generally have the big-head syndrome, which makes them unable to see pass their own awesomeness. People with pride are willing to share positive attention, especially when it’s deserved. Don’t take all the applause when you are celebrated for a team effort. Mention the efforts of those who helped, too.You might say, “I am truly pleased that you all liked the film, but many people were involved in this project with me. I’d like to give a round of applause to each of them also.” Then, call out their names to give them a moment in the spotlight, too.

, Favors from conceited people often are bestowed at a price. These people may not choose to do anything nice for others without expecting something in return. A humble person extends a helping hand to those in need without questioning what they’ll get for it.


If a friend is in trouble, come to their rescue without hoping for credit or compensation. Say, “If you need me, let me know. I’m here for you.”
Another great way to humbly help others is through volunteerism. Find a cause you like and reach out to help those in need. Examples might include building homes for the needy or reading to kids at your local library."

Always style you hair nicely.,
Don't over-accessorize.,
Always clean your bedroom.,
Have sleepovers whenever you can.",How to Be Gorgeous and Popular," Having good skin is imperative as you wouldn't want to be stuck with spots! We all aren't blessed with perfect skin however with some work you can make it seem that way.


Drink about 8 glasses of water everyday,6 glasses is okay for some. Do this to achieve clear skin. The most you should drink, however, are 10 glasses as it is possible to be over-hydrated which is unhealthy.






Use a good moisturizer. Read online reviews to see which work best; You can usually purchase samples rather than the entire product. Remember-Even though the product worked for some people it may not be right for you. Everyone has a different type of skin, therefore the same moisturizers won't work best for everyone.






Wash with soap. You can follow this routine as often as you brush your teeth, after you wake up and before you go to bed. There are plenty of scrubbers made for face washing however wash-cloths work fine, too. Optional: Follow with a good lotion or cream.





;
, Brush twice daily. Your teeth are a lot like skin; Different toothpastes work better for different people. If you have yellow teeth brushing twice a week with baking soda can help however brushing with baking soda can damage your teeth enamel so do not do it often.

, Wear things that match but remember to stay by a budget. The key to looking good isn't to have the most expensive clothes but rather to have the nicest looking ones. Thrift shops and Goodwill are always an option and can be great for designer clothes at cheap prices. Try to have a good wardrobe, too. Having at least six tank-tops,four pairs of jeans,a waistcoat,three jackets, two pairs of flats and one pair of boots makes for a fool-proof set. As you grow out of clothes sell them to consignment stores. Staying cheap is gold!

, Try to seem like everybody's friend. Being mean or shy only results in less friends. Remember: You're always good enough and nobody can tell you otherwise.

, Email works well, too. Try to at least have a phone that you actively text on. Having some way to keep up with everybody is to have conversations at your fingertips. Find out what messaging systems your peers use and quickly create your own account. Having a good amount of contacts of whom you text a lot is priceless. These can also be the roads to learning secrets of your peers which shows you are trusted.

, Having one person that you stay connected with at all costs is great as it shows your optimism. Even if you think you are covering up any depression or hatred towards someone, it shows. Optimism is a thing you can't fake easily and is imperative for popular girls.

, Try doing searches for hairstyles with your head type, hair color, or hair type. Be careful when doing extravagant hairstyles. Being over-the-top can make you come off as awkward and strange. Your hair has the power to change your entire look! Don't take it for granted!

, Having your look appear cluttered is one of the biggest set backs you can go through! Five clothing and accessories together is a good rule to follow.

, When your bedroom is clean you will be more organized, less stressed, and more clean yourself. Try to create a schedule for yourself on when to clean your room. The longer you procrastinate the worse your room will get. Spending 10 minutes a day is great to keep your room clean.

, Inviting people over keeps you in somewhat of an inner circle that no other event can overcome. If there is a school club you are in that is coming to a milestone of some sort, assume it as the chance for a party and invite some people over.

You don’t have to wear loose clothes, but you should stay away from clothes which cling to your bust or which show a lot of skin. Consider wearing peasant blouses that are flowy and girly, or loose-fitting empire style dresses.If you’re more of a tomboy, don’t feel like you have to wear dresses or extra-feminine clothes just to look innocent and cute. Try wearing raglan-style shirts or loose-fitting crop tops for a cute and youthful silhouette.;
, Light colors naturally look more innocent than black or other dark, bold colors. Wear clothes, especially tops, that are light colored as opposed to dark.

Try wearing tops that are white, yellow or pastel colors. You can also wear clothes with cute prints like hearts, polka dots, or animal patterns like cat faces or owls.
To look extra-feminine, wear shirts with cute embellishments like bows, lace or ribbons.

, A lot of people think that the only way to look cute and innocent is to not wear makeup. But if you love wearing makeup, there’s no reason to give it up! Instead of wearing dark makeup like smoky eye shadow, black winged eyeliner, dark lips and heavy contouring, go for lighter-colored makeup instead.Use rosy shades for your eyes, lips and cheeks. Rosy tones make you look cute and flushed, adding to your innocent look.
You can also wear sparkly eye shadow in colors like champagne, rose gold or peach.
Larger eyes naturally look more cute and innocent. Emphasize your eyes by lining them with brown eyeliner at the lash line. Black eyeliner can be overwhelming especially on light complexions, but if it works for you then go for it.
There are thousands of makeup tutorials on the Internet that focus on cute makeup looks. In particular, look for words like “cute”, “innocent”, “natural” and “romantic” when you are finding a tutorial.

, Wear cute accessories like bows, barrettes, or butterfly clips in your hair, and jewelry that has cute charms like hearts or stars. If you want a more subtle cute look with your accessories, wear small, delicate pieces like thin rings and bracelets.If you’re a tomboy, you can accessorize with a baseball cap, a beanie or a newsboy cap for a cute look.

, Try to avoid wearing heels, and instead, wear flat shoes like ballet flats, mary janes or canvas sneakers. You can also wear flat boots in the winter. Flat shoes look more youthful and wholesome than heels - and they are better for you too.

, If you’re naturally a loud person, try and monitor how loudly you talk. A soft, easy voice can add to your innocent, shy vibe. Don’t try to change your voice altogether, just try to tone down your voice a little bit. It may be worth it to take a couple of days where you really pay attention to the way you talk. After a little practice, it should come naturally to you., Playing with your hair is an adorable way to bring attention to yourself. If you have long hair, run your fingers through it, curl in around your finger or tuck it behind your ear when talking. If you have short hair, rumple your hair or sweep it to the side., Part of being innocent and cute is having an optimistic and positive outlook on life. Smile to let your sweet side shine through. Giggle or laugh when people tell jokes or funny stories to show that you appreciate them and to come across as being approachable and friendly.Try to laugh sweetly rather than loudly or aggressively.
You can even put a hand up in front of your mouth as you giggle. This is an extra cute way to laugh!

, Always aim to be considerate and kind. Instead of dominating conversations and making yourself the focus of a group, take a step back and hear others out. Do your best to make people feel included and comfortable, and try to be sensitive and empathetic instead of hardheaded or stubborn.If you notice that someone looks uncomfortable or is not participating in a conversation, ask them a question about themselves to make them feel more at ease and involved.

, Don't make crude jokes or tell stories with a lot of sexual innuendo. Attract attention because of your kind and sweet personality, not because you are being sexually suggestive.


If you are in a conversation that turns sexual, you don’t have to pretend like you don’t know what is being talked about, but instead stay silent or giggle shyly.
Just because you want to embrace your cute side, don’t think that you can’t have a boyfriend. You just need to focus on making your personal and romantic life private rather than something you talk about in detail.

, Your shyness isn’t a weakness; in fact, it will only add to your innocent vibe! Don’t think that you have to hide your shyness or compensate for it. Blushing or even being a little awkward will only make you appear more cute and adorable.If you’re not naturally shy at all, don’t feel like you should fake it. You want to be as authentic as possible.

, Find a fulfilling and enriching hobby to keep you out of trouble! Hobbies can awaken your curiosity and your inner child, especially creative ones like drawing, writing or learning a musical instrument. You can also try out activities like horseback riding or hiking which bring you closer to nature. If you don’t already have a hobby, try a couple on for size.


If you don’t know how to start, join a class or a club to help you get started.

, Find friends who also are trying to live wholesome and fulfilling lives. It’s much easier to feel innocent and sweet when you spend time with like-minded people. Find alternative activities that you can do with these new friends instead of partying or getting into trouble.


Don't worry if you find that you are happier around younger friends - it's perfectly normal.
Spend time with kids and interact with them to see how they act. Try to understand how they see the world and try to learn from them. Enjoy children's activities and the things that innocent people enjoy.
To find new friends, try and talk to new people at your school, your work, your church or other place of worship, or through a youth group.

, Make kindness a central part of your existence. Try to do one thing a day to help others out, whether it be helping someone cross the street or tutoring a classmate. Being kind not only benefits others, but it can change your world view. It’s hard to feel cynical when every day you are helping others and making a difference.Be interested in others; someone who engages others in conversation, takes an interest in what others say, and shows a genuine concern for the other person's interests.
Give compliments. Everybody loves a girl who sees good in others and makes them feel good. It can be a great conversation starter sometimes too.(""Where'd you get your shoes? They're so cute!"") Just make sure you mean it; say it in your normal tone of voice, not a squeaky, overenthusiastic one.
Think about volunteering in your spare time; it's a great way to give something back to the community and to meet other people who also want to make a difference.

, Getting drunk and out of control isn’t cute at all. Try to drink only in small amounts, or, better still, cut it out all together. If you are socializing with people who are drinking, have only one or two drinks or opt for something non-alcoholic. Smoking also destroys your new cute persona., Try to aim at being the best and getting straight A's. Be polite in class, and make sure you always do your do your homework on time. Be nice to your classmates and to your teacher. Be respectful, kind, and helpful to everyone at school. This will make people like and respect you more.


Being innocent doesn't mean being ignorant, so try to read proper newspapers and books out of class.

, Sex and violence help sell things and so they are highly prevalent in the media, and it’s hard to stay innocent when you are constantly surrounded by them. To stay safe online, ask your parents to install parental control software on your phone and PC. This will let them block websites concerning porn, drugs, violence, etc, which are inappropriate for the new you. Don't feel childish or silly about asking for this; you will feel safer and protected this way, and your friends will think it's very cute.
Try to cut down the time you spend in front of the television, and try to customize the media that you take in by cutting out shows that feature a lot of sex and violence. Again, your parents can help you here.
Celebrity magazines aren't really good for you either - try to read something more uplifting.

, Instead, agree a bedtime with your parents (10.00? 10.30?) and ask them to make you stick to it even if you would rather not sometimes. You will feel super cute and innocent getting ready for bed knowing that other girls are out partying.


Bedtime is much better if your bed is lovely and warm. So ask your Mom to put a hot water bottle in your bed around 20/30 minutes before your bedtime.

Wear the things that show who you are, listen to music that expresses your soul, and never pay any attention to the haters. They're just upset that they don't enjoy their life that much.;
, This is really what being indie is all about. It is about liking things and appreciating things that are neglected or that deserve more love than they're getting. From small-time musicians trying to get by to lovingly crafted (rather than lovingly budgeted) films, indie culture is all about finding that diamond in the rough.

, Like the indie movie directors and musicians you admire, make sure to approach life in an independent way. Do the things that make you happy and don't be afraid to deviate from the norm. Dye your hair weird colors because you like the color. Wear clothes that don't match because you like how the patterns clash. Take up a hobby that's considered weird because you don't think it should be weird.

, You can stay totally single, date whoever you want (regardless of what society would think), date more than one person at a time (as long as your significant others agree), and make sure to maintain your independence in any relationship you do have.

, State your opinions, let your appearance express your individual personality, and take actions in your life that express who you are and what you believe in. If it is extremely important to you that employees get fair treatment, volunteer with a worker's rights organization. If you don't like something going on in your country, protest and work to get your issues on the next ballot.

Have discerning taste.,
Look for the timeless, not the ephemeral.,
Get into the music.,
Get into DIY.,
Constantly expose yourself to new things.",How to Be Indie2," In mainstream culture, people tend to just like things because everyone else likes them, not because they're actually good. In indie culture, people take quality seriously and you will need to as well. People can of course have different opinions about what is good, but you should evaluate new things to think about whether you think they are actually good. Set the standards bar high for music, food, clothing, and everything else in your life (especially concerning consumer products).

, Mainstream culture tends to be really trendy and most things that are popular will only be considered good for a short time. You should look for things, both past and present, which have a timeless quality. This is why indie music tends to take a lot of influence from folk music and fashion usually pulls from the 40s-70s.

, Indie means independent record label, after all. I won't bother with a list of well-known indie bands for you to listen to; there are new bands with new sounds coming out all the time and to tell you what to listen to would defeat the purpose. Being indie about music is about being open to new things.


Do some research. There are many online services such as Pandora and Grooveshark that will allow you to put in the name of an artist you enjoy and will make recommendations for you of new artists for you to listen to. Try new things and find some new bands!
Head down to your local record store, if it still exists. Picking through records for hours is how our predecessors found their music and there is a lot to be said for it. If you're lucky enough to still have a local record store, become a patron.






Talk to your friends about music. The best way to learn about artists you will really enjoy is to talk to other people who love music. Being indie is about exchanging new ideas and sharing new things; when you find a band you like, share it with your friends!
Get involved in your local music scene. No matter where you are, there are people playing music in your area. This is the heart of indie music, and a great way to get involved in your community. If you play music yourself, find people to make new sounds with! There's no better way to participate in indie culture than by making indie music.






Don't worry about whether or not your tastes are popular or ""indie enough."" Listen to what you love. There is no ""master indie playlist"" that tells us which songs are cool and which are not.

, Part of being indie is about making your own stuff, and learning new skills.


Take your existing interests and hobbies to the next step. Love to eat? Learn to cook! Love scarves and knitwear? Learn to knit! Really into your smartphone? Learn to develop apps yourself! The information is out there to self-educate, and the potential is limitless.
Don't be afraid to be creative. Indie labels have always been known for new kinds of music that push boundaries. Push boundaries in your creative endeavors too.
Get your friends involved in DIY too. You can complete more ambitious projects when you have help! Build a community garden or volunteer for a cause you all care about. Being indie is also about doing things together. There are many community organizations to get involved with in your local area.

, New movies (from new directors!), new books (or old, neglected ones), new music, or a new look, you should always be open to new things. Even philosophies and ideas. Indie culture is about finding things to love that people have neglected, forgotten about, or haven't had the chance to appreciate yet.

Express yourself with your wardrobe.,
Stay away from big brands and stores.,
Make your accessories treasures.,
Go for a natural look.",How to Be Indie3," Almost as if you are a blank white canvas and your style is the art. What would you want to say to people? Indie is about finding your own voice and and being proud to speak.


Look for vintage clothes that you like. Older cuts and prints are often lost to time, and some of them are completely worth bringing back!
Don't be afraid to wear something that you might think is a little crazy. Being indie is about being you! If you think it will look good, give it a shot.

, Visit your local thrift store instead — you will save money, help the earth by recycling, and find treasures you would never see at the mall.

, Jewelry, watches, hats, scarves: all of them are avenues of expression. Look for treasures in your travels, but don't forget that you can make them yourself! Your accessories should look like they have significance to you.

, Indie culture tends to focus on a natural look. Minimize the makeup, wear organically shaped clothing (flowy tops or willowy pants), and keep your hair looking great but kind of like you just rolled out of bed or came off the beach.

Have fun!",How to Be More Interesting," Relax. One reason why many people fail to become interesting and stimulating people is that they worry too much over the small things and don’t come across as natural. Their effort backfires on them, because they are just trying too hard. Try to stay relaxed and flexible. Take life one day at a time.Don't sweat the small stuff. Don't stress out if a class you wanted to take on the weekend is suddenly cancelled, for example. Instead, re-frame your thoughts to look ahead. Rather then get bummed out and dwell, find out when there's another class or plan something else to do.;
, Interesting people are happy people. This is one of the reasons why we find them so interesting; whether we admit it or not, we want to know how and why happy people are so happy. Moreover, no one really wants to be around a ""Debbie Downer"", a negative, unhappy person.Look for the positives in your life and become practiced in seeing the glass “half full."" Feeling down because you never have plans on a Friday night? Instead of getting depressed, think of what you could do with that time: join a games night cafe, start a knitting club, etc. Sometimes disadvantages can turn into opportunities!

, Be available to the world and look for excitement instead of waiting for it to find you. Celebrate flexibility and a ""just go with it"" attitude.


Oftentimes people aren’t interesting because they are reserved. Many people feel that they need hold back in order to protect themselves. Of course, to some extent, this is true, but you can also take this too far. By holding back too much, you're limiting your potential and in the process becoming less interesting. The more reserved you get, the more static your life., Being interesting means doing things you've never done before and being willing to share those experiences with other people. People who are boring and dull normally possess a very small comfort zone. So try to constantly expand your comfort zone and dare yourself to try new things; this is the quickest path to becoming more interesting.The more out of the ordinary experiences you have, the more of an interesting person you will become. People often ""live through"" the experiences of others. One person may not be ready to go skydiving but will feel in awe that you have and want to know all about it! Sign up for class about something you have never done before, like pottery or knitting, or participate in a sport you haven’t played before, like rugby.
Try things you might not be great at, such as public speaking or improv. Learn to master these skills.
Remember that the only way we can bring change and growth in our lives is by challenging the habits and behaviors we currently have. So push yourself to your limits and challenge yourself to improve and grow.

, Being more interesting isn't about sitting around, but about living a varied life. You want to become the kind of person who has new things they can introduce to everyone.Read widely. Read books on different topics by a range of different types of writers. Listen to podcasts. Keep up-to-date on what's going on in the world. Form your own opinions about the complicated world in which you live.
Learn about your neighborhood. Seek out new places or revisit old haunts in your town. Make one weekend night a week a ""going out"" night where you explore the 'hood.
Seek out interesting people. The people you spend time with affect your behavior. The Longevity Project, which studied over 1000 people from youth to death found that the groups you associate with often determine the type of person you become. So, if you want to be interesting, you need to surround yourself with dynamic people!, If everyone else is doing it, you’re too late. Do your own thing, and others will follow. Plus, it's more fun to set the interesting trends than to simply follow them.Be the leader of a crowd, not a follower. That shows you have confidence are someone worth knowing.

, This is quite possibly the most important point about becoming more interesting. No one is the exact same as anyone else. Every individual is precisely that - individual. Everyone has quirks and insights unique to themselves. Don’t hide these things; these are what make you interesting.Don't underestimate how interesting certain quirky or intellectual aspects of you can be. You like reading history books? Embrace it, rather than see it as a nerdy pastime of interest to no one. You can impress people with your knowledge of some pretty esoteric topics.
Wear something crazy and fun. People might laugh but it will make you interesting. Don't be afraid to stand out.
Never feel as though you should have to change or hide who you are. Your quirks are what make you YOU. Becoming a more interesting person does not mean become someone else, but instead highlighting what it is about you specifically that is interesting. , The author of the book on being interesting, literally titled How to Be Interesting, has said that the first step to being interesting is to actually show up. Go to things, socialize, meet people.You can show up basically as an observer of other interesting people and let that be a learning experience for you, or you can show up and be a little bit more of the life of the party. But the main thing is to show up. Consider this part of the exploration process.If you're at a party, make a circuit of the room, or try something on the table you've never had before. Stepping out of your comfort zone like this instantly gives you something to talk about with another guest.

, Remember, being interesting doesn't mean that you left the biggest impression, or that you're the one telling the story that grabs everyone's attention. Rather, it means that you left a positive impression on the people you interacted with or had a good conversation with them, and they want to get to know you.Most captivating people are often good listeners. Impressing people can be great but it can also devolve into status jockeying, one-upmanship, and envy. People love to talk about themselves and all the while there is a dearth of good listeners. Let the other person talk. , This is straight from Dale Carnegie's classic book How to Meet Friends and Influence People. Ask people what they've been up to or what their hobbies are. Then talk about that. You've become interesting simply by showing an interest. If you know about the topic, the similarity will bond you. If you don't, ask them to explain and listen as they talk about something they love., You should have at least three stories that reliably entertain, inform, and engage other people. Rehearse your ""act"" just like a comedian. Don't count on making up good ""material"" on the spot; comedians don't do this and neither should you.


Keep in mind that people are generally more interested in stories about other people, rather than things. Human beings are fascinated by their own behavior. Capitalize on this. , Being interesting is as much about how you say something as what you have to say. Two people can tell the same story, but one person can do it in a droning, boring way and the other in a punchy, engaging bit. You want to be the latter.Everyone has certain things about them that people tend to ask about over and over. Common topics include work, school, family, recent trips, etc. It helps to have mini-speeches and stories prepared for these topics. That way, if someone asks, you'll have something ready to go.
When you're speaking, words only account for 7 percent of what is conveyed. Voice tone and body language are far more important. Inject humor and personality into what you're saying. Laugh. Smile. Be passionate. Gesture.Think about the most interesting person you know; chances are that this person had a manner of being that drew you to them - were they relaxed or confident or outgoing or enigmatic? Try to replicate this.

, Read other people. What you tell your parents about your recent trip to Europe will differ from what you tell new friends. If you notice people's attention wandering, try to switch it up, or ask a question., Bravery is needed to have contrary opinions and take unexpected paths. You don't have to be like everyone else and you shouldn't want to be. If you’re not courageous, you’re going to be hanging around the water cooler, talking about the guy who actually is., Play around. Don't be afraid to just be yourself.

Keep it real.",How to Be Fabulous," Sequins are amazing. They make you sparkle and give you all of that Mae West drama in a nice modern package. Are you wearing sequins? That's nice. Wear more. Sequin dresses are the best. Don't ever let anyone tell you that they're out of fashion because they just don't know what they're talking about.;
, Who wants to live a dull life of grey and brown? NOBODY. Bring color into the lives of everyone you know by wearing bright outfits. Be daring in your color choices and don't be afraid to bring more than one bright color in at a time.

, Not social drama though, who wants more of that? When we say drama we mean something like a feather or (faux!) fur stole. You know you can bring it like Marilyn Monroe, so bring it!

, To your heels, we mean! Jeez. Take those boring kitten heels and add some drama. You're hitting fabulous around the 3.5"" mark.

, More hair, piled higher, with more volume: that's fabulous. Get extensions or even a fun wig. You can add even more drama by adding color to your hair. Just make sure you look super-model perfect all the time. The fabulous look is less Beach Bum and more LA runway.

, What are you listening to us for? The whole point of dressing fabulous is to follow your own mind. You've got fabulous taste, naturally! The most important thing is to dress in a way that makes you happy and makes a statement about who you are. If you are tweed coats with elbow patches, that's fabulous too and don't let anyone tell you different.

, Don't ever be ashamed of the person you are or that body that you have. Why would you be? You're fabulous just the way you are! Rock what your mamma gave you and embrace who you are. Wear the best clothing cut for your shape and wear clothing styles that match your personality.

, Do not let anyone tell you who you are. Explore the things that you want and pursue the things that make you happy. Why would you spend time trying to be someone you're not and doing a whole bunch of stuff you don't like doing? It's a waste of your life! You should find who you are and what makes you happy and forget about everything else. Don't worry. You'll find a place for you.


A good way to go about discovering yourself is to volunteer. Help people that are in a really tough situation that you identify with. This will go a long way towards helping you discover yourself.






Another way to learn about yourself is to travel. Go somewhere really far away where people are very different than you and you'll learn a lot about who you are as a person. It will also make you more confident!







, The really fabulous people aren't laid back, hang out on the couch and watch Jerry Springer kind of people. They are the get out there and enjoy their life kind of people! Drink a couple shots of espresso and you'll be ready to party your way through life.

, The truly fabulous are not afraid to express their emotions Share the experience of being human with everyone around you, revel in the ups and downs of life, by never being afraid to show exactly how you feel about what's going on. Humans are emotional creatures and holding all that in can be really unhealthy.

, Your clothing should always be fab-u-lous! Dress loud and proud, choosing colors and styles that make you happy and express who you are. The brighter the colors, the better! You should use your clothing to announce to the world that you are here and ready to be worshiped.

, No one is going to think you're fabulous if you don't think you're fabulous. You need to start by leaving behind all of the self-critical behavior and self-doubt. You're an awesome person, even if you don't always feel like it. Give yourself a hug, buy yourself a nice present, and take yourself on a date to that sushi place, because you are worth it!


If there's something you really don't like about yourself and it's a legit problem (like maybe you're kind of a jerk sometimes), then fix it!







, You can't rock the world with your awesomeness if you're tired and haggard looking! Beauty sleep really does make you more beautiful, so get in your 8 hours. In the mean time, you can strut your stuff in Dreamland.

, If you really want to be fabulous, you have to like people. And you have to spend time with people. You need to give them the opportunity to enjoy everything you have to offer in life, so get out there and be sociable. Go to parties, host parties, hang out with friends, go to clubs, and find other great ways to spend time with people and make new friends.

, As a fabulous diva, you will be expected to watch out for your friends, family, and others among your subjects and peers of fabulosity. Help people, defend them against critics, and let them discover their own inner divas. Bring out the best in them, because that is the most important job of The Fabulous One.

, You wouldn't want anyone to miss a single moment of the performance that is your life. What a terrible fate for them! Command attention no matter where you are in order to be sure that you are in control and driving the show. This doesn't mean making a scene and throwing a tantrum. No, you should command attention by being vocal (but not loud), making eye contact with people, and bleeding confidence out of every pore.

, You're too fabulous for people to waste your time with stupid ideas, hateful speech, or whiny attitudes. If someone around you is really negative and going around starting drama, stop hanging out with them. Ain't nobody got time for that. There're places to be and things to do!

, Your way is the right way, so get it. Usually you can get your way simply by being stubborn and standing by your principles and ideas. However, it can't hurt to get really good an arguing and convincing people of things. Sounding confident and like you know what you're talking about will also help you get your way.

, Don't be a slut (we said date, don't sleep around), but do feel free to date whoever you want to, as long as you aren't in a relationship. Why? Because it would be a shame to keep all this fabulousness to yourself! Get out there and show people what you've got to offer.

, Another important duty of The Fabulous One is to keep everyone happy and stress free by bringing the laughs. Help people by finding the humor in tough situations. Practice your snappy comebacks and clever one liners, so that you're ready when the time comes.

, You want your life to be as fabulous as you are so get out there and do things. If you don't want to work some 9-5 in an office, find a job that better suits you. Go to school for the things you love and get a career you won't hate in 20 years. Travel! See the world and learn fab from the best!


Great nightlife can be found in LA, New York, Las Vegas, Paris, Milan, Berlin, London, Bangkok, Buenos Aires, and São Paulo (Brazil).

, If you really want to live a fabulous life, it's going to mean living without fear and a healthy willingness to take risks. You can't just sit around doing the same things you always do. The best things in life are achieved when you get out there and do things that might not turn out. Forgo the sure bet in favor of the new experience.

, Instead of just following all the trends, you want to try to set them. This means being original and unafraid. Use those unique experiences you got while taking risks to bring new experiences to others. Be unique but wonderful and tasteful in everything you do and you will start trends.

, Being fabulous means apologizing to nobody, so don't be afraid to take things a little further or go a little more over the top than people would normally go. This will help show people who you are and also let you enjoy your life more. Life is short, so don't hold back!

, Cultivate a playlist that is the soundtrack to your life. Listen to songs when you are happy, sad, or angry, and have a go-to song for when you want to make yourself feel even more awesome than you already are.


Fabulous theme songs for your life include Natasha Bedingfield's ""Strip Me"", Miley Cyrus' ""We Can't Stop"", Janelle Monáe's ""Q.U.E.E.N."", and Beyoncé's ""Single Ladies"".







, Have a sweet pad to go with your fantastic personality. You have to have an equally great place to bring friends and lovers back to, right? It doesn't have to be big, but it should be flashy and flawlessly designed. Spend big bucks on designer furniture, or mimic the look with cheap vintage finds: whatever works for you!

, You don't need to be a jerk to people but you should tell it like it is. Avoid being super insulting but call people out when they're being jerks or doing things that are bad. Politeness isn't going to help anyone if people are doing harmful things.

Well, if that's the case, that has to change -- today. Instead of thinking that you're a boring person who needs to change completely, start by being positive. Think about all of the awesome things that make you stand out, and only then can you start making a game plan for being even more original.


Think of your personality. What are your three favorite traits? Are you funny, sarcastic, really smart? Can you be even more that way?
How about your looks? What are your three favorite physical traits? How can you work them to make yourself stand out even more?
Over the years, people must have given you compliments about certain aspects of your personality. Which things stood out the most?
Be honest with yourself. What's one thing you've always liked about your self that you feel hasn't gotten enough recognition?;
, The next thing you have to do if you want to be fresh and original is to stop thinking that you have to change completely because you just seem plain and boring. Instead, tell yourself that you're a fascinating person -- the world just hasn't figured it out yet. If you want to get anywhere in life, then you have to work on boosting your confidence. You have to love who you are, love how you look, and tell yourself that you have so much to offer to the world.


Change comes from the inside. First, you have to think that you're an original person on the inside. Then, you can start sharing that originality with the world. There's no point in trying to act original if you feel that you're boring deep down.
Make a list of all of the things about you that are really interesting. Keep going until you fill an entire page.

, Okay, so you've realized you're not as boring as you once thought and have boosted your confidence a bit. But something still needs to change, huh? No problem. It's time to do some soul searching to figure out what would make you a more original and fresh person. Once you figure it out, it's time to make an effort to act differently. Here are some things you may want to change:


Maybe you think that you look like everyone else and have no sense of your own style. Start shopping on your own and wear what makes you feel good instead of what everyone else is wearing.
Maybe you think you blend in with the crowd at parties, in class, wherever. Make an effort to talk to new people more, to put yourself out there and crack people up, to offer original opinions instead of nodding along with the masses, or just to act a little crazy (in a good way).

, You might have come up with the two or three qualities you want to work on to make yourself really stand out. Great. Is it gonna happen overnight? Probably not. If you show up to school acting and looking completely different, people may think you're trying too hard. Instead, take baby steps to get to the place where you want to be. This will make it easier to truly change and will make the process feel more natural.


If you want to change your style, there's no need to get a complete makeover on the Sunday before school. Instead, start introducing new items into your wardrobe little by little until you've really changed your look.
If you want to become a more vocal person, start talking more in social situations, little by little.
If you want to start forming interesting opinions, start reading up on the things you care about instead of blurting out controversial comments that you can't back up.

, Part of being fresh and original means taking a moment to consider where your values, ideas, and opinions come from. Are you really as liberal or conservative as you think? Do you really think you know how people should behave in social situations? Do you really think you know everything there is to know about your favorite subject in school? The more you can turn your world on its head and start looking at old things with a new perspective, the easier it will be to be fresh and original and to start looking at the same old thing in new ways.


Talk to people who have the opposite point of view about something you feel strongly about. Take the time to really listen to their opinions, not to brush them off.
Consider why you think a certain way. Is it because of how you were raised, because of where you grew up, or because of the people you hang out with? How many of your opinions are really objective? Not as many as you thought, eh?
Any time you have a really strong opinion, take a moment to write down what the other side would say and why. This will make you understand your own ideas in a new way.

, You may not be feeling original because you do the same old thing every single day of your life. So, it's time to mix things up. Start small. Have something different for breakfast. Go to bed an hour later. Take a new route to school. As you get more comfortable, change bigger things. Sit at a different lunch table. Take an interest in a new subject. Spend an evening with a new group of friends. See how much these changes start to affect how you ""normally"" act.


Sure, some routine is good. But doing the same old thing every day is exactly what will make you feel like the same old person.
Forming new habits will make you see that being a different kind of person isn't as impossible as you think.
Even if you find a new routine that works for you better, don't be afraid to mix that up, too.

, If you want to be fresh and original, then you can't just hang on to the things that make you feel super comfortable. You have to try things that make you feel scared, out of your element, confused, or just a little intimidated. This doesn't mean you should get in a knife fight or do a backflip off a skyscraper, but it does mean that you should try doing things that make you feel a bit out of your element, whether it's going to a party where you don't know many people or going to the movies by yourself.


Make a list of all of the things you are afraid of doing, whether it's hiking or dancing in public. Ask yourself how many of those things are really so scary.
Do something you know you'll be bad at. That takes some of the pressure to succeed off and will make you have more fun in the process. If you know you're a terrible singer, sign up for voice lessons. Knowing you won't be the next Whitney Houston will take some of the pressure off.
If you're really afraid to do something, like running a 10K, train with a friend who is an expert. Being with someone who is comfortable doing something even if you're not can make you more comfortable.

, If you want to be fresh and original, then you have to be at least somewhat outgoing. Introduce yourself to strangers. Volunteer to go first in a class presentation. Sign up for your school's talent show even if you don't have a talent. Post something interesting and provocative on Facebook. It doesn't matter what you do. What does matter is that you step out of the shadows and get comfortable in the spotlight -- or near it, at least.


If you're quiet in social situations, try to talk about 30% more the next time. You don't have to dominate the conversation, but you should make an effort to be more talkative.
Talk to new people. If you're scared to do this, then start by asking them some simple questions first.
Sign up for an acting or an improv class. They'll get you more comfortable with being yourself in front of an audience.

, Part of being original is going against the expectations people have of you. If they know exactly what you'll do and exactly what you'll say at any given moment, then how can you call yourself an original person? You don't have to act completely weird to surprise people, but you should work on upping that unpredictability factor if you really want to stand out to people.


Don't be afraid of being a goofball. Do a silly dance or tell a corny joke that you know will make people groan when they least expect it.
Play a prank on your friends every once in a while. Make sure to get 'em good.
If you get in the habit of stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things, then people will already be surprised when you tell them about your latest endeavor.
Go on an impromptu adventure. Take a weekend road trip or check out a hidden gem in your neighborhood. Be spontaneous as much as you can and you will keep people guessing.

, If you want to be fresh and original, then you have to look the part. This doesn't mean you should wear bright neon colors or dye your hair pink -- unless that's your thing, of course -- to get noticed. However, it does mean that you should find a hairstyle, a look, and a wardrobe that is unmistakably you. If you shop at the same two stores and look exactly like your five closest friends, then you won't be very original, will you?


Try shopping in a store you have never set foot in before. You may be surprised by all of the great clothes you will find.
Check out thrift stores to add some quirky items to your wardrobe.
You know that clothing item you saw that made you say, ""That looks so cute, but I'd never be able to pull it off..."" Well, why not? It's time to stop doubting yourself and try it on.
Get your stores from as many different stores as possible. If you only shop at Macy's, it'll be easier for someone else to replicate your look.
Sick of the same old haircut? Experiment with a completely new 'do. If it doesn't work, no worries -- just grow it out and try something else.

, If you want to be original, then you should have unique talents. Try something different that you never would have thought would appeal to you, from salsa dancing to violin lessons. Learn Chinese. Become a yoga master. Volunteer in a local soup kitchen. It doesn't matter what you do -- what does matter is that you find something new to be passionate about. Having passion for something different will make you unique.


If you don't pursue your own interests, then yeah, you won't stand out. You'd rather be ""The girl who speaks Chinese"" or ""the guy who is a curling master"" instead of ""that person who hangs out in that one crowd.""
Trying new hobbies will also lead you to meet new people, who can also help you gain an original perspective.

, Part of being fresh and original is being able to engage almost anyone in conversation. Talking to strangers -- provided you don't meet them when they're trying to lure you into their vans with candy -- can help you become more comfortable with yourself, learn to talk to a variety of people, and just become a more engaging, fresh, and original person.


Start by making small talk with the check-out girl at your local grocery store. The next week, try chatting up the person next to you before a yoga class. What's the worst that can happen?
Try talking to people you don't know at parties. That's what parties are for, right? If you're more shy, talk to new people while you're standing with mutual friends.

, This one is a no-brainer. If you want to be unique, then you can't spend all of your time with people who have nothing to offer but the same stale, boring opinions. You shouldn't ditch your entire friend group to hang out with a bunch of weirdos, either, but you should seek out people who have unique opinions and different perspectives on the world that can change your own. Original people can be found anywhere: in your own home, in your classes, or at work. Make an effort to seek out people who see the world a little differently.


When you find these people, ask them lots of questions. Understand where they are coming from.
Original people aren't the ones who stand out the most or have the loudest opinions, either. You will have to get to know them.

, You shouldn't form radical opinions just to scare people or look like an extremist. Instead, you should do a lot of research; watch documentaries, read different types of newspapers and magazines, and talk to a variety of people before you come to your own conclusions. Then, when you feel comfortable with your original thoughts, start sharing them -- with the people who care what you think, of course.


Don't jump to conclusions and put it all out there before you can back up your thoughts. It's all about doing your research.
If you go along with the mainstream about some things, that's perfectly fine. Having a ""normal"" opinion is better than having a radical opinion just for the sake of it.
Learn to have educated debates with people instead of just arguing with them. You don't have to be stubborn to be original. In fact, truly original people are comfortable with listening to the opinions of others.

, Of course, this may be difficult on a limited budget, but if you have any money to spare, make an effort to see a new part of the world. If you can't afford it, travel just a few towns over or do some volunteering work in a foreign land. The important thing is that you see how other people live and see the world; bonus points if what you see is pretty different from the way you live your life.


Make a goal of going to a completely new place at least once a year, even if you're just going to a new state.
When you do travel, ask as many questions as you can. Talk to the locals. Don't be a tourist and try to get an authentic experience.

, Acting fresh and original is great -- acting just plain weird to get attention is not. This can be a fine line. Some people really are so original and unique that they seem just plain weird because no one gets them; others, however, just seem to act weird to get attention, and those people can look like posers. So, whenever you try to be original, make sure it comes from within, not just because you want people to look at you.


Wearing a funky bracelet you found in your grandma's jewelry box is original; wearing hot pink pants just to get attention can be seen as weird.
Telling people something they've never heard before in an interesting conversation is original; blurting out personal or gross information just to raise a few eyebrows is weird.
Stating a unique opinion in class is original; making weird donkey noises when the bell rings is weird.

, Being fresh and original doesn't mean just finding a new ""original"" way to be and sticking to it. If you really want to be fresh and original, then you have to know that the hunt for knowledge is never over. You can renew yourself; again, again, and then again. Always question your beliefs, seek out new people and activities, and aim to have a fresh perspective as often as you can.


Though confidence is the key to happiness, there's no such thing as being completely happy with the person that you are. Love yourself -- but always strive for something more.
This doesn't mean being a tree-hugging liberal one day and a die-hard conservative the next. Reinventing yourself is a gradual process.

, If you want to be original long-term, then you can't let haters get you down. Sure, there will be people who think you're weird for trying to be original, but is that worse than having people think you're boring -- or even to not have them think about you at all? Work on following your own path instead of being concerned about what other people are doing and thinking, and you will succeed in no time.


It's great to get advice from friends; it's not great to question what you're doing just because someone not-so-great is questioning you.
Constructive criticism can help you become a better person; destructive criticism should be thrown out the window.

If you want to be feisty, start here. All feisty people let their opinions be known one way or another. Whether you're just shooting the breeze with friends or participating in a serious debate, you'll want to let the people around you know what you're thinking, even if it's something they won't agree with. This has benefits beyond just making you seem feisty — a fearless expression of your opinions can lead others to respect you for your boldness, even if they don't agree with you.


While you will want to have no qualms about saying what's on your mind, ordinary social etiquette still applies to you even if you're feisty, so avoid being rude when you're expressing your opinions. For instance, if you're with your friends and they want to see a movie that you don't think you'll like, at dinner, you might say something light-hearted and sarcastic like, ""Wow, another paranormal teen romance? Sounds awesome, guys!"" You wouldn't want to say something like, ""You guys are morons. I can't believe you idiots like that trash."" Remember, feisty people are opinionated, but they're not cruel.;
, As a feisty individual, just as you'll want to let the people around you know what you're thinking, you'll also want to let them know how you're feeling. To a certain degree, the way you feel on the inside should be the way you behave on the outside. If you want to laugh, laugh. If you want to cry, cry. If you want to shout in somebody's face, go ahead and shout in their face (assuming they deserve it and that the situation is appropriate, of course). Don't waste time worrying about what other people think about your emotions. If they're genuine, they'll respect you for them.


Again, however, you'll want to be reasonable about just how extreme you are with the expression of your emotions. If you're frustrated during a math test, don't groan loudly and interrupt other students. If you're at a funeral, avoid breaking into fits of giggles, even if the joke you're thinking of is really funny. A healthy measure of common sense is key here — feisty people are open about their emotions, but they're not emotional wrecks.

, The two pieces of advice above (to be open about what you think and feel) are easier said than done, especially if you're naturally shy. A big part of being feisty is having the confidence to be open about these things. Confidence allows you to be genuine without fear, to express yourself without reservation, and to care about what others think in a way that's not dependent on their approval for your satisfaction. As a great all-around social tool, confidence can also help your social interactions go smoothly in general, ensuring, for instance, that you're seen as feisty, rather than confrontational.


Gaining confidence in certain social situations is something almost everyone struggles with. Countless books, articles, and other resources have been written on the subject. While gaining confidence is a process that's too long and detailed to discuss in-depth here, the basic idea is that you'll want to at first fake confidence by literally imitating confident behaviors (using eye contact, standing with good posture, and so on). Eventually, you'll be able to internalize this external confidence and begin to focus on your strengths, rather than your weaknesses, while simultaneously working to improve yourself. It's a vague process, but one that becomes easier with practice.
For more information, check out our fantastic How to Be Confident article.

, There's no avoiding it — if you're confident and open about what you're thinking and feeling, eventually, you're going to run into someone who thinks or feels the opposite of what you do. Conflict is a natural part of being feisty, so don't run from it. Instead, embrace it. Feisty people enjoy the possibility of a spirited (but friendly) debate, so feel free to engage in a little good-natured sparring when the opportunity arises. Not only is this a chance to stretch your mental and verbal muscles, but also a chance to gain a new point of view, make a connection with another person, and even flirt, so long as you're open to these possibilities. As always, however, your ""feistiness"" is no excuse to be rude, so be conscientious of the other person's feelings as you argue.


The tricky part of arguing as a feisty person is balancing your own genuine emotions with the needs of maintaining a civil argument. While you have no obligation to humor opinions that you find repugnant (like, for instance, racist or sexist prejudices), you should make a point to be polite about any sensible opinion your opponent might have. As a general rule, it's OK to attack someone's opinion, but not the person him or herself (e.g., favor phrases like ""that won't work"" over ones like ""you're dumb for thinking that will work"").

, As shallow as it sounds, the clothes we choose to wear are an important way of expressing ourselves. If you show up to a job interview wearing a business suit, you're presenting a much more professional image than if you show up in sweats and a t-shirt. While feisty people should still pay attention to social convention when it comes to dressing for important events like weddings, interviews, graduations, and so on, when there aren't obvious social expectations of what you should wear, it's up to you!


Dress however you'd like — if you feel like wearing bright colors, wear bright colors. If you feel like wearing something dark and muted, wear that instead. Make your clothing an emblem of your inner personality — it's a somewhat shallow but admittedly noticeable way to express yourself to you everyone you meet!

, All of the suggestions above have recommended that you should listen to your inner thoughts and feelings when it comes to expressing yourself, rather than others'. For feisty people, it's generally more important to be honest and open about yourself than to temper your opinions because another person may disagree with them. However, when doing this, it's crucial to maintain a positive and friendly attitude, or you risk coming across as arrogant or conceited. Worrying about what you expect from yourself more than what others expect from you is a great mindset to have, but the opinions of other people aren't entirely without merit, so don't outright ignore them! People who don't ever listen to others aren't feisty, they're just close-minded.


Other people's input can help you see problems from a new perspective or even come to a new understanding of yourself. For instance, if you're having a friendly, feisty argument with a friend about what is and isn't appropriate dating behavior, if you listen to what he says (without letting him walk all over you), you may learn something that can win you more dates in the future. You also may not, but if you don't listen, you definitely won't.

, As discussed above, feisty people are strong-willed and opinionated, but they're not blowhards. In fact, feisty people are usually a joy to be around because they simply love to have a great time! If you're looking to become feistier, start with your sense of mischief. Feisty people are constantly looking for a chance to get the better of others in good-natured, fun ways. Pranks and practical jokes are your bread and butter here, though you can also give the impression of being mischievous just by saying mischievous things. For starters, try any of the following:


Purposely interpreting the things your friends say in the worst way possible (e.g., with jokes like ""that's what she said"" and so on).
Leaving goofy messages on someone's computer after s/he leaves the room.
Impersonating a telemarketer when a parent answers your call.
Telling the people you meet at a party a name that isn't actually yours.
More elaborate practical jokes a la those in How to Pull Harmless Pranks.

, Though feisty people enjoy the occasional argument, at their hearts, they're good-natured, happy people. Achieving this type of happy satisfaction is easiest if you have a strong sense of humor. If you're naturally somewhat serious or grim, this can be tricky, but it's not impossible. Memorizing a few canned jokes or funny stories can be good icebreakers, giving you an ""in"" to conversations so that you can let your guard down and begin enjoying yourself. Try to stay relaxed and open-minded during social encounters. Empathize with other people — realize that the vast majority are just like you. Most of all, practice by having light-hearted conversations with your friends and with people you've just met. A sense of humor is like a muscle: you have to use it to for it to become strong.


It's hard to have a good sense of humor if you're stressed, tired, or distracted. This means that, to be as feisty as possible, you'll need to have a strong hold on other aspects of your life, like your career and family responsibilities. Ironically, the best way to have a good sense of humor is to be serious about ensuring that everything else in your life is going well so that you can relax and enjoy yourself.

, Feisty people have reputations as merciless teases, and with good reason. Light-hearted teasing is a great way to keep another person's ego in check while subtly building up your own. In other words, it's just plain fun! When you tease, however, it's important to keep your barbs mild and to stay away from personally sensitive topics to avoid hurting the recipient's feelings. It's also important to be ready to receive a little teasing of your own. Don't dish it out if you can't take it!


One of the very feistiest ways to tease someone is to fire back with a perfect retort after s/he says something cheeky or unsuspecting. Doing this requires a quick wit and excellent comedic timing — it' not easy, but with practice, it is possible to get better at it. For more information, see How to Think of Quick Witted Comebacks


, One of the biggest perks of being feisty is that it's free license to be a shameless flirt! Flirting should be a fun, exciting opportunity and the perfect opportunity to show off your feistiness, not something to be dreaded. Don't be shy — remember that feisty people don't keep their opinions to themselves.


Like being confident, the specifics of flirting are so broad that there's not enough room to do them justice in this article. The basic idea is that you'll want to joke and lightly tease people you're attracted to, showing them special attention while simultaneously staying ""hard to get"". A sense of confidence is crucial for good flirting skills, though looks, intelligence, and a good personality are also big pluses.
If you're looking for more guidance, you may also want to check out How to Flirt.

, Quick! Make a list of the feistiest people or characters you know. Now, how many of them have a sarcastic sense of humor? Odds are that most do! From Princess Leia to Danny DeVito to Hermione Granger, feisty people are known for their prodigious senses of sarcasm. Basically, sarcasm is saying the opposite of what you think in a humorous way that makes it obvious that you're joking. Sarcasm is a great tool for joking, teasing, and flirting and is a potent conversational weapon in the hands of a feisty individual.


As an example of sarcasm, you might sarcastically say, ""Gee, this chicken is just like grandma used to make"" if you think it's not very good. You probably wouldn't just say, ""This chicken is good"" as a sarcastic joke, as there's not really any punchline here other than that you don't think it's good. Sarcasm needs humor to work well — sarcasm for sarcasm's sake can be dreadfully annoying.

, More than anything else, feisty people view the possibility of interacting with another person as a way to enjoy themselves. Flirting, teasing, joking, and conversing are all great fun for the feisty man or woman, which makes performing these activities an entertaining end in and of themselves, rather than a means to something else. By enjoying the back and forth of a good conversation and pursuing exciting new interactions no matter where you are, you'll make new connections, find new friends, and quickly gain a reputation as a feisty go-getter.

, Being feisty takes a lot of energy. Treating every conversation like an exciting new opportunity, constantly looking for ways to joke and tease, and going to great pains to ensure that everyone around you knows what you're thinking can be mentally and physically demanding. Because of this, it's easiest to be feisty if your body can keep up with the demands your new feisty personality is placing on it. Stay in shape by making an effort to get some form of exercise everyday and avoiding sugary and fatty foods. You don't have to be a bodybuilder to be feisty — you just have to be fit enough to have the energy to pounce on every opportunity to express yourself.


For detailed fitness advice, check out our article selection on personal fitness.

, Just as it's important to keep your body in good shape so that you have the energy to be as feisty as possible, it's also important to give yourself adequate rest so that, when you do run out of energy, you're able to replenish it. Everyone fatigues from social interactions at a different rate — some people can go from party to party without losing a beat, while others need to recuperate in solitude after a few hours out and about. Only you will know how much rest you need in order to be at your feistiest, so listen to your body. If you find yourself internally groaning at the thought of interacting with another human being, give yourself some alone time before venturing out.


It's worth noting that rest is also very important on a basic physical level. Most medical resources recommend that adults should get roughly 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Failing to get enough sleep can lead to chronic fatigue, stress, and irritability, all of which can lead to you acting more grouchy than feisty.

, While taking care of the physical side of the equation by exercising, eating nutritiously, and getting adequate rest are great ways to ensure you have the energy to be feisty at all times, in truth, sometimes even the feistiest people have a hard time motivating themselves. If you feel like you don't have the energy to meet the world with the feisty personality you know you have within you, try using one of the following pump-up strategies:


Listen to your favorite song. Bonus points if it's a motivational song along the lines of ""Eye of the Tiger"".
Watch an inspirational or suspenseful movie scene. Good choices include Alec Baldwin's profanity-laden speech from Glengarry Glen Ross and the Mexican standoff at the conclusion of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
Perform a short burst of intense physical activity, like jumping jacks or sprinting.
Listen to your favorite comedian.
Call a friend you haven't talked to in a while.
Send a flirty text to your significant other.
Watch a jump-scare video online to shock yourself awake.

Remember though, this doesn't mean you can't talk or chat. In fact, it's helpful to involve yourself in many conversations. Find a few relaxing things to do, for example taking a warm bath or listening to music.

, Have your own interests and opinions, and don't be afraid to voice them. Be passionate about what you believe!

, Being happy is beneficial for a number of reasons. Most applicable here, though, is that being happy lets other people know that you'd make a good friend. Beyond that, it'll make you feel better, too! Although, everyone has tough times so don't worry if you are occasionally upset.

, You'll never get anywhere as someone who always has their arms crossed and is frowning. Open up and smile at people! If you're in a room where you don't know anyone, introduce yourself. Cool people are the ones who talk a lot.

, Enter talent contests and competitions, but don't get excessively competitive or be a bad sport. Sports especially are very cool. If you play a sport, or are interested in playing a sport, try out for your team at school. Sports are a great way to make new friends, exercise, and get noticed. If you aren't really the athletic type, though, find a club you like. If you like to paint, join the art club. If you're into acting, try out for a play. If you like to sing, join the choir, and so on.

, Don't spend the whole time talking to just one person. Have fun and run around to different people to make conversation. Make the conversation light and friendly, but not too intense. Some possible topics are movies, school assignments, current events, books - anything that you think the other will like to talk about. Keep your excitement controlled, though. Also, be sure that you have variety in who you talk to. You don't want to accidentally start stalking people!

, Don't let it get too messy. You don't have to keep it sparkling clean, though. For example, some posters, a desk, wall paint/paper that reflects your style, etc.

, Do you have many of them? Having friends shows that you are kind and capable of creating and holding bonds with other people. Try to have an overlap of friends from different schools or camps.

, Don't use your computer too much! Myspace and Facebook are social networking websites, but it's much better if you can actually talk face to face with somebody instead of messaging/emailing them. Instead of stalking your crush online, spend time with your real friends/crush outside of your computer screen.

, Create a facebook profile, but get your parent(s) approval first. Make sure to use proper spelling and grammar. Remember, proper grammar and typing shows that you are well-read and have class. Never give away personal details online.

, Everyone loves music, and you can too. Listen to music that you like. Don't worry about listening to a certain genre of music simply because everyone else is listening to it. The kind of music that you like shows your personality and uniqueness - it's okay to stand out!


If you want to find out which songs are ""in"" right now, go to either MTV or iTunes (if you have an account) and look for the top 10 list.

, Going to the gym improves your body shape. That being said, if you are naturally big-boned or slender, don't worry too much. Get comfortable with your weight and outer appearance. It boosts your confidence. Get involved in a sport that you enjoy, all sports are healthy, so don't just go to the gym.

, Have you ever disliked how that popular, prissy, fashion-freak girl in your class treats you? Have you ever envied her? You may have envied her before, but if you were that girl, treating other people like that, people wouldn't like you. So don't envy her, and don't try to be like her. Just be yourself, because if you're an outgoing, kind, down-to-earth kind of girl, everyone is bound to like you!

, This doesn't mean you have to be friends with everyone, just be nice and it will help your reputation!

, If the chain of gossip that ""So-and-so likes So-and-so"" comes around to you, stop it right there. Don't tell anyone else, because then you'd just be continuing the chain, even if you know it's true. It would just be plain mean if you helped other people spread a rumor that may be true but that person doesn't want anyone to know, or even worse, that's just a plain, flat-out lie.

, If you tell one of your other close friends, tell her not to tell, and then she tells one of her other close friends, and then the chain goes on, pretty soon almost everyone will know, and your friend will not be happy about that. Keep all secrets between you and your friend, unless you feel that the person is in danger. In that case, tell a trusted adult, not other peers.

, Remember, you never want to go to school smelling bad, with greasy hair, dirt in your nails, or things stuck in your teeth. Shower daily. If you have a problem with dirt stuck in your nails, then paint them or work hard to clean them. Brush and floss your teeth to avoid stains. If you have acne, try using an acne face wash, such as Proactive, Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, etc. Also remember deodorant! Secret and Degree are good brands to try.;
, Feel comfortable in your clothes. Make sure that the colors don't clash. Know what's ""in."" Some cool places to shop are Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Aéropostale, American Eagle, H&M, Forever 21, and even the juniors department at Target. The following are all good items of clothing to own:


Skinny jeans/jeggings are comfortable and fun to wear to school.
If you have pierced ears, wear big earrings. Pearl and hoops are both good options.
Hoodies are a cute way to keep warm on a chilly day. Sweaters (especially those with ruffles) are also acceptable.
Big belts are definitely a necessity, especially if you have low-rise jeans.
Invest in some floral skirts for summery days. Hollister has some cute ones!
Scarves are another way to add spice to your wardrobe, especially in the winter.
Wear long necklaces. Aeropostale and American Eagle have very pretty jewelry.
Try short blue jean skirts. These are stylish and will match with anything. American Eagle has some cute ones.
Graphic tees are great to throw on when you don't feel like putting too much effort into your wardrobe. All of the stores above have very cute graphic tees.

, Here are some popular/cool shoe brands:

,, Better stuff are offered by Nike, Hollister, American Eagle, Forever 21, Reebok etc.

, Try to contrast them with bright colors like baby pink, white, yellow, light blue, green if it's summer.


Shorts with stripped leggings look good during winters.You can try contrasting them with dark colors like dark red,purple,dark blue,aubergines,forest green,black etc.

,,


Uggs are warm and very cute in the winter.
Rainbows are very stylish in the summer and will great with just about everything. They are also made very well and will last a long time without wearing out.
Converse are very cool and you can wear them anytime of the year. Consider buying a white pair and letting your friends draw on your shoes, or trade colorful shoe strings.
Try Wallabees by Clarks.
Sperry's are great spring and fall shoes.
Any kind of cute flat shoes are also popular to wear with skirts or dresses.

, Layered hair is in right now, but layers don't necessarily look great on everyone. Side bangs are a cute alternative. Highlights are hip, but only if done well. The ones that stand out always look fake and cheap. Different styles of hair look good on different people. Mix it up — don't wear your hair the same every day to school. Here are some ideas for hairstyles:


Wearing it down and straight. That is very stylish. If your hair is wavy or curly, you can achieve this look by straightening your hair in the morning. Just be aware that straightening your hair too often can damage its natural beauty overtime.
Wearing it down and curly. If your hair is really straight, you can achieve this look by curling your hair in the morning.
Wearing a high ponytail. Ribbons and bows look great in a ponytail. Try a bow or some ribbon that contrasts your outfit.
Wearing it in a side, low ponytail. These look great if they're a little messy.
Wearing it in a bun. Wearing your hair in a bun is a great option if you're having a bad hair day.
] Another trick for a bad hair day is by putting a cute beanie on top of neatly brushed hair.

, This is optional, but perfume (when used in moderation) can be very cool. Juicy Couture has some cool, good-smelling perfume.

, Makeup is very cool if you use it the right way. A little bit of mascara, eyeshadow, and lip gloss is all you need. Great Lash is a great mascara brand. Try Bobbi Brown brand for eyeshadow, but really any eye shadow works. Try BabyLips by Maybelline for your lips - it has pretty colors, has SPF, and all the while it's moisturizes, too. If you need foundation, Cover Girl is a good brand. And of course, don't be afraid to get nice, pretty eyeshadows from Claire's, Barry M or Rimmel.

, They're just ideas! Make sure that whatever you wear fits your style. Be you!

Make sure this is who you actually are.,
Start by acting a little more bubbly.,
Dress a little more happy.,
Crazy hair colors and nail polish designs/colors are great!,
Take the craziness to you room, notebooks, and anything else you want to add flair to!,
For an added effect, try eating a little more sugar than usual.,
Try to find some hyper people to hang around with.,
Don't be afraid to stand out!",How to Be Hyper and Bubbly," Have you been hiding your true, effervescent self away from family and friends, or are you just faking it? Write a list of reasons why you are changing your personality/finally letting your real personality show. Make sure you have at least three things before continuing on.;
, Don't change all in one day because it will seem like it's just a one time thing. You don't have to be happy about everything or be bouncy and hyperactive all the time; not only will it be annoying to other people, but you will tire of it faster. Gradually become more and more bubbly and happy, and always look at the glass as half full.

, Wear more bright colors, random, and happy things, if you'd like, to show that you're a fun person. You could also dress in darker colors and surprise people by being all happy and fun even though you dress very dark! Wear things like glow sticks, brightly colored jewelry, accessories with candy on them, shirts with funny sayings (which you can get at places online like www.snorgtees.com or www.6dollarshirts.com), and funky colored jeans. Carrying around a magic wand is something unusual you could do to stand out.

, Don't be afraid to put green tips in your hair and nails. Collect different colors of nail polish to use. Nail pens are really cool because you can draw on different designs with them! miginailart.com sells different sets of them for around $30, and they last a while. As for hair dying, don't go overboard. The most you should bleach you hair is every season, and even then it's not good to dye your hair. Bleach your roots and recolor your hair every time they start to grow out/fade. Try bleaching and dying your hair only once the previously bleached hair has grown out of your hair to keep it healthy.

, Collect a ton of stickers and then add them to notebooks and even put one or two on your face every now and then. As for your room, ask your parents if you can redo your room. If they say yes, go ahead and change it around. If they say no, ask if you can just update a few things, like adding a cute rug, string/beaded curtains, a new bedspread, etc. Hang up posters of your favorite things, and try to cover a whole wall with magazine clippings of things you like! Start a collection of things you like too if you want, like old records, Japanese erasers, giant lollipops, etc.

, Don't go overboard and eat twenty pieces of candy a day; it's bad for your health. It's not worth being unhealthy just to be hyper. Try carrying around a bag of Skittles or something with you. If your parents don't allow candy, substitute it for gum. Don't let anyone have any of your candy/gum. Also, be mindful of the weather- don't stand around in 85 degree heat with a pocket of Snickers!

, Their happiness may rub off on you. If you can't find a group of people, at least find a friend who acts similar to you so that you aren't alone.

, Standing out from the crowd signifies uniqueness, individuality, and non-conformity. Being a leader (and not a follower) is a great thing. This isn't just a phase, it can be a way of life if you put your heart into it.

Wash your face regularly.,
Don't forget to exfoliate.,
Consider using herbal remedies.,
Avoid touching your face.,
Don't use excessive makeup and lotions.,
Keep well hydrated and eat healthy.,
Try products containing benzoyl peroxide.,
Experiment with alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).,
Ask your doctor about retinoids.,
Consider prescription antibiotics.",How to Get Rid of Teen Acne," Acne in teens is caused by several factors, but removing excess oils and grime from your face at least twice daily can help prevent pores from getting clogged and inflamed.Use an oil-free cleanser and thoroughly wash your entire face (particularly your forehead) in the morning, just prior to going to bed, and after exercising.


Gentle face washing on a regular basis is certainly helpful, but too much scrubbing can irritate pimples (whiteheads and blackheads) and lead to more inflammation and redness.
Use mild cleansers such as Cetaphil, Aveeno acne bar or Neutrogena Acne Wash.
The early teen years is when the skin's oil glands produce more sebum (oil) due to hormonal changes, which blocks pores and irritates hair follicles.Sometimes bacteria grow within the blocked pores, causing more inflammation, redness and pustules.;
, Exfoliating is also important for healthy skin because it removes the surface layer of dead cells and helps to clean out clogged pores and remove superficial blackheads.Use exfoliating pads made especially for the face and make sure both the pad and your face are wet / moist. Apply a little bit of mild cleanser (see above) to the pad and lightly exfoliate in circular motions all over your face. Then rinse with water and thoroughly dry your face (by patting it) with a clean cloth or paper towel.


You shouldn't exfoliate every time you wash your face — it'll likely irritate your skin. Instead, aim to exfoliate two to three times per week.
Make sure to keep your exfoliating pads sanitized. Spray some hydrogen peroxide on them after use or toss them in the microwave for a minute or so — both methods will kill bacteria and most types of molds (fungi).

, There are many plant-based remedies that teens and adults use to combat acne outbreaks, although scientific studies proving their effectiveness are usually limited. Some work as antiseptics (kill bacteria), others as anti-inflammatories or antioxidants, and still others as exfoliating (peeling) agents. Commonly used plant-based remedies for acne include: tea tree oil extract, lemon juice extract, azelaic acid cream, licorice root extract, raw (unripe) papaya fruit, green tea extract and aloe vera gel.Applying herbal lotions and ointments to pimples at night after you exfoliate the area may be more effective because the medicinal plant compounds may be able to penetrate deeper underneath the surface layer of the skin. Allow herbal treatments a few weeks to be effective.


For acute (inflamed) acne, aloe vera is a good choice because of its mildly anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, as well as its powerful ability to heal skin.Tea tree oil is a strong antibacterial that's a good choice for applying to a popped whitehead or pustule. Be careful, as tea tree oil can irritate some people's skin.
Lemon juice extract (mainly citric and ascorbic acids) not only kills bacteria and removes oil from pores, but it can help to fade (bleach) older blemishes and acne scars. Although, most people don't recommend this method as it can lead to higher irritation, sun sensitivity, and bleached skin.

, Many teens habitually touch their face and unconsciously pick at their pimples, but that only makes acne worse.Bacteria can easily transfer from your hands and fingernails to your face and start growing in clogged pores. Therefore, you should avoid habitually resting your head in your hands or sleeping with your face touching your arms or hands.


Popping your pimples might seem like a quick and easy fix, but it can cause inflammation, infection and scarring. Letting acne run its course often leaves smooth, healed skin in the long run.
Many dermatologists recommend not popping or squeezing your own pimples. Instead, they suggest leaving it to a skin specialist., During an acne breakout, use as little makeup as possible because it can easily clog pores and promote the formation of pimples. Lipstick and eyeshadow is likely fine, but avoid applying heavy foundation, face powder and blush to areas affected by acne — especially cosmetic products that are oil-based.The same holds true for moisturizers. Although keeping your face moisturized is helpful for preventing and combating acne and the dryness that some acne medications can cause, any lotions and creams your use should be water-based, not oil-based.


When choosing makeup for acne-prone skin, look for ""oil-free"", ""noncomedogenic"", ""water-based"", ""mineral-based"" or ""nonacnegenic.""
Oil-free lotions (such as Complex 15, Cetaphil, Aveeno, and Eucerin) and sunscreens (Neutrogena or Coppertone Oil-free Sunscreen) are good choices if you have acne.
When using moisturizer, buy brands that are labelled ""non-comedogenic pH balanced"", which means it's not too acidic and won't block your pores.

, For skin to maintain its health, it needs lots of water and essential nutrients, such as vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids. Water is lost in large quantities daily, so you need to replace it regularly. Unfortunately, your skin is usually the last organ to get replenished with water.As such, aim for 8 eight-ounce glasses of purified water on a daily basis. Skin also needs nutrients, so avoid junk food with refined sugars and focus more on whole grains, beans, nuts and fresh fruits and vegetables.


Foods that cause your blood sugar to spike, such as simple sugars found in sweets like cookies, candy, and white grains, cause insulin overproduction, which may in turn increase oil production in the oil glands of your skin.
Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits, papaya and strawberries — vitamin C is needed to make collagen within skin.
Some teens are allergic to dairy products (not just lactose intolerant), so their acne outbreaks may be triggered by drinking milk products and eating cheese, chocolate or ice cream. This is uncommon; however, some experts think that excess dairy products can lead to acne breakouts in some people.

, Benzoyl peroxide can be found in many over-the-counter acne medications because it can kill bacteria, unplug oil ducts and help to heal acne / pimples.Start cautiously with a 2.5% or 5% gel or lotion once a day, after you wash your face at night. After about a week, apply it twice daily for at least a couple of weeks and see if your acne fades away. If it doesn't, start the process over with a 10% solution. Any product stronger than 10% needs a doctor's prescription.


You should see improvement after about four to six weeks, so be patient and keep using the product as directed. Continue using it regularly, either a daily or a few times per week, even after the acne’s been contained to prevent it from coming back.
Products containing benzoyl peroxide tend to dry the skin out, so be prepared to use a water-based moisturizer.
Benzoyl peroxide is available in lotions, gels, creams, ointments, cleaners and foams in virtually all pharmacies.

, AHAs such as glycolic acid and lactic acid have been used for many years by dermatologists to treat acne, typically as facial peels using 20–30% solutions.The acids cause the surface layer of skin to shed, which has an exfoliating effect on acne. Many over-the-counter products such as facial washes and moisturizers contain a 4-6% concentration of AHAs. These products can be used daily as facial cleansers in order to deter acne, but the stronger solutions have more success with combating acne breakouts.


AHAs can sting a little upon application and initially cause the acne and surrounding skin to look red and irritated before the medicinal benefits kick in.
Many well-known skin care companies (Oil-Of-Olay, Ponds, Clinique, Neutrogena) make products containing AHAs.
You may also want to try beta hydroxy acids such as salicylic acid.

, Retinoids are a group of medications derived from vitamin A (such as retinol, Retin-A, Stieva-A, Avita,Tazorac) that control growth and differentiation of skin cells, reduce inflammation, deter bacterial growth and strengthen your immune response.Retinoids can be very effective when used for acne, although they often cause a lot of peeling when you first start using them and make the skin very sensitive to sunlight. Retinoid products are available in many over-the-counter products, but stronger topicals and pills still require a doctor's prescription.


Retinoids should only be applied to acne at night, because it makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn.
Retinoids are a great choice for long-term use for treatment and prevention of breakouts as well as reducing scars from breakouts.
It may take two to three months to see improvement in your acne when using retinoids, and your skin may look worse for the first few weeks, but be patient and stick with it.
Studies suggests that Tazorac (0.1% cream) may be the most effective for treating acne pustules (whiteheads).A very strong oral prescription retinoid called Accutane (isotretinoin) is reserved for teens who have severe cystic acne (large painful pustules) with lots of scarring. It works as a strong anti-inflammatory and decreases the size of the sebaceous (oil) glands., Bacteria growth within clogged skin pores is a common cause of whiteheads or pustules. Thus, using topical antibiotic creams or ointments can be helpful in treating acute (inflamed) acne, which is similar to a skin infection.Topical antibiotics are often combined with retinoids or benzoyl peroxide for the first few months of treatment — sort of a one-two punch for acne. When combined, the topical antibiotic is applied in the morning and the topical retinoid in the evening before bedtime.


Combo products include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, Acanya) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin) or clindamycin and tretinoin (Ziana).
Antibiotic pills (taken orally) are more effective at treating moderate-to-severe acne caused by overactive oil glands, but they cause more more side effects (upset stomach, nausea, dizziness and sun-sensitivity) than topical treatments.The most common types are tetracyclines, such as minocycline and doxycycline.
Oral antibiotics are usually used for just a few months to help control larger acne bumps while the topical treatments have time to take effect.

Exercise regularly.,
Don’t touch your face.,
Shower often.,
Eat healthily.,
Get at least eight hours of sleep.,
Drink lots of water.,
Relax your body and mind.,
Wash your fabrics.,
Use oil-free makeup.,
Wear sunscreen everyday and do not tan.,
Avoid toothpaste, lemons, and baking soda.,
Avoid apricot scrubs and plastic microbeads as the former will cause microtears and the latter contributes to environmental pollution and bioaccumulation up the food chain.",How to Get Rid of Acne1," Exercising does a number of things to help reduce your acne. It releases endorphins which lower stress levels and therefore reduce oil-production and also makes you sweat which cleans out dead skin cells. Try exercising on a daily basis for a minimum of thirty minutes to help reduce your acne not only on your face, but also on your chest, shoulders, and back.;
, This is incredibly difficult, as people are prone to touching their faces on a regular basis. Be careful about scratching your face, resting your face on your hands, and picking at pimples. Never pop your zits or squeeze at pesky blackheads, as this only introduces more bacteria to your skin and will make your acne worse.

, Although you may want to keep your water bill down, showering regularly helps to keep oil production low, kill bacteria, and rinse away dead skin cells. Wash your entire body with a mild cleanser and use shampoos that limit oil production in your hair. Be sure to always shower after exercising to remove the dead skin cells your body has sloughed off through sweating.

, Foods that are highly processed and contain a lot of oils greatly increase the amount of acne on your body. Getting the proper amount of nutrients from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and protein help your skin to regenerate faster and limit unnecessary oil production. When at all possible, avoid foods that are processed or contain a lot of sugar (think junk foods).

, Sleeping kills two birds with one stone, as it helps to relax your body as well as detoxify it. If you aren’t getting enough sleep, chances are your skin hasn’t had the time or ability to renew its skin cells. Regulate your sleep cycle by going to bed at a consistent time every night and sleeping for a minimum of eight hours., Although we’ve all heard to drink eight glasses of water a day, there isn’t a set amount on how much water you should consume. Water helps to detoxify your body and purify your skin, so make sure you drink water often throughout the day.

, High stress levels lead to increased sebum production, so do your mind and your skin a favor by giving yourself some time to relax. Try taking a bath, reading a book, meditating, or practicing yoga and watch your skin transform in response.

, Any fabric that comes into contact with your skin on a regular basis - clothes, towels, pillowcases, and sheets - should be washed at least once a week to remove oil and bacteria that build up over time. Use a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin to help solve your acne problem.

, If you wear makeup, you may be stuck in a vicious cycle of covering up acne while simultaneously causing it with your cover-up usage. Find acne-fighting oil-free mineral makeup to help prevent worsening your acne while simply trying to hide it. Power foundations are also recommended. When possible, avoid wearing makeup at all though as it clogs your pores over the course of the day.


Regularly clean makeup brushes to prevent bacterial growth.

, Ultraviolet Radiation is the number one cause of premature aging. It also leads to Skin Cancer in high enough doses. Treat the sun like the death ray that it is. Exposing your skin to harmful UVA and UVB rays damages skin and prolongs post inflammatory erythema(PIE)--red acne marks, as the sunlight stimulates pigment-producing cells.


Not only can the sun prolong PIE appearance, it can lead to premature aging including sun spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. UV damage is DNA damage. Sunscreen is an anti-aging must for all ages young and old--preventing future skin cancer. It is the fountain of youth in a bottle. Prevention is better than treatment. There is no such thing as safe tanning, as tanning is the result of sun damage.
Therefore, it is very important that you wear sunscreen everyday, with an SPF of 30.Of note, after SPF 30, there are decreasing marginal returns in UVB protection. The % of UVB protection as a function of SPF Value is a log graph and plateaus after SPF 30. Therefore, there is not much difference in protection between SPF 40 and 50. Sunscreens with an SPF 100 are banned in some countries.
For UVA protection, a sunscreen with a high UVA protection of PA+++ or higher of PA++++ as recommended, especially to treat PIE. PPD is the UVA equivalent of SPF; use a sunscreen with a minimum of PPD20. The PA+ system has a + that corresponds to a tier of PPD protection. Of note, different countries use different PA systems. Japan and Taiwan changed their PA system to a 4+ tier system while Korea uses a 3+ tier system.
When out in the sun for long periods of time, stick to the shade as much as possible and wear a wide-brimmed hat and light, long-sleeved clothing. Wear sunglasses, especially those that have less melanin in their eyes. Consider carrying a parasol. In Asia, they are a popular fashionable accessory.

, If used without care, some experiences suggest they may cause irritation or chemical burns on your face.Toothpaste, lemons, baking soda, and salt are touted as common convention to treat acne or improve the appearance of discoloration but they will damage skin instead. Avoid using any of these ingredients.

,


Apricot Scrubs are a cult product but the walnut shells are too sharp to exfoliate skin, and will cause microtears--contributing to photoaging.
Plastic microbeads are in the process of being considered banned in several states as they pollute waterways and are swallowed by fish.

Practice introspection.,
Experiment as much as you can.,
Get out of your comfort zone.,
Don’t worry about looking weird.",How to Be Different from Other Girls1," To stand out, you have to know yourself and know yourself well. Engage in a little bit of introspection from time to time, whether that means keeping a journal each night or having a meditation practice every morning.Having a rich inner life will set you apart from other girls because you won’t rely on outward validation. This is a powerful ability to have.
To practice introspection, start by asking yourself how you feel each morning and night. From there, you can analyze the things you like and why you like them.;
, Practice exposing yourself to new things. Try new foods, new hairstyles, and new classes. Trying new things will give you confidence, will garner a large set of skills, and will set you apart from others.Experiment safely. Do not engage in illegal or dangerous activities for the sake of learning new things.
If you are nervous, start out with something small, like using online tutorials to learn to knit.
Experimenting can mean cooking meals you’ve never had before, reading a book you normally wouldn’t read, or even joining a community theatre production.

, If you are extremely shy, try going to a party where you don’t know anyone and practice talking to strangers. If you are naturally outgoing, try your hand at observing and people-watching. Get out of your comfort zone to demonstrate that you can go with the flow--a trait that is certain to show you stand out from the crowd of other girls.Again, if you’re nervous, start out small. Speak to someone you’ve never spoken to before, or try a type of foreign cuisine you’re unfamiliar with.

, A lot of girls are terrified of looking stupid or weird, so they hold back or avoid trying new things. Don’t! If you look weird trying something new, or sound weird when talking to someone new, so what? The worst that can happen is you won’t have a new hobby or friend. And even if you don’t, you’ll stand out from the crowd.If you’re worried about what other people think, remember that they probably don’t notice as much as you think they do.

Pay attention to your instincts, feelings, and personal tastes while exploring your dark side. You might find that you like some really unexpected bands or movies, for example.
If you find that you don’t like the same things that other people are into, that’s okay. Maybe your goth friends make fun of you for liking an emo band, or vice versa. That’s their problem, not yours. Keep liking what you like!;
, Famous psychiatrist Carl Jung described the dark side of a person as their “shadow,” which contained all of the things that society teaches us to repress: greed, anger, hatred, fear etc. — in short, our more primitive side.Jung recommended working to assimilate the shadow into your conscious personality.Instead of repressing your darker instincts then, you should acknowledge them and work through them.
By getting to know your dark side, you can know yourself better, and become a better version of yourself. This doesn’t mean you should act on your darker instincts. It means that you should acknowledge your feelings and work through them instead of pretending that they don’t exist.
A great example of the shadow that Carl Jung referred to appears in the novella, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson. If you haven’t already read it, it’s great, dark reading material!

, Learn to find comfort at night and in the dark. If you’re afraid of the dark, work on overcoming that fear. Find ways to enjoy the calm, cool, silence of night, and the stunning beauty of the moon.


Dark people are often night owls, staying up into the wee hours of the morning. You may find that this is when you’re most creative. If this isn’t the case, though, don’t push yourself. Keep hours that make you feel healthy and fit.
If it’s safe for you to do so, go for night walks. If you have friends who are also into dark things, go for a walk with your friends, as there is safety in numbers.
As an example, walking in a cemetery at night can be lovely. If you do this, however, make sure that you respect the grounds and don’t destroy anything. If you see anyone being rowdy or aggressive, do not approach them. If they seem dangerous, consider reporting them to the police.

, You can do this with books that are written by practitioners as well as books that are written by academics with a more objective viewpoint.


An example of a good book that approaches Vampires from a more academic viewpoint is Paul Barber’s Vampires, Burial, and Death.
Richard Cavendish’s The Black Arts approaches the topic from a religious standpoint, but is detailed and highly reviewed.
A lot of academic books will refer to primary source texts. These are the books that people are writing about. An example of a primary source would be the Bible. A great primary source for researching the treatment of witches is the Malleus Maleficarum, which is a famous medieval witch-hunting manual.Beyond books, there are also countless documentaries about the occult. A fun (though inaccurate) one from the 1920s is called Häxan, by a Danish director named Benjamin Christensen. Note that there is some nudity in this film., Read horror novels, campfire stories, and whatever else you can get your hands on that scare the bejesus out of you. Check lists of top horror books to find ones that suit your tastes.There are tonnes of Reddit threads that are full of scary stories, some of which are real. Threads like NoSleep, LetsNotMeet, and Paranormal are a lot of fun. You can even participate in the threads by adding your own stories, or commenting on the stories of others.

, When it comes to music, “dark” could mean anything. It really depends on your own tastes. Ask around and explore forum threads for dark music suggestions. Basically, it’s about what evokes the desired feeling for you.Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails are some of the darker mainstream bands that have been around for a long time.
Alkaline Trio and Brand New both have dark lyrics which focus on themes to do with depression and despair.
Nirvana and Radiohead might not automatically seem like dark bands, but they both express sadness, rage, and despair through their lyrics and melody choices.
Classical music can be wonderfully dark. A famous example is Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata.
Old jazz music can sound pretty creepy, particularly when it’s slow and on vinyl. Rezsö Seress’s 1933 song “Gloomy Sunday” is also known as “The Hungarian Suicide Song”, because it reportedly drove some of its listeners to suicide., If you have a dark side, chances are you love scary movies. There are a lot of genres to choose from. Maybe you like paranormal stories, or maybe you like violent, gory slashers.


Famous slashers include Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1969), John Carpenter’s Halloween (1978), Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom (1960), and Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).
Famous paranormal movies include Masaki Kobayashi’s Kwaidan (1964), Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez’s The Blair Witch Project (1999), Oren Peli’s Paranormal Activity (2007), and the Insidious series.
For dark coming-of-age films that are disturbing but not really horror, try Michael Lehmann’s Heathers (1988), Richard Kelly’s Donnie Darko (2001), or Rian Johnson’s Brick (2005).
The options are endless. These are only a few examples of a few genres. If you aren’t sure where to start, check out some horror movie sites and forums to see what might suit your tastes.

, Go beyond the usual suspects and explore books, films, music, and other art forms that nurture and inspire your interest in dark things.


Go to poetry readings and art galleries. Volunteer at horror film festivals or host horror movie nights at your home. Explore the darker side of life as depicted through art, and let it inspire you to create your own things.
Practise creating your own art, whether it be music, writing, film, photography, paintings, or anything else you can do to express your own experience of darkness.

, Acting mysterious can make you seem darker and more interesting. The charm of mystery will wear off with time, so once you trust someone and feel close to them, it’s okay to warm up and open up more.One way to seem mysterious is to say less than is necessary. For instance, if someone asks you what you’re doing on Friday night, you might say, “Going out”. This may encourage them to get curious and ask more questions.Be warned, though, some people will tire of having to always drag information out of you.

, If you’re trying to give the impression that you’re a dark, mysterious person, it’s best that you choose your words carefully so that they suit the way that you want people to see you.


Thinking before you speak will make you seem more well-spoken and intelligent. Just make sure that you don’t overthink everything you say, otherwise you might not ever say anything at all!

, When you’re always around, people are more likely to take you for granted. If you’re not always around, they may be more likely to miss you (unless you’re not fun to be around).It may feel like you’re playing a game, but it’s actually healthy to take time to be alone and develop yourself and your interests. Having people miss you is just a nice side effect of this.
If someone asks you why you aren’t coming out, it’s okay to tell the truth. Don’t make up some lame lie about being busy with something else. Just let them know that you want to have the night to yourself.
Don’t say you’ll be there and not show up though. That’s just plain flakey, and it won’t make people miss you at all.

, Note that this is not the same as being unreliable. Being unreliable is just selfish and inconsiderate.


As an example, maybe you always wear black and listen to a lot of sad music, but you love Lady Gaga. No one would expect that from you, so it becomes a funny personality quirk of yours.
Don’t do anything dangerous while being unpredictable. Don’t act crazy just to get attention or surprise people, as this will likely push people away instead of making them more interested in you. It could also end up hurting you or other people.

, Showcase your twisted mind with sick jokes. Try to avoid making fun of people or putting yourself down with your jokes, as this will likely hurt people’s feelings — and that includes your own.


A popular example of a sick joke is the one that they play in the movie Fight Club, in which a flight safety manual depicting people calmly following safety procedures is switched with a manual depicting utter chaos.Having a good sense of humor can make life easier in general. Used incorrectly though, your sense of humor can strain relationships., Treat others with respect. Being dark doesn’t mean being rude or mean. In fact, being dark AND being polite and well-spoken will just make you seem even cooler.


Don’t assume that people are lame just because they don’t dress like you or share your interests. You don’t know what their life experiences have been. You don’t have to be best friends, but you can still be nice to each other.

, If you’re feeling really dark, it may be tempting to do things that could jeopardize your future. Try not to lose sight of your goals (or make goals, if you don’t have them).


Work on things that you love and work towards a career that you love, whether it be playing in a band, publishing a book, joining a travelling circus, or just working a regular 9 to 5 job and saving up for cool vacations.

, People with dark personalities sometimes end up spending lots of time inside and away from people. This may be what makes you feel comfortable, but it’s likely not actually making you happy.


Get outside, exercise, hang out with people. Do things that get you out of your own head and your own little world. It will give you a broader perspective on life, and will help you appreciate your alone time that much more.

, If you struggle with depression, go see a counsellor or a doctor and get some help. Life may seem long and hard right now, but one day you’ll realize that it’s brutally short — far too short to spend feeling sad and unsatisfied with life.


It’s still possible to enjoy dark things and feel satisfied in your life. You are not betraying who you are by trying to become a happier person. As much as it may feel like it, depression is not your friend.
If you think you are at risk of committing suicide, call a suicide hotline. Give yourself the chance to feel better before giving in to your depression. There are various websites and hotlines available to you., Research has shown that people with dark personality traits such as narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism are generally found to be more physically attractive than others, but NOT because of their personalities.


They were actually found to be more attractive because of how their personality traits influenced the way they presented themselves. In general, people with dark personality traits tend to be flashier dressers and have more confident and attractive body language.Research also shows that over time, negative personalities ultimately eclipse physical attractiveness. In short, your bad personality will ultimately eclipse your looks.

, It can be fun to express your dark interests through your appearance. If you’re unsure of what sort of dark style to choose, consider your idols. Horror movies and music are great sources for style inspiration.


As an example, you might wear your hair long and black like Morticia Addams, or big chunky boots like Marilyn Manson.

, You can model your dark style after your idols, but it’s important that you change it up enough that you still look like your own person — not just a clone of your idol. You could even mix up the styles of a few dark icons to arrive at your own unique style.


A fun example of horror movie characters who manage to look dark while still looking unique is Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald, of the movie Ginger Snaps, whose gothy, witchy old lady look is much different from traditional witchy characters in films.

Use a Turmeric Paste: Turmeric has healing effects.,
Make a cucumber mask.,
Steam.,
Use Diluted Tea Tree Oil or Neem Oil (neem oil is also known as margosa leaf oil).,
Try a bit of garlic.,
Use a honey spot treatment.,
Try using papaya.,
Try putting salt on them.",How to Get Rid of a Pimple1," Mix Turmeric in the correct ratio with a little water or yogurt and apply at night for at least 30-40 minutes before washing with water as a mask. However, be careful of using acidic products. Check the pH by using pH testing strips. It should not be below 3. Use of it over a period of time can give desired results. In a single night, the impact won't be instant.;
, This solution works best for soothing your skin and reducing redness but is not as effective as aforementioned solutions for killing bacteria. Mince a bit of cucumber to form a paste, and put this directly on your pimple or over your whole face. Wait for it to set for 15-20 minutes, and then rinse your skin off with cold water. Voila! Your redness should be significantly reduced, and you’ll feel cool as a cucumber.

, Steaming will help you open your skin pores as well as let your skin breathe. Using this method, you can deeply get rid of bacteria, dirt, and oils trapped inside the pores, which may cause infection or inflammation. To do this, you fill a big container with the hot water. Next, you let the steam come in contact with your face for a few minutes. Then, you rinse off your face using the lukewarm water. After drying, you should apply your oil-free moisturizer., Tea tree oil is used in many beauty products for its skin-soothing qualities and ability to naturally kill bacteria. Purchase a bottle of pure tea tree oil, dilute it with water, and use it to treat your pimple. Do this only once a day, and repeat until your zit has completely disappeared. Be careful though, as utilizing undiluted tea tree oil can actually have the opposite effect and cause a chemical burn.For a quick home remedy, use tea tree oil and witch hazel. Twice a day, take a few drops of tea tree oil and spread it over your pimple. If you have sensitive skin, dilute the oil with water. Then, before going to bed, clean your entire face with witch hazel (an astringent), focusing on the pimple. Each day the pimple should grow flatter and less red, and disappear in three to four days.

, As odd as it may seem, garlic is great for reducing pimples for two reasons: it is a natural antiseptic, and it also contains high levels of sulfur (good for drying oil). Either mince a clove of garlic to form a paste, or cut a clove of garlic in half and hold it to your pimple. Leave the garlic on for 5-10 minutes, and then rinse off with cool water.

, Honey is a great all-natural skin purifier, as it works to kill bacteria and block out dirt and grime. Pour a bit of honey onto your pimple, and leave it on for as long as you’re able. If you prefer to add the goodness of honey to your whole face, you can do so in the form of a honey mask. When you’re ready to take it off, simply dissolve the honey with a bit of warm water.

, Yes, the tropical fruit you often enjoy in smoothies is also great at cleaning your skin and getting rid of pimples. Juice a papaya or crush a small amount of the fruit to form a paste, and then dab it onto your pimple(s). Let it set for as long as you are able before washing it off and splashing your face with cold water. You can repeat this process several times daily if you desire.

, Salt great at treating lots of things. It will sting a bit, but soon the pimple will be gone. Wash your face first and then put a small amount of salt on your pimple. Leave it there for however long you want. The longer, the better. Do it every day until your pimple is gone. You can also use sea salt and mix it with warm water if you prefer that. Dab the water on your face and let the water dry. Repeat this every day until the pimple is gone."

Wash your face twice daily with a pH balanced cleanser.,
Wash your face using oils.,
Exfoliate your face.,
Apply essential oils to active pimples.,
Use products with benzoyl peroxide.,
Use sulfur-containing clay masks.,
Use a toner after cleansing.,
Always apply a moisturizer.,
Use a retinoid.,
Find products containing azelaic acid.,
Use a sheet or face mask.",How to Get Rid of Acne2," The first step to getting clear skin is to set up a regimented cleansing routine to restore the skin's acid mantle and thus discourage acne vulgaris growth. Buckle down and force yourself to wash your face with a pH balanced cleanser of 5.5 when you wake up in the morning and before going to bed at night. As tired or busy as you may be, taking the extra few minutes to cleanse your skin will reduce your acne significantly.


If you have acne on other parts of your body such as your shoulders, back, and chest, give these areas a scrubbing twice daily as well.
If you wear makeup, never go to bed without washing it all off. Sleeping with makeup on is a surefire way to increase your pimple-count and make getting rid of your acne even more difficult. Use an oil-free makeup remover prior to washing with your regular cleanser to make sure all traces have been removed.

, Known as the Oil Cleansing Method(OCM), this is a popular method of cleansing in Asia, and is a growing trend. OCM is an alternative cleansing method that is gentler for skin, and of interest for sensitive skin types.


Look into oils such as olive oil, egg oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, and emu oil.


, Exfoliates are mild scrubbing products that work to slough (to get rid of) off dead skin cells that build up and cause acne. Exfoliation can be chemical or physical.


For a gentler approach, use a chemical exfoliator, an AHA or BHA at a pH between 3 and 4 to slough off skin. A chemical exfoliation un-glues dead skin.A BHA product often cited includes salicylic acid, it must be between a pH between 3 and 4 to work. A BHA works to slough (to get rid of) off dead skin cells and encourage new skin growth. As a result, you may experience dry skin and scaliness around your acne, but this will dissipate over time as your skin begins to regenerate faster. Use this in a cleanser or spot treatment daily on the acne-affected areas of your skin.Aspirin tablets, which contain salicylic acid, a BHA can be ground up and mixed with water and then put on your zits to reduce redness and swelling.
Rub a light layer of honey into your skin, and let it sit for 30 minutes. Rinse off with warm water. Honey has a variable pH from 3 to 6, but at a pH between 3 and 4, it contains AHA's that will exfoliate skin.
For physical exfoliation, consider purchasing a konjac sponge. It is gentle enough for usage upon your face.
For physical exfoliation, consider using oatmeal as an exfoliate. Mix oatmeal with honey and rub it onto your face for 2-3 minutes, and gently rinse away the residue with warm water.


, Neem oil and tea tree oil are thought to have antimicrobial properties that can kill acne-causing bacteria. Dab a drop of diluted version of tea tree oil or neem oil on each spot, or wet a cotton swab and wipe it over problem areas. Tea tree oil is an antibacterial agent that can help clear out the microbes clogging your skin. Avoid using undiluted tea tree oil — it'll burn your skin, and worsen acne. Read the warning label on the bottle.

, You can use benzoyl peroxide in the form of either a soap or lotion over your acne-prone areas. This product works to clean off dead skin and help your skin to regenerate new, clean cells faster. Look for products that contain 3% or less of benzoyl peroxide to avoid irritating your skin.

, Although we don’t know exactly why sulfur works as a great acne-killer, we do know that it does work. Look for products that contain sulfur to clear up your acne, seemingly by reducing oil production.


, After you wash your face, exfoliate, or apply a face mask, apply a toner to the entirety of your face. Toners work to tighten pores making it less likely that dirt and oil will become trapped in them. Buy acne toners at a local drugstore, or use witch hazel or apple cider vinegar dabbed on with a cotton ball. Don’t rinse toners after application - allow them to stay on your skin.


, Oily skin produces acne, and if your skin is very dry your body will compensate by creating sebum. To prevent this from happening, use a gentle moisturizer after you wash your face every morning and evening. Apply moisturizer post toner application., As a Retinoid is a prescription medication in the U.S., be cautious of the side affects before usage. Retinoid cleansers contain high levels of vitamin A, which help to clean out clogged pores and dissolve away grime. You can get a prescription for one from your doctor. Trademarked OTC retinoid-like products are ineffective.

, Azelaic acid is an antibacterial that also helps to reduce redness and inflammation and is found naturally in wheat and barley. If your acne tends to leave dark marks on your skin, try a product that uses azelaic acid to clean your pores and reduce acne-produced dark spots., Sheet or Face masks contain compounds that soothe your skin and kill bacteria. Use a sheet or face mask 2-3 times a week for 15-20 minutes to dry out your skin and clean out your pores. Buy face masks from your local beauty supply or drugstore, or make your own at home.


Create a blend of cucumbers and oatmeal. The cucumbers help to reduce redness and fight off dark spots while the oatmeal soften and soothes irritated skin. Blend the two together in a food processor until it forms a paste, and then apply it to your skin for 15-20 minutes before washing off with warm water.

Get a facial.,
Get a facial peel.,
Try microdermabrasion.,
Get a laser treatment.,
Try a light treatment.,
Use prescription drugs.",How to Get Rid of Acne3," These are available at most spas, and involve the use of several different cleansers, masks, and extraction tools to reduce acne on your face. If you don’t feel comfortable with having an esthetician work on your face, visit your dermatologist for a more medically-oriented facial.

, A facial peel is a specialized gel containing acid that dissolves dead skin and bacteria cells. Getting these on a regular basis can greatly reduce acne over time in addition to your regular skincare regimen.

, This is a process by which your skin is “sanded” away to produce new skin growth. Getting microdermabrasion treatments once a week over several months is the most effective route to take, as each treatment only affects the outermost layer of skin.

, That’s right - use lasers to kill off your acne. Many dermatologists now offer a treatment in which they use lasers to fire strong blasts of light to kill overactive oil-producing glands beneath your skin. This process can be painful, but has been shown to cut down acne 50% on average.

, Unlike painful laser treatments, light treatments use milder pulses of light fired off by a specialized wand to help kill bacteria. Certain colors of light (including red, green, and blue) have shown to have a positive effect on killing acne. Ask your dermatologist if getting a light treatment is a good choice for you., Certain medications can be prescribed by your dermatologist to help with particularly bad cases of acne, but should be used with caution. As with all medications, there may be unwanted side-effects in a small portion of the population.


Going on a specialized form of birth control (for women) can help to regulate hormones which may be producing your bad acne. Ask your dermatologist if this seems like a good option for you to take.
In particularly troublesome cases of acne, a specialized drug known as accutane can be prescribed. This is an incredibly intense retinoid treatment that has shown to almost completely remove all acne in users. However, it has the most serious side-effects of any acne-fighting drug and should be used with extreme caution.

Own your opinion.,
Assert your needs.,
Accept compliments.,
Use proper posture.,
Make eye contact.,
Respect yourself.",How to Be Different from Other Girls2," If you have an opinion about something, don’t sink back and keep it to yourself. Speak up! State your opinion, and contribute to the conversation. A woman who can hold her own stands out above the rest.When giving your opinion, it helps to be well-informed. If you aren’t familiar with the topic being discussed, try to listen instead of speaking. When a topic you know comes up, offer your opinions.

, A lot of girls feel like they are not allowed to assert their needs--not in a relationship, not in their family, not in the workplace, and not in the classroom. Do you want to be different from most girls? Assert yourself!Some people might not like you asserting yourself, but not being afraid to demand respect and consideration is nothing to be ashamed of.
Assertion doesn’t have to be mean. To assert yourself, you can ask your teacher a question if you don’t understand an assignment, tell your friends you are too tired to go out, or let your significant other know that they hurt your feelings.

, Most girls will deny a compliment, shake their head, or at least make a face to suggest displeasure. Don’t do that. Instead, smile, and say a simple, “Thank you.”Not all compliments are created equal. Objectifying you and complimenting you are two very different things. If a compliment makes you uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to shut it down.

, Rounded shoulders and downcast eyes suggest you are uncomfortable in your skin. Instead, stand up straight, look straight ahead, and keep your chin parallel to the ground.Work on your posture at all times. If you slouch when you’re alone, you will slouch when you are out, too.

, Whether you are listening or speaking, be sure you make eye contact. If you cannot hold eye contact indefinitely (and this can make people feel as though you are staring them down, anyway), try to hold it for 20 seconds at a time with a 10-second break in between during conversations with others.Eye contact demonstrates confidence quietly, rather than loud or brash statements.
If you feel too awkward practicing eye contact with others, you can practice meeting your own eyes in a mirror or practice with your family members.

, Ultimately, the only way to get respect from others is to have respect for yourself. Respect your time, your energy, and your limitations. You can show yourself respect by treating yourself with care and consideration, such as making time for rest, feeding your body healthy foods, and listening to your intuition.If you do not have time for a commitment, say so.
Be honest about what you need from a relationship or position. Respecting yourself means being up front about your needs.

Acknowledge your likes and dislikes.,
Speak your mind.,
Wear the clothes you feel good in.,
Work on loving yourself.",How to Be Different from Other Girls3," Although some tastes are in vogue and others are not, do not hide your own likes and dislikes. It might not be cool, but if you have a passionate affection for 90s boy bands, own it! If you don’t like the resurgence of bluegrass, don’t listen to it. It’s that simple.Acknowledge your likes and dislikes, but don’t put anyone else’s down.
To acknowledge your likes and dislikes, you might say, “Could we put on a country station? Country music is my favorite.” or “I love Greek food--let’s do Greek food for lunch.”

, A lot of girls feel too intimidated or nervous to join in a spirited debate, or to disagree with someone in a group conversation. To stand out and set yourself apart, speak your mind. Although you should always treat other people with respect, you do not have to keep your thoughts and ideas to yourself.Speak your mind in a civil, kind tone. Standing out from other girls can also be achieved by dominating male-oriented conversation.
When speaking your mind, be strong but not overbearing. If you are talking about politics, for instance, you can say something like, “I’ve been following the New York Times’ coverage of (political movement), and I agree with…”

, Magazines have countless articles dictating what women should and should not wear based on a variety of ever-changing variables. Scrap Cosmo and wear whatever makes you feel good. If you have an apple shape and love drop-waist dresses, forget what anyone else says, and rock that drop waist.If you feel best copying the looks in magazines, own it! Wear and do what makes you feel good.

, Just as respect comes from self-respect, gaining the love of others requires you to first love yourself. Practice loving yourself outright--your flaws, your quirks, your talents, your strengths, and your weaknesses. Most women struggle with self-loathing at worst, or a hefty list of insecurities at best, so loving yourself with truly set you apart.A simple way to practice loving yourself is to speak kind words to yourself in the mirror each morning. Something as simple as, “You look beautiful today” can boost your confidence.
Loving yourself can mean exercising in a way you find fulfilling, or wearing clothes that make you feel your best, even if they aren’t in keeping with the latest trend.

Apply salicylic acid.,
Use a retinol product.,
Use a konjac sponge.,
Keep your skin clean.,
Try a steroid injection.,
Use a bit of benzoyl peroxide.,
Try an aspirin mask.,
Ice your pimple.",How to Get Rid of a Pimple2," The most common dermatologist-recommended treatment for pimples/acne is salicylic acid treatment at the correct pH between 3 and 4. A BHA, this acid is used to safely kill bacteria and dry up the excess oil that causes a pimple. Look for a spot treatment that advertises a salicylic acid compound, and apply it as soon as you feel a pimple coming on. You can also use a facial soap that contains salicylic acid, to help reduce acne and the formation of more pimples in the future.

, Retinol is a type of Vitamin A complex that is used in drying out zits. Retinol can be a bit strong for sensitive skin, so look for an over-the-counter product before asking your dermatologist for a retinol prescription. Apply the product once daily (or per instructions via the box) until your pimples have disappeared.


When using a retinol product, be sure to apply plenty of moisturizer as it is likely that the skin around your pimple will become very dried out and possibly peel/flake off.

, These sponges gently physically exfoliate skin, helping with skin cell turnover.

, Throughout the day, pollution from the air, sweat, and dirt stick to the skin on your face and make your pimples worse. Wash your face twice daily, and keep cleansing pads/towelettes with you throughout the day. This way, whenever your face feels oily, grimy, or sweaty, you can wipe it off and leave your skin fresh and clean. These are especially handy for after a workout and in hot weather.

, If you’re suffering from deep cystic pimples, you may not be able to get rid of them on your own. Take a trip to your dermatologist and get a steroid injection instead; this will reduce the redness and swelling significantly, and your pimple should disappear much faster than normal. Talk to your dermatologist about other options as well, to keep your pimple gone even weeks after the injection., Another go-to for skin care, benzoyl peroxide is an active ingredient in most acne-fighting medications. Find a spot treatment whose primary ingredient is benzoyl peroxide, and apply it once or twice daily until your pimple has disappeared. It works by drying out the excess oil and killing the bacteria that is clogging your pores.

, One of the primary uses for aspirin is to bring down inflammation and swelling; something it does when applied to a pimple, as well. Another form of salicylic acid, aspirin is a BHA. Grind up one or two aspirin tablets, and add a drop of water to form a paste. Put this directly on your pimple and leave it on for as long as you’re able. Rinse it off with cool water, and your pimple should be nearly gone!

, Similar to aspirin, ice is often used to bring down swelling and redness on the body. Hold an ice cube or an ice pack over your pimple for 20-30 minutes. This will cause the pore to close up, which then causes the excess bacteria and dirt to drain out on its own. Furthermore, it will lose its redness and size, giving your skin a nearly normal texture and appearance. This method may also help if the pimple is causing you pain.

, If you want to outwardly appear happy, it would be easier if you felt it on the inside. When feeling angry or sad, smile, even if it's forced. Pretending to be happy is actually proven to improve your mood. Try techniques like writing down how you feel or working out issues with other people.

, Be nice to people. Pretend you're in a contest to see who can be the nicest, but don't overdue it to the point of seeming like you're kissing up. If someone doesn't seem to like or appreciate you, continue being nice to them, but try to avoid social contact as much as possible.

Use honey.,
Use rosehip oil.,
Use coconut oil.,
Use aloe vera.,
Use an ice cube.,
Use an aspirin mask.,
Use olive oil to cleanse.,
Use vitamin E oil.",How to Fade Acne Scars1," Honey can be used to treat not only acne scars but also acne itself. It is gentle on your skin and reduces redness and irritation. Honey contains antibacterial properties which help to fade acne scarring and dark marks. It is moisturizing and makes your skin soft. Dab a little honey directly onto the scars at night, and wash off in the morning.;
, Rosehip oil is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants which help to keep skin looking smooth and healthy. While the use of rosehip oil on fresh acne spots is still being evaluated, its use has been proven effective in repairing acne scars as well as other forms of scars and skin blemishes. Through regular use, marks and scars will fade and become less prominent over time. Simply massage the oil gently into the affected area once or twice a day., Due to the lauric, caprylic and capric acid found in coconut oil, it makes an excellent cream to help diminish acne scars. Coconut oil also helps to prevent new acne scars from forming. To fade acne scars, massage coconut oil into the affected area at least once a day, but 2-4 times daily is best. It may be too rich, so use carefully. Coconut Oil can also be used as a cleanser. , Aloe Vera is known in the cosmetic field for its healing properties, and it can be used to gently, yet effectively heal acne scars over time. Although you can buy many aloe-based gels commercially, the best thing to do is purchase an aloe plant.


To use the aloe from an aloe vera plant, break off a leaf and rub the gel-like contents directly onto the skin. Let it dry, then leave it on for 30 minutes. Wash off with a mild cleanser. Try to do this every day.

, This treatment works best for new, or inflamed scars as the ice will reduce swelling and shrink blood vessels. Over time, ice will also help to reduce the appearance of minor scars and discoloration.Wrap an ice cube in a piece of tissue or cloth and rub it over the inflamed areas for 10-15 minutes a day.

, Aspirin possesses effective anti-inflammatory properties and it contains a form of salicylic acid, which is used in many acne treatments. An aspirin mask can be used to soften your skin and reduce discoloration.


To make the mask, crush 4-5 aspirin tablets into a powder, then mix the powder into natural yogurt or pure aloe gel. Apply the mask to your face and let it sit for 15 minutes.
Wash off with lukewarm water, pat your face dry, and moisturize.

, Known as the oil cleansing method(OCM), olive oil is an alternative cleansing method for removing dirt and sebum from ones face. Massage gently and remove with a soft cloth.

, Vitamin E oil has incredible moisturizing properties and is an effective treatment for acne scars. Apply pure vitamin E oil to your skin 2-3 times daily, and you should see results in about 2 weeks.

Try over-the-counter creams.,
See a dermatologist.,
Get laser resurfacing treatment.,
Try a tissue filler.,
Get a chemical peel.,
Try dermabrasion.,
If all else fails, try surgery.",How to Fade Acne Scars2," There are tons of scar treatment products available over-the-counter which can help to even out redness and discoloration. They are usually branded as either scar-fading or lightening creams. Look for creams with active ingredients such as kojic acid, licorice extract, arbutin, mulberry extract, and vitamin C. These ingredients exfoliate the skin, removing the discolored top layers and leaving the skin smooth and tight. , If the over-the-counter products aren't packing enough of a punch, consider seeing a dermatologist who can prescribe a stronger, medicated cream. You can also discuss other options for fading acne scars, such as laser treatments or chemical peels.

, Laser resurfacing treatment works by removing top layers of skin from the acne scars, which are damaged and hyper-pigmented, leaving the skin underneath tighter and smoother. This treatment doesn't even need to be done in a hospital, a dermatologist can perform the laser resurfacing right in his or her office.The laser can feel a little painful, but the doctor usually numbs the skin with a local anesthetic first, so it's not too bad.The treatment can take up to an hour and may require several sessions, depending on the severity of the scarring.

, If your acne scars are more like indentations and scoops than raised bumps, a tissue filler can work wonders to plump up and smooth out the skin. Tissue fillers - such as hyaluronic acid - are injected underneath the skin by a dermatologist, producing immediate results. Unfortunately, the effects of this treatment are not permanent, so if you like it, you'll just have to keep coming back every few months for more!Silicone micro-droplets are a newer type of filler which actually stimulate your skin's production of collagen, allowing skin to regenerate on its own. You will need several rounds of injections for the treatment to take effect, but once these are complete the results are permanent., Chemical peels are concentrated acidic solutions that exfoliate the outer layer of your skin, exposing the softer and smoother skin underneath. They are effective for fading acne scars, as well as evening out skin tone, improving fine lines and treating sun damage. Chemical peels are available at your local dermatologist or plastic surgeon's office., Dermabrasion wears down scarring by removing the top layers of skin using a rotating wire brush. This treatment is quite harsh and your skin can take up to three weeks to heal, but once it does, you will have a new layer of lovely fresh, smooth skin., If no other treatments seem to be working, consult with your dermatologist about having your scars surgically removed. Be aware that surgery is the highest-risk option, as it often involves anesthesia, and can be very pricey - so you should only consider this option if your scars are very deep or extensive. Most of the time, surgery involves having each scar cut out individually, though sometimes a surgeon will need to break up the fibrous tissue which causes scarring, beneath the skin.It will take some time for your skin to heal after surgery, and you may also need to get a resurfacing treatment to smooth out the top layer of skin.

Wear sunscreen everyday.,
Exfoliate daily.,
Use gentle skincare.,
Don't squeeze or pick.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Fade Acne Scars3," Exposing scars to the sun can cause them to darken and slow the healing process. This is because ultraviolet rays stimulate the pigment-producing cells in your skin, leading to further discoloration. To avoid this, you should wear a sunscreen everyday, summer or winter.


Before heading outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher that contains the ingredient zinc oxide. Reapply after swimming, sweating, or after more than 2 hours in the sun., Exfoliating your skin on a regular basis can help your acne scars to fade naturally, by removing layers of old, blemished skin to reveal the fresh new skin underneath.


Try an over-the-counter exfoliant, containing the active ingredients AHA or BHA, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties and can help with discoloration., It's tempting to try abrasive scrubs and all sorts of irritating treatments in a desperate effort to get rid of acne discolorations, but irritation only causes more harm, which impedes your skin's ability to heal itself. Stick to gentle, non-irritating skincare which is kind to your skin.

, Scars are made up mainly of collagen, and are the body's way of healing itself. However, by picking or squeezing pimples, you cause pus and bacteria to filter deeper into the skin, damaging your skin's natural collagen. Picking also leads to skin damage and inflammation, which delays the healing process. Avoid picking or squeezing spots, and eventually the collagen-based scars will disappear on their own., Drinking water is not going to get rid of acne scars on its own, but staying hydrated is essential for healthy skin and will help to speed up the skin's natural rejuvenation process. Try to drink 1–2 liters (0.3–0.5 US gal) of water a day and eat lots of fresh fruit and veg.

Make sure you read the active ingredients of the product to know if it contains benzoyl peroxide and what strength.;
, Benzoyl peroxide works as an antimicrobial and exfoliative agent, helping to kill bacteria and to increase skin turnover.Benzoyl peroxide also helps to dry excess oil on the face.It also works to reduce inflammation where it is applied., It is known that 1 – 2% of people are allergic to benzoyl peroxide. While most people will experience skin irritation, redness and scaling with the use of benzoyl peroxide, these side effects should subside with time. If you continue to experience redness and scaling even when using very low concentrations applied on alternate days, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the drug.


Irritation is extremely common during the first three weeks of use and should improve after four to six weeks.Other possible signs of an allergic or negative reaction include peeling, sensitivity, and dryness.If you experience signs of a severe allergic reaction, including a tightness in the throat, shortness of breath, wheezing, low blood pressure, fainting, or collapse, call emergency services immediately., Whenever you use an over-the-counter product containing benzoyl peroxide, you should use that product in accordance with all of the instructions on the label. If you acquired the medication with a prescription, it is critical that you use benzoyl peroxide products as directed by a medical professional., In severe cases of acne, it is common to combine using benzoyl peroxide with topical or oral antibiotics as well as tretinoin. It should be noted, however, combining benzoyl peroxide with other irritants, other skin care products with benzoyl peroxide or exposing yourself to excessive sunlight can increase the risk of skin irritation in the area where benzoyl peroxide was applied. Make sure to limit exposure to other irritants so that you can effectively gauge the efficacy of benzoyl peroxide products in treating your acne.The side effects of combining other skin care products with benzoyl peroxide are similar to those that occur when you are having a genuine allergic reaction.

, Wash and dry your skin before applying benzoyl peroxide, unless using a benzoyl peroxide facial wash.Make sure your hands are clean before applying and wash your hands immediately afterwards.

, It is very important that you test any products containing benzoyl peroxide in small doses before applying liberally to affected areas. To do this, apply a small amount of the product to areas of your skin that are suffering from acne.Start with the lowest concentration possible, such as 2 – 5%, to minimize skin irritation.
Take care not to get benzoyl peroxide in your mouth, nose or broken skin. Do not apply it around your eyes or lips.Benzoyl peroxide is designed to be a topical medication, and should not come into contact with mucous membranes, such as the nose, mouth or eyes. Flush the affected area with water if you get benzoyl peroxide in your eyes, mouth, or broken skin.

, After applying a small amount of a benzoyl peroxide product to affected area, monitor that area for any signs of an allergic reaction. Note that mild redness, stinging or burning on initial application is expected. Applying this product at night should reduce appearance of redness by the morning. If irritation persists, use every other night.


If you do not experience any negative side effects (sensitivity, excessive dryness, peeling) and see positive results, continue using the benzoyl peroxide product as directed by a doctor or the product’s packaging.
In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions may occur. If you experience excessive swelling and trouble breathing, discontinue use of the product and contact a medical professional immediately., If you begin to experience allergy symptoms after applying a benzoyl peroxide product, stop using that product immediately. Remember that some irritation is normal at first, but contact your doctor if you have any questions.

, Flush the area several times until the product is rinsed thoroughly off of your skin. Avoid splashing any of the water into your eyes, nose or mouth. Don't use soap, as this might further irritate your skin. Do not scrub; rather, gently rinse and rub your skin., Do not rub your skin to dry it, as this can cause further irritation. You may use a towel, but a soft cloth like a clean T-shirt may be more gentle on your skin. Avoid using cotton balls as this may leave fibers on your skin., All-natural moisturizers, in most cases, will prevent further irritation of the skin. A sensitive skin or no-fragrance version is likely to be best, but it is wise to consult a physician. Even products labeled ""sensitive skin"" or ""no fragrance"" have the potential to interact negatively with benzoyl peroxide. Virgin coconut oil is often used as a gentle moisturizer., Do not continue using benzoyl peroxide products on irritated skin or on skin that has been moisturized until you consult with your doctor., Skin care products contain a wide variety of active ingredients, many of which have the potential to react negatively with benzoyl peroxide. Because of this, do not apply other skin care products to the areas of skin you treated with benzoyl peroxide to avoid the negative side-effects of mixing skin care products.Make sure you read the label for the active ingredients in any and all skin care products. Look for products containing peeling agents such as resorcinol, salicylic acid, sulfur, or tretinoin. These should be avoided when using benzoyl peroxide.Other products that may interact negatively with benzoyl peroxide include: isotretinoin (Accutane), dapsone, lime, hair dyes or removal creams, astringents, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions containing alcohol.Consult your medical provider about how you could use other products in combination with benzoyl peroxide. Tretinoin is sometimes used in combination with benzoyl peroxide to treat severe acne and your doctor can instruct you on how to use both products while minimizing interactions.

, In addition to avoiding skin care products that contain alternative active ingredients to benzoyl peroxide, you also must avoid the use of other products containing benzoyl peroxide. Using multiple medications that contain benzoyl peroxide can cause your skin to react negatively simply because you have applied too much benzoyl peroxide to an affected area.

, Stay out of the sun as much as possible and always wear a broad-spectrum sunblock with a minimum SPF 30. Wear a wide-brimmed hat to further protect your skin. Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps. If you get a sunburn, you should not use benzoyl peroxide unless directed by your doctor. Using sunblock may prevent the darkening of your skin where you have applied benzoyl peroxide.

, The type of acne you have will determine the type of treatment.Ask your doctor about the benefits, risks, and potential side effects of using benzoyl peroxide. Write a list of any alternative therapies you have questions about and take it with you to your doctor's visit.

, Any other medications you are taking (including supplements, vitamins, and over-the-counter products) could cause a drug interaction.Other things you may want to discuss with your doctor include:


Other creams (prescription or over-the-counter) that you are using
The different forms of this medication (lotion, facial wash, etc.) and which one might work best for you
The different concentrations of benzoyl peroxide and whether starting with the lowest possible dose (to minimize the possibility of irritation) is right for you

, This can include eczema, dermatitis, broken/bleeding skin, or any other irritation.Benzoyl peroxide is a topical medication only and any broken skin or open wounds would allow it to enter your body. Benzoyl peroxide may also make conditions such as eczema worse., If you have had an allergic reaction or severe irritation with benzoyl peroxide products in the past, you should avoid using benzoyl peroxide.There are several other acne medications and therapies that you could use, however, so don't lose hope. Talk with your doctor about the alternatives.

, Benzoyl peroxide may interact with lotions, makeup, facial washes, perfume, or any other agents that may come in contact with your skin.Ask your doctor before you use products like shaving cream or astringents, as they may make irritation from benzoyl peroxide therapy worse., It is not clear if benzoyl peroxide would be unsafe for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding, which is why it is important to ask your doctor.Be sure to consult with your OBGYN as well.

, You might need to adjust the dosage or discontinue using the product if you have severe side effects or if the treatment seems ineffective. While the information in this article is written to help you make informed decisions about benzoyl peroxide therapy and to help you minimize the possibility of irritation, it does not substitute for medical advice., Benzoyl peroxide is one of many acne treatments. Benzoyl peroxide is used for mild to moderate acne.Other acne treatments can be suggested or prescribed by a doctor (usually a dermatologist) and include:


Salicylic acid, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, and tetracycline.
Topical medications such as retinoids (such as Retin-A) or Dapsone
Topical or oral antibiotics
Medications to control hormones, such as oral contraceptives (for women) or anti-androgen agent (for men)
Isotretinoin (usually for the most severe cases of acne)

, Not all acne treatments take the form of oral or topical medications. You may wish to look into other treatments performed by dermatologists. These treatments include light therapy, laser treatments, chemical peels, whitehead and blackhead extraction and steroid injections., Though it is not entirely understood, there is a known connection between stress, cortisol, and increased acne.Learn positive ways to cop with stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. Make stress reduction part of your routine., Though dermatologists debate the connection between diet and acne, some researchers have found that modifying your diet (adopting a low-glycemic diet, specifically) can be beneficial., Some products, such as zinc, aloe vera, tea tree oil, though often disputed by dermatologists, have been tried as alternative, or additional, therapy to traditional acne treatments., For moderate to severe acne, most dermatologists recommend a combination of treatments that pair topical medications with oral medications."

If you talk to yourself in an unkind way, talk back in a way a kind way--the way your best friend would, for instance.


If the voice says, “That person turned you down because of your acne,” say back, “Rejection hurts, but it’s a normal part of being human. If this is true, then that person is silly for being so judgmental.”
For example, a voice that says, “Nobody will want to be seen in public with you!” can be replaced with, “I know my friends value more than appearance. And there are plenty of people with all sort of imperfections outside in public right now.”;
, If your best friend felt embarrassed or down because of acne, what would you say to them? Would you make fun of them or let them know that you cared? Be kind to yourself. Imagine if your friend came to you with their own insecurities about acne. What would you say?Instead of saying, “Poor me” or, “I’m less deserving of things because of how I feel about myself,” say, “Everyone struggles with things that make them feel vulnerable or insecure.”

, There has yet to be a perfect human who is flawless in their looks and actions. Every person has shortcomings and you are not separate from that! Being human means having flaws. Instead of feeling separate from others because of your acne, recognize that you are not the only person who struggles with skin issues or problems related to your appearance.Remembering that even the most put-together person has struggles and flaws can help you recognize that you’re never alone or beneath anyone.

, If you feel low about yourself due to your skin, find other things to raise your self-esteem. For example, participate in a sports team or activity that you enjoy. You can increase your confidence by trying something new. Attend a dance class, go to yoga, or give meditation a shot. You can feel accomplished in trying something new and begin to build skills to improve your self-esteem.For example, learn to ice skate. While it might be scary at first, you can make new friends and build your skills each week.

, People often want to turn away or avoid things that make them uncomfortable. You might not want to acknowledge how acne makes you feel or the suffering it causes you. Yet, reflect on the feelings you experience that relate to acne. Do you struggle to look at yourself in the mirror? Do you fear meeting new people and whether they will judge you based on your acne? Acknowledge the pain it causes you in order to more fully have compassion for yourself.Acknowledging the way you feel about your acne will likely be unpleasant or uncomfortable. However, accepting how it affects you can help you be kinder to yourself.

, It’s unlikely that your acne is the only trigger of low self-esteem. What are other events that make you feel low? Are you particularly sensitive to how people talk to you or look at you? Do you take failure very personally? Work on identifying and raising your self-esteem in other areas outside of your skin.For example, if someone gives you feedback about a project, do you think they’re being critical of you, or attacking you in some way? Recognize that people’s comments may not be a personal attack on you.

, When you feel different from others, it can make you feel alone or isolated from others. But acne is a very common affliction. If you look at your friends and notice that you have the worst acne, you might start to feel less-than them or self-conscious because of this difference. If you feel isolated because of your acne, remember that lots of other people have acne, too. Even if you feel alone, you are not alone.Some people struggle with acne in an emotional and social way while others simply carry on. Search out individuals who may have blemishes like you, but do not go and hide because of it. If they can do it, so can you.
Recognize that social media does not reflect fact. People typically do not post pictures that are unflattering. Often they wait until the breakout clears up, or use a lot of make-up or use Photoshop or filters to mask the imperfections. This leads to a situation in which it can look like no one ever has a bad hair day or pimples or anything, because it never gets on the Facebook feed. But of course people do. But too much time online feeds into a world that is a glossy fantasy of reality...in which you are the only person that has imperfections.
If you’re scared to meet people or talk to people because of your acne, face your fears. Put yourself in social situations and notice that they almost always go well., There are lots of acne solutions you can buy at your local pharmacy and use at home. You may start with a face wash product to target your skin type, which may be oily, dry, or a combination of both. Use a spot treatment for targeting individual breakouts. Generally, over-the-counter products to treat acne include benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. They are often gels or creams that you apply directly to the spots.These treatments may make your face especially dry at first, so adjust how much you use or include a moisturizer in your daily face care routine.
While lots of treatment options exist, they may not all work for you. Be patient when trying out new formulas and products. Most at-home treatments take 4-8 weeks to show improvement.

, One of the best ways to clear the effects of acne is to treat the acne. Especially if you’ve used all the natural remedies and over-the-counter treatments, it might be time to see a specialist. A dermatologist can assess the severity of your acne as well as potential causes and treatments. Although, you may need to be patient: many treatments can take up to eight weeks to take full effect.Depending on your insurance, you may need a referral from your general provider to see a dermatologist.

, Some people choose to hide their acne or the redness on their face with makeup. When choosing a cover-up, make sure it says “noncomedogenic” on the label, which means that it won’t clog your pores. Be careful of any products that go on your face and make sure they are not irritating your skin or making the acne worse. Write down a list of products you use and bring them to your dermatologist to ask if they are safe.Also, touch your face as little as possible during the day to keep oils down.


Use oil-free and water-based products. You might cover up your acne with moisturizers, sunscreen, or tinted ointment.

, Having acne isn’t like having the plague: it’s likely other people your age have it, too. Don’t be afraid to bring it up or talk about it with your friends. You might share advice or recommend products to help. Talking about your acne can be a way of bringing people together and solving a problem you’re all having.For example, you can say to your friend, “I have a zit that just won’t go away! Does that ever happen to you?”

, While problems with your skin and how they affect you can feel like the center of your life, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Take care of your whole body, your emotions, and your mind, not just your face. Take care of your body by eating well, exercising, and getting adequate sleep each night. Do something relaxing to help you deal with anxieties and stress.Have a healthy way to let go of stress. Try taking a daily walk, going for a run, journaling, or painting.

, Whether you see a dermatologist or primary care physician, it’s important that you feel supported by them. See someone who is kind and sympathetic. Your physician should listen to you and respond to your concerns. Because acne affects not only your skin but also your emotions and social interactions, your physician should be willing to discuss the total impacts of acne with you.If you don’t feel supported by your physician, consider changing to someone who makes you feel heard and understood.

, Join a support group for people who have acne and struggle with self-esteem. You can likely find an in-person support group in your community for people struggling with self-esteem problems, and you can find a more specific group for people who struggle with the effects of acne. Joining with other people can help you feel less alone and more supported.Ask for advice, share your story and listen to other people’s stories. Meeting other people who have similar struggles to your own can be comforting and relieving.
Find a support group in your community by calling your local mental health clinic or hospital. If you can’t find a community support group, join an online support group or forum.

, If you need to talk, ask someone for some time to vent or talk about how you feel. Let them know you feel insecure because of your acne. Find someone who is a good listener and who will support you, not cut you down or make fun of you. You might want advice or not want advice, so you can tell them ahead of time whether you want some help or you just want them to listen.Consider the people in your life who are trustworthy and supportive. You might not want to go to somebody who often playfully pokes fun at you or does not take you seriously.
Think of someone who cares about you and wants to support you through your difficulties. Ask them, “Can I talk to you? I’m struggling with how I feel about myself.”

, If you feel like your acne affects your self-esteem in a way that you don’t know how to move forward, a therapist can help. Therapy is a safe place where you can talk about your feelings without feeling judged or criticized. Your therapist can help you identify triggers and build coping skills to improve your self-esteem.Find a therapist by calling your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a physician or friend.

Make sure to wash with soap your entire body, especially places where acne can appear (back and chest) and personal area like genitalia, armpits and feet.;
, Washing hair everyday is not healthy for your hair's natural oils, because it dries them up. When you wash every other day, or just a few items a week, your hair looks healthier and much more natural. When you wash your hair, shampoo well, rinse and repeat before conditioning.

Be confident.",How to Be Fashion Forward (for Tweens)," If you feel like you need a change, then it may be because your old clothes are boring. Do a closet inventory and get rid of everything you don't like or that doesn't fit. This will not only get you more space for new clothes, but it will also help you find good clothes that you may have forgotten about. Just remember to not get rid of any clothes you like because they are ""not cool"". Your style is your choice!;
, Go shopping with your mother or with your good friends. Make sure that whoever you're shopping with won't judge your style and make you pick what they want; you're trying to be original, remember? If you can't find anyone to go with, see if you can online shop or go alone. Real life shopping is better, though, because you can feel and see the clothing, while you can't do that online.

, Picking stores that are ""cool"" won't do you any good unless you really like the store. Go to stores that grab your attention with clothes that you think are cool. Some nice stores are: Abercrombie and Fitch, Delia's, Target, Kohl's, H & M, and Forever 21.

, Once you're in a store, look around for deals. It's okay to get something a little more expensive, but if it's your own money you're using, then you should go for deals and cheaper prices.

, Don't choose your clothes based on what other people think is ""fashionable"". Choose what you like because you like it, not because someone else does.

, You can find inspiration from other people, characters, places, other time periods, and more. Remember that you're creating your own style, so don't ever overdo it!

, Remember to choose a variety of clothes, not just one certain style or type. Choose different skirts, dresses, pants, shirts, leggings, coats, and more. Even if you're a tomboy, at least trying on a dress or skirt isn't the end of the world! You never know—you may like it!

, Try on your clothes and show your shopping buddy. A good shopping buddy is always honest, and will be sure to tell you if you don't look good in something! If something doesn't fit, try it in a different size. Never get something you don't completely and totally like, or otherwise you won't wear it!

, Don't keep ""sets"" of clothes and only wear those as outfits. That won't be original at all! Mix things up a bit and don't be afraid to take a fashion risk! Try a skirt with super skinny jeans, or use your scarf as a belt!

, If someone says your style rocks, look them in the eye and say ""Thank you!"" If someone says they hate your outfit, look them in the eye and say 'If i wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it,"" and walk away. Never be afraid to be you!

, Try things like belts, scarves, hats, etc. You can go shopping at stores that sell clothes or stores just for accessories like Claire's.

, Go online and look up some cute DIY accessories such as earrings, bracelets, etc. If you know how to knit or sew, use it to your benefit and make yourself a scarf or hat! Use your talents to your best ability.

, If you like jewellery, then you can wear earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and more! They don't need to be pure 24 carat gold; costume jewelry works just as well. If you don't like jewellery, then don't wear it! Style can shine without any jewels at all!

, This is a choice between you and your parents. Ask them if it's okay, and if so, do it on the weekends if you like. If your school is okay with makeup, then wear it if you want! Never overdo it, makeup doesn't make beauty. It just lets it shine brighter!

, Just a little mascara, light colored eye shadow, and blush and lipgloss can go a long way. You should not wear too much makeup to school, because it will make you look fake. Wear a little more makeup than usual to parties and on weekends if you like!

, If your school does have a rule about no makeup, then don't break it! You could get in trouble and it would not end well.

, You can also use Lush facial products; they work very well!

, You don't need million dollar soaps, but a scrub or soap will be good. Make sure it is oil free to prevent acne. If your mother has pimple cream, then use it!

, If you're a girl over ten, then it's time you start showering every day. Use conditioner and shampoo, plus a body wash or any other products you like.

, Keeping clean should be fun! You can use bath bombs, sprays, and other fun things.

, Remember that confidence is key. The coolest style imaginable would not be complete without a proud, smiling face. Never be mean, but that doesn't mean giving fake compliments! Always be kind, nice, and polite. Say please and thank you, and remember: a smile is the best style!

Choose a classic look.,
Coordinate with friends.,
Create the perfect outfit.,
Wear comfy shoes.",How to Look Good for a Party2," Don't wait until the night of the party to figure out what you are going to wear. It is helpful to plan at least a few days in advance to prevent rushing around to find an outfit. If you can, ask the host of the party or a friend what the dress code is like so you know if you need to dress formal or casual. Here are some key pieces of your outfit to plan.If it's casual, consider jeans and a nice shirt.
If it's formal, wear a fancier button up shirt or blouse, dress, slacks, or a tie.
If you're outside on a warm day, dress in lighter fabric so you don't get too hot.

, If you can't figure out exactly what the dress code is because you don't know the host or you don't want to ask your date, there are looks you can find that are timeless and work for almost any occasion.Girls can always depend on the little black dress. Find a simple black dress that is knee length. You can add a necklace and heels to dress up the look or wear flats to keep it casual.
The ""go to"" for guys can be a button up collar shirt with nice dress slacks.

Men can look good with facial hair, but if you decide to keep a little on your face, you need to trim and maintain it properly.,
Maintain good dental hygiene.",How to Look Good," Browse through hairstyle magazines and fashion magazines to get an idea of which hair styles and colors are currently the most popular. This should not be the only thing you use to choose a hairstyle, but it may give you some idea of where to start the selection process.


Hair magazines can be especially helpful since they offer a variety of styles for a variety of lengths. Look at celebrities' hairstyles.
Trends come and go, so think carefully before you choose a style simply because it seems popular right now.
Even though you should avoid choosing a style simply due to its popularity, browsing through current trends can give you an idea of which styles you might want to avoid and which styles are already outdated.
Guys may have a harder time finding fashion and hair magazines that appeal to a male demographic, but male hair style magazines do exist. Nonetheless, if you are unable to find one, look online for pictures of current style trends for men.;
, You may like the way a given style looks on someone else, but that does not necessarily mean it will look the same way on you. Hair texture plays a large role in why this happens. Straight hair and curly hair holds styles differently, just as fine hair and coarse hair do.


The four basic texture groups are straight, wavy, curly, and kinky.This applies to both men and women.
Within each category, hair can be fine, medium, or coarse. This, too, applies to both men and women.
Generally speaking, straight styles look best on women with fine to medium hair, especially if they have naturally straight hair to begin with. On the other hand, women in this category tend to have hair that does not hold a curl well.
For women: straight hair is difficult to curl and curly hair or kinky hair is difficult to straighten. You can still style your hair in these ways, but be prepared for a lot of extra work with minimal rewards.
For women: if you have fine hair, look for styles that add volume with layering or texturing. Stay away from flat styles or styles that will require many extra hair products to ""hold"" in place. If you have medium hair, you can usually enjoy a variety of styling options. If you have coarse hair, look for styles that thin out excess volume and avoid styles that add volume or texture.
For men: if you have thin hair, consider short styles instead of longer ones. Short styles tend to hide thinness better, while longer styles make the thinness of your hair easier to spot. Similarly, you may have an easier time taming kinky hair if you keep it short. Men with wavy or curly hair have a variety of lengths available to them, though. Shorter hair tends to tame your waves and curls, while longer styles can look great but require more effort to maintain.

, Every face has a slightly different outline, but the outline of your face can affect how a certain hair style looks on you. Choose a style that works with your face shape for best results.Round faces: Women should consider an uneven cut with plenty of layers in it to add the appearance of length to the face. If opting for a shorter style, avoid ""round"" styles like traditional bobs and stick with defined pixie cuts and or choppy bobs. Men should consider styles that lengthen the forehead while maintaining plenty of hair along the sides of the face.

Oval faces: Women should try to break up the overall length of the face by adding details like blunt bangs or side swept bangs. On the other hand, men should avoid bangs with this face shape and should leave as much of their face uncovered as possible.

Square faces: Women should look for hairstyles that add roundness to the face, like a classic bob, since these soften otherwise sharp edges. Avoid styles that add too much bulk, though. Men should keep bangs off the forehead to avoid adding extra angles to an already angled appearance. They should also avoid center parts.

Heart faces: Women should look for medium and longer styles that are thin toward the top of the head and thicker toward the bottom, thereby balancing out the heart shape. Men may wish to consider longer styles that drop down past the cheekbone so that they can emphasize the bottom of their face while minimizing the bulk of the top.

, Both men and women struggle with body image, and you most likely have parts of your body that you like less than others. Draw attention away from these parts by highlighting your positive features with detail.


As a general rule, wear darker colors to slim down wide parts of your body or to otherwise obscure parts of your body you have less confidence about. Light colors catch the eye, so they should be worn around areas of the body that you feel better about.
Avoid placing prints on areas of your body that you feel insecure about. Prints and patterns attract attention, so if you place them in an area you want to hide, you won't be doing yourself any favors.
Opt for fitted garments in your size. This is especially important for women, but it applies to both genders. Loose, baggy clothes tend to look sloppy and may make you look plumper than you actually are.
Women should pay special attention to their body type. Typically, body type can be broken down into different shapes: hourglass, pear (or triangle), apple (or round), inverted triangle, or rectangle (or straight).Do a little research online about the best ways to dress your body type. Typically, you want clothes that emphasize your smaller portions and accentuate your weight, thereby enhancing your curves and balancing out your overall appearance.

, Skin tone is broken down into “cool” and “warm.” While you do not need to limit yourself to a range of colors based solely on your skin tone, certain colors may make enhance your complexion better than others.


Cool toned skin has pink undertones, while warm toned skin has yellow or olive undertones.
People with cool toned skin should look for colors on the blue side of the spectrum. Most blues look good on cool toned skin, as well as blue-tinted greens and violets. Light pinks also work well, as do vibrant oranges, which act as a complementary contrast. As far as neutrals go, look for blacks, grays, silvers, and stark whites.
People with warm toned skin should look for colors on the red side of the spectrum. Most reds and yellows look good on people with warm skin, as well as yellow-tinted greens and red-tinted violets. Browns, tans, golds, coppers, and off-whites tend to be the best neutrals.

, This piece of advice primarily applies to women. Cosmetics are a powerful tool, but you should apply your makeup lightly and in ways that highlight your beauty. Never attempt to hide behind your makeup.


Apply a light foundation and blush that match your skin tone as closely as possible, even if your skin tone is lighter or darker than you would like. Liven up your skin by applying blush and bronzer no more than a shade or two darker than your actual skin tone.
Use concealer when necessary, but apply a thin layer instead of caking it on.
Choose a feature to highlight and focus that majority of your effort on that. Usually, this is either your lips or your eyes. Glam up one feature while leaving the others plain to avoid overwhelming your look.
Apply mellow, subtle eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara during the daytime. Save your dramatic eye coloring for evening.
Same goes for lip color. Opt for subtle shades of gloss or lipstick during the day and more dramatic shades of lipstick at night.

, Being aware of the latest trends will help prevent you from wearing clothes that are grossly outdated, but ultimately, trends come and go. Wear styles that you like and skip over ones that fail to catch your eye.


This does not necessarily require a large amount of research. You can browse fashion websites and magazines, but you can usually get an idea of what styles are “in” and which are “out” simply by watching television, walking down the street, or looking in a trendy store.
Build your wardrobe on classic pieces that rarely go out of style. Limit yourself to the occasional trendy piece here or there, but be prepared to chuck a piece if it becomes dated in a few years.

,



Round faces: Look for frames with sharp angles and corners, like rectangles and upswept frames. Avoid short frames or those that are notably small.

Oval faces: Most frames work well with this shape. Round frames can enhance your curves, while geometric shapes add angles that balance out your curves. Avoid frames that are too large, though.

Square faces: Consider oval and round frames to soften the hard edges of your face, but avoid square and geometric frames that add additional angles.

Heart faces: Look for bottom-heavy frames and avoid top-heavy styles. Also avoid decorative frames. Instead, opt for narrow frames that add as little bulk to the forehead as possible.

, Clothes that are washed, dried, and wrinkle-free just look better than dirty clothes that have been piled in a corner in your room for the last week. No matter what clothes you choose, make sure that your clothes are in the best shape possible so that you look your best, as well.

, Wash your skin with an appropriate facial cleanser at least once a day, if not twice.


If you have dry skin, wash your face once a day instead of twice a day. Use gentle cleansers for sensitive skin to avoid making your skin any drier than it already is and apply plenty of face lotion afterward.
If you have oil skin, you may need to wash your face twice a day. Use a gentle cleanser in the morning and a stronger cleanser in the evening. Exfoliate your pores weekly.
Avoid using plain body soap. Body wash is stronger than most facial cleansers and, as a result, it will dry the skin on your face too quickly and too severely.
If you struggle with acne more than most people, you may need to seek out a medicated facial cleanser. Talk to your dermatologist or family physician for suggestions.

, Most individuals should wash their hair every other day to maintain the right amount of oil.


Washing your hair everyday or more than once a day will likely dry it out. As a result, your hair may suffer long-term damage. In the short-term, it may also be frizzier and more brittle.
Washing your hair less often than every other day may result in hair that looks flat and oily.
Use shampoos, conditioners, and other hair care products formulated for your hair type for the best possible results. If you have trouble making your hair look shiny and healthy, talk to a hair stylist or barber for suggestions.

, In addition to washing your face and hair regularly, you must also wash your body on a regular basis. Bathe every one to two days whenever possible.


Wash up with warm water and soap. You can either use a shower gel or bar soap.
Apply lotion to your skin after you get out of the shower, focusing on rough patches like your knees and elbows. Applying lotion right after your shower will lock in more moisture. Additionally, lotion is an important part of your beauty regimen because it prevents your skin from drying out.

, Men and women don't usually need to worry about their facial hair, and for men there is no shame to have a mustache or a beard since it's assumed to be natural and masculine. Women don't either need to worry about facial hair, but some women prefer not to have it. Remember, it's your choice, and it's only some hair! Not a big of a deal., Avoid beards or mustaches that look untamed, and if your facial hair looks scraggly, you should consider shaving it off.
Women can usually get away without shaving during cold-weather months, but you should shave your underarms as soon as you break out the short sleeves and your legs as soon as you start wearing capri pants, shorts, skirts, and dresses. Shave every few days during the warmer weather months to keep up on your hair and reduce stubble.

, Brush your teeth at least twice a day to keep your smile its whitest.


Brush your teeth once in the morning and once at night. You can also brush in the middle off the afternoon, shortly after lunch, if desired. Use a cavity-fighting toothpaste. A whitening toothpaste can also be considered, but some individuals may find that whitening toothpastes make their teeth feel more sensitive.
You should also floss regularly to cut down on decay. Consider carrying floss around with you, as well, in the event that food gets stuck in between your teeth while you're out and about.
Talk to your dentist about using commercial whitening strips if you want to brighten your smile a little more. He or she should be able to recommend a brand that is safe for your teeth.

If you notice hair building up in your razor, give it a quick rinse to get the hair off.

Clothes aren't everything, though.,
Don't forget about the most important thing: school supplies.,
Remember the next most important thing: A positive attitude.",How to Shop for Back to High School(for Girls)," Go through your wardrobe and see what fits, what doesn't, what you like, what you hate, etc. Donate the unwanted clothes, give them to a friend, or throw them out if they're in really bad shape.


Organize a swap party with your friends and bring all of your unwanted clothes. You could end up getting that skirt you've wanted for the past year, but is always sold out or too expensive.

Reuse the clothes. Some old, careworn shirts could make a great body pillow or quilt, and jeans could make cute bags.;
, Instead of blowing all of your allowance or paycheck on the movies or something that you'll only wear once, save it, or at least most of it. Do odd jobs around the neighborhood, get a part-time job at a local store, or start a dog-walking business for some added cash.

, Before you buy that top you've wanted for ages, get some of the basics. Some things it would be in your best interests to have would be:


At least five pairs of jeans-different styles, all the same, low riders, boot cuts, whatever.
At least five plain t-shirts. Get one or two white and black ones, to go with almost anything, and a few colored ones.
At least three camis and tank tops. You can use them to layer or for a hot day, provided they're school appropriate.
One pair of leggings. Leggings are extremely versatile; you can use them under dresses, as pants, with almost anything.
At least three hoodies. Hoodies are useful for layering, on chilly days, or instead of a jacket.
At least one pair of sweatpants for days when you don't feel like dressing up or are bloated.
At least two pairs of shorts, but make them school-appropriate; no booty shorts!
At least one dressy shirt and skirt/dress, for nicer occasions-an honors assembly, a sports banquet, or a semi-formal school dance.
Shoes-at least one pair of sneakers, tennis shoes, flats, flip flops, and dress shoes. It's up to you how many of these you get, but don't go overboard.

, Providing you have everything listed above (although remember, those are just guidelines-depending on the local climate, they may vary), it's time to improve upon your probably bland wardrobe. Head to the local shops to find the perfect drop-dead-gorgeous outfits you've wanted for ages.


Go to local thrift stores; they might have a classic shirt of your favorite 80s band, or the perfect jeans, all at a fraction of the cost!

, Make your favorite outfit better with a chic handbag or necklace. Buy a few necklaces, bracelets, and rings for the finishing touches.


Chances are, your backpack is looking mighty dingy, but you might not want to get a whole new one. Add pins and patches to refresh the entire bag.
Don't think you have to buy everything from the department stores, though. You can make your own bracelets and necklaces, or head to a local art center if they sell jewelry made by the community.

, Don't think that this is everything you need, though. You might want to get a new hairdo to make yourself look and feel like a new you. Buy new makeup to replenish your dwindling supply. Get a manicure for soft, touchable hands. Get some acne treatment in case a zit pops up the morning of your first day.

, As shocking as it may seem, you're in school to learn, and going back unprepared won't help you at all. If you don't already have a supply list, just get the basics:


Five to six single subject notebooks, depending on how many classes you're taking and whether they require individual notebooks.
Four to five packs of loose leaf paper.
Five to six folders, depending on how many classes you're taking and whether they require individual folders.
One or two packs each of pencils and pens.
Two or three binders, although this varies depending on how you plan to use them; for certain classes, for homework, for projects, etc.

, This can quicken the time. You won't have to go through millions of drawers just to find some lotion.

, Does a parental unit awake you? Sometimes they don't wake up as well: they're humans, you know. Make sure your alarm clock is set to go off at the correct time. Have it tuned to your favorite radio station for fun songs in the morning! Another alternative is an iHome for an iPod. You can wake to your iPod music instead of beeping or the radio.

, If you're a person who reads at night to fall asleep, it's better if you conserve your reading for another time. Books can drag on and on, and you'll lose track of time!

, Write it out on a sticky note and post it near your bedroom door. Such as: Wake up: 6am; Get dressed: 6:10; Eat breakfast: 6:15; etc.

,, Also, don't go back to sleep.

Dress cute.,
Be clean.,
Wear some makeup.,
Get electronics.",How to Dress Rich in Middle School," Try wearing affordable clothes that are in style.;
, Shower every day and wash your face with cleansers and scrubs. Use body scrub that makes you smell good, and keeps your skin soft. If you are busy and barely have time in the morning, take showers at night so you can wake up beautiful. Apply lotion and tidy up your nails after taking a shower. Always have wavy or straight hair, so if you have naturally wavy hair, you may want to straighten it (and vice versa). Use shampoo and conditioner that makes hair less oily and hydrated, or removes frizz. If you dance or play a sport, pull your hair back into a loose bun or ponytail to look cute and be able to move around. If you do ballet, your teacher will want you in black tights. Those are boring, and colored ones are much better. If you like, you can get (or do your own) a French manicure to look even more glam. Be careful if you want loud colors, because some can look tacky. However, any bright shade, like bright pink, looks cool on your toes.

, Don't wear too much, as you don't want to look like a clown. Wear some eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, and lip gloss. If you'd like, you could also put on concealer to hide zits and get magazine-perfect complexion. Magazines such as Seventeen and CosmoGirl have great makeup tips. Wear one necklace daily and a few cute bracelets that match your outfit. Wearing too much of one thing (e.g. 3 necklaces, 8 bracelets) usually looks tacky. Avoid large hoops if your ears are pierced, because they look strange on young girls. Small hoops or bigger Stacey-style hoops are safe.

, Rich girls normally have a hot cell phone such as an Android, Blackberry, or Sidekick, an iPhone 5s and an iPod, too. They also have cool, small digital cameras.

Make your designs come to life, you'll need a sewing machine and fabric (or, you could sew it by hand, but the work is tedious and takes much longer).,
Have a design studio, if desired.,
Start sketching!,
Start a fashion blog.,
Get subscribed in at least one fashion magazine: Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Teen Vogue, Glamour, and Seventeen are good magazines.,
Share your work!,
Make a name for your company!,
Wear your own creations.,
Have fun!!!",How to Be a Tween Fashion Designer," Or, you could ask a friend to make the designs for you. You'll have to give your friend some of the money you made, though. You'll also need a sketchpad, colored pencils/markers/crayons, pens, and an open mind.;
, Find a spare room in the house, a little nook or cranny, or even the basement or attic, and make that your own personal space. You can work up there, get inspiration, and stuff like that. It can also operate as a showroom, so you can show your friends your creations.

, Make anything that comes up in your mind. If you're not a good sketcher, maybe take drawing classes from a friend, or even take art lessons at your school or community. If you want to make it REALLY real, you could draw it on a human body. If you can, great, try it. If you can't, it's okay. If you have the desire to, take drawing classes. There's an article on how to draw a woman body here, on wikiHow.

, It's a good way to put yourself out there. Share your illustrations and/or creations and get feedback from other fashionistas. Write your feedback on the latest Alexander McQueen shoes or the new Ralph Rucci collection.

, Try to keep in touch with the latest, but don't follow the crowd. Your designs are YOURS and unique. Add whatever you like and leave whatever you don't like out - no reason for not liking it is too stupid or too crazy to leave the item out!, Maybe make your friend's prom dress, or give your cousin your new garment. They'll start showing it off to other people, and they'll say, Where did you get that? and they'll say, Oh, my friend made it. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there, and remember to accept feedback. Feedback only makes you better.

, It could be your name, it could be something like FIERCE or OMG or something like that. Remember that it doesn't have to be a one woman operation. You could have your best friend help. It's way funner!!!

, Like I said about sharing your work: people will comment if it's good work.

, Though fashion designing is stressful, it's exhilarating and not only one of the hardest jobs, but probably the funnest, too. You'll be up there with Dior in no time!!!

, Getting up is always hard in the first place. People say you should get a decent beauty sleep, but obviously as you become a teenager there is always that show/book you want to watch/read. Set a good and upbeat alarm (if you use one) at a time you think suitable. Don't press snooze! You'll get into the habit and you waste time. You can also ask your mum or someone to wake you up at first if waking up with an alarm is hard.

, Moisturize.

, Whether you have a shower or not, try not to fuss with different lotions and sprays. Just use a nice smelling body wash and (if you want) shampoo.

, Try customizing your uniform by adding a cool watch, or if you're allowed jewelry, some bangles or a necklace.

,, Try something simple and cute, such as a high ponytail and cute clips. Or you can wrap a ribbon around a bun or pigtails.

, Discreet but good make-up is concealer and foundation (if needed) and possibly brown mascara.

Look for a slinky red stiletto for the ultimate in sexy footwear.,
Tone things down with a red pump.,
Find middle ground by choosing a low-heeled pump.,
Try a different shade of red.",How to Wear Red Shoes1," If you want a shoe that will leave a lasting impression for a date or big event, a red heel is the way to go. Be careful about what you pair this shoe with, however, since pairing it with too many notably sexy garments can push your look into the realm of trashiness.;
, If you want to wear your red shoes to work or for a casual stroll down the block, a simple red pump is your best bet. Flats are simple enough to subdue wild red into submission.

, Heels can look classy, even if they are red. Closed-toe pumps are your best choice, and you can wear them with both casual and dressy outfits.

, If you feel uneasy about wearing a bright red shoe, start out by wearing a deeper shade, like burgundy. A deep shade of red is more subdued and a little less noticeable, which may make you feel more confident about your ability to pull it off.

Match red with neutrals.,
Color block.,
Avoid wearing red with red.,
Also avoid wearing red shoes with bright green.,
Wear red shoes with a neutral pattern.,
Pair red shoes with patterns that have traces of red in them.,
Wear your red pumps with casual clothes.,
Avoid wearing red shoes with trashy or suggestive pieces.,
Wear your red shoes with a conservatively sexy ensemble.,
Resist the temptation to adorn yourself in too many red accessories.",How to Wear Red Shoes2," If black, brown, gray, nude, white, and deep navy blue are the only colors found in your outfit, a neutral shoe will only make your outfit seem duller. Adding a bright red shoe can make your style pop. Try wearing a red pump the next time you throw on a black pencil skirt and white button-down blouse.

, Color blocking is the practice of wearing solid blocks of bright, complementary colors against one another. Try wearing your red shoes against an orange or pink dress.

, If you have a solid red dress, do not wear it with your red shoes. If you do, you run the risk of overkill. If you would prefer to wear your bright red shoes with a red dress, choose a deep red dress to add depth to your ensemble.

, Red and green are too closely associated with Christmas, and wearing them together will make your outfit look too seasonal. Instead of a bright green, mix your red shoes with deeper shades like olive.

, Red peep-toe shoes make a good accompaniment to a black and white polka dot dress or pinstripe trousers.

, While solid red outfits are often overkill with red shoes, a print with traces of red in it coordinates with your shoes in a subtle, appropriate manner.

, Red shoes look great against denim blue jeans, especially medium and dark washes. A red pump is an easy way to add a pop of color and a twist of sophistication to your everyday style.

, Red shoes are already relatively sexy. Wearing them with ripped jeans, tube tops, cut-off shorts, and other revealing garments does not make you look sexier. Instead of looking confident, it may simply look like you are trying too hard to be noticed.

, If you want to take full advantage of the seductive nature of red stilettos, pair them with an outfit that is subtly, rather than overtly, sultry. For instance, a little black dress with cap sleeves and a hemline that comes down to your knee can be very sexy, even though it shows a modest amount of skin. This makes it a potential candidate for your red high heels.

, You can match your red shoes with red lipstick and a red handbag, but stop there. Do not add a red belt, red scarf, red bracelet, and ruby red ring to the mix. A few red accessories looks coordinated, but too many looks overdone.

, Here are some things to bring to school:


Binders and folders; notebooks
Pencil pouch/case
Pens, highlighters, pencils
Lunch money or lunch; and phone.

, The most common time to wake up for school is 6:00 - 6:30.


Put your alarm across the room so that you have to get up to turn it off and won't go back to bed.

, If you decide to hit the snooze button, you will wake up twenty minutes later than you should and end up rushing through the morning in order to be on time. When you finally get up, you may even be more tired than you were the first time your alarm went off.

,, If you want to leave your hair down, be sure that it is neat and tidy, or if you prefer the messy style, that is is a good messy bun or tousled beach waves look. Simple styles for your hair include:


Any kind of braid
Braided bangs
Ponytails
Half up, half down.

, You don't want to get food all over your clothes for school, do you?

, It is good to keep your teeth looking clean and fresh, especially when you're going to school.


Brush your teeth for about two to three minutes, twice a day to prevent cavities.
Use a mouthwash if wished.
Floss your teeth.

, Keep it fresh and clean, ready for the day.

, This is entirely optional and if you do add any, don't overdo It. All that is needed is concealer and maybe lip gloss or sheen. Mascara and eyeliner are optional.


Remember that makeup adds time to your morning and can contribute to skin breakouts. Given your beautiful young skin and fresh appearance due to being so young, it's not needed.

, Keeping a portable bag packed with a variety of essentials can be helpful. You could include such things as:


Comb or brush
Ponytail holders, clips or bobby pins and headbands
Lip balm or lip gloss; or a chapstick
Makeup, if relevant
Lotion, hand sanitizer
Deodorant
Tissues.

Make a list of things you want to change about yourself.,
Start with clothing.,
Go shopping!,
Recreate your personality.,
Mind your Manners.,
Try to have a friend or two in every ""group."",
Don't be a jerk or a snob.,
Have fun with it!",How to Reinvent Yourself for Your Freshman Year," Don't get too worked up about personalities and permanent physical features, like your nose, chest, or hair. Those things will change automatically over time. Think about your clothing style, your manners, your hairstyle/color, and your exercise and eating habits (believe me, these are CRUCIAL in high school). Make a list of REALISTIC possibilities for things you can change without spending a lot of money or overexerting yourself.;
, Go through your closet. As in, ""Okay, I'm laying ALL of my clothes out on my floor and seeing what I want and don't want. Let's turn up the tunes and get to it!""


Make a pile of DONATIONS, things that are still in good shape but you don't want, including last season's clothes and shirts that are too small. You could make crafts out of them if you're handy, but it's a better choice to give them to someone who needs them and will wear them a lot.
Make a pile of THROW AWAY, things that are beyond repair and would not be used by a dog, much less a human. Again, crafty people can use these things, and it's much better for the environment if you use this material, instead of perfectly good clothing.
Bag up the donations and give them to Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Amvets; and throw away the others. Now you've got some things to work with. Try new combinations of the clothing you already have, by adding different techniques like layering or adding prints, or reinvent them with accessories like jewelry, hats, belts, and shoes. If you want to go really far, even start picking out whole outfits for days where you need to get out of the house quickly, and don't have time to do a fashion show.

, Stick to a small budget and buy two or three outfits from a cheap but stylish store (such as Target, Walmart, Kohl's, Marshall's, or T.J. Maxx's)that can be easily mixed and matched with your existing choices. Buy pairs of quality, inexpensive shoes. Bonus if they can be worn with a casual and a formal outfit with little alteration. Buy lots of cute clips/head accessories and earrings and jewelry. Don't go too bulky or overwhelmingly colorful.


For high school, jackets and bags will be your BEST FRIENDS. Jackets will make sure that you don't freeze with school's varying temperatures. Buy a tote bag to carry your books around in the halls, or re-purpose an old one.

, This is something that will be crucial from your freshman year, the year that you discover yourself. If there is something changeable that annoys others, do your best to fix it. For example, if you are very sarcastic during tender moments, try to monitor your speech. When you constantly interrupt people, see if you can hold your tongue and listen more. However, if it's something that you just don't see yourself changing in an instant, like shyness or saying embarrassing things, don't worry. You have plenty of time-just be glad that you know how it affects others.

, These are basic. Don't eat with your mouth open. Don't beg for things if you've already been told no. Say please and thank you. Greet someone when they walk up to you. Some are more tricky, like don't hold grudges, don't be jealous, and compliment others freely. You can find many manner websites, even ones written for teens, that tell you how to behave and what NOT to do in different situations.

, Be friends with some of the goths, preps, nerds, populars, and especially those who you were friends with in middle school. Don't leave your friends behind just because you want to change yourself. Make sure you keep that in mind. Even if you realize that you are drifting apart, don't just abandon them, especially during a rough transition to high school.

, Just because you may get lots of attention for the way you change (both good and bad) doesn't mean you're suddenly the most popular person on earth, and it especially doesn't mean that you can act like you think you are. Be nice to everyone, even the teachers and students you may not like as much. If you find yourself being mean to others, calm down, take a deep breath, and examine the issue from afar. Remember that everyone needs kindness.

, There's nothing more fun than experimenting with a new look and a new you. Enjoy high school! They're going to be the most important 4 years of your entire life.

, PacSun is probably the best store to go to because it has all of the surfer and skater brands with a Cali feel. The best brands are Billabong, Converse, Hurley, DKNY, dELiA's, Tilly's, Nike, Rainbow, O'Neill, Reef, Rip Curl, Roxy, Vans, Hollister, and Zumies.

, The best hair is wavy and highlighted. This is because of all the time in the sun and water, and because they just don't care. To achieve the perfect hair, spray your hair with a homemade spray. Mix lemon juice with a couple tablespoons of sea salt to get the best hair. Remember to deep condition at least once a week and use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. You can put it in a loose bun, loose ponytail, loose braid(s), half up, or just leave it down.

, You should go tanning at least every other week to keep that tan. Use plenty of sunscreen and a good lotion so you don't crisp up too bad. Drink lots of water, eat healthy, and exercise. Wash your whole body with a good quality soap/shower gel. Rinse with really cold water. Shave your legs and armpits, and if you want your arms. Cleanse, tone, and moisturize your face. Do a facial every week. Exfoliate once a week also.

, Starting with a clean base, apply clear mascara to your eyes. Then, apply some lip balm. If you want, use a little blush. Amp up your eyebrows with a waterproof eyebrow filler or eye shadow. Comb through thoroughly.

, Make sure to eat plenty of protein, fruits, veggies, and whole grains. If you want, go vegetarian. Exercise plenty. Do Pilates, yoga, and meditation to stay in shape year round. Also do a sport.

, You should do skateboarding and/or surfing. Also do swimming, volleyball, dancing, cycling, and/or running. These sports give off a surfer/skater vibe and prepare you for your other sports. Choose only 2-3 sports and really excel in them.

, Be relaxed. Don't stress about little things. Get excellent grades, preferably straight A's. Don't get in trouble very often at all. Be open about your life. Always be happy. Be a beach babe. Have a healthy social life. Most of all, just be you. If you are a weirdo, embrace it!

Opt for pastel colors over bold colors.,
Look for garden flowers over tropical flowers.,
Try on a floral print blouse.,
Buy a floral print skirt.,
Shop for a floral print dress.,
Throw on a floral print scarf.,
Incorporate flowers into your jewelry.,
Wear a flower in your hair.,
Purchase flats with floral elements.",How to Have a Preppy Floral Style1," Soft hues, like baby blue and buttercup yellow, are subdued and classy, which work well for the preppy style you are trying to achieve. Bright colors, like hot pink or neon orange, can be equally lovely but will work against this style trend.;
, Think roses, daisies, tulips, and daffodils. Garden flowers create a feminine ambiance that works well with this style. Orchids and other tropical flowers give off an exotic feeling that may clash with the preppy style, however.

,


Look for a well-fit blouse made from soft, draping material that lightly falls over your body without clinging to it.
Blouses with frills or ruffles are especially feminine and may complement this style nicely.
You can either opt for a small floral print or a large one.

,


Look for a knee-length skirt and avoid anything shorter.
Pencil skirts and A-line skirts flatter most body types and have a classic appeal that may help you create a preppy look.
For skirts, larger prints are often more flattering than small prints.

,


Opt for a conservative style like a sheath dress that goes down to the knee.
You have a little flexibility with the neckline, since scoop necks, boat necks, and v-necks all work well, but it should not plunge too low or reveal too much skin.
Also opt for dresses with sleeves or thick straps and avoid halter or strapless styles.
However, if you find a halter neck dress that has the perfect print, wear a cropped sweater or a plain crop top over the dress to be comfortable with the outfit.
Both large and small prints can work well, depending on your figure.

, If your outfit is composed of solid colors, a fashion scarf is a nice way to add a bit of floral pattern to your look. Scarves made from sheer materials have a delicate, feminine appearance and may work better than scarves made from heavier fabrics.

, Look for a long strand of pearls with a flower clipped to the side or a delicate daisy pendant. Rose-shaped earrings and bracelet charms are another unobtrusive way to introduce flowers into your jewelry.

, You can either opt for a cloth flower hair clip or a headband with a floral element attached to the side.


Alternatively, you may also find vintage style hats—like a straw summer hat or bucket hat—with a flower pinned above the brim, and many of these will also work well.

, Try canvas flats with a floral print or leather flats with a cloth flower pinned at the toes. Avoid heels, since these often clash with the preppy style.

Mind your colors.,
Stock up on fitted button-down shirts.,
Look for cardigan sweaters.,
Include khaki trousers in your wardrobe.,
Stick with dark wash jeans for casual wear.,
Opt for Bermuda shorts over shorter styles.,
Stock up on simple, knee-length skirts.,
Try a fitted blazer.,
Keep your shoes simple and feminine.,
Minimize your accessories.",How to Have a Preppy Floral Style2," A standard color scheme for any preppy-based style includes white, black, navy, and beige. These colors should be accented with like pastels like baby blue, soft pink, light teal, buttercup yellow, and peach.

, Button-down shirts look clean and crisp, which gives your look the polite, conservative edge needed to create an effectively preppy wardrobe. White shirts are the most versatile, but you can also throw in a few pastels.

, Cardigan sweaters are ultra feminine and classy, making them the perfect piece to throw over a plain shirt, floral blouse, or floral dress. White and cream sweaters work well, but a light pink cardigan is another classically preppy piece.

, Khaki pants are more common to the preppy style than darker dress pants and are especially well-suited for the pastel color scheme required in floral preppy outfits.

, Dark wash jeans have a dressier look than light wash jeans, making them better suited for any preppy style. Opt for a straight-leg style and avoid styles that taper or cling to your leg.

, Shorts are by no means forbidden, but short shorts should be avoided. Bermuda shorts and other styles that fall just above the knee look best for this style.

, Mini-skirts do not look conservative enough, and maxi-skirts may look too casual or frumpy. A knee-length skirt works best for the preppy style. You can either opt for a smooth A-line or pencil skirt, or look for a playful pleated skirt, instead.

, A fitted blazer creates a crisp, structured appearance that suits this style well. Throw it over a plain button-down shirt or a floral blouse.

, Avoid heels, which have a tendency to look too sexy for this style. Opt for flats during the warm weather and flat, knee-length riding boots during colder weather.

, Look for simple pieces that have a vintage or timeless look to them. Gravitate toward pearls and diamonds—or fake pearls and fake diamonds—over colored stones, and avoid loud statement pieces.

Focus on good hygiene.,
Wear make-up that looks natural.,
Keep your nails clean and trim.,
Shape your eyebrows.,
Keep your hair clean and tidy.",How to Have a Preppy Floral Style3," Bathe regularly and keep an overall tidy appearance. If you want to carry the floral style into your hygiene routine, use flower-scented shampoos, body lotions, and body washes. A small spritz of a floral perfume may also make a nice accent for special occasions.

,


Smooth out your skin with a sheer foundation that closely matches your skin tone.
Apply a light coating of blush to the apples of your cheeks.
Use eye make-up sparingly. A light coating of a pink or nude eyeshadow is fine, and a clear mascara can lengthen your lashes without weighing them down. Avoid heavy liners and dark mascaras.
Wipe a light pink lip gloss over your lips. Glosses work better than lipsticks, and light pink shades work better than deep reds.

, Avoid long nails and immediately trim away nails that chip or crack. If you want to apply polish, stick with clear or nude colors.

, If you have thick, unruly brows, pluck them down into neat arches. Do not get carried away, though. You should not need to draw any part of your eyebrow in with pencil. If you do, then you may have removed too much.

, Long, straight hair is traditional for most preppy looks, but long, curly hair suits the preppy floral style just as nicely as long as you keep your curls tamed instead of frizzy. Short bobbed styles may also work well.

Don't go shopping where everyone else goes.,
Don't copy one exact style, unless you want to.,
Express yourself!,
Surprise people sometimes if you wish.,
Don't let people tell you what to wear.",How to Dress Like Yourself (Tween Girls)," Try hitting a thrift store instead of Abercrombie, Debenhams or Farmers. Of course if chain stores sell clothes you LOVE, shop in them and wear what you feel comfortable and confident in. Keep in mind there cute things to be found in thrift stores, if you choose to shop in them, you won't have the same clothes as everybody else. Your look will be more individual. You can be your own person and have your own views whatever you wear. You won't stop being yourself if you look just like everyone else, a bit like everyone else, or nothing like everyone else!;
, If you like the skater look and some of the punk clothes catch your eye, combine both looks. You can be emo-goth, preppy-punk, scence-geek, or anything you like. Being yourself and dressing as yourself means loving what you put together for its own sake, not for how anyone else labels it. Don't go fully any one look, unless you want to, wear what you like and don't let it be too showy if you're not comfortable with that. Show off your good features if you are comfortable with that, hide what you feel like keeping to yourself. It's your body and your look.

, You can send a message with your clothes without even opening your mouth. What message do you want people to think of when they see you in your clothes? Do you want your clothes to say you're a beautiful girl who deserves respect? People WILL try to read you through your clothes before they speak to you, so let your clothes be a reflection of your beautiful, true inner self, a girl who's intelligent, has her own idea about what is stylish, and knows her worth.

, Get something new that POPS and is totally YOU! Whether it be bright red leggings under a miniskirt, leg warmers, fingerless gloves, bangle bracelets, a pink baseball cap, or a bright yellow purse or anything else you like, make your outfit totally unique, if you wish.

, Have your own opinions and trust you own ideas. You might totally like bright orange shirts and black jeans together. Trust your fashion sense!

Look at the length.Crop tops include any top that exposes a portion of the midriff, usually the waist or navel.,
Experiment with the hemline.,
Find a flattering fit.,
Consider color and print.Like any other wardrobe piece, crop tops come in a variety of prints and colors.,
Keep it modest.,
Wear the crop top over another shirt.This can be a great way to break into the crop top look.,
Slip on a sweater or jacket.,
Grab something high-waisted.High-waisted bottoms and crop tops work perfectly together.,
Try overall jeans and jumper dresses.,
Balance out the volume.,
Play with color and pattern.,
Keep a conservative hem.,
Cut down on the bloat.Having a bloated belly can make the crop top look less flattering, and even if it doesn't, bloat can reduce your confidence and make it harder to feel comfortable in this daring garment.,
Keep your undergarments hidden.,
Accessorize with a long necklace.,
Groom the exposed skin.,
Stand straight.",How to Wear Crop Tops," Varying the length of the crop top can change the way it makes your body look.


If you have a naturally trim and slim belly, you can probably afford to wear a notably short crop top that stops just below the bra-line.
For curvier bodies, however, crop tops that land at or just above your natural waist typically look best. By showing just a small sliver of skin at the thinnest part of your body, these tops draw attention to the narrow part of your curves and have a slimming effect overall.
If you feel uncomfortable regardless of your body type, you could ease your way into the style by wearing a faux crop top. These tops are just a little shorter than normal, so they'll only show skin when you lift your arms.;
, The cut of the hem can impact the overall look of the crop top, too. Vary the hem to flatter the shape of your body or appease your sense of modesty.


If you have a petite frame, consider choosing a crop top with a lifted center hem and slightly longer sides. A crisscross top would be one example. These tops can make a short torso look longer.
Try a high-low crop top that rises in the front and drapes down further in the back. This can be a good way to ease into the crop top style if you're looking for something a little more modest. Crop tops that tie in the front also have a similar effect.

, Some crop tops are meant to be a little loose while others are supposed to hug your body. Regardless of the cut, though, you need to make sure the crop top fits your body's dimensions.


Tight crop tops can have a sexy, powerful appearance, but they tend to be very unforgiving and will show any bumps or folds along your torso.
Loose crop tops can create a more covered appearance and may also look your middle look slimmer, Note, however, that loose crop tops should be made of structured materials. Flowing, draping materials can look sloppy in crop top form.

, Since this style is already bold, choosing a solid print is usually the easiest way to go.


Neutral solid prints are even better if you want to keep the top looking low-key. The shade will determine where the eye goes, however. For instance, wearing a lighter shade on top can make the upper portion of your body look wider, which can help balance out large hips. On the other hand, wearing a dark shade on top can make the upper body look thinner, which can be great if you tend to be rounded or curvier there.
Prints and bright colors can look amazing on lean or tall figures, but there's probably a great print for every body, so feel free to try on patterns regardless of your figure.

, Exposed midriffs are daring enough on their own. To prevent your outfit from looking too racy, you should choose crop tops that are fairly modest in all other ways.


At minimum, you should avoid backless crop tops and crop tops that show cleavage.
If you want to make the top look even classier, consider choosing one with a collar or a high neckline.
Sleeves can also make a crop top look more modest, and crop tops with sleeves work especially great in the spring and autumn.

, Put a dark crop top on over a lighter colored shirt. In doing so, you still draw attention to your narrow natural waist while gaining modest coverage provided by the undershirt.


This can work especially well if you're busty since the undershirt prevents anything from slipping out of the tiny crop.
Even if you aren't concerned with modesty, this can be a great way to wear your crop top in the spring, autumn, or winter.

, A more conventional cover-up would be a sweater or jacket. Coordinate the tone and color of the jacket with the crop top beneath it to prevent the two pieces from clashing.


In most cases, a structured jacket will look clean and stylish. For a more casual appearance, though, consider wearing a loose yet well-fitting cardigan sweater.

, By choosing bottoms that rise to your navel or just above it, you show a very thin strip of skin along your natural waistline and highlight the thinnest part of your torso.


Choose high-waisted jeans for something casual, high-waisted dress pants for something polished and professional, or high-waisted skirts for something chic and feminine.
High-waisted bottoms are modest and flattering, so they'll work on nearly any figure. If you already have a relatively slim or balanced figure, though, you could likely make the crop top work with mid-rise bottoms, too.

, Wear the overalls or jumper over your crop top. Latch up the front and back, but leave the sides unbuttoned or slightly exposed.


From the front, you won't be able to tell that you're wearing a crop top. The daring hem of your top will only play peek-a-boo from your sides, making this look both modest and playful.
Moreover, wearing crop tops with overalls can update the look and prevent it from appearing too dated or sloppy.

, As a general rule, consider wearing loose, flared bottoms with tight crop tops. Conversely, try wearing fitted or structured bottoms with loose crop tops.


Wearing opposite bottoms will create a more balanced look overall, but matching volumes will often create a less flattering appearance. If you wear a loose top with a large skirt, for instance, you might seem twice as large as you really are. Similarly, if you wear a tight skirt with a tight top, your look may overdose on sex appeal and look somewhat tacky.

, Just like volume, color and print are other aspects you'll need to balance out between top and bottom.


For the most part, avoid mixing patterns, and keep either the top or bottom plain while making the other stand out more. If you're anxious about the boldness of your crop top, wearing a bright skirt or pants with a muted crop top can be a good way to draw the eye beyond your exposed midriff.
One popular trend is to match the pattern of your crop top to the pattern of your bottoms. The pattern should be an exact match, however, and not an estimated match.

, Since crop tops are already provocative, you should stick with appropriate hemlines that won't expose too much along the bottom half of your body.


You can wear shorts and short skirts, but try to stick to the “fingertip rule”—the bottom hem of your skirt or shorts should extend to or beyond your fingertips when your arms are relaxed at your sides.
At the very least, you need to make sure that none of your rear hangs peeks out from beneath the hemline of your skirt or shorts.

,


To help reduce bloat when you want to wear your crop top, drink plenty of water, consume more fiber, and eat foods high in potassium (e.g. avocados, bananas, and spinach). Exercising more and regularly working up a sweat can help reduce bloat in the long-term, as well.

, While this rule does affect the idea of modesty, it's actually more concerned with how polished and fashionable your overall outfit appears. Exposed undergarments have a sloppy appearance at best and a cheap appearance at worst.


If your bra is exposed, your crop top neckline is too low or the hem is too high. Similarly, if your panties are exposed, your bottoms are way too short.
A less obvious concern would be shapewear. Most shapewear extends over the bottom portion of your midriff, which could cross over into the area exposed by your crop top. For that reason, wearing shapewear with your crop top can be very difficult to successfully pull off.

, Consider wearing a long, pendant chain necklace with your crop top. This skinny piece of jewelry can draw the eye down the vertical line of the torso, which can make your torso look longer.


Since crop tops tend to shorten the appearance of your torso, adding a necklace like this can help elongate and balance your torso again while still allowing your narrow waist to peek through.
Other accessories that create vertical lines along the torso, like scarves, can have a similar effect.

, No matter how you wear the crop top, it won't look good unless the newly exposed skin is presentable.


If you have hair along the belly area, wax it off. Shaving can create difficulties since the skin on your stomach is usually sensitive and prone to razor burn.
Regularly moisturize the skin with lotions or creams. Doing so can help it look firm, healthy, and glowing.
Resist the urge to use self-tanner on the exposed skin. You may think that a golden tan will make your belly look slimmer, but unless you tan your entire body, the tone of your tummy can easily become mismatched to your legs, arms, and face, making it look strange and out of place.

, Good posture is important no matter what you wear, but it's especially important when you're wearing something like a crop top. Make a conscious effort to stand and sit up straight as much as possible.


Slouching can create weird rolls in your stomach and sides, which will show thanks to the exposure provided by the crop top. These rolls shouldn't appear as long as your posture remains straight, though.

Have a positive attitude about learning opportunities like kindergarten.,
Foster your child’s independence.,
Encourage interactions with other children.,
Be supportive.,
Discipline your child appropriately.,
Set expectations.,
Try to be a good role model.",How to Prepare Your Child for Kindergarten1," An excitement for school has to be nurtured. Begin to encourage your child to appreciate learning opportunities at an early age. Let your child explore her environment and encourage her to ask questions.


Positivity extends to appreciating and admiring your child’s work, whether that work is a mud cake, a macaroni necklace, or a finger painting. Praise her abilities and creativity in order to inspire her to gain the confidence to try new things.;
, Having a sense of independence will help your child to succeed when she goes off to kindergarten. Teach your child self care skills when she is a toddler. Teach her how to put away her own toys and dress herself. Giving your child the freedom to make decisions for herself, such as what to wear or what she wants for dinner, will encourage her to develop an independent spirit that will serve her well.


When allowing your child to choose things, give her options to choose from, that way you can still be met with the outcome you want, while also giving your child a bit of freedom.

, Support your child in meeting new friends and trusted adults. When she does interact with others, use the interaction to teach your child how to share and discourage bad behaviors like hitting or yelling. Provide your child with the opportunity to have social interactions by:


Taking her to playgrounds where she can meet other children.
Setting up playdates.
Hosting parties for your child where both children and their parents are invited.

, Let your child know that she has your support by encouraging her questions and praising her abilities. Being supportive of your child can help to develop her self confidence so that she can overcome the challenges she will face in kindergarten.


Give your child plenty of hugs and kisses, particularly when she does something well.

, Administering fair discipline will help your child to learn to control herself while also developing a sense of responsibility. Having a structure (including a system of discipline) can help your child to make sense of the world. When disciplining your child, always remember to criticize the bad behavior and not your child (for example, say “I am not angry at you but I am not pleased with the way you have thrown your food all over the floor”.) Even if you are angry, show your child that you still respect her and love her.


Give your child reasons for why you got mad and be prepared to listen to her side of the story. Teach her the proper way to react next time.

, Talk to your child about the expectations that you have for her and her time in kindergarten. You can tell her that you expect her to be a good student, to listen to her teachers, and to be a kind person to her friends. Show your enthusiasm for the new things she is about to learn and experience when outlining these expectations.

, You are the greatest influence on your child’s life. As such, it is important to try to act in the way that you want your child to act. Make sure to keep negative thoughts to yourself. Be a good example by:


Showing respect for others.
Being compassionate.
Showing excitement about learning new things.
Reading and doing creative activities like painting.
Taking care of yourself and your appearance.

Talk with your child all the time.,
Listen when your child wants to express herself.,
Ask questions and answer questions.,
Read with your child everyday.,
Encourage doodling and scribbling.,
Practice counting with your child.,
Take your child on daily adventures.",How to Prepare Your Child for Kindergarten2," Take every opportunity you have to talk with your child and enhance her language skills. Tell her about your plans for the day, ask her questions, and discuss ideas you have with her (even if she doesn’t fully understand them). Be as detailed as possible when talking with her. You can also help her to understand what you are saying by pointing to the things you are talking about. Other ways that you can enhance her language skills include:


Reading books out loud together.
Singing together.
Saying rhymes.

, While it is important that to talk to your child, it is equally important that you listen to her. Encourage her to express her thoughts and feelings. If she’s happy about something, encourage her to talk about what made her happy; if she’s sad, tell her she can talk to you about what made her feel unhappy. Listening to your child helps her to understand that her opinion, thoughts and feelings are important to you and the rest of the family.


In line with this, encourage her to listen to you too when it’s your turn to speak. By doing this, you teach her that listening to others is also important.

, When you constantly ask your child questions, you challenge the way that she thinks. When she is a toddler, begin asking your child the difference between two things, how she felt about an event, or what she thinks about the story you just read. Doing this will help to prepare her for entering kindergarten; when she has practice answering questions, she will be more prepared to answer questions confidently in class.


To this end, you should also answer your child’s question—and there will be many of them. Children are very inquisitive, and answering your child’s questions will help her to gain the confidence she needs to display that inquisitiveness in class. When answering, keep in mind that your answer will be remembered; your answers do not necessarily need to be elaborate, but do take the time to give thoughtful answers.
You can also ask your child what she thinks the answer is, and to explain why she thinks that, before giving your own answer.

, As mentioned above, reading is a very important part of your child being ready for kindergarten. To help prepare her for kindergarten, you can read books about getting ready for school, or about life at school. This reading does not need to be limited to storybooks. It can include:


Magazines
Articles
Anything that you both will find interesting (instructions from a box of pancake, the ingredients of a fruit juice in a carton, signs along the road)

, Drawing, doodling, and scribbling all help your child to hone her motor skills. Encourage drawing and painting on blank sheets of paper to foster creativity, as well as using coloring books to practice coloring ‘inside the lines’.

, Don’t stop your counting practice at 10 or 20 or 30—continue beyond 100 and 1000. Introduce adding and subtracting (which you could also call ‘takeaways’) to her; even simple math problems will help develop problem solving skills.


Help her solve puzzles and gradually let her solve them independently.

, Take your child with you to fun and exciting, as well as regular and mundane, places. At each location, participate in activities that will help her to learn. For example, you could go to the zoo and create a scavenger hunt where she has to find three mammals, three reptiles, three fish, three amphibians, and three birds.


Other ideas include having your child help you add up costs of items at the grocery store.
Take your child to libraries, museums and art galleries.

"
"
Feed your child nutritious meals.,
Help your child exercise regularly.,
Provide your child with medical care.",How to Prepare Your Child for Kindergarten3," Providing your child with healthy food is an essential component of learning effectively in school. Children who go to kindergarten hungry, or who don’t eat the essential food groups, are likely to have a harder time concentrating in class, which makes learning difficult.


Feed your child a well-balanced diet of whole grains, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy. Steer clear of foods with empty calories like candies or chips.
Give your child a healthy, filling breakfast the morning of her first day so that she can focus and have energy until lunch time.

, Give your child opportunities to play and engage in physical activities with other children or by herself. You can help your child to become strong by letting her do activities like:


Skipping, jumping, throwing and catching a ball with a playmate, dancing, swimming (with adult supervision), biking or scootering (also with adult supervision), and hiking.

, You child should have all of her immunizations before she goes off to kindergarten. Some private and public schools even require the child’s “baby booklet” to check which vaccinations your child has gotten. Vaccinations are important because they help your child to develop immunity against a variety of diseases like:


Polio, mumps, rubella (German measles), tuberculosis, HiB virus and diphtheria.
If your child is missing shots, contact your pediatrician right away.

Get a headwrap.,
Tie your hair into a top knot.,
Place the wrap at the back of your head.,
Tie the wrap into a knot.,
Turn the end into bow flaps.",How to Wear a Head Wrap1," You can use a wrap or a scarf. A long, rectangular scarf is the best kind to use for this style. 55 inches long and ten inches wide is a standard size for a scarf. Some of the best materials to use are jersey, chiffon, and viscose. Silk looks nice, but it may not hold as well.They can be purchased at department stores, vintage shops, and at stores that specialize in headwraps., This look works best if you tie your hair in a top knot because the wrap needs to be tied tightly and loose hair will not fit well under the wrap. You do not need to do anything if your hair is already short., Put the center of the wrap at the back of your head. The two ends should be extended past your face. The wrap should cover the entire back of your head. It should not be folded., Use the two ends to tie a knot. The knot should be tied just above the center of your hairline. Once you have tied the knot, pull the ends to make sure it is secure., At this point, the ends should be hanging down on either side of the knot. Fold the fabric until you create an oversized bow with a bow flap on each side. Once you are satisfied with the bow, tuck the end into the bow flaps to complete the look."
"
Put your hair into a high bun or afro puff.,
Fold the headwrap in half.,
Tie the wrap into a double-knot.,
Slide the fabric back.",How to Wear a Head Wrap2," This look can be used purely for style, or it can be used to keep your hair out of your face. Either way, it is better to start with your hair in a style that is already pulled back. You can put it in a high bun, ponytail, afro puff, or if it’s short, leave it as is., Start by folding the wrap in half widthwise. Once you have folded it, place it at the back of your head. It should cover the entire back of the head. The ends should be extending out toward your face.Folding may not be necessary if you’re starting out with a wrap or scarf that is not wide.

, Pull the ends together by holding the middle of each end together with one hand. Then, tie a double-knot at the center. A double-knot means that you reinforce the first knot with a second tying. This ensures that the knot will stay secure throughout the duration of the time you wear it, and it is for aesthetic purposes as well., Once you’ve tied the knot, tuck the ends of the wrap or scarf into the fabric around the nape of your neck. Next, slide the fabric back into a place that you would normally wear a headband. Place it wherever feels most comfortable for you."
"
Use a long rectangular scarf.,
Put the scarf at back of your neck.,
Bring the ends forward.,
Continue to twist.",How to Wear a Head Wrap3," A long rectangular scarf is ideal for this style because you will need plenty of fabric to create the look. If you’re unsure that the scarf is big enough, you can test it by wrapping it around your head and seeing how much fabric is leftover. There should be enough fabric leftover to twist and wrap around your head., Center the scarf at the nape of your neck so that the ends hang down evenly. The scarf should not be folded. The scarf should be covering most of your head and hair, except part of the very front of your hair., Take the ends in your hands and hold them out straight in front of you. Begin twisting the ends together as if you were twisting a towel. Start by twisting the ends directly in front of you. Once you have twisted enough, begin bringing the twist around the middle of the crown of your head.

, Continue twisting until you have very little fabric left to twist. The twisting should end around the front of your head. Then, tuck the ends into the area where you first started to twist."

If you decide to be in a relationship, the person doesn't have to be cute or hot, but he or she must be nice to you and treat you right.",How to Be Cute at School (Girls)," Do not do it because you consider it is necessary to fit in at school or to be popular or accepted by people who appear to be popular. Being popular isn't the be all and end all of life, and trying to be cute when it isn't really you is self-deception and you'll just feel very uncomfortable in your own skin. The only good reason to try the cute look is because you really identify with it as part of your own personality.;
, Regardless of your appearance, having confidence in your own abilities and having a sense of self-worth is an important part of being a happy and fulfilled person. Being cute isn't just about having a sweet appearance; it's also about feeling good about yourself so that you feel confident in front of other people and don't gain insecurities or need to chase other people's approval.

, Start by knowing what a bad attitude is. It is feeling less than others around you and turning that into gossiping, spreading rumors and dissing them. None of these things will help you to feel any better and they'll gain you a reputation for being unfriendly and insecure. A cute girl is cute because her attitude radiates friendliness, kindness and acceptance of self and others. Aim for that to be your attitude too.

, Don't change for some guy or girl. When you're sad, at least try to smile. Be there for your friends and they will be there for you.

, If you have a uniform then look around the school and find hints of the style, either it's folding your shorts up or tucking your shirt in your school pants, give it a try. If you have no uniforms get some cute jeans and some cute shirts. Even apply some makeup if you want. You will look very cute and the makeup will highlight your beautiful face


You don't have to look or dress inappropriately to look pretty, you're already beautiful!

, Some ideas for hairstyles include:

Curled or straightened ponytail
Side fishtail braid
Two Dutch or French braids
A single Dutch or French braid
Space buns
Half up half down (curly or straight)
Down and straight
Down and curly
Try not to have frizzy, puffy or messy hair.
Choose hairstyles that match your face. Everyone is different.

, But remember, always stick it the school rules.

, Whatever looks cute. Now with your bag, get a cute bag that is big enough for a lot of books. You can make your bag and pencil case look cute on the outside by decorating it, put some key chains on the zippers or write on it with cute quotes and song lyrics. Now your locker, decorate it with pictures of your friends and some cute wrapping paper or anything you want. But make sure it's tidy.

, Be polite to everyone, and show a pleasant attitude to everyone.


Be helpful to everyone and share things. Never be rude deliberately.

, Stuff all of the mean girls and get with your girls and have a place in the school where you meet every lunch time and hang out there. Even give your group a name if you want, for more fun.

, Sure, being cute is a lot of fun, but don't forget school. Do your homework, be organized, get to class on time, study for exams, catch up for days you were away, but most importantly, try your hardest on your schoolwork.

, Being social is cute so meet new people, hang out with your new friends, but don't forget your old friends. Go to discos with yours girlfriends and dress up and have fun. Go shopping every two weeks with your girls, watch a movie or even have a sleepover. And most importantly, be friendly and nice to everyone, because if you be mean it will ruin your look.

, There are some rules to dating when being a cute chick. You must never let a person touch you anywhere that makes you feel uncomfortable. In public you can flirt and hold hands and kiss your partner on the cheek or lips, but no more than that (Save the rest for when you are alone). Also remember, when you're dating someone, don't forget your friends or leave them behind! Balance the time you spend with your partner and your other friends.

Use a quality facial wash and toner.,
Avoid picking any acne or blemishes.,

Lastly the coat.",How to Dress for School Gossip Girl Style," Forget about pants, go with a skirt. If your school has a uniform skirt: use that, but if not, use a high wasted skirt preferably pleated or gathered in navy or black. Plaid skirts can also work to.;
, A plain white long sleeved shirt will always work, but you can also try ruffle fronted blouses or shirts with a lacy collar. Have your top tucked into your skirt for that pristine refined look.

, Stockings suit the look the best but they can be quite uncomfortable in the warmer months. In warmer months instead of tights or stockings wear short socks with heels or none at all with flats. In the colder months, wear colourful stockings especially if the rest of your outfit is all in navy and black. Popular colours of stockings in gossip girl are blue, red, white, navy and black. Thigh-high socks are also essential especially if you want more of a 'Serena' look. Also try out knee high argyle socks.

, If your uniform requires black lace up shoes, so be it. But if they require just black go for more impractical school shoes like ballet flats, kitten heels or ankle boots. If your school has no requirement for shoes at all, suitable shoes would be ballet flats in black, grey, navy or red and peep toe heels in bright pops of colour or a plain navy or black. Boots in the winter also work.

, This could be a classic style sweater over your shirt or a piped blazer with a crest. If you have a uniform usually you would be wearing your school blazer so stick with that. For a more casual or 'Serena' look wear a vest jacket. Vest jackets look good in a simple cloth, knit or even a fur trim. Be careful with the fur trim as you don't want to look tacky but some of the girls seem to pull it off.

, A belt in red, bright blue, glossy black or even green and yellow around the top of your skirt makes the outfit look great. The thicker the belt the better. Look out for belts with little bows on them or a distinct buckle.

, All the girls in gossip girl have some form of a necktie. Wear this in a coordinating colour to your skirt.

, Wear multiple necklaces. For example one or two simple silver chains with a pendant and a long strand of pearls or maybe a pearl choker with a long gold chain with a flower on the end. Stick to either a silver or gold scheme because mixing both can be risky. Wear pearl bracelets and whatever signature pieces you want to add. Have a regular ring you wear everyday. Plain diamond-style studs or pearl drop earrings are the way to go.

, A headband is a must. Coordinate it with your outfit if possible. White, Red, Navy, Yellow, Pink, Green, Purple and more all look good. For a distinct 'Blair' look wear a headband with a bow on it and try different styles etc pearls, buckles, plaid.

, A nice top handled bag that you can carry on your arm completes the look. The bigger the better. Navy, Black, Grey, Red, Beige and bolder colours like purple, yellow and green are all suitable.

, Waistcoats, peacoats, trench coats you see it all. Opt for nice coats preferably which have a pleated back and that are belted in classic colours but also bright colours such as purple and blue.

That’s all part of being a pretty boy! . Get haircuts regularly and shave. Buy skin cream and moisturize. Just do everything you can to keep up your clean cut appearance.;
, This part is crucial. Outfit yourself with the best brand name fumes you can buy, such as Pony by Ralph Lauren or anything from the Axe line. Try to pick out the good ones, not the cheap stuff. You don’t want to come off looking stingy, because that doesn’t play in well to the pretty boy swag. Remember, its important for it to look like you really care about your appearance if you want to have pretty boy swag.

, You need name brand stuff. Everyone has his or her own style of dressing, but you should make sure that the clothes you wear are popular to some degree. You don’t want to copy others, but you want to look like you know what’s going on in the fashion world. You should dress a little more fancy that everyone else does if possible.

, Wear clothes that go together like red and white, black and white, blue and black, black and yellow and black and red. It’s important that you always look good and that you care about your appearance. Never go out with a shirt that hasn’t been ironed. This would be fatal.

, Get a black or gold watch that is noticeable and stands out. This has the dual benefit of showing people that you care about the way you look, and that you are willing to spend money on it. This is like a more visible form of cologne. It marks you as a pretty boy.

Buy classic pieces.,

Purchase clothes that you can mix and match.,
Consider your body when picking out your clothes.,
Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn.,
Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes.,
Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron.",How to Dress Nice Every Day (for Girls)1," To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories.


Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.;
, To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don’t normally wear, or patterns that pop.


For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.

, When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday.


While you most likely can’t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.

, Certain clothes have cuts that look differently on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their own idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:


If you have a ‘Pear’ shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist., Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn out clothing does not necessary look very classy—unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans.


If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.

, Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don’t like a color or don’t feel like it looks good on you, don’t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing yourself in things that make you confident and happy; if a color matches your skin tone, but you don’t like it anyway, don’t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:


Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens.
Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange.
Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples.
Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds.
Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.

, Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not sure how to iron your clothes, click here.


You can also try steam pressing your clothes.

Need to get that body in shape for the summer.,
Do you have a shy, or rude personality?,
Rude personality:

,
Nobody likes a rude mean girl in high school.,
Shy personality:

,
We all are shy sometimes, whether it's around boys or people.,
Shyness is cute for boys, but if you are too shy to make a move they will lose interest in you.,
SHOPPING TIME!!!,
This is every girls favorite part, shopping.,Makeup is your best friend

,
Makeup would help you, and help your confidence.,Stay true to yourself

,
Even though you wanted to give yourself a major makeover, do not go overboard and lose who you really are.",How to Give Yourself a Summer Makeover for Your Freshman Year (Girls Only)," Go to a doctor, use acne creams and never forget to wash your face!;
, Eats lots of healthy fruits and vegetables, because it would help you in a long run with your body fat or acne. Drink lots of water as well. People say to drink at least 8 glasses of water, but some people are starting to think it depends on the person's body. So start eating healthy, and drinking some water it would do you some good to help.

, So take them vitamins as well.

, It done some good for others and it would probably do well for you. If your acne is cause by stress then you need to go to a spa, and take a chill pill. Relax your worries away. Don't fret over it.

, Wash your face 1-2 times a day. The reason I said 1 as well because some people's faces doesn't need to be washed that much. Use a cleanser that is good for your skin, and doesn't irritate it as much. I am not going to lie every cleanser is going to dry your face out without you having a moisturizer without oil in it. I would know because I tried basically every acne product for my face, and they didn't work. The only one that worked was Neutrogena the one product I am trying now. I recommend Neutrogena oil-free acne face wash, and I use a moisturizer named Aveeno that is an oatmeal moisturizer. It done wonders for me, and now my acne is almost gone. To open your pores use a hot washcloth put it on your face till it cools off.

, The dermatologist is your best bet if you have terrible acne, but don't go to a dermatologist if you have little acne cause that's plain stupid. Unless your acne is bad or stubborn then I would recommend the dermatologist or doctor, but you can go to the dermatologist because they know more about the skin.

,, Nothing wrong with that. However getting your hair to grow is just as easy getting rid of acne.

, It get rid of the split ends that won't let your hair grow out. Wash your hair and massage the scalp with some conditioner and shampoo. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is healthy and can make your hair grow good and strong.

, If not, too bad because eating lots of fish can make your hair grow faster. If you still going like "" Oh gosh no I am not eating fish "" Then eat some veggies and fruits then. Also take biotin, because I heard it's good for making your hair grow faster. Make sure to get some vitamins with Zinc and Vitamin E in it. It will help you.

,, Goggle in the morning and night as well. Use a toothpaste that whitenings teeth. I have yellow teeth as well, because of my cavities(don't worry I am going to the dentist in 3 days) It's not good having yellow teeth, it makes yourself look unhealthy. I am trying this toothpaste called 3D crest whitening and it's awesome. My teeth is getting whiter than I am having now. Which I awesome and I love it <3

, Stay strong. You can cut back on sweets. Having candy 1 time every week or two. Your choice.

,, Nothing with getting enough sleep wouldn't hurt. Having a cucumber mask or avocado mask gets rid of dark circles. Putting cucumbers on your eyes would help as well which is awesome. Or freezing a spoon in the freezer and putting it to your dark circles 1-2 minutes I heard. So get enough sleep girls.

,, Reason you have to wash your vagina is because that some girls have skirts and they open there legs, and lets say it smells fishy and dirty.

,, If you are going to use soap use dove, because your vagina is gentle and your friend. Or use a vagina wash, but I wouldn't use a vagina wash anyway. DO NOT DOUCHE YOUR VAGINA IT'S BAD FOR IT!

,, I personally would trim your pubic hair ladies, because hair is there for a reason to protect you from the bacteria. No guy likes a hairy girl don't have legs on them hair like you are some ape shave it or get it wax. As for armpits I would just shave it. Some girls have problem with upper lips hair, but most girls I see doesn't have the problem and doesn't seem noticeable but if you see it then it's best to wax it.

,, anyway I would get them arch somewhere near your spa or hair salon if they do it.

,, Plus you get made fun of. Don't know why you get made fun of just happens. Use some chapstick for a while and some moisture for your lips or something. Vasaline helps as well.

,, Lose a couple of pounds or trying to get a figure. Then you know well what you have to do. RUN! Everyday. You can walk, run, or jog. I don't care as long you are exercising. Go to a gym every day a week. Don't strain yourself though. Eat healthy and drink water. Go get some of those special K cereal that helps you lose weight. Basically exercise, eat healthy, and stay active.

, Then get over it.

,, Neither would I as well. If you have a rude personality then you need to fix it quick, because if you don't then you would end up all alone with no friends in high school. To all you rude people get over yourself and stop it. Cause boys and teachers or anyone don't want to tolerate you.

,, We don't know what to say. I would suggest going to the mall or park meet someone. Or go to a summer camp you would make new friends there :)

, Some of them would still go for you who knows. Depends on the boy.

, FOR CLOTHES,HANDBAGS,etc.!On a budget?

, I personally love shopping a lot, and if I had a lot of money no doubt I would spend it on myself and new clothes. Though what happens when you are going shopping on a budget because of your parents? Well tough luck getting them to buy you a lot because it's not going to be easy. The best thing to do is get a summer job or win some lottery somehow to buy your own clothes. So make sure you go to them sales and get the cheapest stuff you can find that still looks fashionable.

,, Buy some makeup, and make sure you buy the ones that won't clog your pores. I recommend Neutrogena cosmetics even though they are expensive still worth it, because your pores won't be clog. They even have makeup that clears your skin!

,, Plus, school is for learning after all not a fashion or popularity contest. Just be yourself and you'll be fine. :)

Keep going around all of your head.,
Go to bed at the desired time leaving the braids in.",How to Achieve the Perfect Crimp," Towel dry your hair just a little, but it still needs to be wet! Do this at night.;
, Use a wide-toothed comb to get out all of the tangles. Do not use a brush, as it damages wet hair.

, Take a small section from either side of your head, and clip the rest back with a large clip. If it is easier for you, use a rat tail comb to section your hair.

, Braid your hair into small, normal braids, starting from as high on the roots as you can get. Once you have finished the braid, tie it off with a small elastic.

, Once you have finished a section, unclip hair and section again. Continue braiding your hair until you have made all of your braids.

Don't spend hours on the computer or phone. If you have late TV shows that you just need to watch, tape it and hit the sack. Not only will you feel better, you'll get rid of those dark circles under your eyes. Keep all your electronics away from your bed, this may help you to get a more peaceful sleep.;
, Yes, even on Saturdays and Sundays, because your body will have a good rhythm and know when to wake up. Your body needs time to naturally adjust to the time so that you will arise; thus if you wake up at the same time everyday, you won't feel tired. That's why you need at least 2 weeks in the summer to get used to waking up early for school.

,, An alarm clock is key to waking up at the same time and establishing a healthy regime. Don't get an alarm clock that beeps like crazy and is bound to drive you insane in the morning. If your alarm clock irritates you in the morning, you will have a bad start to the day. Getting a radio alarm clock is usually the best solution. You’ll be awakened by the sound of your favorite station and you can feel free to listen to some tunes before making the decision to get out of bed. However, a regular alarm clock with an ordinary alarm will work just fine if you find yourself falling asleep rather than waking up to your favorite tunes. Place your alarm clock somewhere out of reach so you’ll have to get up to stop the alarm rather than rolling over and pressing the snooze button.


If you don't have a radio alarm clock, keep your iPod and a set of speakers ready for you to turn on and jam out while getting ready. But don't turn up the music too loud! It will damage your ears.

, A shower wakes you up and maintains good hygiene, so you can go to school looking and feeling great. If you don't have enough time or don't want to take a shower in the morning, it's best to splash your face with ice cold water to wake yourself up. You can also take a shower at night and wash up in the morning for great hygiene.

, Breakfast is the main source of energy for the whole day and the most important meal of the day. Eating a nutritious breakfast is essential for a healthy, balanced diet. Studies show that eating breakfast prepares you for the day ahead both mentally and physically. Eating breakfast first thing in the morning helps to stabilize blood sugar levels, which control appetite and energy. Skipping breakfast can lead to tiredness, fainting spells, lack of concentration and poor performance at school, college, university or work. It also means that you are more likely to snack on unhealthy foods such as chips or cookies before lunch. If you're unable to eat breakfast in the morning make sure you have a nutritious, energy bar on the way to school or prepare it before you go to sleep.

, Brushing your teeth prevents cavities and bad breath. Use a mint toothpaste for a fresh-feeling mouth, and rinse afterwards. Brush your teeth every morning.

Swag-o-meter.,
Try to have confidence.,
Adopt your own kind of swag.,
Consider what type of person you want to be.",How to Turn on Your Pretty Boy Swag2," The swag-o-meter is probably the most important part in the entire pretty boy swag set up. A swag-o-meter is a mental bar which tells you how high your pretty boy swag is. The higher, the better. Keep up your swag-o-meter by competing against other pretty boys in sporting events, for girls, or anything else you can think of. This is like a very public form of confidence.

, Even if you’re trying something new or different, be super confident about it. Strut your stuff to the world and own whatever it is that you’re doing at all times . Be confident in the things that you like and other people won’t see anything wrong with it. Trying to hide things or feeling self conscious about the stuff you do isn’t a part of having swag. You should just assume that everything you do is great. It’s a wonderful way to live your life.

, Don’t just copy everyone else. Put your own personal flair on things. Swag is about looking unique and confident, rolling around with a sort of easy confidence. It's a lot harder to stand out if you’re just trying to look like everyone else. Put your own flavor on it.

, Having pretty boy swag doesn't mean you have to be self centered or act like a womanizer. Just be confident and happy with your style and be kind to other people!

Learn how to dance.,
Start working out.,
Pick up a sport!",How to Turn on Your Pretty Boy Swag3," If you can't dance, you can't attract the ladies, and if you can't attract the ladies, you have no ""pretty boy swag"". Try watching videos online of hip-hop or rap dances and imitate them. Alternatively, you could take dance classes at your local dance studio, or have a fellow dancer teach you. This might sound intimidating but you’ve got to be able to dance and you could meet a lot of girls in the process of learning. Just remember to keep that confidence high at all times.

, Prettiness defines the ""pretty boy swag"". You can raise your prettiness by pumping the iron and getting in great shape. Try working out 3-4 times a week. Be sure not to tire your muscles or lose focus on your goal. You’re going to have to work out a lot. You also don’t want to be so overly muscular that you look intimidating. Part of being a pretty boy is that you have a good body but you also look refined and ‘pretty’. Don’t take this too far, just stay in good shape.

, Playing a sport is super hot, but some sports are better than others. This is definitely a part of being a pretty boy, because you have to show some talent in order to back up your swag. Basketball, baseball, football, and hockey are all sports that will get you the attention that you want so, so, so badly. Don’t run cross-country or play ultimate Frisbee if you want to have pretty boy swag. You never hear about the cross-country runner getting the homecoming queen.

Plan your outfits.,
Consider the occasion you are dressing for.,
Wear clothing that makes you feel confident.,
Try to avoid combining patterns.,
Consider using the rule of three.,
Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week.,
Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week.,
Create an emergency outfit.",How to Dress Nice Every Day (for Girls)2," One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week’s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear.


Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.

, When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you’re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you’re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with may be the way to go.


If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don’t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.

, When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost.


Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.

, While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy.


For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.

, If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the ‘rule of three’ can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color.


Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.

, While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that really dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to really come up with this eye-catching ensemble.

, While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won’t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit.


By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice in a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.

, Some days, you might find that you just don’t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, its important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you’ll be good to go.

Pick out some shoes that will look classy.,
Wear shoes that would for the occasion.,
Keep your shoes looking brand new.,
Try out different kinds of jewelry.,
Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing.,
Try out different kinds of accessories.,
Create your own ‘golden rule’.",How to Dress Nice Every Day (for Girls)3," If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses.


Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it’s important to be able to walk in them.

, As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.

, If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well—from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:


Shine shoes
Polish shoes
Wash shoes

, Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding.


However, try not to over accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.

, Jewelry can draw a person’s eye, which can be both a great thing, and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together.


However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.

, Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can really spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.

, The ‘golden rule’ refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit.


Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn’t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.

This can help you feel better about yourself, and feeling at ease when naked can help you look and feel better. Try to seek out positive people on your quest to look good naked.You are likely bombarded every day with negativity in regards to your body. A lot of media is centered around how and why you need to change your body. To drown out this pressure, hang out with people who are genuinely positive. Seek out friends, family members, and co-workers who have high self-esteem and are encouraging and appreciative of others.
Avoid people who bring you down. You may want to skip out on getting cocktails with your friend who is always dieting. Negativity is contagious. If your friend feels bad about her body, you may become more critical of yourself.;
, It can help to learn how to appreciate all types of different bodies. You will come to see things like confidence and personality can make someone sexy just as much as natural good looks. Look for positive female role models who embrace their bodies.Seek out celebrities and women you know who are accepting of their bodies. For example, maybe your Aunt Joan is comfortable with her aging body, and does not worry about developing wrinkles. Maybe there's a plus-size model you love who encourages women to appreciate bodies of all shapes and sizes.
Have body positive role models can help you see the connection between one's mind and body.

, So you wanna look as sun-kissed as possible, and you do it by keeping your make-up natural. Start with moisturizing your skin in the morning, and then put on very little concealer that matches your skin tone. Also, make sure your blush is light and blended in with your skin. Put a maybe light color eyeshadow on your eyelids that match the color of your eyes. Remember:

,,,, Lucky!

,, Now when it comes to lips, you wanna have a cute color, and not a fierce red. Go for peach or rosy lip gloss.

, This is a part that is often forgotten. You need at least two coats of waterproof mascara if you are planning to swim. Do it from root to top, and while applying it, do it in a zigzag way, since this will make it look fuller and longer.

, I personally would advise a strapless if you wear strapless bikini's, or else you can see the non - tanned stripes, which looks kind of not done. Button ups are cute, and so are spaghetti tops.

, Okay, so you don't want to go to the beach with skinny jeans, because A: they are a Don't on the beach, and B: they are very hard to get the sand out off. So don't wear them. Wear short boyfriend jeans or a cute white skirt. For a real beach outfit, I would wear a red strapless top with a short white skirt and sandals. Wear some hoops, but don't make the jewelry to overdone.

, Or lets just say sandals or flip flops. Never wear heels in the sand. Never, ever do that. You will not be able to walk, and it isn't sexy to see you trying to go forward with a red head.

, What works for your best friend or sister may not work for you. Take a look at your skin. If you skin looks oily, then get a facial cleanser that says ""For Oily Skin"" on it. If you have dry skin, look for something that says ""Moisturizing"" or ""For Dry Skin"" on it. Remember, you can always visit a makeup counter and ask the sales person there to help you find out what type of skin you have.


Your skin type may change depending on the time of year and the time of the month. Many girls find that their skin gets really dry during the winter season, and more oily while they are on their period.
Consider a cleaner that has salicylic acid in it if you have oily or combination skin. It's great for managing acne too!, Toner is important, because it helps seal your pores and restore your skin's pH. Moisturizer is important, because it helps make your skin soft and smooth. It also helps prevent your skin from looking flaky when you put makeup on! Use a lighter moisturizer with SPF in the morning, and a heavier one in the evening.You may have to change the type of moisturizer you use throughout the year. For example, you might want to use a heavier one in the winter, and a lighter one in the evening.
Even oily skin types can benefit from moisturizer! Choose a lightweight, gel-based moisturizer intended for oily skin. If you have sensitive skin, try one without any added fragrances., A lot of people love that sun-kissed glow and tanned skin, and for good reason: it makes you look healthy! Too much sunlight, however, can damage your skin and lead to wrinkles and skin cancer. This does not mean that you have to avoid sunlight like a vampire, however. Simply put on sunscreen that has at least 30 SPF on it every day before you go out, and try to limit your sunbathing.


You can always add a healthy glow to your skin with bronzer.
Many moisturizers and liquid foundations contain sunscreen. Consider getting one for the summer.
Try to avoid the sun between 10am and 2pm, as this is when the sun's rays are at their strongest and most damaging. If you must step out for long periods of time, put on some sunscreen or at least a long-sleeved shirt!, It can also help you feel good about yourself. It can, however, clog your pores and potentially lead to acne. If you wear makeup on a daily basis, try to go makeup free every so often to give you skin a change to breathe.

, If you notice your skin looking dull and grey, it is time to whip out that loofah or scrubby. Get into the shower, and gently buff your face, neck, arms, and legs. This will scrub away the old, dead skin cells, and reveal the healthy, soft, glowing skin underneath.

, They not only smell great, but they are great for your skin! Scrubs can be used on your face, arms, and legs to exfoliate away dead skin cells. Body butters can be used all over your body just after a shower to lock in moisture. This will help your skin feel soft and smooth.


Avoid using body butters on your face. Use facial moisturizing creams instead.

, Looks are a big part of being beautiful, but smell also plays a big part too! Be sure to wear deodorant (you may have to reapply it throughout the day). You can wear some perfume or body spray, but don't overdo it. Too much of a good thing can quickly become a bad thing!


Oftentimes, the body washes, shampoos, and lotions that you use are more than enough to keep you smelling great!

, If you cannot afford to go to a dermatologist, look for products that contain benzoyl peroxide. Use these products sparingly at night before you go to bed. Focus on your forehead, chin, nose, and cheeks—all areas that tend to get breakouts. Don't just spot-treat pimples as they come up. You will need to use the product for at least a month before you start to see the results you want."

Have a good personal hygiene routine.,
Hair is one of the most important parts of looking good.,
Learn how to style your hair correctly.,
Have clear skin.,
Wear makeup.,
Have good nails.,
Dress fashionably.,
Put together some outfits that you can always wear on days when you don't know what to wear!,
Keep a healthy diet.,
Exercise.,
Be confident!,
Remember, be beautiful on the inside too!",How to Look Better Than Everyone Else in Your Class (Girls)," Shower every day or every other day. Wash and condition your hair as much as needed to keep it from getting oily. Brush your teeth after every meal, and wash your face twice a day. Shave your legs and underarms too.;
, If your hair doesn't look good, it will take away from the rest of your appearance. Try to decide on a signature style, whether it's pin straight and neat, curly and slightly tousled, or somewhere in the middle. Try to have your hair look the same most days, but mix it up every once in a while, like you could try out a different style for only one day every week or so.

, If you don't know how to achieve a certain style, ask a friend who knows how or look at some online videos before just wearing your style out and about. Use hair product if needed to add volume, shine, and softness and decrease frizz and breakage.

, This is essential. Drink plenty of water! It's hard to drink that recommended 8 glasses of water a day, and not many people do, but try to make a smaller goal. Even 4 or 5 glasses of water, and you will see the difference! Wash your face twice daily with a skin cleanser that works for you. If you have bad acne, get a face wash to treat it or visit a dermatologist , if you have dry skin, get a moisturizing face cleanser, etc.

, Makeup is supposed to accentuate your natural features, not cover them completely. Good makeup for school might be concealer to cover up blemishes and dark circles, a bit of shimmery eyeshadow to highlight the eyes, some mascara, light blush, and lip gloss. Also, mix it up. Don't wear exactly the same makeup everyday, try changing the color of your lip gloss, or line your eyes one day. Get good quality makeup so that it will look good and won't go bad as quickly.

, Trim your fingernails, so they are at a length that you like. Try to keep them relatively long, but not so long that you are hurting people with your fingers or having difficulties picking up things or writing. Paint them, even if they're clear, to give them extra shine, and take care of your toenails, too.  

, Fashionable doesn't necessarily mean expensive, there are a ton of cheap trendy clothes for much less than higher priced places.

, Some things that are in right now are boho dresses, strapless floral print dresses, and floral tops! Also skinny jeans with cute flats or gladiators with gems!

, Eat plenty of whole grains, fruits and vegetables and protein. Choose to eat healthy food over junk food as much as possible. Avoiding junk food will also improve the quality of your skin and hair as well. If you really think you are overweight or underweight, ask your doctor. They will be able to tell you if you are in a healthy weight range or not.

, Not only does this make your body look better, it induces endorphins, which can make hair grow faster and gives your skin an overall glow. Exercise based on the results you want. If you want more muscles, do strength training. If you want to lose some weight, do some form of exercise. There are many ways to exercise, whether you are out home, at the gym, or running in your neighborhood. Find which way works best for you.

, Remember, a smile is everything!

, Be nice and sweet to everyone. Be polite.

Wash your hair, but not every day.,
Wash your hair properly.,
Comb your hair properly to prevent frizz and snags.,
Skip the daily heat styling, and use a good heat protectant when you do.,
Try to go natural when choosing shampoos and conditioners.,
Try a vinegar rinse.,
Try a hair mask if you have dry or damaged hair.,
Take advantage of your hair's natural texture.",How to Look Beautiful As a Teenage Girl2," It may sound gross, but washing you hair every 2 to 3 days (instead of every day) actually leads to healthier hair! If you wash your hair every day, you will strip it of its healthy oils. This results in hair that looks dry, brittle, and ratty.If your hair tends to look oily, consider wearing it in a braid, ponytail, or bun on the second or third day.


If you exercise a lot, have fine hair, or have oily hair, then you may need to wash your hair every day or every other day.Consider using a gentle shampoo and conditioner in these cases.

, Focus the shampoo on your scalp and the top to middle of your hair. Gently massage it into your scalp using your fingertips—never ""scratch"" your scalp with your nails. After rinsing the shampoo out, apply the conditioner, focusing it on the ends of your hair. This will keep your hair from turning dry and your scalp from becoming oily.


Use the right type of shampoo and conditioner for your hair. Again, not everything that works for your friend may work for you.

, Don't comb your hair straight down from the roots to the ends at first. This can make your hair snap and break. Instead, work in small sections, starting from the ends of your hair. Once the rest of your hair is smooth, only then can you run the brush from roots to ends.

, Not only can daily straightening or curling look boring after a while, but it can do a lot of damage to your hair. When you do heat style your hair (ie: straightening or curling), apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair. This protects your hair from getting burnt and prevents it from looking dry.


Having a bad hair day with unmanageable frizz? Try braids. They are much gentler on your hair than straightening, and take much less time to do!

, Stay away from products that contain silicones and sulfates. Silicones are great at making your hair appear sleek, smooth, and shiny, but they can cause build-up over time, which results in dull, lank, and limp hair. They can only be removed with sulfates, which are harsh cleaning agents that make your hair appear dull and dry., It may sound gross, but the soft hair you'll get afterwards is well worth it! Vinegar cleans out any buildup in your hair as well as restores its natural pH. The result is soft, shiny, smooth hair. Mix ½ to 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, then pour it over your hair towards the end of your shower. Tilt your head back and close your eyes so that you don't get any in your eyes. Follow up with a cool water rinse to close the cuticles and maximize shine., Hair masks are like rich conditioners that help soften, hydrate, and moisturize your hair. Each brand varies, but you generally apply them after shampooing your hair, then leave them on (preferably under a shower cap) for 10 to 15 minutes. After that, you rinse them out; you don't have to use conditioner!

, It is much easier to embrace your hair than to fight against it. Visit a hair stylist, and ask him or her to help you choose a hairstyle that suits your face shape and hair texture.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat well and eat healthy.,
Exercise to stay fit and lift your mood.,
Get 8½ to 9½ hours of sleep enough night.,
Try to feel good about yourself.",How to Look Beautiful As a Teenage Girl3," Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses (8 ounces/240 milliliters each) every day. This will cleanse out any impurities in your skin, and give it a healthy glow. It also helps keep off water weight, which is caused when your body becomes dehydrated and stores extra water.

, Skipping meals is one of the worst things you can do to yourself, and it can actually cause you to gain weight, because your body enters starvation mode. You should eat 3 full meals each day, and 2 to 3 snacks in between. Be sure to eat a well-balanced diet, filled with healthy grains, lean meats, and lots of fruits and vegetables.


If you are vegetarian, you can get protein through eggs, dairy products, beans, and nuts. If you are vegan, you can get protein through beans, nuts, and soy products. Do try to consume some meat, egg, or dairy every once in a while, however; your body is still developing!

, This does not mean that you have to hit the gym and start weightlifting. Even a simple 30 minute walk each day can help keep you in shape. Not only will you be keeping fit, but you will be relaxing your mind. You may even find yourself feeling a little less stressed afterwards!If walking doesn't suit you, try doing something active that you enjoy, such as: jazz dance, ballet, sports, martial arts, jogging, or even yoga.If you are trying to lose weight, be patient, and try not to worry. Many girls find that their weight fluctuates during puberty. Weight loss also takes time.

, That may sound like a lot, but it is important. There's a reason it's called ""beauty sleep"" after all! Not getting enough sleep causes more than just bags under your eyes. It can also lead to things like mood swings, depression, or anxiety. It can also make your skin look dull and your weight to increase., Many girls think that they are ugly, but they are actually very pretty! If you feel ashamed and insecure about your appearance, take a look in the mirror, and try to find at least one aspect of yourself that you like. It does not have to be big, it can be very simple, such as the shape of your nose, your freckles, or the color of your eye. Look in the mirror each day, and compliment yourself. By boosting your self-esteem, you may eventually stop seeing your flaws, and start seeing the true beauty that you actually are!


A positive attitude will allow you to see the good things about yourself. A negative attitude only allows you to see your flaws.

Understand that you don't need to wear makeup to look beautiful.,
Consider keeping your makeup simple.,
Try concealer if you have pimples or dark, under eye shadows.Concealer is not mandatory, but it can help you feel better about yourself if you feel self-conscious about things like pimples and under eye shadows.

,
Take care of your hands.,
Shave or wax your body hair away.",How to Look Beautiful As a Teenage Girl4," You should only wear makeup for your own enjoyment, and never because someone tells you to. If wearing makeup makes your feel good about yourself, then go for it! But if people are trying to pressure you into wearing makeup, and you really don't want to—ignore them and be yourself!

, Wearing more makeup won't make you look more beautiful. If anything, it may make you look older and overdressed for the occasion. Most professional makeup artists choose to keep their makeup light and natural during the day. It is only for the evenings and special occasions where they go for the dramatic looks.


For a simple, every day look, try a tinted moisturizer, a little bit of brown eyeshadow, some mascara, and lip gloss. You can also add some blush or bronzer too, but keep it light.
If wearing dramatic makeup makes you happy, then go for it! You might want to give your skin a break every few days, however.

,, When it comes to making themselves beautiful, people have tendency to only focus on their face and hair—but hands are important too! Keep your hands soft by wearing a moisturizing hand lotion, and don't pick or chew on your nails. Keep your nails trimmed, and use a manicure brush to clean under them every night. Don't be afraid to paint your nails, or even get a professional manicure. A little bit of color never hurt anyone!


If you do choose to paint your nails by yourself, remember to take the old nail polish off first. Wearing nail polish on top of chipped, peeling nail polish will look messy.To protect your nails and make your polish last longer, remember to apply a good base coat before your nail polish, and a good top coat after you are done.
Don't use nail polish as a replacement for proper nail care. Take care of your nails first, then think about nail polish.

, Most girls will just remove the hairs on their legs and underarms, but you can do your forearms too, especially if your hair is thick and coarse. You can also go to a beauty salon or manicure place, and have your eyebrows and upper lip waxed as well!


It is not a good idea to pluck or wax your eyebrows by yourself. Getting the right shape can be hard, and it is easy to mess up and over-plus.
If you can't or don't want to wax your eyebrows, consider grooming them instead. Pluck away any unruly hairs with a pair of tweezers, them comb through your eyebrows with a clean spoolie brush.
Check with your parents. They might not allow you to shave because of religion or just of personal choice, ask your parents and obey what they say!

Wear what you feel most comfortable in.,
Dress up a simple outfit with accessories.,
Keep your wardrobe clean and tidy.,
Emphasize the part of your body you feel most confident about yourself.,
Dress for your body type.,
Be kind.,
Be yourself.",How to Look Beautiful As a Teenage Girl5," You may find the hottest, cutest outfit in the mall, but it won't do you any good if you don't feel comfortable or yourself while wearing it. Your lack of confidence will show. Instead of trying to look like everybody else, why not try to make your own style and wear what you feel most comfortable in? Who knows, you might start the next fashion trend!

, You don't have to wear accessories if you don't want to, but they can really make your outfit look more complete. For example, a wide belt over a maxi dress or a simple tunic can really take your outfit to the next level! Choose accessories, such as belts, hats, and jewelry that match your outfit, personality, and style.


Look through fashion magazines to get ideas.
Can't afford cute accessories? Make your own!

, An outfit may look super cute by design, but it won't look cute if it is messy, dirty, or smelly. Take good care of your clothes, and wash them when they get dirty or smelly. Take care of the way you put your outfits on. It is fine if you prefer a torn, ragged, ""punk"" look, but try not to be sloppy about it.

, Wear vibrant tops if you like your upper body/arms and slimming pants if you love your legs! If you don't feel good about any part of your body, ask a friend (or even a friendly sales associate) to help you find an outfit that will look cute on you. Sometimes, it is easier to see what looks good on other people than it is on yourself—your friend might be able to see something that you don't!

, There is an outfit for everyone out there! Whether you are skinny or overweight, you can still wear similar clothes, such as shorts and tank tops. What matters, however, is the cut. For example, if you have narrow shoulders, you'd look better in tops that have thinner straps. If you have broader shoulders, you'd look better in tops that have wider straps.

, Being kind is one of the easiest things to do to look prettier. Think: you could be the prettiest girl on the outside, but you may be really mean. Would you want to be that girl, or would you want to be the kind, friendly girl everyone wants to talk to?

, Whoever you are and however you look, own it. Beauty is a mindset. Feel beautiful, and you will be beautiful. Just look in the mirror. You don't need a wiki page to remind you that you rock.

Add different kinds of stylish clothes to your wardrobe.",How to Look Beautiful During Summer Vacation," Drink plenty of water to clear up your skin and aid your kidneys in excreting toxins from your body. If your acne is severe, see a dermatologist. If your acne is mild and sporadic, use a concealer when you get spots. Remember, pat in the concealer. Find out what skin type you have, and buy facial cleansers for your specific skin type. Always remove make-up at the end of the day, and wash your face twice (morning and night). Use a good moisturizer so your skin is hydrated. Try to use a moisturizer with sunscreen during the daytime. If you tend to have oily skin, carry oil-absorbing pads with you to blot your skin with every few hours.


You can squeeze some fresh lemon onto your fingertips and apply it to any spots you may have on your face. Wash your face twice a day. In the morning, splash your face with cold water for about 10 seconds. Then pat dry with a washcloth or facial sponge. This helps stimulate blood flow and is really good for the skin.;
, Since your feet will be exposed a lot through wearing sandals, make sure they're pleasing to look at. You can have a pedicure done, or give yourself one. Just make sure your feet are clean, hair-free, nails aren't too long, nails are filed, and your feet are moisturized. Be sure to use sunscreen on your feet, too. As for your hands, try putting a clear polish on your nails and keeping them well groomed. If your hands tend to be dry, apply a moisturizer at night and wear white cotton gloves while you sleep (this also works well in the winter). You will wake up with softer, more beautiful hands.

, Always use sunscreen. You will still tan but you will cause a lot less damage to your skin. Use self-tanning lotion or cream. Many people get skin cancer, even if they just get a tan, not a burn. It is just like regular cancer, and can be fatal, unless surgically (or with a laser) removed.


Remain physically active. Go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week. If a gym is not accessible, go swimming, biking, rollerblading, walking, etc.

, Do whatever works for you and suits your face. If your hair is curly, use a product to define your curls. If you're looking for a new style, go to a hairdresser and ask for his or her opinion. A professional will be able to help you pick a style and color that will suit your face and skin tone.


Wash and dry your hair regularly. French braid your hair on both sides of your head before bedtime, then remove the braids in the morning and you'll have instant waves. It's so quick and easy!

, This is not necessary but if your parents allow it, it could be useful. Use a mascara that is waterproof, which is best for summer and it's likely that you'll be sweating, swimming, etc. Curl your eyelashes before you use mascara, it will make your eyes pop. Apply bronzer to your cheeks, forehead, nose and chin; this will give you a nice summer glow. If you have pimples, dot on concealer and seal it with powder. Now, although makeup can improve the way you look temporarily, you mustn't forget that if you wear it continuously you may not be satisfied with the way you look without it on.

, Wear whatever you feel like. You will always look better when you're wearing something you're comfortable in. And because it's summer, you can always go and buy new clothing, especially if you are in school. Always want a new great look!

, Don’t shy away from all the dark colors because they can look very trendy! Your wardrobe should contain some Plain tank-tops in the colors: white, black, pink, blue and lavender. A variety of short shorts in different styles and colours. With a cropped blazer or paired with a pair of funky Chuck Taylor All Star Converse. Including anything denim, followed with some cute jeans and dresses.

, Start your day having aloe-vera pulp, coconut water or normal water. Leave a cup on your nightstand to remind yourself to drink every morning.

, Get a membership at your local gym and try your hardest to go there at least once a week then twice a week etc. Workout at home if you're not comfortable doing it in public areas.

Smile!",How to Look Attractive (Girls)," Consistency is the key to maintaining beautiful skin, so commit to setting aside a few minutes a day for it. Here's how to make it easy:


Wash your face in the shower. Save time in the morning by combining your skincare routine with your shower. Do a few quick swipes and rinse while you're getting your hair wet.
If you're too tired to do a full skincare routine before you go to bed, keep a stack of makeup removal wipes on your nightstand.
Try to moisturize day and night. Don't forget the common areas where wrinkles tend to pop up: the outer edges of your eyes and around your mouth.;
, A quick rinse-off before you start your day will make you look, smell and feel a little prettier, no matter what else is going on. Try to get it down to a routine that you can easily get through in five or 10 minutes.


Wash your hair on a regular schedule. You don't need to wash your hair every time you shower — and, in fact, people with coarser hair should stick to every other day, or even every three days. Whatever works best for you, be consistent. Your scalp gets into a routine when it comes to releasing oils into your hair, so make your life easier by maintaining the same schedule.
Trim and clean your nails once or twice a week. Your nails will be softest and most workable when you first get out of the shower, so it's a good opportunity to do a quick trim. You'll have clean, presentable fingers and toes without having to do a full-on mani-pedi.
Manage body hair. Address any shaving in the shower, and take care of plucking as soon as you get out. As a general rule of thumb, try to shave armpits every day and legs every other day, and clean up your brows once a week.
Put on deodorant as soon as you get out. It's also a good time to put on fragrance, whether it's perfume or a light body spray. (Just go easy and make sure you don't use too much!)

, No matter what else happens, your smile is one of your best assets. Here's how to make sure it stays sparkling:



Brush twice a day, and floss at least every night. Don't forget to gently brush your tongue, while you're at it — a lot of bacteria that cause bad breath can hang out there.
Use mouthwash at night, and keep gum or mints on-hand to make sure your mouth stays sweet and appealing.
Fight off chapped lips. If your lips tend to get flaky and dry, you're probably dehydrated — drink water more regularly, and you'll notice a difference. If that doesn't help, keep a small tube of chapstick to use throughout the day.

, You don't have to be stick-skinny to be attractive, but it's worth the time and effort to keep your body fit and healthy. Not only will it pay off as you get older, the endorphins released during exercise will help you feel more confident and pretty.


Play a sport. Exercise doesn't have to be monotonous. If you find yourself bored to tears by the thought of going to the gym, consider taking up a sport or physically-oriented hobby. Basketball, tennis, volleyball and swimming are all great choices.
Work out with a friend. Stay committed to fitness by making it a social appointment. You're less likely to bail out on running if it means standing up your friend. Plus, you'll have someone to bond and commiserate with while you exercise.
Try to stay generally active. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park a little farther away from the entrance of the grocery store. It might not seem like much, but even small increases in how much you move will eventually show in your figure.

, Women across several cultures use makeup to play up their features. But remember, you don't have to wear makeup to be attractive — it's just a tool you can use if you'd like. You can also wear different levels of makeup, depending on your situation and your comfort level.


Try a natural look. You can wear just enough makeup to cover any little flaws and look like the best version of your usual self. Use a clear or slightly tinted lip gloss or chapstick, and a light powder to even out your skin tone.
Wear an everyday look. You can wear a full face of makeup without using a heavy hand, or you can skip the whole routine and just use a bright lipstick or a smoky eye. If you tend to wear makeup on a daily basis, consider settling into a basic look that you can alter up or down depending on your needs.
Do a glam evening look. For going out or special events, try setting aside 15 or 20 minutes to do a full face of makeup. Use concealer, base, finishing powder, blush, eye makeup, and a lipstick or lip stain. Just remember the lips-or-eyes rule: pick one or the other to highlight. Doing both will look too garish and over-done.

, Like most people, you probably have a few fallback hairstyles you rely on for your everyday look. That doesn't mean you can't try something new every now and then, though! Putting a little extra effort into your hair can boost your beauty and make you feel like a supermodel.


Change it up. If you usually wear your hair back in a ponytail, try leaving it loose in a half ponytail or curl it with a flat iron. Alternatively, if loose and long is your preference, try a textured ponytail or a trendy fishtail braid.
Consider a new haircut. If your hair just isn't working for you or you're in a rut, maybe a new cut or color is what you need. Browse around online or thumb through magazines for styles you like, and make an appointment at a salon. Remember, it's your stylist's job to make people feel good about how they look, and he or she will be delighted to offer advice if you're not sure what to do.
Trim split ends and touch up color. Even if you're totally content with your current look, make sure you keep up on maintenance. Get split ends trimmed every six to eight weeks, and cover up any mis-colored roots at the same time.

, What looks amazing on your best friend might not suit you as well, and it has nothing to do with how attractive you are. Knowing how choose clothes that fit you well will make you appear more beautiful (even though you yourself haven't changed!).


Be aware of your body shape. You can take your measurements, or you can just look in the mirror and try to eyeball it. The most common types are:

Pear: larger hips, smaller waist and bust. Highlight your small waist and shoulders.
Apple: larger bust and waist, smaller legs. Draw attention to your slim legs and hips.
Hourglass: larger bust and hips, smaller waist. Play up your classic curves and small waist.
Banana: Thin through bust, waist and hips. Play up your slender figure, using belts or cropped jackets to draw a line across your waist.


Remember: light colors highlight, dark colors hide. For instance, if you like your waist but don't like your hips, wear dark pants and a light shirt.

, A daily cleansing routine is a strong foundation for having beautiful skin, but you can do a few special processes now and then to make sure your complexion stays clear.


Exfoliate. Once a week, mix a gentle exfoliant with your cleanser and gently massage it over your face. Rinse off as usual.
Remove blackheads. Buy a few blackhead removal strips at the drugstore, or visit an esthetician for a professional extraction.
Treat yourself to a mini facial. You can pick up face masks at the drug store, or make your own out of peaches and oatmeal.

, The way you carry yourself tells other people a lot about how you feel, so make sure you're communicating confidence.


Hold your head high. Don't look down at the ground.
Keep your shoulders back and relaxed.
Stand with feet hips-width apart.
Balance your weight evenly on both feet.

, Did you know that beauty queens spend hours re-learning how to walk? Sounds silly, but they're practicing walking in a way that appears graceful and floaty. Follow these quick tips instead of spending so much time on pageant training:


Don't drag your feet. Avoid shuffling or only lifting your feet to the minimum possible height that allows you to walk.
Let your hips swivel slightly. An exaggerated swivel can cause back pain, but so can trying to maintain an unnaturally directed pelvis while you walk. Instead, allow your hips to swing with the motion of your walking.
Try not to bounce up and down too much. Practice walking in a way that keeps your head at the same height, even as the rest of your body is moving.

, You already possess the one thing that can make you more attractive than any other help: your pearly whites. Keep your smile within easy reach, and try to find reasons to grin. Not only will it make you feel happier , you'll brighten the moods of everyone around you.


If you have a hard time smiling regularly, try to think of a favorite joke or something that makes you happy, like a pet or sibling. Muse on it whenever you need to flash a quick grin.
Keep it appropriate. Smiling when someone says hello to you is great; smiling when your friend talks about losing his grandma is not as great. Gauge the situation before you automatically grin.

Shampoo the roots and condition the ends. This prevents build-up on your scalp and keeps the ends from breaking.
Wash your hair in cold water. This seals the proteins from the products into your hair, leaving it healthier and shinier.

Hot water leaves your hair's pores open, allowing nutrients to escape.

;
, Don't feel the need to wash it every day! This will dry it out and get rid of good, natural oils.


Thick, coarse, or curly hair does not need to be shampooed as often.

Deep condition your hair once a week, if desired. This is an especially good idea for dyed or damaged hair.

, Hair dryers, curling irons, and straighteners all damage your hair, from root to end. Let your hair dry and style it naturally to avoid unnecessary damage.


If you must blow-dry you hair, use the low setting. The higher the heat, the greater the damage.

, Keeping a styled cut keeps split ends from getting out of control.


No need for a trip to the salon -- do it yourself! Stick to the style you have; just clean up the ends.

, If you have curly hair, rock those curls! If your hair is straight, walk right out of the shower into the world (but put clothes on first). A girl's natural beauty is always her best look.


Use products to enhance your hair's qualities. Use a gel or spray to define your curls or serums to make your hair pin-straight.

, Your hair, skin, nails, and attitude all depend on it.


Extreme dieting may seem effective, but it wreaks havoc on your body. A healthy diet insures you get all the necessary vitamins and minerals your body needs to grow and shine.
Your hair gets nutrients from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Without these, it will grow slower and seem duller.

, Establishing a routine catered to your own skin will maximize its effectiveness and leave you glowing and camera ready.


Dry -- sometimes flaky, few breakouts,
Oily -- prone to shine and breakouts, bigger pores
Combination -- your T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) is oily, cheeks are dry

This can change with the seasons or have a tendency to be oilier or drier.


Sensitive -- has allergic reactions to products, turns red easily in more extreme weather

, Many moisturizers or lotions have small amounts of SPF built in.


Stay away from tanning beds. Prolonged exposure in the sun is bad enough for your skin, but unnatural UV radiation is even worse. Tanning leads to wrinkles, spots, and, obviously, skin cancer.Youth is fleeting; don't make it go faster!

, What your mother told you is true. The things that are best for you are also best for your body.


Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking has been proven to add years onto your skin and teeth. Get your beauty sleep! Studies have shown that getting a full 8 hours of sleep leads to lower stress (which leads to better skin), a healthy weight, and higher levels of creativity!, Make-up can clog pores and lead to breakouts. Make sure you wash your face at night and before applying make-up in the morning.


Use make-up remover to get at the stubborn places around your eyes.

, Use an oil-free lotion and apply all over your face and neck.


Moisturizer is useful to even out your skin tone. Use one with SPF 15 to reduce sun damage.
Moisturizer also provides a base for foundation.

, Too much make-up covers up your actual beauty and may look clownish.


Natural make-up (like Mineral Foundation) is healthier for your skin and reduces breakouts -- unlike most make-up, which increases them.

, Clothes look different on everyone. Knowing your body shape will help you pick out the fashions that minimize your flaws and enhance your attributes.


Apple -- larger upper body, slimmer legs
Pear -- wider hips and thighs, smaller bust and waist
Hourglass -- bust and hips similar in proportion
Banana -- shoulders, bust, waist, hips all similar

, If you know what to play up, you can draw attention away from what you're playing down.


A cute jacket is appropriate for all seasons and draws attention away from the arms
Eye-catching accessories go with any outfit (and add personality!)
Heels make even the shortest legs look longer
A top with a cinched waist at the natural waistline helps to create the illusion of an hourglass figure

, If it buttons up, it doesn't mean it fits. Pick clothes that not only fit you, but fit you well.


When in the store, move around. You won't wear clothes that are uncomfortable.
Wear good undergarments when trying things on. Extra lines can create an unflattering silhouette.

, Your own coloring will affect what shades look best on you.


Hold a piece of white paper up to your skin. If you have a yellow hue, you have a warm skin tone; if pinkish, you have a cool skin tone.
Pick clothes that flatter your skin tone. Autumn and spring tones are warm; winter and summer tones are cool.

, The benefits of exercise are not only for your waistline -- it'll improve your mood in addition to you looking and feeling better.
Exercise will:


Lead to weight loss
Lower your heart rate
Improve your complexion
Define your muscles You don't have to do it all at once! If you're on a time crunch, work out a little in the morning and a little in the evening -- the benefits are the same.



, This habit will look after your skin and hair for you.


If you're thirsty, you're dehydrated. Keep a bottle of water with you as often as possible.
Upping your water intake can result in weight loss!A healthy amount to drink, on average, is half of your body weight in ounces (of water) per day. That is, if you weigh 100 lbs, drink 50 ounces of water each day.

, There is nothing more beautiful than a girl whose beauty is her own.


When it comes to clothes, pick the ones you feel good and comfortable in. The girl who can barely sit down is not the girl you want to be.
Don't like today's trends? Start your own! Having a sense of style is knowing what yours is -- not being able to follow the crowd.

, It's contagious. Soon enough, you'll be happier. And everyone around you will be happier, too.


A genuine smile will instantly brighten your eyes and slightly flush your cheeks. Automatic blush!

, Inner beauty affects outward beauty. A vibrant, optimistic personality creates a gorgeous person on the inside and out. A confident person has an aura of self-worth that cannot be wiped off with soap.

Most importantly though, do what makes you happy.",How to Look and Feel Your Best," It's very important to feel good in your body and once you do, others will see. Especially when you are in your teens being confident is quite hard. You feel fat or ugly? Trust me, you're not the only one who feels this way.


Feel fat or ugly? You're really not. I promise you, nobody is as critical of you as you are. Calculate your BMI to figure out if you are overweight and if you actually are, consider going on a diet.
No matter your size or shape, own your body. It's all yours, all you. You are beautiful in your very own way because you are unique. No matter how you feel about yourself, there's no-one out there who's like you.
When you're standing in front of a mirror really, really try to zero in on the good things about you. Obsessing about the negative things won't make them go away and it certainly won't make you feel any better. If there's really something about you that you want to fix for yourself, fix it. It's important to feel good, not pretend like you do.
Stop comparing. You are not others. And more importantly you can't be. Admire others and aspire to be a better 'you' but don't be someone else. As Oscar Wilde said: 'Be yourself. Everybody is already taken'
Remember this: Your body, your rules. If you don't want to do something with it nobody can force you. You are not obligated to do anything you don't feel okay doing. This especially applies to sex. If you don't want to that's your right and nobody can say otherwise.;
, Might sound confusing, but it isn't. Be friendly, open and remember to smile. You will really be surprised how much more friendly people will be towards you. Then again, you don't want people stepping on your toes, do you? So when someone is getting in your face, be polite but very, very firm. Don't yell at them and never, never-ever get violent. This will not earn you any respect. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, you're a lot stronger than you think.

, No matter what. You might fib towards other people but don't lie to yourself. You are better than that.

, Treat yourself to baths, masks, massages etc. It makes you feel amazing and boosts your self-esteem. Also remember to relax. Meditate, read a book, take a nap. Do what you can to combat stress.

, Yes, of course you have to maintain your hygiene.


Take a short shower or a shallow bath every evening but wash your hair only every three to six days (Depending on how oily your hair is) as not to strip your hair of it's natural oils. Use a nice-smelling shower-gel/shampoo/conditioner and lotion but don't clash scents.
Brush your teeth at least two times a day and use breath-mints and chewing gum between meals.
Use deodorant to combat body odor. Try to stay away from the kinds that smell too sweet or too strong since lots of people are very sensitive to smells and overpowering everybody in a 5 meter (16.4 ft) radius with your deodorant isn't polite. Good scents to use are: citrus, mint, soap and there are even ones that smell like detergent. If you want to you can use a neutral-smelling one and spray perfume over it to create your very own 'smell'. But please remember to keep it light. If you have a cold, avoid perfume because you can't smell how much you've already applied and smelling like you bathed in your perfume is not really an enjoyable thing for your peers.
Make sure your clothes are clean, too. You can smell and look amazing but if your clothes smell like sweaty socks and are totally wrinkly it will still ruin your appearance.

, You've probably heard this a million times but this really is important. Don't wear clothes that are too revealing just because you think boys want you to or it's the ""cool"" thing to do. But also don't wear clothes that ""hide"" you. Be proud of your body and show it off in the very best way. Try stores like H&M for cute fashionable clothes for all body types.

, If you are still under 12 don't go for it. Please, don't.


Face: For every day: Just a little powder to brighten and correct your complexion. For a little more coverage try mousse/souffle foundation as it gives a light and even coverage. Use concealer to lighten your dark circles. If you have blemishes or acne, don't try to hide them too much. The more you try, the more people will see them. Neutrogena, Clearasil, etc. are good for cleaning you skin and curing blemishes. If you have extreme acne or sensitive skin, see a dermatologist for special treatment.
Eyes: Mascara is awesome for every day. It makes you seem more awake and really makes your eyes stand out. If you are a blonde, try a dark brown instead of black, it seems more natural. Also don't overdo it. Mascara should enhance your real lashes, not look like a bunch of clumped-together stubs. You can also add a little tan/brown/sand eyeshadow to make your look more glammed up. At night you can spice your look up a bit with a slight smokey-eye or subtle colour eyeshadow (dark-green, purple, dark purple, gold, silver etc.).
Lips: A nice gloss or lip-balm will do if you are young. If you want to you can also wear a light lip-stain or lipstick for a more intense colour. Always make sure your lips are hydrated, chapped lips look kind of love-less. For a gentle exfoliation use a soft toothbrush to scrub off dead skin, smooth your lips and increase circulation.

, Always make sure your hair is reasonably clean but if it gets oily and you don't have time to wash it, try putting it up in a high ponytail.


Find a shampoo & conditioner/heat-protectant/leave-in conditioner/hair-masque that suits your hair-type. (ex. Herbal Essences, Pantene, Dove etc.)
Change up your hair style. Don't always run around with the same style. Do a high ponytail one day, french-braid the next, curls another. But don't overdo the heat, it damages your hair.
Try cutting, highlighting or dyeing your hair. But try to stay close to your natural hair colour (i.e. if you have black hair maybe bleaching it completely white isn't a great idea in the long term). But go ahead and experiment!

, Turf your non-healthy habits! This will help you live a longer and happier life.


Stop harming yourself. If you are smoking, drinking to much or over-eating. STOP IT NOW. No matter what, you are not doing anybody (least at all yourself) a favour. Self-control-issues and chemicals are not important enough to ruin your life over! Seek medical guidance if you can't overcome your addiction. If you are cutting yourself, doing drugs or are suffering from an eating-disorder see a doctor right now. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, mental illnesses are just as much illnesses as the flu is and they won't just go away with time.
Eat healthily. Cut down on processed fats and sugars and processed flower/ white flower. Also try to avoid the combination fat-sugar, as sugar raises you insulin-levels, opening your cells and if there's a lot of fat around, it will deposit itself in the cells as well. Remember: White flower changes into sugar in your body (try chewing white bread for a couple minutes, it'll start tasting sweet!)
Drink lots of water. It really is important for your over-all health, especially for your kidneys, as they clean your blood. x/2=_oz of water a day (x= your weight in pounds). But don't stress the water too much, you already get the majority of your daily recommended intake via your food and the only thing drinking huge amounts of water will accomplish is making you pee a lot.
Get exercise and get outside. Go for a walk as often as you can or garden (Even if you only have a small windowsill) but don't forget to wear sunscreen on hot days.
Get rid of bad habits and find new hobbies. Read a book instead of spending all day in front of your TV or on the computer. Try arts & crafts or new sports.

, Don't waste your time, strive for high results and work to achieve them.

, Doing things you enjoy is not wasting your time and doing things differently from others is not wrong. Wear neon orange lipstick and dye your hair leopard print if it puts a smile on your face! It's your life, live it how you want. Don't let society tell you who you are or what you have to do or how you have to feel.

Smile and be friendly.",How to Look and Feel Great As a Teen Girl," What do you like about yourself? Is there anything you would like to improve about your health? What would you like to improve about your appearance? Start making some personal goals that you can follow up on!;
, There are things such as your eye color, any genetic conditions, your natural skin color, your ability to run or walk if you use a wheelchair, or your height that you can't change. Remember though, if you are only 13, you may still have some growing to do height-wise so eat a balanced, nutritious diet and don't start smoking in order to reach your full height potential. Other things, you just need to accept as a part of who you are. If you don't like your hair color, you can change it. If you don't like your weight, you can change that too, but make sure you feel comfortable in your own skin and change it for yourself, not for others.

, Do you need to eat more, less or the same? Do you need to eat healthier, or start cooking some of your own meals? A little treat now and then is fine, but a Big Mac and fries every week is definitely not healthy! A good rule of thumb: Put good in, get good out!

, Preppy, classic, edgy, girly? Think about what you like, what looks good on you, and what to avoid. Take your height, weight, age and form into account. If you are an hourglass, for example, look up what clothing those with hourglass figures should wear to flatter their body. Make sure whatever you wear, you feel comfortable in. You can't feel good if you don't like what you wear.

, Wash your hair every 2 days with shampoo and conditioner, or less, or more. Do what works for your hair. Brush your hair whenever needed or at least 2 times a day. If your hair is heavy, you may enjoy a cut with layers. But don’t go too crazy if you're not used to it - they can take quite a while to grow back out if you don't like it. Be sure that the hair styles are cute.

, Nails are very important in your appearance. Keep your nails looking good by clipping them once a week to an even length; one popular choice is 3-6 millimeters above the skin. Clean under your nails everyday. You can also paint them if desired.

, Wash your face with warm water and facial cleaner or soap every morning when you wake up and at night before you go to sleep. After washing always use facial moisturizer. To keep the rest of your skin clean, take a shower every day using soap that won’t harm your skin, or have a bath or full wash. Lotion your body immediately after you get out of the shower. Drinking lots of water, (at least 8 glasses of water a day), will make your skin glow and keep it healthy. (It also helps prevent acne).

, Brush your teeth after every meal for 3 minutes, then floss, and use mouth wash to keep your breath smelling good. When you brush, make sure your getting your gums too. Brush your tongue about 1 minute every time your brush your teeth to keep it pink. If you have crooked teeth, get braces and do as your dentist recommends, or, embrace your individual quirks and only straighten your teeth if it has a medical benefit. There's nothing wrong with cosmetic dentistry, it's just not essential to looking and feeling great.

, Put on Chapstick/lip balm on when you’re at home, especially during the winter. Wearing chapstick in public is nice too, it gives a natural glow to your lips.

, Ask your doctor before starting any intense exercise routine, especially if you have asthma or any other chrome conditions. Don't over exert yourself to reach the numbers below. Use the times as a guide, and do what you can, gradually working your way up to longer distances and faster repetitions.

, You need at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday, even if you did 15 min cardio, then got up and played wii fit for another 15 min. Try to work your way up to these times and you will have your 30 minutes of exercise. Walking is great exercise.


Warmup (5 minutes): simple stretches for 3 minutes, light jog for 2 minutes
Cardio (15-30 minutes): jog a mile everyday or jog for 15-30 minutes a day. If you can't do this because you have a mobility issues, find your own way of keeping as fit as you can to look and feel great.
Toning (30 minutes): do 50 sit ups a day, do 20 push ups a day (if you can't do it all in a row, try at least 6 in a row at first) do 60 arm curls a day with 5 pound weights (at least 20 in a row)(hold one weight in each hand, hold arms to sides, then lift weights up to shoulders, then back down and repeat), 50 over head presses (hold 5 pound weights above shoulders with arms bent, then lift arms straight up over head and lower arms back to first position. Do 50 squats and 50 lunges.
Flexibility (10 minutes): hold splits on each leg for 2 min everyday, then straddle (middle) splits for 2 minutes (don’t force yourself to go all the way down at once, and don't bounce in any stretch), stand up with your feet shoulder width apart and reach for your toes for 1 minute, do simple stretches for the next 3 minutes.

, Try not to eat too many calories for your height, but enough to maintain a healthy weight. This number should be increased if you exercise regularly. Eating correctly will help your body keep or become a natural, beautiful shape. Always and only eat healthy meals which are breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack in between lunch and dinner. Skip the snack if you are not hungry. Don’t overeat – only eat until you are comfortably full. Minimize sweets and soda, but plan occasional treats. If you eat sweets, eat small portions.

, It's no secret that makeup can improve your appearance. All you really need to wear is a bit of concealer, powder, lip gloss, and mascara. But don’t make it too obvious, the point is to make people think that you’re not wearing makeup. You can wear your makeup during the day with touch-ups every now and then, but make sure you take it off once you get home to let your skin breathe. Remember that make-up appropriate for a thirteen year old may look a little odd for a young woman of 19, but if you think you look and feel good, go for it! .

, Wear deodorant every day. You may need to put it on more than once. The smell shouldn't be too strong, either. Find a perfume that matches your personality, and stick to it. Don't wear so much that it's overbearing, though.

, A warm smile and a friendly demeanor can make anyone more appealing and attractive. Smiles and friendliness also attract potential friendships and allies. No amount of makeup can replace the beauty of a warm smile, and when we smile, we feel better about life, others, and ourselves.

Get some pairs of skinny jeans, a pair or two of jeggings, a few pairs of short shorts, a few pairs of knee length shorts, and a pair or two of skinny khakis.

, Get into a skincare routine for your skin type. Use acne products and you will soon have a beautiful acne free face.

If they don't allow you, be cool with it and ask again in 4-6 months. Nagging will not help, and fighting will simply show your parents that you are not mature enough to wear makeup. Also do not use the excuse of ""But she wears make-up!"" That will also just show your parents that you are definitely not mature.;
, Set a price limit, which should be about $15-$20, and don't spend anymore than this amount. You don't need a ton of makeup. Focus on getting a few classic pieces that you can wear every day, plus something pretty for special occasions, such as sparkly eyeshadow or lip gloss. Stay away from bright blues, greens, or purples. Instead, opt for natural pinks and light browns. If you are in a department store like Macy's, the women at the makeup counters will be happy to give you a free makeover, providing you'll purchase your favorite products. They will tell you what looks best on your skin and will show you how to apply it.

, Be sure to choose the right color for your skin tone. Don't be afraid to ask your mom for her opinion.

, Select a mascara according to your hair color. If you are anywhere from platinum blonde to strawberry blonde, choose a brown. If you're ranging anywhere from a redhead to light brunette choose black-brown while If you're brunette or black hair you can get away with black.

, Stay away from rogue colors; these will make you look old and fake. To apply, smile. Apply blush where your cheeks are fattest. Cream blushes are nice but may make your skin oily, so opt for powders. If you put to much on, smooth it out lightly with a clean brush or your fingertips. To find the perfect shade for you, run or jog for 20 minutes. The color of your cheeks when you exercise is the color that will look best on you.

, You don't need to worry about lip liner or lipstick now. Lip gloss will give you a pretty shine or sparkle with a hint of color. Lip balm will give your lips an instant natural color boost and will make them noticeably softer. Choose clears or pinks. If your lip gloss is too sticky, run an ice cube over your glossed lips. You'll still have the shine without the sticky sensation.

Decide what you want.,
Search through your closet.,
Create your new wardrobe.,
Accessorize your basic wardrobe.,
Sort out some shoes.,
Make up your mind about makeup.,
Take care of your personal hygiene.,
Get to know the best places to buy clothes.,
Have the right attitude!",How to Look Amazing (For Girls)," Make a list of style goals you want to accomplish. Do you want a better closet? Better hair? Whatever you want, write it down. This way, you can keep it as a to-do list of sorts, and it's also a good way of seeing what's realistic and not realistic.

Remember that looking amazing is about giving yourself more confidence. Having an amazing sense of fashion won't mean much if you're extremely nervous about how you look even after people tell you that you look great.
Certain things will be easier to accomplish than others. Maybe you want a dress that you saw in this month's fashion magazine, but it's incredibly expensive. Maybe you want to dye your hair blonde, but your school or parents won't allow you to dye your hair. It may be more realistic to make the list and see what you can do, can't do, and what you can work around.;
, Go through your closet and take everything out. Make two piles; one pile of clothes that you'll donate or sell, and the other pile of things that you'll keep. Keep things that don't seem ""last year"" and picture yourself wearing to school happily.


If you think you'd only wear a certain piece of clothing on the weekends or it means a lot to you, it's okay to keep it.
If you want to sell your clothes, stores like Plato's Closet and Children's Orchard will take your clothes and give you either cash or store credit. It's garage sale prices, but it's still money.

, Get together the following things for school. Your wardrobe should contain:


Graphic tees. The bolder, the better. You'll want bright colors with designs that stand out.
Solid v-necks or regular t-shirts. They're basic, and classic. They're super easy to accessorize, too!
Tunics. These long shirts are great over leggings or skinny jeans. Get bright colors, and beaded tunics are great. Make sure the tunic is long enough to qualify as a tunic, but short enough not to be a dress.
A vest. Black or gray are the best colors, and pin-striped navy is popular, too.
Jackets or hoodies. Get most of them in bright colors, and the rest in darker colors.
Tank tops are a good idea, too. Get one in white, one in black, and the rest in any color that looks good on you.
Jeans of different varieties. Consider getting one pair of distressed jeans, one pair bleached, one light wash, and one dark wash.
Shorts, depending on how warm it is where you live, is normally best. A pair of denim shorts are a great bet as they're very easy to style, but be sure to get other kinds, too.
Leggings. Basic, neutral colors like black, gray, and white are the most versatile, but patterned leggings can be fun to rock your world, too. Be sure that you can match a pair of patterned leggings to at least one of your outfits, though, because you don't want to be stuck with yellow polka dot leggings and nothing to wear them with!
Skirts, if you like. You should own at least one formal skirt for formal events. They can be varying patterns, lengths, and materials.
Consider a trench coat-like jacket. It should be long and have a tie around the waist.
A few summer dresses are a good investment. Throughout the year they can be changed entirely by adding a jacket and leggings, or maybe a scarf.
A pair of cargo pants is a good idea. Sometimes the best ones come from the guys section, so keep your eyes open. Nobody will know that you actually bought them in the men's section.

, Accessories are a great way to dress up or down your usual outfit, making your wardrobe more versatile. The following accessories will be most useful:

Belts. One should be basic black, another should be one that you can wear up higher over a t-shirt dress or just a t-shirt, and the last can be any belt that you love.






Earrings, depending on how often you accessorize. Silver hoops and diamond studs are classy, and chunky, bright colored ones are common. Go with your heart and pick your favorite.






Bags are great, especially for outings.






Scarves in any color. Invest in high-quality ones if you can, but if not, pick ones that look and feel great. Cashmere is a good option, but if you can't find cashmere or can't afford it, wool will substitute just as well.






Necklaces in any shape, color, or size will work.






Bracelets are great, but don't wear them all at once.






Try some headbands! Hippie headbands are a cool trend. Other types of headbands are cool, too, and they look great on any hair type. Try to have a couple to choose from.






Hats are a must, especially for bad hair days. A common choice is a beanie, but you can wear any hat you want.







, Shoes can determine how formal or casual your outfit is; a summer dress with some canvas shoes is a totally different to the same dress with a pair of pumps with a kitten heel. The following shoes will make sure you can dress for any occasion.

Flats. Make sure you have a basic neutral pair.






Boots. They're fashionable and good for cold or rainy days. Try to get a stylish pair in a neutral color. Be wary of Ugg boots, as these may be harder to match than other boots and cannot be comfortably or sensibly worn in warm weather and they get stained in rain/mud unlike leather or patent leather boots.






Comfortable tennis shoes are a must, especially for gym.






Try Converse. These are optional, however, as not everyone likes the look of these shoes.






A pair of sandals for sunny days and by the pool. Metallic sandals are very in, but neutral colors are good too, and very versatile.







, Makeup is more appropriate for older students, such as high schoolers or college students, but many girls experiment around with it in middle school. Decide what's right for you.

If you're in elementary school, you don't need makeup! At this age you have no need to wear foundation, as you're not likely to be getting pimples before your teenage years. If your mom is okay with it, you can start experimenting at home, however.






Around middle school, you may want to start experimenting with makeup. There's no need to feel pressured to wear makeup by your friends, but if you genuinely want to, start off slow, perhaps with lip gloss, mascara, and a concealer to hide pimples. Products like blush and foundation aren't typically needed for middle school girls.






If you're in high school or college, try to go with a fairly natural look for school. Even though it's fun to look fabulous, the focus of school is supposed to be learning, not attracting guys. Enhance your natural beauty with mascara, lip gloss or lip stick, foundation and concealer. Try to find a foundation with SPF 15+. If not, use a BB cream or moisturizer with SPF, or even sunscreen. Proceed with caution if you choose to use blush, eye shadow and/or eye liner. A little goes a long way with these products.






To make lips look fuller, apply lip gloss or lipstick evenly over both lips, then take some lip shimmer or a lighter shade and apply to the center of the lips. Then rub lips together. Believe it or not, this technique gives lips volume. But they shouldn't look like the picture, it should be lighter on the inside and darker on the outside. Lips should be exfoliated. When you shower or wash your face or maybe even once a week, exfoliate your lips. Do this with a soft toothbrush wet with warm water.






Intense eye shadow is primarily intended for formal events, however, it may be used sparingly with neutral colors like brown, beige, and even gold and still be school appropriate. Decide what you are comfortable with and what your parents are comfortable with. If you curl your lashes, curl them before you apply mascara.






Foundation is helpful if you have redness, bruising, or scars on your face that you want to cover up. It may not cover up as well as concealer, but it gives a more natural finish. Blush is best applied on the apples of your cheeks or on the highest part of you cheekbones. Only use blush, though, if you need it. Some people have color in their cheeks naturally, and some people don't. Use an oil free concealer.









, Even if your sense of fashion is great, nobody will want to talk to you if your breath smells.

Brush and floss your teeth twice a day, and whiten them once a month. Use healthy whiteners or just whitening toothpaste. Whitening once a week is not recommended. It will strip your teeth of enamel. Mouthwash is great if you have bad breath.

If you have to get braces, think about what color bands you want, as you won't be able to change the color for some time, so make sure it's a color that you like! Even if you take good care of your braces, lighter colors and clear bands can be stained by food. It's unlikely anyone else besides you will be able to notice, but if you're worried, ask your orthodontist which band colors are the most stain resistant.








Wash your face twice a day if you have oily skin, and once if your skin is dry. Find a face wash/skin system that is right for you. Remember that generic brands aren't anything to be afraid of, and some generics work better than the more expensive brand name items! Also, make sure you find a moisturizer that works for your skin type. If you're oily, don't go with a really heavy one, opt for a lighter one instead. And if your skin is dry, go with something a little thicker, richer, and creamier to keep your skin hydrated. If you feel you have bushy eyebrows, and you want them gone, either pluck, thread, or wax. I prefer plucking, as it is easier, safer, and can be done more easily from home.






Showering every other day is best for your body, and taking warm short showers is much better than long hot ones. If your legs and armpits are hairy, try shaving. Only shave if you don't feel comfortable with your body hair. Another alternative is hair removal cream, which has an unpleasant smell, but works well. Always use lotion when you get out of the shower, especially if you shave. It keeps your skin from looking dry.






Wash your hair every other day when you shower. Washing it every day takes out all the natural oils that prevent frizz and add shine. If your hair is oily or dirty, wash it.







, When it comes to clothes shopping - which you'll be doing quite often as the fashions change - you'll need to find ways of getting them cheaply. After all, you don't want to spend over a hundred dollars on just a shirt!

The less expensive places are department stores like Macy's, Kohls, and JCPenny's. A few other inexpensive places are Old Navy, GAP, and Target.






Some great stores are Aeropostale, Hollister, Forever 21, American Eagle, Urban Outfitters, PacSun, VS Pink, Journeys, Vanity, Claire's, Icing, and WetSeal.






If you're big brand name obsessed, but on a budget, try TJ Maxx or Ross. They have brand names up to fifty percent off, and they have everything.






If you're looking for vintage and thrift stores, the best place to find them is on Yahoo! Local. Just enter the keyword(s), your city, state, and area code, and it will come up with every store in the city, complete with the address.






Great websites are lulus.com, shopstyle.com, shopwiki.com, and the sites of whatever brand you're looking for. Often in-store prices and online prices are different, so always check to see which is the better deal.







, Not only do you need style to get to school looking amazing, but you need the right attitude. People are going to notice a smiling girl more than a glum one.


Confidence is an important factor. Even if you're not confident, try to look the part. Raise your head high, your shoulders back, and smile. Speak your mind, and don't be afraid of what others think.







Be nice to everyone, especially your enemies. Of course be a great friend, and give and take advice. Involve yourself in at least one school activity.

Top eyeliner is easy and adds a dramatic look if wanted. Put your finger to the side of your eye pull just so that eye shuts. Apply the eyeliner in a very thin line to where the eyelashes are growing. To make your eyes look bigger make the line a little bigger the further you go. For more drama, you can even use a blue!

Clean your hands with soap and water, then dry before handling your jewelry., This is the most common type of nose piercing, just a hoop that runs through your nose. There are a couple types of rings, each of which is designed to come out a bit differently.Seamless rings. These rings should have a break in the material. To take it out, bend the ring slightly so the break comes apart, then slide out of your piercing.
Segment rings are designed with a separate piece that comes out of the ring. Pull it out in order to remove the ring from your nose, then snap it back in place to close the ring.
Because of their size, nose rings can be tricky to pull apart in order to insert or remove. Some companies make opening and closing pliers, special tools to grip the ring, which you might find helpful for seamless rings.

, These are common types of jewelry consist of a straight post holding a bead or jewel that is visible. The other end is usually another bead that helps prevent it from falling out. To remove, grab both ends and pull apart.Nose bones are similar types of jewelry, but much more difficult to get out. To change the jewelry, you will effectively need to rip it out of your nose.

, This type of jewelry started in India, and has become more popular in the Western world. It consists of a short post that has a hook or “L-bar” at the other end to hold it in place. Just like a stud or pin, to remove you grab both ends and pull.Some types may require you to twist slightly to help the pieces come apart, but that should be fairly easy to get the hang of., If you are having trouble getting your fingers on the jewelry, or have certain types of piercings that you can’t remove, go back to your piercer to have them take it out. This is not something you should do often, but if something is stuck, or you are having a problem with your jewelry, the piercer should check it out.When you first get your nose pierced, it can be a good idea to talk about removal with your piercer. Talk about the proper way to remove your jewelry, and others things you should know about jewelry care.

, If you removed your jewelry in order to swap in another piece, it is important that you make that change quickly. Have the next piece ready to go so you can make the switch. Everyone’s body heals differently, but you can’t be sure how long it will take for the hole to close up. Even piercings that have been there for years can shrink or close within minutes, making reinsertion difficult, if not impossible., If you have decided that you want to get rid of the jewelry you are wearing then you need to take it out. Nose rings and other nasal jewelry are designed to be removed easily, so once you know that you don't want it, just remove it.


One key exception to this is if the area around your piercing has become infected. If this is the case, do not touch the jewelry. Instead, go to a doctor so they can treat the infection. Many infections can be treated without removing the jewelry, so make sure you tell your doctor that you want it take out.If your jewelry has become embedded, it may require surgical removal. Talk to your doctor about getting it removed as soon as you can, as you don’t want jewelry embedded into your skin like that., If you have removed your nose ring for good, you want to make sure the hole shrinks without infection or other trouble. Once you have removed the jewelry, make sure you continue to clean the wound area twice a day using warm water or a saline solution. In most cases, the piercing hole will heal on its own, shrinking down so that all is left is a barely noticeable dimple.If your piercing has become stretched, it is less likely to heal back to its original shape., If you change your mind, and decide to get your nose pierced again, make sure the hole heals completely before getting it pierced again. If the area doesn’t heal, you can create scar tissue from the additional trauma to your nose., Twice a day, you should clean the pierced area using sterile cotton swabs dipped in warm water or a saline solution. Dabbing the pierced area should be enough, but be sure to remove any crusty formations on the jewelry. When you are finished, pat the area dry with a paper towel, clean tissue, or dry cotton ball. Be careful not to use towels, as they can snag.To make your own saline solution, rather than buying it, dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt in one cup of lukewarm water.
Remember to use different cotton balls or swabs when cleaning the parts of your jewelry inside and outside of your nose.Avoid using strong substances such as tea tree oil, alcohol, betadine, hydrogen peroxide, and methylated spirits. These can lead to scars and lumps on your nose, and will probably create a burning sensation and other irritation., Sometimes you may want to clean just the jewelry, especially if it is getting a little dull. Once you remove it, use a soft brush with warm water and a little antibacterial soap.In general, avoid using cleaning products and chlorine. They can damage many of the materials used in jewelry.
Talk to your piercer about what your jewelry is made of, and good cleaning products for different materials.

, You don’t want your nose jewelry to sit out the open when you aren’t wearing it. It is small, and easy to lose if you aren’t careful. A small soft pouch for your different pieces should be enough to keep it secure and in an easy-to-find place., One good way to keep your nose piercing healthy is to live a clean life. In particular, keep an eye on things that are near your face. Washing towels and bedding at least once a week, especially pillowcases and washcloths. Clean glasses and sunglasses as well.To help with the healing process, and keep yourself healthy overall, remember to eat a good diet and get plenty of sleep. Aside from making you feel more awake and energetic, this will also help your nose heal the area around your piercing. In addition, avoid things that put additional pressure on your body, like drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and stress.

, If you need to remove your jewelry for something like surgery, sports, or your job, talk to your piercer about temporary, non-metallic alternatives. That way, you’ll be able to keep something in the hole while not getting in the way of whatever else you need to do.Just remember not to take anything out until you talk to your piercer. Your hole may close up before either of you has a chance to do anything.

Try the things you like on.,
Never be afraid to ask a faculty member for help.,
Don't buy something if you're not totally sure about it.",How to Shop (for Teens)," It's easier to make a decision on something when someone else is giving their opinion too. Bring along a friend or family member who your trust; not only for their opinion, but to keep yourself safe. Besides, it's more fun shopping with a friend than alone.;
, It's hard, but its always better to set a budget and stick to it. It's better in the long run. If you have trouble doing this, leave your credit card at home and only bring cash. Bring an amount of cash that you're comfortable spending - if your spending limit is $50, bring $50 to spend! This ensures that you won't blow your money in one day.

, This will prevent you from overspending or wasting time. Before you hit the stores, go on-line and look at the websites of your favourite stores. Find items that you like there, then write them down and find them in the store.

, Popular teen stores include Forever 21, Claire's, Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Aeropostale, PINK Victoria's Secret, Delias, American Eagle, and H&M. You should consider trying different stores (like boutiques). You never know what you'll find in that little unknown store. Maybe some new clothes or something you'd like to improve your style with. Just because ""everyone"" doesn't shop there doesn't mean it's a bad store; it might become one of your favorites! Thrift shops also have some surprises in them, if you really take the time to look around.

, Be careful before you buy them, though. Read the next steps for some pointers of what may or may not work well.

, If you're buying something that you don't try on, like socks, always touch them before buying. Stick your hand in it, and see if it's itchy, or just right. Maybe there's a stain? Ask for another one that looks in better condition. Or perhaps it looks flimsy, or as if it will fall apart within months? It's better not to consider it. If you are allergic to some materials, read the label to see what it is made of beforehand.

, Make sure the things that you're buying fit you properly. You should feel comfortable and yourself in your clothes. Try on many sizes before making a decision.


Check yourself out in the mirror. If the store has a three way mirror, it's always best to stand in it before purchasing. The jeans you're trying on could look great from the front, but saggy in the back.

, Love the shirt, but can't find your size? It's their job to help you, so don't be shy about asking the salespeople.

, Only buy something if you really love it and are willing to wear it. It's helpful to try to think of at least two things that you can wear it with too, just so that you know you'll have something to wear it with. If you aren't sure about that top, don't buy it. It's better to leave it rather than buy and regret it.

Add a thin layer of concealer to your eyelids before applying yellow eyeshadow., In general, smearing yellow eye shadow across your eyelids is not necessarily the best way to use yellow.

Frame your eyes with yellow. Add lines of yellow eye shadow around your eye to add a nice yellow frame.

This can keep your look bold without being overly dramatic.For example, if you're adding yellow the corners of your eye, use black eyeliner or eye shadow to frame your eye.
If you're using yellow to outline your eyes, color the main lids with something like brown or black.

, Think about the time of day when applying yellow. Very bright yellow may stand out a lot during the night time. This may be too bold, to the point it looks gaudy.

This is why you want to make sure that you're caring for it properly. Most people (celebrities included!) get zits and imperfections in their skin. Instead of stressing about that one pimple, try to work on your overall skin health.Using a simple, basic face wash each day will help to remove unwanted oils and dirt, without completely stripping away the good oils. Wash your face in the morning when you get up and again before you go to bed.
Figure out which type of skin you have to get the right face wash and moisturizer. People whose skin is dry, tend to have flaky skin. Oily skin looks greasy or shiny only a few hours after washing. Sensitive skin often feels tight or itchy and experiences allergic reactions to various chemicals.
Moisturize your face, hands, and body especially in the drier times of the year (like winter or summer). Keeping your skin moisturized will help you appear radiant and healthy!
Avoid touching your face, because the oils in your fingers can irritate the skin on your face and help cause more pimples.;
, Make-up isn't necessarily for everyone, but it can be a great way to make yourself feel good and attractive. You can use make-up to highlight different aspects of your face.This is where make-up can be really handy. If you're having a bad skin day, you can cover up those zits and use make-up to highlight your eyes (if that's one of your best physical attributes).
If you have really beautiful eyes (and you do!) you could bring out the colors in them using eyeshadow. Avoid choosing an eyeshadow that exactly matches your eye color, as this looks too monochromatic. For example: if you have blue eyes, try purple eyeshadow (lavender for the day, and deep plum for the evening). If you're going out dancing, use a metallic shade like turquoise or silver.
Lipstick can be a great way to achieve a dramatic, dynamic appearance. Red lipstick is a girl's best friend. Pair it with a smokey eye look and a classic black dress and you're good to go!, This look is about preserving the natural look of your face, while sculpting it to meet your hotness needs. It enhances your looks (especially your eyes) without getting too exciting or obvious.


Add definition to your eyes by applying eyeliner, in a subtle and natural shade (like brown). Brush on a little eyeshadow in champagne or light brown.
A little bit of mascara opens up your lashes and makes them look longer. Make sure that you get a mascara that works for you, because some can get really clumpy and goopy, which you don't want.
Contour your face using bronzer to bring out your cheekbones. Blush can help widen or lengthen your face depending on what you're looking for (apply in a horizontal line to widen or across temples and jaw to lengthen).

, Smokey eye is always in, and it can be dressed up or down. It draws attention to your eyes, enhancing the color in them. Prime your eyelid with an eyeshadow base so that the darker eyeshadow colors don't run.Sweep a nude eyeshadow over the entire eyelid. From base to brow of your eyelid, apply a shimmering eyeshadow. Line your top and bottom lash line with dark eyeliner (brown or black). With a Q-tip, smudge the liner.
Sweep a darker eyeshadow over the entire eyelid and into the crease. Blend the color upward and outward.
Apply a highlighting color under the brow bone and in the tear duct. Line your inner lash line with eyeliner to intensify the effect. Coat your lashes with two to three coats and curl them upward.

, No matter what style you put it in, healthy hair is always the most attractive hair. Wash your hair as often as it needs washing. For all hair types, however, you want to make sure that you're only washing your scalp. Washing the ends can dry them out!Hair that is fine needs to be washed between once a day to once every three days, depending on what you've found works best for you. Now, there's some speculation that shampooing every day can actually cause your hair to dry out more quickly and therefore to start producing more oil. You might want to experiment with washing less regularly, or maybe even changing your shampoo.
If your hair tends to be greasy, you'll probably want to shampoo your hair every day. You may also want to look into changing your shampoo, because shampoo can be the cause of greasy hair.
Hair that's curlier and coarser (and typically thicker!) probably needs less washing. A couple times a week, three at most, otherwise it will dry out more quickly and that will lead to frizz., Hair is something that can make you stand out and enhance your face or it can do the opposite. Once you've figured out your face shape, it'll be simple to pick a haircut that works with it. There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, oblong, heart-shaped, and diamond-shaped.For an oval face, your face is about one and a half times bigger than the width of your face. Your forehead is typically bigger than your chin. With an oval face, you're lucky because most haircuts look good.
A round face has prominent cheeks, and the length and width of your face is about equal. Avoid bangs and try to create volume on top (ponytails and buns are good here). This will give you the look of the oval face.
A square face has a prominent jaw and square chin. Your jawline and forehead are about the same width. Bangs and short hair tend to make your face look more square, so it's usually best to avoid those looks. Use layers and medium to long hair length to help contour your face.
An oblong face is slightly longer than an oval face (with which it is often confused), and isn't as wide. People with an oblong face may also have a pointy chin. Bangs and chin-length layers are good for this face shape, which will help your face look less long.
In a heart shaped face, both your forehead and cheekbones are wide. Heart-shaped means that you have a narrow jaw and pointy chin. Go for longer length haircuts, with more width around the chin.
For a diamond shaped face both your jawline and forehead are narrow. Your cheekbones are the widest part of your face. Build volume around the hairline and jaw, while keeping the volume down around your jaw. Bangs and texturizing the ends can help cover up the narrowness of your hairline and chin.

, Sometimes being hot is about finding the right hairstyle. Come up with a couple hairstyles that make you look amazing and that you love. Swap these around during the week so that your look doesn't become boring. Occasionally try out a new 'do to keep things interesting.For wavy hair try: a messy updo with soft face-framing tendrils; or pull up the sides of your head and secure them in the back, letting the ends curl; or try an unfussy low, side bun.
For straight hair try: side part with the rest of your hair down; or a pony-tail with volume at the crown with a little hair spray; or french braid on either side of your head that you secure in the back, while leaving the rest down.
For curly hair try: a short cut; or let it loose with a little product and a severe side-part to create volume on top; or gather a small section at the top of your hairline and pull back, leaving the sides and back down; or grab small sections of your hair and pin them up in the back.

, Clothes that are either huge on you or way too small make you look unkempt. You will also end up feeling uncomfortable, which will in turn make you feel less confident and less attractive. Clothes that fit also flatter your body type, whatever that happens to be.


Take your measurements. Measure your bust at the fullest part, holding the dressmaker's tape measure firmly but not too tightly. Measure a little loosely around your waist, which is where your body naturally creases. Measure your hips around the fullest part of your hips and rear. Keep these measurements in mind when looking at a size chart.
Getting a bra fitting. Most women are wearing the wrong size bra. It's either too small or too big. The best way to make sure you're wearing the right size is to get an actual fitting from someone who knows what they're doing (typically a company that deals in undergarments, like Victoria's Secret).

, Part of looking hot is having an outfit that flatters you and enhances your appearance. If you're wearing clothes that don't look good on you, then it's not really going to matter what you look like. Finding clothes that work takes a little patience and a little experimentation.


Pick your ""uniform."" This means a couple (around two or three) ensembles that you like to wear and that you know look good on you. Using these outfits as bases, you create a style that makes people notice. For example: if you tend to wear dresses pick a style of dress that works as your ""uniform,"" like retro-50s look. To give yourself more range you might add different belts, and different dress colors. Depending on the weather you might wear leggings and boots, or bare legs and flats.
Having neutral bases can help ground your outfit, so that it doesn't get too out-of-control. These means some basic shirts and trousers and skirts in neutral colors (like black, navy, white, grey). You can pair these with a more flamboyant shirt or trousers, or accessories. For example, wear a red patterned t-shirt with black skinny jeans, a grey jacket and grey boots. You could add some big, bright earrings (yellow or orange) or a scarf.
Red has been shown to be the color that attracts the most attention. Women who wear red tend to be seen as sexier than those who don't (or who aren't wearing red at that particular moment). Wear a daring red dress, or even just a red scarf to up the hotness factor., Whether it's a fun, brightly colored purse, a big belt, or flashy earrings, accessories are the way to demonstrate your own individuality without getting overwhelming. There's a whole host of ways to flatter an outfit so that people take notice of your style!


Handbags are great style pieces, as well as being useful. If you tend towards specific colors (like greens and browns) grab a handbag that complements those colors (like a shiny gold).
Jewelry is definitely a way to attract attention. Figure out what you like and show it off! Long dangling earrings are good for people with short hair, or hair that is usually pulled back. Wearing pearls with jeans and a t-shirt can give that little classy kick. You can also use jewelry to pick up color accents in your clothes (for example if you're wearing a gold dress with green edging, you might go for green earrings to offset the dress).
Scarves, belts, and hosiery (leggings, socks, tights, etc.) are all functional items that can be hot too! You can grab a brightly colored scarf and belt to go with your more subtle trouser/t-shirt combo. You could wear a dark gray dress with a pair of brightly colored, patterned leggings.

, You want to get shoes that work well with your wardrobe, but are also comfortable. If you can't walk in high heels, for instance, it's best to skip the high heels and stick with flats. When you're uncomfortable, other people pick up on it and are less likely to think you're hot.


Flats are a really versatile type of shoe. You can dress up a casual outfit, or you can dress down a super dressy outfit. Depending on the color of the shoe they can be an obvious highlight (like red) or subtle comfort (like gray or brown).
Boots give a classy look to most outfits, especially if they have a little bit of a heel. Black boots are incredibly versatile, and if they're comfortable, you can wear them most anywhere. Ankle boots are great with skinny jeans, skirts, even shorts and tights!
High heels are something you definitely need to get accustomed to before you start tossing them in with your outfits. Wearing a pair of brightly colored heels can make you feel and look hot! They can give an instant dressing-up to any outfit (even jeans and a t-shirt), but if you don't walk in them properly you look like you're uncomfortable.

, Only following the latest trends is a surefire way to not get noticed. It's the people who combine current trends with their own flare of style that get labeled ""hot."" This is because, these people stand out and they know what works best for them.


A good way to create a unique style without barging into completely new territory is to find a few key statement pieces. These are things like jewelry, scarves, shoes, even particular colors that are unique to you. For example: you might wear basic dresses and skirts, but your leggings are funky and brightly colored (like using a Monet painting, or wearing space leggings).
Find clothing in unusual places. Women's clothing has a tendency to look the same, but you can get cool t-shirts (with space, and dinosaurs, and comic book characters) in the boys section. Also finding one-of-a-kind items (like handmade jewelry) can help you to stand out.

, Health is incredibly important to your physical and your mental health and appearance. Things like getting enough sleep, and exercise, can greatly affect your physical appearance (especially your skin).


Exercise is an incredibly important part of looking hot! It's not necessarily about losing weight, but it is about keeping yourself healthy. Exercising releases chemicals that boost your mood and keep your body healthier. 30 minutes each day is the recommended exercise amount. So put on some music and dance, or go for a run.Get enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep not only makes you look haggard, it makes you feel bad and heightens any existing problems. Try to get at least eight hours of sleep at night (if you're a teen, aim for nine hours). The more sleep your get before midnight, the happier your body will be. Turn off all electronics (phone, computer, iPod) at least 30 minutes before bedtime.
Drink enough water. A lot of people these days walk around dehydrated, because they're not getting enough water. Being hydrated helps manage your weight, it helps make your skin better, and makes you feel less foggy. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. If you don't like plain water, get a plain or citrus seltzer, or squeeze a little lemon into a bottle of water. Avoid drinking lots of caffeine or sugary drinks, because these will dehydrate you.

, What you put into your body makes a huge difference in the health of your skin and your hair. It also makes a big difference in your mental health, too. You want to make sure that you're eating foods that help to boost your physical and mental health, instead of foods that will make you feel worse.For a healthy diet you will want to eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Go for at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. The best fruits and veggies are the dark leafy greens, the brightly colored ones (like red peppers, red onions, etc.), and blueberries, strawberries, and bananas.
Try eating foods with essential fatty acids in them like salmon, walnuts, avocado, and flax seed. These are really good for mental health, as well as your skin.
Low-fat dairy products, which have vitamin A and acidophilus, can help regulate your intestinal tract which helps to get the toxins out of your body. In turn, this makes your body and skin healthier.
Definitely try to avoid junk food and highly processed foods and sugary foods, as much as possible. Not only do these have a bad effect on your skin, they will make you feel worse, and more moody. You don't have to entirely cut out these foods, but keep down your consumption of them.
Eat three main meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and two snacks (in between breakfast and lunch, and in between lunch and dinner). This will help regulate your blood sugar and metabolism. Especially make sure that you eat breakfast, because this will help you throughout the day. A typical day might look like this: oatmeal with raisins and walnuts for breakfast, a hard-boiled egg and apple for a snack, whole wheat pasta with low-sodium tomato sauce and cheese for lunch, celery sticks and peanut butter for a snack, baked chicken and brown rice with salad for dinner.

, More than physical attractiveness, confidence is what gets you noticed and labeled ""hot."" You can be totally plain-looking by society's standards and still have the confidence that makes people sit up and take notice. Fortunately, confidence is something that you can practice until you get good at it.Avoid judging yourself too harshly. People screw up sometimes, or say something stupid, and no one looks hot 100% of the time. The more you pick on yourself when things don't work out quite the way you'd planned, the less confident you'll feel.
Avoid judging other people. Scientists have found that people who repeatedly judge others harshly, reflect poorly on themselves and have less confidence, as a result. If you find yourself making negative judgments about other people, stop and replace the judgment with something positive or something neutral. For example: if you find yourself thinking ""wow, she's got the worst voice"" instead turn that around and think ""no one can help the voice they're born with"" or ""she tells the best jokes!""Avoid comparing yourself to other people. This is an exercise is futility. There's always going to be someone who is hotter than you, gets more attention than you, has better hair than you. Comparing yourself to everyone only makes you feel worse about yourself, which in turn erodes your confidence.
Practice confident body language. Walk with confidence; stay upright with your shoulders back and your chest out. Make eye contact when you're with people. Not only is eye contact extremely sexy, it also is a sign of confidence., To keep your positive attitude and boost your confidence, you'll need to work on getting rid of your negativity. Negative thoughts about yourself and others will make you feel worse about yourself and other people will pick up on those feelings, whether conscious or not.


For example, if you look in the mirror every morning and say to yourself ""Wow, I'm hideous,"" not only will you convince yourself that you're hideous, but you'll convince other people.
Pay attention to your thought patterns and where you have the most negative thoughts about yourself. By paying attention to how you think about yourself, you'll start to notice all the horrible things you say to yourself on a daily basis. Once you identify these thoughts, you can work to change them.
When you do have negative thoughts about yourself, replace them with positive or neutral thoughts. For example: if you think ""wow, I'm hideous,"" every time you look in the mirror, check yourself and think instead ""My teeth are looking good today,"" or thank your body for being healthy. You can work your way up from neutral to positive. Start telling yourself that you're beautiful and eventually you will start to believe that.
Get rid of negative people from your life, as much as you can. People who make you feel bad about yourself, who constantly criticize you, who drain your energy, are people that you need to avoid as much as possible. If you can't cut them out of your life entirely, set time limits so you only have to be with them a short period of time.

, While ""hotness"" usually comes from physical looks and confidence, people tend to consider those who have good personality traits to be more attractive than those who don't.Kindness, being a good listener, being respectful to other people, are all qualities that makes people view someone as more attractive than their physical appearance might suggest. Cultivating these qualities can up your attractiveness rating in other people's minds.
Help other people without expecting anything in return. Drive a friend to their doctor's appointment, buy the coffee drink of the person behind you in line, offer your time and money to a homeless shelter.
This doesn't mean that you need to live your life for other people. Helping people, and listening to people, are great things as long as you're taking care of yourself at the same time.

, One of the things you need to keep in mind as you're striving for ""hotness"" is that what ""hot"" is is constantly being re-defined. This is why being yourself, and having confidence in that self is the most important thing.


Stop comparing yourself to the women and girls in magazines and on t.v. Those ""perfect"" women, don't actually look anything like that. They have a team of hair stylists, wardrobe artists, make-up artists, special lighting, and Photoshop to make them look like they do.Remember, people once considered the bustle (making your behind look enormous, while making your waist appear unnaturally tiny) attractive. Some of the fashions and versions of ""hot"" nowadays look just as silly.

, Bring two deodorants; one extra strength for when you're playing your sport, and a nice scented one for everyday use. Bring wipes and a small rag or towel. When you are about to play, wipe down any areas that are going to sweat (be discreet, please! Nobody wants to watch a girl wipe down her underarms!), and dry them off. Apply deodorant.

Get the mascara off your wand.,
Clean your wand.,
Use isopropyl alcohol.,
Pat dry.,
Remove any makeup.,
Mix the Vaseline.,
Dip your wand in the Vaseline.,
Apply to your upper lashes.,
Apply to your lower lash line.,
Let it sit.,
Wash it off in the morning.",How to Make Eyelashes Longer with Vaseline," Grab a paper towel. If you use a soft tissue, it will likely cause more of a mess than you began with. Using your paper towel, dab the bristles of your mascara wand. If there is stubborn mascara clinging for life, gently wiggle your wand back and forth in a folded paper towel. This will also help spread the bristles.;
, Now, dip your wand in lukewarm water. Let it sit for 2-4 minutes with all of the bristles fully submerged. This loosens any dried mascara that’s on your wand.

, After you’ve let your wand sit in warm water, there may be some mascara still lodged between the bristles. Soak the bristles in isopropyl alcohol to remove these and to sanitize your wand., Use a paper towel again to gently pat your mascara wand dry. You want the wand to be totally dry before you use it. If you’ve cleaned it ahead of time, store it in a plastic bag to keep it clean and bacteria free.

, Wash any makeup off of your eyes and lashes. This will help the moisturizing qualities of the Vaseline do its job.

, Using your clean finger, move the top layer of Vaseline around. This will warm it up and make it easier to apply.

, You want to get a heavy amount of Vaseline on your wand. It has a tendency to clump onto the front of your brush. If this happens, simply use a damp paper towel to help spread it evenly down your wand.

, Just as if you were applying mascara, apply the Vaseline to your upper lashes. Coat both sides of your lashes thoroughly, making sure not to get any in your eyes. If you wish, you can smudge some of the Vaseline back over your eyelid for smoother skin. If you have sensitive skin, this may cause a reaction so be sure to test it on the back of your hand before doing this.

, Dip your wand back in the Vaseline. Being careful, once again, to not get the Vaseline in your eyes, apply it to your bottom lashes.


Your lashes will clump together when you apply the Vaseline. However, be careful not to put on too much or it will end up all over your face and sheets. You should use enough to coat your eyelashes evenly in one thin coat.

, If you apply this every night, the Vaseline will moisturize your lashes which prevents them from breaking off and falling out prematurely. The conditioning qualities will help prolong the cycle of each eyelash, resulting in thicker and longer lashes.

, When you wake up, wash the Vaseline off. If you have trouble getting the Vaseline off of your eyelashes, try using a cleanser. Because it's oil based, water might not be enough. Use your regular make-up routine during the day. If you do this consistently, you can see results in as little as three days.

Dress to impress.",How to Make Yourself Beautiful in One Night," Exfoliate your skin and shave any unwanted hair. Shampoo your hair and condition it with sulfate-free products to keep your hair feeling silky and smooth. Rinse with lukewarm or cool water to prevent the natural oils in your hair that keep it shiny from rinsing out. When you get out, moisturize your skin. Put a spritz or two of your favorite body spray/perfume to make yourself even smell beautiful! Use a leave-in conditioner for your hair and use any other products that are in your routine, such as hair mousse or a de-frizzer. Let your hair air-dry or blow-dry it if you don't have as much time. Make sure you get haircuts every once in a while. Trims, so you don't get split ends!;
, Keep your nails trimmed and your cuticles cut. Paint them your favorite color(s) or throw on a clear coat for instant elegance! Apply lotion on your feet and then put on cotton socks to give them extra moisture!

, Give your teeth a good brushing. Use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash to keep those whites pearly! Floss between your teeth and give them an extra rinse. Outlining those teeth should be luscious lips. Apply chap stick or Vaseline to make them soft and then use your favorite lip color or gloss. Make sure there is none on your teeth!

, Coconut oil and olive oil, as well as honey, are naturally beneficial to your skin. Coconut oil can even get rid of acne! Use your regular face cleansers and moisturizers before you apply any makeup. If you can, try to keep your natural beauty and just highlight your best features. A little coral blush and some mascara can sometimes just do the trick. Or none at all! Putting Vaseline on your eyelashes (and eyebrows, if needed) before you go to bed will condition them and can make them grow longer and shine better! Speaking of your eyebrows, make sure they're groomed too. Remove any stray hairs and make sure to keep them looking full by penciling them in, if needed.

, Whether it's for a special occasion or just to feel pretty, put something on that makes you smile. Keep it classy and don't reveal too much. Add jewelry to the outfit, but remember the old rule: take one piece of jewelry off before you leave the hour. Pair it with the perfect pair of heels/flats and you're ready to smash 'em!

Pack emergency feminine hygiene products.",How to Make an Emergency Kit for Teenage Girls1," Choose a bag that’s large enough to fit all your supplies, and preferably something that has a strap or handles for easy transportation. You’ll probably be bringing this kit with you everywhere, so make sure the bag is comfortable to carry and suitable to your taste. Consider a bag with a few separate compartments and pockets to make it easier to organize your kit.


A small backpack, a large makeup case, purse, or tote bag would all work well for your emergency kit.;
, No matter where you go, who you’re with, or what you’re doing, you should always have at least $10 to $20 in emergency money on you at all times, as well as some change. On top of having some money in your wallet, keep extra emergency money in your kit, preferably in a secure or secret zippered pocket.


Change can be used at a payphone in case your cell phone dies, for an emergency snack from the vending machine, or to buy a pad or tampon from the bathroom dispenser.
Even just $10 can be enough to get you out of a jam, whether you need a meal, cab fare, or anything else.

, Make a list of all the medications you take on a daily basis and write down your known allergies. This is in case there is a medical emergency and a doctor or nurse needs this information. Keep a copy of the list in your emergency kit. Update this copy whenever needed.

, Keep the medications together in a separate case or pocket. Don’t forget the medications you don’t take every day but need in case of emergencies; this could include:


Epinephrine injectors.
Emergency inhalers.
Antihistamines.
Insulin shots.
Eye drops.

, Always have enough supplies on you for at least a few hours of protection. Pack whatever product you prefer, such as pads, liners, tampons, or a menstrual cup. Consider keeping an extra pair of underwear on you as well.


These supplies are just as important even if your period hasn’t started yet. Instead of being caught off guard, you’ll be ready if it comes when you aren’t home.

Select a larger bag.,
Pick out smaller cases to organize your kit.,
Pack water and a snack in your kit.,
Keep spare eyewear and eye care supplies.,

Assemble a travel toiletries case.,
Put together a mini cosmetics case.,
Assemble a travel sewing kit.,
Make up a travel writing kit.,
Locate a second phone charger.",How to Make an Emergency Kit for Teenage Girls2," To be prepared for a larger emergency or disaster, you’ll need a larger bag than you did for your everyday kit. This is the type of thing you can keep in your locker or ready to go in your closet at home. You can even have two or three of these lying around, such as one at school and one at home.


Don’t forget to keep emergency money in your ready-for-anything emergency kit as well as your everyday kit.

, Even if your emergency kit bag has pockets and compartments, it’s still a good idea to organize the contents of your kit to make everything easier to find. After all, the last thing you need during an emergency is the added stress of not being able to find something you need! Makeup cases will work well for organizing your kit.


Consider color coding your individual cases based on their contents. For instance, you could keep medical supplies in a reddish colored container because of the association with the Red Cross.
Opt for cases that have zippers so that you can keep your kit neat, tidy, and separated.
You will probably need between four and seven smaller cases, depending on how you want to organize your kit. It’s also a good idea to have a hard-shell case for sewing items.

, Whether you just need an afternoon pick-me-up or forgot to eat breakfast, having a bottle of water and non-perishable snack in your emergency kit could come in handy at any time. A good snack could be a granola bar, dried fruit bar, crackers, bag of nuts, or anything else that will last for a few months., If you wear glasses, it’s always a good idea to have a spare pair in your emergency kit in case you lose or break your main pair. Similarly, if you wear contact lenses, always keep a spare contact case and extra solution with you.

, This can be used to treat cuts, scrapes, minor injuries, and unexpected headaches, cramps, and other mild pain problems.These items should all be kept together in a separate case. Your first-aid kit can include:


Tweezers to remove splinters.
Adhesive bandages for small cuts and scrapes.
Hand sanitizer and antiseptic wipes to clean cuts.
Throat lozenges and cough drops.A travel-sized bottle of pain relievers. These can go in the first-aid kit or with the medication supplies.
Tissues for wiping, cleaning, blowing your nose, and everything else tissues are great for!

, It’s always a good idea to have a spare change of clothes on you in case of spills, rain, unexpected periods, or rips and tears. It doesn’t have to be your fanciest outfit, but one day you might be glad you’ve got an extra T-shirt with you. Don’t forget about:


Underwear in a re-sealable plastic bag (the bag is for the dirty pair).
A bra or sports bra.
Socks.
A T-shirt, tank top, or blouse.
Spare pants or shorts.

, Any drug store will have a variety of miniature toiletries you can use to supply your emergency case, including deodorant toothpaste, dental floss, mouthwash, soap, and gum or mints.You may just need these to freshen up between classes or meetings, but during a disaster, keeping clean can also prevent disease and infections.

, You don’t need all your cosmetics in your mini case, but just a few things for emergency use in case of a last-minute date or job interview, or a hair or makeup mishap. Keep a few bobby pins, a comb, and hair ties in your kit,some hand cream or body lotion, lip balm, a small mirror, and some select makeup items. What constitutes emergency makeup will be determined by your cosmetics preferences, but it could be:


Foundation and a compact.
Mascara or eyeliner.
Lipstick, gloss, or lipliner.
Blush or eyeshadow.

, This is for if you lose a button, split a seam, break a strap, or experience some other wardrobe malfunction. A basic sewing kit needs pins and safety pins, a sewing needle, black and white thread, one or two generic buttons, double-sided tape (for quick fixes), and a pair of mini or collapsible scissors.You can also include a mini stain remover to treat spills and stains.


Keep these items in a hard-shell case so you don’t stab or prick yourself with pins and scissors.

, You never know when you might need an actual pen and paper to leave a note or jot down a brilliant idea, so keep a small pad of paper, pen, and pencil in your emergency kit (ink can dry out, so keep a pencil as well). Throw in a few paper clips too, which in a pinch can serve hundreds of purposes, such as a:Makeshift hair barrette
Bra strap holder
Zipper pull.

, Having a mobile phone can be a lifesaver in an emergency, but only if it has enough battery life to connect you to the outside world. A spare phone charger for your emergency kit is a worthwhile investment that means you’ll always be able to reach people if you’re in need.


Ask friends or family if they have compatible chargers lying around from old phones they don’t use any more.

Drink!,
Eat healthily!,
Moisturise!,
Do something with your hair!,
Perfect your posture!,
6.,
Be clean!,
Confidence Boost!,
Have fun, and be yourself.

",How to Make Yourself Gorgeous," Most of us don't drink nearly enough water, and this can play havoc with our bodies, both inside and out. This first tip is not only a short term step, but do this in the long term, and you can make yourself significantly healthier as a result! However, for this tip, try to drink about 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of water per day: it will firstly rehydrate you, helping your skin to become radiant and gorgeous, but will also act as a detox. Just make sure you don't go too far from a bathroom! If plain water is too dull for your liking, try adding a squeeze of lemon juice.;
, Make sure that you eat plenty of fruit and vegetables (again, this is great for the long run!). Try eating avocado, orange or red peppers, papaya, oranges...as a rule, the brighter the colour, the more vitamins the food contains!, Have you ever tried 'E45' cream? If not, now is the time to start! Try slathering it on after a hot shower in the steamy bathroom for fantastic, soft, smooth skin. For those of you with dry or normal facial skin, try applying it liberally on your face, as it helps to sooth sore or irritated skin, and also helps to heal blemishes.

, Whether this means getting a new cut, or changing the colour, even the smallest change can make a huge difference. Looking for a sun-kissed, summer glow? Try dying your hair one or two shades lighter to enhance natural highlights, and asking your hairdresser for a relaxed, easy layered style. Wanting to look sultry and sexy? How about dying your hair a few shades darker (avoid black colours, as when these fade they can look dull, and instead opt for dark chocolate brown or coffee shades), and maybe ask your hairdresser for a sculpted, possibly fringed, look. Always make sure you ask their opinion before deciding on a drastic look, and be honest with the amount of time you spend on your hair: you don't want to have a style that you can't reproduce at home easily!

, When walking, try to walk tall-this instantly makes you look slimmer and more confident, and as a result, you will feel more confident. When standing, don't slouch, stand straight, with your shoulders down, and try not to cross your arms (this is a defensive position, and makes you look unapproachable).

, Find that 'wow' outfit! Whatever the occasion, every girl needs that one outfit that makes you feel sexy and special. If you're going out for drinks or to a club, opt for a short and shouldered dress with flats, skinny jeans with a cute top and heels, or a vest top layered with a black long sleeved lace top, with a mini and heels. Most importantly, make sure you can actually walk in your heels: agony is NOT sexy! If you're going on a casual date, how about trying bootcut jeans, sneakers or ballet pumps, with a polo shirt layered with a v-necked jumper, for a cool, preppy look. When shopping for this outfit, choose your favourite retailer, find one item that you love, be it a skirt, a necklace or a pair of shoes, and find items that go with it. Always try to buy 'outfits', or things that you are sure will go with items in your existing wardrobe, which avoids having wardrobe malfunctions.

, The morning (if you are not doing anything that could get you dirty/sweaty during the day) or the afternoon of the event, take a long shower. After coming out, slather on E45 cream, spritz on heat protection spray, and blow dry your hair. Try using a round brush to help blow dry your hair in the opposite direction to the way your hair naturally lies to help add volume. Make sure you use deodorant, brush your teeth (and once again immediately before you go out), and put of your favourite perfume (Daisy by Marc Jacobs or Davidoff Cool Water is great for a relaxed look, whereas Chanel No 5 or Paco Rabanne's Ultraviolet are better for sophisticated, sexy looks.

, On your way to the event, listen to uplifting music, such as 'I want everything' by Hope 7, 'So beautiful' by Superchick, 'High flying, adored' from 'Evita', 'Unwritten' by Natasha Beddingfield, 'I gotta feeling' by the Black Eyed Peas...etc, etc. Walk tall, and say to yourself, 'I am gorgeous, I am wonderful, I am interesting, and I rock!'

Go shopping.",How to Look Your Best Every Day (for Girls)1," Do you prefer bright colors, or a more natural look?;
, If you cannot be 100% objective, ask a friend to help. You need to keep only the clothing that makes you look great. Although that t-shirt is super soft, if it doesn't look good on you, it needs to go. If it isn't in your closet, you won't be tempted to wear it. If it doesn't fit your style, you should decide if it is worth it to keep.

, While earrings always look nice, you (or your parents) might not be comfortable getting your ears pierced. Stay away from piercings anywhere else, and don't have more than two holes in your ears. Necklaces and bracelets are great, but don't go overkill with too many of them.

Shoes.

At least 3 of the type of bra you wear everyday
1 bra for when you wear a nice dress

, It may be fun to bring a friend. Go to the mall, or wherever you get your clothes from. Find the clothes that you need, and fit your style. You may also want to think about what is ""in,"" but you don't have to. You should also get whatever jewelry you decided you want.

Blow dry. Try to do a different style every day. If you want you can make a calender that has what hairstyle you'll wear that day so you won't be doing the same hairstyle twice or something.

, Be careful not to put on too much. One spritz is enough.

Ditch the teen fad clothing.,
Wear clothes that fit.,
Don't wear printed tees.,
Wear quality jeans.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Dress nicely.,
Get rid of the backpack.",How to Look Older As a Teen1," Clothes are one of the ways people judge us when they look at us. What we wear can influence people's opinion of us. If you are trying to look older, stop dressing like a teenager. Start shopping in a different section of the store. Bypass the junior department for the adult clothes. The junior department tends to carry clothes with cheap, thin, semi-transparent fabric that makes you look young. Instead of these cheaper fabrics, look for better-made clothing.Girls should avoid girly trends, like mary janes and Peter Pan collars. Avoid items with lots of lace and ruffled tops, gathered skirts and anything too 'cute'.
Avoid sporty styles. Sweatpants, basketball shorts, baseball hats, and gym shorts can make you look lazy and messy. These are also common styles for young people.;
, Swap your baggy clothes for form-flattering clothes. You don't want clothes that swallow you whole and hang off your frame. This can look unflattering and messy. Alternately, do not wear skin tight clothes. Skin-tight can make you look young and immature.


For guys, choose your shirts by measuring the shoulders. If the hemline of the shoulder extends past the end of your actual shoulder, the shirt is too big and won't be a good fit.
For girls, choose clothes that accentuate (not reveal) your shape. If you have narrow hips, wear an A-line skirt to draw the eye outward, giving the illusion of hips. Choose scooped necklines and V-necks. Buy jackets and sweaters that fit your silhouette., One sign that you are young is wearing a t-shirt with a logo or funny saying. This includes band t-shirts, brand names, and logos. If you want people to think you are older, skip the t-shirts altogether.


For guys, try plain colored shirts or stripes. Go for fun colors, like light pinks, yellows, and oranges. Dressing maturely doesn't mean boring colors. Henleys and polos are good styles of shirts for men to wear instead of t-shirts.
For girls, go for embellished tees or tanks. Try plain blouses in bright colors or in prints.However, stay away from fluorescent and neon.

, Jeans are a staple in anyone's wardrobe no matter what age. However, think about the jeans you wear if you want to look older. Buy high quality jeans in good, flattering cuts. Make sure they are not low-rise or high-waisted.


For guys, buy straight cut jeans. For girls, go for boot cut, wide leg, or skinny jeans. If you wear skinny jeans, make sure they are not too tight.
Trade faded or ripped jeans for jeans in darker washes. Don't get jeans with rhinestones or other accents.

, Finish off dressing maturely by wearing the right shoes. Don't wear sneakers or canvas shoes. Don't wear overly flashy shoes. If you are a girl, don't wear heels that are too high or too stylish. No matter what gender, don't wear flip-flops. Instead, wear sensible, conservative shoes.


For guys, wear boots. Black boots look good with just about everything. Brown leather lace up boots are also great for outfits. Loafers and boat shoes may also work if you don't want to wear boots. Polished leather shoes are a mature look.
For girls, wear pumps. Make sure the heels aren't too high. If you don't want to wear heels, wear sensible flats. Sandals look good in the summer.

, Another way to look mature is to dress nicely. Present yourself as a well-groomed, professional individual. This helps people see you as older instead of a child.For guys, wear khakis or dress slacks. Pair them with a tucked in polo or button up shirt. Wear a nice leather belt and dress shoes. A tie isn't necessary, but will help make you look more mature.For girls, wear dresses that fall to your knees with necklines that do not show too much cleavage. You can also try wearing a nice skirt and blouse. Pair the dress or blouse with a cardigan or a blazer. Wear sensible shoes.

, When you are going out, don't carry a backpack. This will make you look young. For guys, carry a messenger bag or a leather briefcase. For girls, carry a simple clutch or a cute hobo purse."

Wear a mature haircut.,
Grow facial hair.,
Wear light makeup.,
Cover your acne.,
Work out.",How to Look Older As a Teen2," Haircuts and hairstyles can make you look a lot younger. There is no one way to wear your hair to look mature. However, there are things you can avoid so you don't look young. Don't dye your hair crazy colors or place colored streaks in them. Shy away from extreme hairstyles, like mohawks, half-shaved heads, and dreadlocks. Wear your hair in a conservative manner.


Shaggy hair makes a guy’s face look much younger. Replace it with a short, defined cut. Spiked hair, long hair, or any other alternative hairstyle might make you look younger.
For women, think about cutting your hair into a bob, pixie cut, or other chic hairstyle. Long, sleek hair can also look mature. Avoid wearing lots of hair accessories, like hairbands, hair bows, and scrunchies., For a guy, growing facial hair can make you look older and more mature. A recent study found that beards can make a man look up to 10 years older.If you decide to grow facial hair, make sure it is a good look on you. Some teenage boys can't grow enough facial hair to have goatees or beards.


Make sure to trim and groom your facial hair. Messy, unkempt beards look bad.
If it grows in thinly, keep yourself clean-shaven. Uneven patches of facial hair will make you look even younger.

, For girls, wear makeup, which can add years to your face. Use eyeliner to outline your eyes. Wear neutral colors, like golds and browns. Don't wear bright or pastel colors. Add some foundation to smooth out your skin.


Conceal the circles under your eyes with concealer.Avoid teenage products like thick, sparkling lip gloss or baby-pink nail polish.

, Appearing to have clear skin will definitely add maturity to your face. Use a spot concealer to cover acne. Adopt a healthy skin care regiment. Try over the counter acne products, like spot creams and cleansing wipes.


Wash your face twice a day with an acne cleansing face wash. Use a moisturizer on your skin. If you have oily skin, use an oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, find one that helps fight dry skin.If you’re a girl, you might wear bangs in addition to makeup to hide blemishes on your forehead.

, This will not only help combat baby fat, but also add muscle definition, which definitely helps teens look older. Guys might want to focus on upper body exercises to broaden their shoulders and build their arms. Girls might want to trim their waists and develop their chest and butt muscles to accentuate their womanly curves.



Interval training is an excellent way to burn fat quickly and using hand weights will help develop muscle. Join a gym or focus on exercises like push-ups and squats that build muscle.

Be confident.,
Change the way you physically carry yourself.,
Develop social graces.,
Complain less.,
Improve your vocabulary.,
Stand up for yourself politely but firmly.",How to Look Older As a Teen3," Nothing communicates maturity like confidence. Even if your physical appearance, unique personality, or social skills aren't what you wish they are, that doesn't have to stop you from building self-confidence.


There's a fine line between being confident and being arrogant or condescending. Confidence is feeling good about yourself, not better than those around you. Don't excessively brag about your accomplishments or speak in a way that puts you above others. This is classic immature behavior.

, Slouching is another classic behavior associated with teens. Hold your head up high and straighten your back. Learn how to walk confidently and improve your posture. Start by standing up straight wherever you are, whether it is walking down the street, sitting at your desk, using a computer, or waiting in line. Correct yourself whenever you notice your posture faltering. Soon, it will become second nature.


Changing the way you carry yourself goes hand-in-hand with confidence. Keep your head up high; don't stare at the ground. Look people in the eye when you talk.

, Speak slowly and confidently instead of loudly. Remember your manners by using “please” and “thank you.” Listen closely to what others say; few things demonstrate maturity as much as a good listener.When people finish stories about themselves, don't immediately launch into a story about yourself. This makes you look self-centered and uninterested. Instead, react to their story first, then use your own story as a way of relating to the other speaker.
Learn how to use small talk. Ask how people are doing. Talk about the weather. Ask about their families. Be polite and carry on light conversation with people.

, People who are always complaining come off as immature and self-centered. As you mature, you accept that things come and go, and everything happens for a reason. Brooding about how awful your life is won't help you actually improve it. Venting to your friends can be beneficial for catharsis or to solicit advice, but constantly complaining about inconsequential occurrences is very juvenile., This doesn’t mean dropping unnecessarily large words during everyday conversation, which will make you look desperate for attention. Focus on cutting out childish words that will clearly identify you as a teen. Speak slowly and deliberately. Make your words count by thinking about word choice.


Learn some sophisticated vocabulary. A good place to start is with SAT vocabulary. For example, say, ""That's a novel idea!"" instead of ""That's a new idea."" Tell someone to be ""candid"" with you instead of honest. A more sophisticated vocabulary makes you look mature and intelligent.
Try not to overuse slang. Avoid ""like,"" screeching ""Oh My God!,"" and punctuating sentences with ""totally,"" ""you know,"" and other meaningless fillers. Try not to use ""awesome"" and ""dude.""

, If someone disrespects you, feel free to tell them to stop. After all, part of maturity is commanding respect. Be straightforward and communicate what you want. Avoid using excessive sarcasm or acting extremely offended. Even if you're joking with these snarky comments, they make you look bad and won’t achieve the results you’re looking for.


For example, if someone interrupts you, say, ""Hold on, please don't interrupt me.""
Don't say things like, ""Wow, I can't believe you just interrupted me. Someone doesn’t know when to shut up!""
Learn when to let things go. Everyone has negative encounters with others, but it takes wisdom to learn how to pick your battles. Being spiteful, resentful, or malicious will make you look immature.
Sometimes when people rub you the wrong way, they often don't realize it. Be respectful of their feelings by either ignoring the mistake or, if necessary, clearly communicating to them that they have caused offense.

Include other supplies like hair elastics, tweezers, and a nail file.",How to Make a Cheap Emergency Bag (Girls)," If you are looking to spend very little money on the emergency bag, you can use household supplies to make your own bag. You will need the following supplies:A square potholder
A large button
6” embroidery ribbon
10 snack size zip-loc bags
Tape
Embroidery floss
A sewing needle
Access to a sewing machine;
, Once you find an area where you can put together your bag, lay the potholder so the inside of the holder is facing towards you, with the pocket or flap on the potholder on the outside., Start by placing one zip lock bag on right side of the potholder so the zipper part of the bag is facing towards the right edge of the potholder. Keep the baggie in place with a piece of tape on the top and the bottom of the baggie.Continue to lay the bags on the right side until there are five baggies on that side. Use tape to keep them in place.
Repeat this on the left side of the potholder so there are five baggies on that side. In total, you should have five baggies on the right side and five baggies on the left side.

, Once the baggies are secured with tape, use a sewing machine to make a zig zag stitch down the middle of the potholder and down the middle of the overlapping baggies. This will allow the potholder to fold over in the middle and keep the baggies in place., Use the embroidery floss and a needle to attach the button to the outside of the potholder. Place it on the outside edge of the potholder and loop the floss through the buttonholes to sew it on.You can then make a loop with the embroidery ribbon on the other edge of the potholder so you can slide the button into the loop to close the bag.

, If you have a small soft bag or a square tin or container that you already own, you may want to repurpose it and use it as your emergency kit. Look for a bag that has a zipper or a secure enclosure and that can fit several items at a time.If you want to use a hard container, such as a square tin, make sure the container has a secure latch or lid and that it can fit several items.

, You can find small soft bags at your local drugstore or your local supply store that are specifically made for emergency kits. Small make-up bags also work well as emergency bags.


Look for a bag or container that has several compartments or pockets. This will allow you to keep your items separate from each other and ensure the emergency kit stays organized and clean.

, Whether you decide to use a bag you already own or buy a bag for the emergency items, you should make sure the bag is made of durable material. Look for bags that are made of synthetic material, like plastic, with woven edges that are not sharp or scratchy. Synthetic materials are durable and waterproof, which will ensure the emergency items will not be damaged if the bag gets wet.


Avoid flimsy material like cotton, as it is not waterproof and can tear easily. If you do use a cotton bag, make sure it is thick and has padding so it will hold its shape.

, One of the essential items in your emergency kit will likely be feminine products like tampons, pads, and panty liners. You should try to keep at least three to four of each item in your emergency kit in the event you need one or a friend needs one.You can save space in your emergency kit by stacking the pads and panty liners and pressing them down so they are more compact. You can also use tampons that are small and compressed so they do not take up too much space in your emergency kit.

, Other key items in your emergency kit may include band-aids and emergency medication like Advil, Tylenol, and Midol.Try to include band-aids of different sizes and shapes so you have options in the event you get a small cut or scrape.
Place three to four pills of each medication in your emergency kit so they are easy to access in the event you develop a headache or experience period cramps and discomfort. Make sure you label each bag of pills so you do not get confused and take the wrong set of pills or mix them up.
You may also want to include a small package of tissues or wet wipes to use in the event of a cut or scrape, or in the event of a makeup mishap or a touch up.

, Keep your teeth fresh by including on the go items like gum, mints, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss. You can keep these items together in one area or section of your emergency bag so they are easy to reach and use.Look for a travel sized toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss as your local drugstore. These are often cheaper than regular sized items and will fit easily in your emergency bag.

, If you tend to use hair elastics throughout the day, include a small supply of hair ties in your emergency kit. You can also include a small pair of tweezers and a nail file to touch up your look throughout the day.Put other small makeup items, like lip balm, travel lotion, or a cover up stick, in your emergency kit if your lips or hands tend to get dry and you like to touch up your makeup throughout the day.
You can also include q-tips and makeup remover or face cleanser if you like to have these items on hand in the event you need to wash your face or re do your makeup.

Use foundation to give your skin a smooth look.,
Apply cat eye liner.,
Use false eyelashes.,
Choose a bold lip colour.,
Apply your lipstick.",How to Look Like Nicki Minaj1," Nicky Minaj always looks like her skin is impeccably smooth and dewy. Correctly apply your foundation to achieve this look by using a foundation brush. Brush in a downward direction and out. The downward direction keeps you from lifting any peach fuzz while giving your face a micro-fine finish.Use a beauty-blending-sponge to top off the finish of your foundation. Purchase a beauty-blending-sponge online, from your local beauty supply store, or even at your local dollar store. This sponge produces a fine finish with your foundation by gently patting it across your face. Make sure the sponge is dampened first as it will soak excess pigment and blend your look.;
, While Nicki often chooses bold colors, you may start with black or choose a colour you are more comfortable wearing. Liquid eyeliner works best when going for the smooth cat eye shape. To apply, start at the end of your eye where your cat eye will end its shape. Angle the rest of your liner pencil toward the inside of your eye and swoop across your eyelid.You want the tip to move in one fluid motion from the outside of your cat eye to the inside of your actual eye. You may also leave small dashes and only use a fluid motion for the winged end of your cat eye, making sure to carefully fill in the spaces between the dashes.If you’re struggling you may use a pencil first because liquid liners are harder to control. Make sure to go over the pencil with a wet eyeshadow or liquid liner to deeply set the colour once you're satisfied with the pencil outline.Clean up excess liner with a tiny amount of petroleum jelly on a cotton swab to get rid of any thick or messy lines., Nicki creates an eye-popping look thanks to false eyelashes.Purchase false eyelashes online, at your local beauty supply store, or even a dollar store. Create a curl shape so that they fit the shape of your eyelid by wrapping them around your finger. Use a thin line of adhesive to place them along your eyelash.Wait until the adhesive gets tacky before applying it onto your lash with your fingers.
Don’t apply your false eyelashes too close to your tear duct. Leaving some distance when applying your inner lash can make your eye look wider. Applying it too close to your tear duct can make your eyes look narrow or crossed.Before applying your fake eyelashes, trim your real ones to prevent them from going past the edge of your eye or getting near your tear duct. Do not attempt to trim your eyelashes if you have never done this before. It may be extremely dangerous especially if your eyelashes are short or if your hands are not steady. Consult a beauty care specialist for help., Nicki will often wear bright pink lip colour. Choose a bold colour that suits your skin tone. For a paler complexion, try a pink or coral lipstick. For a medium complexion, experiment with different, even wilder colours as your tone suits any colour. If you have a darker complexion, try a colour with berry accents or a deeper shade of what you normally wear.To emulate Nicki’s pink lips, choose a pink with ""undertones"" suited for your skin tone. For example, if there is a tinge of yellow to your skin, choose a pink with a cool tone and blue undertones as the veins in your skin appear green. Veins tend to look blue for people with pink undertone. In this case, try pink lipstick with a warm red undertone.Wear your colours around the house for a few hours. This may require choosing several different colours before settling for the right shade that you're comfortable with while still keeping the bold Nicki vibe., Apply liner, colouring your lips entirely. Remove any messing chunks and make sure that your lips are smooth by dabbing a tissue or simply using your fingers to pluck off any colour chunks. Apply your lipstick and smack your lips to keep the colour even and natural looking.Remove excess colour with a cotton swab. Dab a cotton swab over a spot with a concealer after you have removed excess colour with the other end of the swab.Freshen up your lips by massaging some lip balm before using lipstick to prevent unevenness from clumping."

Grow out the length of your hair.,
Cut blunt bangs.,
Experiment with a wig.,
Use hair extensions.",How to Look Like Nicki Minaj2," While Nicki is known for wild and colourful hair, she actually just has long hair that’s a solid single length. So avoid layers and keep things plain but long.Do not use excessive styling products or tools and eat a healthy diet to help your hair grow.


While time consuming, growing out natural hair length achieves the most vivacious look. You can should also part your hair in the center as Nicki would.

, Nicki is known for her blunt bangs. These bangs should be cut by a professional to ensure that the cut compliments the shape of your face. Basically, blunt bangs fall just below your eyebrows and create a defined line straight across your forehead for an extreme look.You may also try clip ins to see if you like the look before committing to blunt bangs. Purchase these hairpieces online or at your beauty supply store and clip them into your natural hairline. They can easily be taken on and off and will immediately change the look of your bangs., Nicki often needs an entire team of stylists to pull off her extravagant looks. Since you probably don’t have the time or money to commit to those type of resources, look into wigs. Changing the colour of your natural hair can permanently damage it while a wig can be easily taken on and off without damaging your hair. Purchase a wig online or at your local beauty supply store.Try a long platinum blonde wig, short puffy pink bobs, or candy coloured and pastel afros as these are all looks Nicki has donned. Make sure the wigs you try have blunt bangs. You may be able to cut and colour your wigs to update your look but be sure to note the quality as some may look more natural than others. Wigs made of real human hair can be coloured and cut but may also be higher in price., If you want to add just a splash of colour or if your hair just needs a bit of length, use hair extensions. They can come as coloured stripes or in different textures of hair. Purchase clip-in extensions online or at your local beauty supply store. These are a quick and easy way to change your look as you can be creative with colours, feathers, and lengths."

Flaunt your curves.,
Work different patterns.,
Pick the right shoes and accessories.,
Shop her clothing line.",How to Look Like Nicki Minaj3," Wear body hugging dresses or plunging necklines if you have the occasion and the confidence. Most people don’t have music videos or award shows to pull off such daring looks but you can still add a touch of sexiness to your wardrobe. Choose outfits that show off your midriff or pull up your skirt slightly to show off a bit of skin.For example, you can wear a roll neck long sleeve crop top, matching skirt, and patent leather strappy sandals to complete a more wearable day-to-day look., Nicki knows how to stay bold with patterns liked pairing mixed print pants with a blazer, great for a more casual look or adding some flair to the workplace.For example, match a monochrome frayed shell top, crepe grid print trousers, a black blazer, and black cut out gladiator heels to complete a patterned look great for going straight from the office to cocktails., Nicki has a flair for the dramatic. She pairs teal Jimmy Choo pumps with a vibrant pink Chanel bag, or a military bag from Marc Jacobs with python knee boots from Bally Ocre. Not everyone can afford her designer tastes but experiment with bold shoe and accessory combinations.Shop at more affordable retailers like Forever 21, H & M, or online.

, Nicki’s clothing line has been released exclusively at K-Mart. Get direct style inspiration from Nicki herself. Be sure that she still keeps her sex appeal and style in her designs. She has also released her couture line as a limited edition release."

, Choose the right moisturizer lotion for your skin type and apply it to your face. This will smooth out any dry patches and create an even surface for makeup application., A doll’s eyes are exaggerated in size and color, so you may want to enhance the color or look of your eyes. If you want defined irises (the colored section of your eye), find a contact lens that creates a dark circle around the iris. These are usually called ""circle lenses."" Novelty contact lenses can be purchased without a prescription.Choose your lenses based on the look you want. Novelty lenses also come in heightened colors (like blue, green, purple, or gold-brown).
Put in your lenses before you put on your eye makeup. You don't want to have any smudges!

, Create the base for the rest of your makeup. Choose a concealer that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. Carefully apply the concealer around your eyes, nose, and cover any dark spots and blemishes on your face.


Repeat this step two more times, making sure to blend the concealer really well. Blending is the only way to create an even, smooth layer.

, Use a powder that matches your natural skin tone; lightly apply the powder by gently blotting your face with a fluffy applicator. Many powders come with an applicator.


Do not rub the powder in—you want to maintain a light look. You want the powder to be seen as this is what creates doll-like skin.

, This is the most important step of looking like a doll because dolls most notably have large, deep-set eyes. You can create the same look using makeup, even if your eyes aren't very large or deep-set naturally.Take a light eye shadow color in a pinky color and apply this all over your eyelids to the bottoms of your eyebrows.
Then use a reddish-brown shade of eye shadow and apply it to the outer corner of your eyelids. Make sure to blend your eye shadow. You can do this using your fingers or a small brush.
After you’ve applied the darker shade of eye shadow, use lip liner or eyeliner to line your lower eyelid. (The liner should be roughly the same color as the darker eye shadow.) Starting at the middle of your lower eyelid, apply the liner just under the lashes, and move the liner towards the outer corner of your eye. Lightly blend the liner outwards.
Use the same liner to draw a line in the crease of your upper lid. Lightly blend. (Tip: If you don't have a defined lid crease, you can create one.)
Apply a dark shade of mascara to your upper and lower eyelashes. You will need to apply quite a bit in order to get the lashes thick and long.
Apply false eyelashes. Choose a pair of lashes with a lot of lashes, but makes sure they’re not too long. You want to bulk up your eyelashes, but you don’t want them to be distracting. Apply the lashes to your top eyelids. If you're hesitant about using fake eyelashes, you can also draw on fake lower lashes with a liquid line. Just draw little wisps below your eyelid., Define and shape your eye brows with an eyebrow gel or liner. In this case, it's perfectly acceptable for eyebrow to look draw on because that's how dolls look!, Use a light colored pink or orange-y blush, smile, and apply the blush to the tops of your cheeks. Next, apply the blush upwards from the tops of your cheeks to your hairline.

, Softly apply a bronzer around the sides of your face. Bronzer helps contour your face and make your cheekbones appear more chiseled.You can make your nose look narrower by using the bronzer along the sides of your nose.
You could also add freckles with a brown eyeliner., Use a neutral, dark lip liner and apply to your outer lips. Next, use a brighter liner to fill in your lips. Blend these two colors together, making sure that some of the darker liner remains—you want definition!


Finally, apply a pink, red or sheer lipgloss, depending on the color you want. This will really make your lips shine!

, In addition to flawless skin, dolls have shiny, perfectly styled hair. Think about how you want your hair to look - Long or short? Straight, wavy, or curly? Natural or enhanced or fake color?


Decide whether you can style your own hair or if you should opt for a wig instead, which can be purchased inexpensively and can be styled in the way you want.
Straighten or curl your hair or opt for a particular hairstyle. Volume is usually a good choice when trying to look like a doll. Many people find they are able to get more volume if their hair isn't freshly washed. Try using a dry shampoo on your hair and them a volumizing product throughout the roots. This will give needed volume to your hair and make it pliable for whatever style you choose.If you want to look dramatically different in length or color, try wearing a wig. You can find wigs at beauty supply stores and costume shops. Don't forget to secure the wig so it doesn't fall off.

, Buy or make some clothing. Traditional dolls wear patterned dresses with buttons and lace. Look for a dress with lace at the collar and buttons down the front. If you can't find the dress you want, you can wear a nightgown or Make a Dress. Embellish your basic homemade dress with lace and buttons. Usually, going feminine is a safe bet to looking like a real-life doll.


If you don't want to look like a traditional doll, you can choose to wear whatever you'd like!

, You should wear simple shoes that compliment your dress. Plain, patent leather shoes and socks with frills will give you a doll-like appearance.


If you want to accessorize your hair, a bow or hairband can give your look that child-like aspect of a doll. If do decide wear a bow or hairband, try to find one that matches the color of your shoes or your dress.

Carry yourself like a teen.",How to Look Older (for Pre Teens)," Look through teen fashion magazines to get an idea of what teenagers are wearing these days. Avoid wearing t-shirts, shorts, and running shoes everywhere and start developing your own style. Tone down the bright colours in your wardrobe and avoid wearing things with logos, cartoon characters, or brand names on them. Try layering clothes for a more mature look.;
, Again, try to focus on mature makeup that teenagers and adults wear. Remember that you don't need to wear a lot of makeup, you just need to wear makeup that makes you look mature. Some good basics are dark mascara and a nice lipstick. Avoid childish makeup in bright colours, and refrain from eyeshadow or lip gloss with a lot of glitter and sparkles in it - it makes you look younger, as these are the kind of things that kids are drawn to. However, a lip gloss with a bit of shimmer and shine is okay, just avoid chunks of glitter.

, Knee-length boots elongate your legs. Try kitten heels; they're a mature balance between flats and high heels. Converse, Vans, and ballet flats are cute too, even if they don't make you look taller. Remember to express yourself and wear things that make you feel confident.

, Go to a hair stylist and ask them to cut your hair to make you look older. Side bangs will usually make you look older, and sometimes some subtle highlights or lowlights will do the trick as well. Look up simple hairstyles that you can use to make yourself look more mature. Avoid wearing childish hair accessories like bows and sparkly, bright hair clips. Use bobby pins or hair clips that match your hair colour for a more mature look.

, Buy some thin, pretty necklaces with silver, gold, or platinum charms on them. They don't have to be really expensive, as long as they look sophisticated. Wear a classy charm bracelet, like a Pandora bracelet. Keep it cute, yet mature. Again, look at teen magazines or some celebrities for inspiration.

, Shower every day. If you're starting to get hairier, consider shaving your legs, underarms, and trimming your bikini line. Also, ask your parents if you're allowed to get your eyebrows waxed, threaded, or plucked. Brush your teeth three times a day and use mouthwash. Cleanse, tone, and moisturize your face every morning and evening. Do anything you feel necessary to keep yourself clean and well-groomed.

, If your parents allow you to, go to a reputable piercer and get your ears pierced. There's nothing to make you look more like a teen than tiny diamond-drop earrings or large silver hoops. Remember to avoid childish plastic jewelry, and instead to opt for silver or gold-coloured jewelry with some crystals on them.

, Be confident, walk straight, and don't be afraid to defend yourself. Just be comfortable in your own skin. Don't forget to smile; let others around you know that this is you and you like it, whether they do or not.

Have good hygiene.,
Get amazing hair and skin for a stunning appearance.,
Enhance your appearance with makeup.,
Be conscious of your clothing.,
Show confidence.",How to Look Gorgeous (for Teenage Girls)," Hygiene is important for feeling more confident, which in turn makes you more attractive. Hygiene gives others a better perception of you--who wants to sit next to someone who obviously hasn't showered in five days?


Bathe everyday and wash your hair every other day. Use a shower gel with a delicious scent (have fun trying different ones). If you are allowed to and actually need to, shave your armpits, legs, and bikini line if you are going to be wearing a bathing suit. If you aren't allowed to, don't worry about it! When you get out of the shower, put on lotion (it keeps you from having wrinkles when you get older). Use deodorant after each shower.
Make sure you brush your teeth and floss at least twice a day. If you have to have braces, a retainer, or other dental work done, don't worry! Usually those things don't actually look that bad, and think about how gorgeous your teeth will be when you are done! br>;
, Skin should be clean, soft, and blemish free, and hair should be bouncy and shiny.


For skin, you should wash and moisturize twice daily. Exfoliate twice a week (baking soda is great--use water to make a paste, rub onto skin, and rinse off) and give your skin a treat, such as a facial, once a week. Always wear sunscreen when you go outside.
For hair, try giving it a final rinse in cool water for shine. Avoid blow drying whenever possible, and never brush your hair when wet. Try using a deep or leave-in conditioner once a week, and spray on a detangler after you shower. For instructions specific to your hair type, see the article How to Have Great Hair (see Related Articles, below).

, If you have any blemishes on your face, put on an oil free foundation to cover them up. Don't go overboard though. You don't need anything but maybe some eyeliner (not liquid), mascara, lip gloss, and foundation or concealer. If you're not allowed to wear make up, then that's fine. Don't worry, because you aren't the only one. Just put on some clear or sparkly lip gloss. Also, paint your nails and make sure they're not too long (you don't want to scratch anyone).

, Don't wear what the popular girl at school is wearing, wear clothes that you're comfortable in.


If you don't have a particular style, think about what you would like. Experiment until you find a style that works, and stick with it. If you already have a style, don't change it for anyone or anything! Be true to yourself!
Always wear clothes that fit you and work with your body type, because a curvy girl isn't always going to look good in the clothes in style. If you tend not to fit in those clothes, aim for a more classy or preppy look that will endure through the years so you don't have to always change your style based on what fits you at the time. br>

, Even if you don't feel it, faking it till you make it is the way to go.


Have good posture and make eye contact with people.
Flash a smile from time to time.
Focus on positive things about yourself, and accept compliments with grace. Store them up in your memory, or even write them down!

To achieve a wavy look, buy a good heat wand as well as heat protectant.,
Inspire yourself.,
Shop for clothes.",How to Look Like Karen Simms," Karen is known for her huge, dark, shiny eyes, so give your eyes a beautiful natural shine by applying two cold cucumber slices (or two cold, wet cotton balls). Pull your hair back, lay down, and gently press them against your closed eyelids. Count to fifty slowly, then pull them away; your eyes will have a natural shine.;
, Blue, green, grey, and hazel eyes are just as pretty.

, Make sure your eyes are dry then select a quality eyeshadow. (Don't go and buy some cheap eyeshadow at a gas station. If you want a flattering Simms look, you might need to pinch a couple pennies to afford it.) First apply a lighter color to the lids, then apply a darker color to the creases. Be sure the tones suit your eye color.

, Get a black or dark brown eyeliner to match Karen’s style. Line both the top and bottom of your eyelids, but don't overdo it (especially if you REALLY want to look like her).

, Get a high-quality mascara and dip the wand in. Set it near your eyelash and blink until there is enough mascara on your eyelashes for you.

, Karen has a naturally full mouth, but there are cheap ways to emulate the look. Get about a teaspoon of sugar or salt. Lick your lips twice and kiss the spoon of salt or sugar, until the majority of it is on your lips. Rub your lips together until they are slightly numb, then rinse them thoroughly. Also, every time you brush your teeth, brush your lips for three minutes.

, Buy a moisturizing lip balm with SPF and use it whenever your lips get dry or chapped. Don't lick your lips! It may be tempting, but it dries out your lips.

, Finish your lips off with a nice lip gloss. Go to any beauty store and buy lip gloss. When buying the gloss, don't make it super-shiny. Keep it moderately glossy, as Karen likes to keep her look natural.

, Karen is very fresh-faced, so the best place to start is with a natural glow. Buy a good acne cleanser and use at least once daily. If you have sensitive skin, ask your doctor or dermatologist what cleanser you should use.

, Buy a lightweight moisturizer and apply it to your face after you've applied the cleanser. This will help keep your skin moisturized and will avoid dry, flaky skin. Make sure that it's lightweight so that your face doesn't get too oily.

, Use a sheer foundation that matches your skin colour and apply it to your face, concentrating on areas like your nose and under your eyes. Put on a bronze or dusty-rose blush if your skin tone is like Karen's; otherwise, go for a colour that suits your skin tone better.

,, ""Done"" eyebrows make your eyes look bigger and your makeup pop. If you don’t want to shape your own eyebrows, have them waxed. (If you’re under thirteen, you can also have them strung.)

,,, Karen has sleek, shiny hair that looks great with or without styling. Keep your hair healthy by washing and conditioning it according to its needs (ex. thin, dry, oily, and dyed hair all have different needs).

, Of course, just because it works for her hair doesn’t mean it’ll work for yours.

, Luckily for you, Karen has worn her hair in a variety of styles including long, shoulder-length, layered, straight, and wavy with front bangs, side bangs, and no bangs at all. Look through some photos of her over the years to choose a style that flatters your face shape.

, Apply the heat protectant to your hair. Once the straightener has heated up, straighten your hair.

, Apply the heat protectant to your hair. Wrap different sections of your hair around the wand and, when you’re done, spray with hairspray or shine-spray to hold the kinks.

, Karen has a great sense of style (and it's actually pretty affordable!). Search for pictures of Karen online to see what you like, what would flatter your body type, and what’s in your budget. Circle the items you like in certain pictures. Do you love the skinny jeans she's wearing in that picture? Or maybe the cardigan? Get inspired by her before going out shopping.

, Karen wears skinny jeans, scarves, heels, and anything else that is frilly or girly. It's a good idea to shop at teenage stores like American Eagle, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Garage, Aeropostale, etc., which are all fairly affordable. If you have a higher budget, try going for stores like Abercrombie and Juicy Couture. Selena loves shopping at Abercrombie and Juicy for occasional clothing.

",How to Wear Makeup at a Young Age," Every girl can have makeup, but your age is an indication of the amount and type. To help you , refer to this suggested makeup age chart:


Use your common sense to help you figure out whether some types of make ups are appropriate for your age and yourself to be wearing.
10 and below - Lip gloss, a tiny bit of mascara (7-10 for mascara).
11-14 - Eyeshadow, concealer, mascara, lip gloss or lipstick. A little bit of blush is fine! Some eyeliner couldn't hurt but only small wings.
15-17 - You can wear any makeup, just not a lot of it. When doing eyeliner, do not wing it. Avoid using bold lipstick.
18+ - You can do whatever you want. You are an adult.;
,, You are beautiful without it, but you can wear small amounts of it if it helps boost your confidence, or makes you feel good.

,, However, save the dark lipstick for occasions.

,, Do not add so much that you can taste and smell it.

, Again, don't go overboard.)The ball part of the eye is the lid, starting from the lash line, and ending at the crease, the place between your eyelid and your brow bone.

# When you are applying the eyeshadow, apply just enough to make it visible.

,, Makeup is to bring out your natural beauty.

,, Try a gold color or a peach colour.

,, Use a concealer, cream foundation, or a powder foundation. Try holding it up to your face in the store, or asking a friend to check if it looks natural.

, Sometimes brown is a good choice, but a thin layer of black is okay too. Just wear what you think looks best. Also, if you don't want to wear color, try clear mascara.

, Try using an oil free moisturizer right before putting it on.

, Your pre-teen years are a perfect time to start a good skin care regimen. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Read bottles to find a cleanser that matches your skin type. If your skin is extra sensitive, look for cleansers that specifically mention being hypoallergenic or safe for sensitive skin.


Try Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser, Clean and Clear Essentials Foaming Facial Cleanser Sensitive Skin, or Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash.
If your skin is often oily, you need a light lotion that won’t clog pores. Try Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture or Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer.

, Use a soft, clean washcloth to gently pat down your face. Be gentle so that you don’t inflame the skin. Give your face a few minutes to finish air-drying after patting.

, It’s important to always apply moisturizer after washing your face so that you can replenish moisture. Keeping your skin moisturized also helps protect it from outdoor elements.


Some moisturizers contain an SPF sunscreen, which is great if you're planning to be outdoors.
If you have acne, try Burt’s Bees Natural Acne Solutions or Philosophy’s Clear Days Ahead.
If you have combination skin (sometimes dry, sometimes oily) then try Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Combination Skin or Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer for Combination Skin.
If your skin is very dry, you need a something a bit stronger. Try CapriClear Spray On Natural Moisturizer or Cetaphil DailyAdvance Lotion.

, If you decide to use foundation at all, use a tinted foundation that acts more like a moisturizer and protective cover before applying makeup. Use a sponge to dab a tiny bit of liquid foundation in areas that require more coverage. You may need coverage in the t-zone where breakouts often occur (forehead, nose, and chin).


A few good ones to try are Covergirl Clean Liquid Foundation, Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Makeup, or Rimmel London Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation. Look for a shade that matches your skin tone.
Test the color on your wrist to see if it matches your skin tone. If you are very pale with pink in your skin, look for an ivory foundation. If you have dark skin with yellow undertones, choose a classic tan foundation.If you’ve never worn makeup before, consider going to a store’s makeup counter. You can sample different colors directly on your skin and receive advice from a beauty expert.
Consider purchasing a concealer stick instead. These are great for covering small areas of skin that need coverage. Try NYC Incredible Waterproof Concealer or Covergirl’s Smoothers Concealer.
Leave freckles alone, as they add to your appearance and help you keep a natural look.

, This will help keep your foundation covered. You can also help with coverage for the problem areas that foundation doesn’t fully cover. Pressed powder also creates an extra layer to protect your skin from the elements. It also works well if you have a lot of red in your skin.


Keep it in your purse for touch-ups later.

, Sweep the eyeshadow on the lid of your eye. Be careful not to go higher than the crease of your lid. Look for an eyeshadow that complements your skin tone. If you want a more natural look, look for light pink or brown shades.

, If you are keeping a natural look, you may want to curl your lashes only, without using mascara. Start at the baseline. Get all the lashes into the curler. Hold down for three seconds, then release.Move up to the middle of the lash, repeat.
Move curler to the tip of the lash, repeat.
Look for an easy to use eyelash curler such as Trim’s Beauty Care Eyelash Curler, NYC New York Color Eyelash Curler, or Sephora’s Sparkle & Shine Lash Curler.

, Blush is meant to look natural and healthy when applied to the skin. Look for light pink or peach shades if you're fair-skinned. Medium skin tones should wear rosy pink or deep peaches. If you’re darker skinned, look for deep rose or plum shades.Use very little blush to avoid looking like a clown.

, Leave your lips bare, or use a very light gloss or lip color. You don't want to go overboard with your lips. Too much color can look too dramatic if you are trying to keep a natural look. A good product is tinted lip balm (pay attention to the shade), or clear lip gloss applied with your finger for a light shine.

, If you have a shiny metallic blue dress, you may want to play up your eyes with the same color. You may also want to try a different color but one that coordinates well with your dress color. Other eyeshadows have glitter or a metallic hue to make them extra dramatic.

, If you want your eyes to really stand out, use a little bit of eyeliner. Use brown eyeliner if using brown mascara and black eyeliner if using black mascara. You could even find fun and different colors such as purple or dark blue. Less is more – apply too much and you may have a mess on your hands.


Apply the liner on the lower lash line. Use a cotton swab to gently smudge.
Apply the liner to the upper lash line. Keep your eye closed while applying. Smudge with a cotton swab.

, If you decided to purchase mascara, apply it after you curl lashes, or instead of curling. Make sure the wand is well-covered. Position wand underneath the top lashes at the lash line. Pull wand straight up. Repeat 2-3 times.


Position wander underneath the bottom lashes and gently curl the wand inward. Repeat 2-3 times to make sure all lashes are covered.
If your lashes are naturally long and thick, mascara will enhance them.
Dip a cotton ball in makeup remover or use cotton swabs dipped in makeup remover to fix any mistakes.

, Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks and upward along the jawline. You may want to try a hot pink color or a color with a metallic shimmer for an extra dramatic look. Close your lips, smile, and apply blush to the round areas of the cheek.Use very little blush to avoid looking like a clown.
Use a small, dome-shaped brush with a flat head. This will help you concentrate the blush just to the apples of the cheeks.
Swirl the brush on the apples of your cheeks using a circular motion.

Mascara can be brown, black or clear. Eyeliner can be brown or black. For lip gloss, choose light colors or a clear one. Also, if you have a light skin tone you can buy bronzer but don't get it if you don't need it because some people just look funny in bronzer. If you want to cover up acne and freckles, don't worry about getting concealer. Most companies just repackage foundation and label it as ""concealer"". Foundation is fine to use. Then just get a foundation or some teens prefer a tinted moisturizer and make sure it matches your skin! Getting mineral make-up is better for your skin as well, even though all make-up can clog pores.;
, You will need a brush for eyeshadow, foundation, blush, and also a blender brush. In addition to the make-up remover, you will need make-up remover pads or wipes. If you don't have make-up remover, don't panic. A little bit of baby oil on a tissue can work just as well, though it may make you break out.

, Use the brushes you bought to apply a very small amount of bronzer and foundation. Make sure to coat your whole face in a thin, even layer (but make sure you don't put on too much as this looks stupid) Also, for concealer apply to the blemishes before foundation/bronzer.

, Start off with the eyeliner. Close one eye and gently stretch the skin of your eyelid with your finger so that there are no wrinkles and you have a smooth surface to apply make-up upon. Take your eyeliner and carefully draw a straight line right on the edge of your eyelid. Repeat on the other eye. Next, you will need to put on mascara. Take the mascara applicator out of its tube and slowly apply it by moving your hand as if you were curling your eyelashes upwards. Do this for both eyes and then move onto eyeshadow. Apply a small amount of eyeshadow to your eyeshadow brush. Next close your eye and use the brush to apply a small amount of the eyeshadow to your eyelid. Repeat for both eyes.

, Spread your lips out so that your bottom lip is completely smooth and flat (you may have to experiment with your face for a while before you figure out how to do this). Then, take the lip gloss applicator and put some lip gloss only on your lower lip. Then rub both lips together to evenly coat both lips.

, Look in the mirror to make sure you didn't get mascara on your forehead, or lip gloss on your chin. If you spot any imperfections in your make up, fix them!

, Feel and act confident, let the world know you are beautiful.

, Right before you go to bed (or sooner if you prefer) you will need to take off your make up. Put just a little bit of make-up remover on a pad or wipe. Next, use this to wipe off all of the makeup on your face. You will probably have to use multiple wipes. You will be able to tell when the make-up is completely off when there is no make-up residue on the wipes. (You don't really need make-up remover; you can just use baby oil on a tissue in a pinch.)

Apply tinted moisturizer on your face and neck.,
Try a compact-powder that matches your skin tone like your concealer.",How to Wear Makeup in (Strict) School1," For those who don't know what this product is, tinted moisturizer is basically a mix of foundation and moisturizer. You can also use a cream stick concealer close to your skin tone, however, make sure that the cream stick concealer is the right colour! If it's too light it will draw attention to the area you put it on, but if it's to dark than it makes your face look dirty and unnatural.;
, It evens out your skin tone and reduces red spots and blotches.

Using the powder brush, apply the blush to your cheek.,
Get a powder brush and brush on some translucent Powder over your face.",How to Wear Makeup in (Strict) School2," Smile as you usually do to reveal the apple (top of your cheek) and apply them to and blend them outwards to your ear. If you're pale, use a pink blush. If you're tanned, use a bronzer.

, This powder keeps your make-up on for longer, and its not that noticeable at all. Your teachers probably won't even bat an eyelid at it.

"
"
For those who want to frame their eyes, instead of using eye-liner, use eye-shadow.,
Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler.,
If you don't have perfect eyebrows, try to brush them into place.",How to Wear Makeup in (Strict) School3," You're probably thinking it sounds weird, but it works! Line your eyes as you usually do with the eye-liner. Brown eye-shadow usually works best, and it isn't too noticeable. If you're really worried about teachers noticing the eye shadow, try smudging the shadow slightly or skip this step.

, You can buy them at any chemist or pharmacy. Another option is those ones which heat up, or, you can use a hair-dryer to slightly heat your eye curler. It is recommended to use some clear mascara after this, because it just brings out your eyes even more.

, Don't use eyebrow pencil unless you really have very very sparse eyebrows."
"
Use a nude lip tint.",How to Wear Makeup in (Strict) School4," It's not as noticeable and not so glossy. You can also put on some chapstick, which is OK to go to school with and apply in front of a teacher. If they confront you about it, just say that it keeps your lips from chapping.

So be yourself, and don't act like someone you're not. It's okay to be different because if everyone were the same, how boring would that be? Very.;
, Designer brands would help. Be creative but don't go crazy. If you don't feel like spending a lot of money on clothes, then just dress nice. If you're wearing the best brands, it can still look bad if they're not matching and worn in good taste. Don't change your style. Enhance it.

, Mascara's nice too but don't go overboard. Less is always more with makeup. Don't cover yourself up- you want a fresh, clean, look.

, If your hair gets frizzy, then use hairspray. Be careful when using heating irons- they can cause damage. There are gels you can put on your hair that can protect it when you're using a straightener or curler, etc. Don't get freaked out. You can still straighten your hair and it doesn't cause that much damage. Just don't use a curling iron every day. Some cool hair tips: Depending on the person, blowdrying your hair can make it straighter, more curly, more poofy, etc. Long, full and shiny hair is a sign of good health. From personal experience, lots of people seem to prefer straight hair. Short hair is cute. French braids are sexy. Long, beachy, waves are really pretty.

, Teeth are the second thing people notice. But most people spend way more time and money on their hair. If you've got yellow teeth, try whitening toothpaste, bleaching strips, and take really good care of your teeth. Brush and floss at least twice a day. Don't leave the house without doing that. Mints and breath strips are good if you've got morning breath. If your teeth are crooked, you might want to consider braces or a retainer. You'll have to look into that.

, Foundations can cover up spots. Blush is nice but don't lay it on too thick. Concentrate on bringing out your eyes or your lips. Use some lip gloss and lipstick and even lipliner if you want to bring out your lips. Don't use too much!

, 8 big glasses a day! Keep hydrated and you'll feel great, lose weight, and get perfect skin! Never go to sleep with makeup. It's not healthy for your skin and looks messy in the morning anyway.

, Try to be optimistic. the glass is always half full. Being stressed makes you moody and if you take it out on others they won't appreciate it.

, It's all about enjoying life right? So do it! Have fun, go to parties, live your life the way you want it!

When you wake up in the morning, wash your face.,

In the morning, after you've eaten breakfast and brushed your teeth, apply lip balm.,

Put on a bit of hand cream.,

During the school day, you don't need to worry about your face that much.,

Nighttime is a crucial point for skin care, since it's a window of opportunity to do so much to help your skin.,

After cleansing, moisturize!,

After that, apply some lip balm.
,

Then apply the lotions.,
Voila!",How to Have a Good Skin Care Regime (Teen Girls)1," This will take away any sweat and oil that has built up over the night. It will also wake you up a bit more as well as give you a shine-free face for the morning. When washing your face, never use soap, unless it is specific soap for face washing. This is a mistake that many girls make. Normal soap that we use to wash our hands and body can irritate the pores on the face and help acne and pimples get started! When washing your face, use a special facial cleanser or even just water and a cloth, which will be enough to keep the loose skin, oil, and dirt to an acceptable level.

Don't worry about aggressively removing oil or other matter from the surface. Acne is a problem of excessive oil production and clogs within pores, not a problem of surface obstruction of pores.
Do not forget the sunscreen, whether summer or winter ,sunscreen is a must. Even in winter the sun's radiations affect your skin.So start young and you will age with great skin.;
, This is important especially if you have chapped lips, but even if you don't, it's still a good idea, just to keep your lips looking smooth and kissable., If you have dry skin on your hands, put some hand cream on in the morning. Just make sure that you don't put on too much, since it will make your hands oily and slippery., If your face gets really oily, buy some special tissues that remove excess oil on your face (available from Mary Kay as well as other companies). Don't wash your face during the day! (More on that later), First, cleanse your skin. Buy a facial cleanser. They help remove dirt, oil, and other pore-blockers. Most cleansers will both cleanse and exfoliate your skin, which are two steps in the '5 Steps to great skin'(more on that later as well)., For teenagers, this is something that can help you have beautiful skin if done right, or give you loads of acne if done wrong. Make sure when you're buying a facial moisturizer, that...

It's actually a facial moisturizer, and...
It's lightweight. Lightweight means that it's not heavy and oily, so it won't add to the oil on your skin or clog your pores. This is very important!

,, If your legs are dry from shaving them, moisturize them. The moisturizer you buy for your legs doesn't matter. Just don't use a lightweight moisturizer on them because it won't help. If your hands are dry, this is a great time to apply lots and lots of hand cream, since it has hours and hours to soak into your skin., You have a great skin care regime! Repeat from step 1 to 8 everyday for great-looking skin!

Buy travel size versions of anything you don't have on this list:

A small makeup bag, to keep all the items in.,
Travel hair brush- (Don't use during class)This is helpful during the morning rush or when your hair is super messy!,Wipes- Great for wiping your face of after lunch, getting rid of messy makeup, and can take the place of hand sanitizer for a little bit

",How to Have All the Things for an Emergency Bag (Girls)," It should be small enough to keep in your bag or locker but big enough to fit these:



 


A nail buffer, nail file, or tiny nail clippers- in case a nail breaks or you get a hangnail.






A small pack of tissues- for cleanups and blowing your nose.






A travel size toothpaste & toothbrush - to freshen up after lunch.






Deodorant- for after gym class.






Safety Pins- in case your skirt rips or something. These are also handy if you forget a belt and your pants are sliding around.






Extra chap-stick or lip gloss- especially in the winter, it's important to keep your lips moisturized.






A compact mirror- To check your makeup or see if you have anything on your face. Just make a quick check, don't be one of those girls who stares at herself in the mirror all the time.






Mini perfume or body-splash- This is optional, for just in case after gym class or when you want to smell extra nice. Be SURE that it seals well, and keep it in a plastic bag or a separate compartment of your bag. You don't want it to spill over everything in your bag!






Mini lotion- This and the mini body splash could be bought at Five And Below, Bath and Body Works, dollar stores, drugstores, and just about anywhere. Most drugstores sell tiny, empty, bottles if you want to bring your standard lotion with you. It could be used when you were running late and had no time to apply lotion, or when you just start feeling dry.






An extra pair of earrings- this is another optional one. If you absolutely have to have earrings on all the time, bring a cute but inexpensive pair, in case you lose an earring.






Feminine items- Just to be on the safe side. ALWAYS have them with you.






Extra hair clips or ties - In case halfway through the day your style starts to fall apart or your hair just keeps getting in the way.






Hand sanitizer- Don't use it all the time or become obsessed with it, but there are going to be plenty of times you sit at a desk and find gum under it, or encounter other icky situations and can't immediately wash your hands

Exfoliate your skin once a week.,
Use a face mask once every 2-4 weeks.,
Use pore cleansing strips to get rid of blackheads.",How to Have a Good Skin Care Regime (Teen Girls)2," Exfoliation does not need to be done every day, as this can make your skin irritated and raw over time. Instead, aim to exfoliate your skin once every 1-2 weeks to remove dead skin and soften it up. You can use a homemade exfoliating treatment, or use a store-bought one. Simply wet your skin, scoop some of the exfoliant onto your fingertips, and massage it onto your skin. Do this for 60-seconds, and then use a bit of warm water to rinse it off.


Try mixing sugar with honey for a home-made exfoliant.
If your skin is sensitive, you can use oatmeal mixed with honey or milk to buff down your skin.

, Face masks do a few things (depending on the one that you're using). They work to remove toxins in your skin, clear out your pores, and get rid of dead skin cells and grime. They are best used once every 2-4 weeks, as they may dry out your skin if used more frequently than that. To use a face mask, wet your face and scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips. Spread it evenly over your skin, and allow it to dry for 20-30 minutes (until no longer tacky). Then, use warm water and a damp cloth to wipe the mask off your face.


You can use masks as a spot treatment on pimples; simply dab it onto a zit, and leave it to dry overnight. Wash it off in the morning, and the redness and tenderness of your pimple will be greatly reduced.
Mud masks are generally the most popular, but there are many kinds that you can find to use.

, Pore cleansing strips are a type of cotton strip with an adhesive on one side. The adhesive side is pressed onto your skin, and when you pull the strip off, it removes any blackheads that might have been present. Pore cleansing strips are generally only needed when you're breaking out. They are usually used on the face (on the nose and chin), but can be used on any part of the body that has blackheads. Follow the package directions for your strips, and finish up by washing and moisturizing your face.

, If you would like, lay them out on your bed and just take your robe or slippers in the bathroom, and after you shower, you could get dressed in your room. Whatever you want.

Do the same with your underarms if necessary.

Moisturize!,
Exfoliate twice a week.",How to Have Perfect Skin As a Teen," Drinking water clears all the toxins from your skin and prevents it from drying out. Take a water bottle with you to school. Resist the urge to glug soda or juice when you're thirsty. Instead, have a sip of water. Not only does this help your skin, it improves your overall health.;
, The skin reflects overall health, so if you nourish your body with plenty of exercise and good, healthy food, your skin will look great as well. Try to consume healthy fats, oils, and proteins every day. Make sure to include fruits and vegetables. At lunch, pick up an apple or a banana and opt for a side salad instead of French fries. Try to walk home or take a quick walk around the track. If your parents or a friend drives you home, ask them to drop you off a block or two away from your house so you can walk home. Enlist in a sport.

, When taking a shower, you want to buy a soap or shower gel that is good for your skin.Unscented soaps are best. Shower gels are best for smooth skin, but there are plenty of bar soaps that work great as well. Follow the directions on the shower gel bottle to wash yourself with shower gel.

Pat your face dry with a paper towel, hand towel, or even a bit of toilet paper. DO NOT RUB! Even though using toilet paper on your face sounds disgusting, it's very gentle and doesn't cause irritation on your face.

, Toners are inexpensive and can be found at your local drugstore. If you can't buy toner, feel free to use a little bit of rice water for a fresh face. A toner will pick up everything in your pores that the cleanser didn't get out (dirt, oil, makeup). It will leave your skin feeling refreshed, smooth, tight and springy. But make sure there's no alcohol in it because that will make your skin more oily and dry!

, Moisturizing is key. From school to sports, we can lose the moisture in our skin pretty easily. Moisturize after cleansing and toning so your skin stays soft and smooth.

But you don't want bobby pins scattered in your makeup bag. So an easy way to pack them is tying your hair bow tightly around the bobby pins.

, Take care of any nail misfortunes throughout the school day with these.

, You never know when your ""monthly friend"" will sneak up. You don't want tampons loose in your purse, especially if a friend will be in it. So keep them in your tampon holder and put the holder in your makeup bag.

Pat your face dry with a washcloth.;
, If you use sunscreen, it should always go on before any other skin products. Allow it to soak in for a few minutes before moving on. You can skip this step if you aren't going to be outside for long. However, dermatologists recommend a daily application of SPF30 or above to keep your skin healthy and looking its best., Moisturizer is especially important if you have dry, irritated skin. Massage a small dollop onto your cheeks and forehead. Wait a minute or two for it to soak in. Or try a tinted moisturizer to cut your foundation time in half.

BB/CC/DD creams are a newer alternative to foundation. They feel lighter on your skin and can include moisturizer and sunscreen. The main drawback of these creams is that they come in far fewer shades, making it harder to match your skin tone., Pick a concealer one shade lighter than your skin. You can either use your fingers or a thin concealer brush.

Very lightly dust the powder onto your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin., Depending on the look you want, you can use one or both. For the natural look, be very careful to pick the right colors for your skin tone.


Very pale skin: Use a light pink blush. You can also look good with bronzer, but you run the risk of ruining the ""naturalness"" you're trying to achieve. If you do use bronzer, pick one that is only slightly darker than your skin.Light skin that tans: Use light to medium pink blush. For a natural look, match your bronzer as close as possible to the color of your skin that gets the most sun.
Olive and light brown skin: If you have this skin type, you have the most options to choose from when achieving a ""natural"" look. Your blush can range from medium pinks to warm apricot shades to copper tones. Just avoid anything too light or too dark. Copper or a shade slightly darker than your skin works for bronzer.Medium brown skin: Mauve or rose gold blushes work best. For bronzer, you can go with either a slightly darker or slightly lighter shade. If you pick a lighter shade, be sure to use one with warm undertones.Very dark skin: Unlike lighter skin tones, a touch of bold berry or plum blush can look completely natural on dark skin. To achieve a natural, contoured look with bronzer, you may have to use two or more shades: a shade lighter than your natural shade to highlight your cheekbones and one slightly darker right below., Use a thick brush and the slightest amount of powder for both.


For bronzer, contour your face by applying it starting from your temples to down under your cheeks. Then, add just a touch along your nose. Be sure to blend well!
For blush, tap the brush very lightly over the apples of your cheeks.When applying both, add the bronzer before the blush.

, If your eyebrows are thin or patchy, use an eyebrow pencil to fill them in. Pick one that matches your natural hair color as closely as possible.


If your eyebrows are very light blonde and difficult to see, you will need to take a few extra steps to make them well-defined. Start by taking a thick blonde pencil and draw your ideal brow shape over your eyebrows. If your roots are darker than the rest of your hair, match the pencil to your roots. use an eyebrow brush to blend it out. Brush on brow powder a shade lighter than your hair onto your brows' hairs to give a fuller appearance. Clean up the edges with some concealer and a brush., Pick out a natural colored eyeshadows only a shade or two darker or lighter than the rest of your skin. Brush the eyeshadow onto your eyelids. If you use more than one color, apply your lightest shade first and end with your darkest shade. Keep the darkest color closest to the lid.


In addition to neutral pigments, you can also add a subtle amount of color for eyeshadow. Use the same rules for matching your skin tone as you used with blush and bronzer. Don't use too much bright pigment or you'll lose your natural look.

, Carefully brush on mascara not much darker than your eyelash color. Apply mascara to only the top lids' lashes. One coat should be enough for a natural look, but if you need more be sure to let the first coat dry completely.

, Either try to match your lips' natural color as close as possible or pick a color that is only slightly different. A good trick for making lipstick look more natural is to apply one coat, dab some off with a tissue, and then apply lip gloss over top.Consider using only clear or slightly tinted lip balm instead. If you do not know how to get your lip gloss on the lips and none on the rest of your skin, don't just put the gloss straight on, get a lip pencil a shade a tiny bit darker than your lips, then fill the lips in with lip gloss or vaseline . If you have picked a very shiny or oily gloss, either get some tissue and press it onto your lips, but don't rub, or press your lips together for 30 seconds then rub them together for 50.

Some experts claim that the best results can be achieve only by washing your face before cleansing.;
, Choose a skin toner suitable for your skin type. This might require you to do some research, as some people have more sensitive skin than others or allergies that make certain toners impossible to use.You may find that a gentle, all-natural cleansing agent is less harsh on your skin.

, Makeup adds definition, color, or contour to your face, but it also dry out your skin leaving your skin looking tired. It can also clog your pores, contributing to skin conditions like acne.Choose a light moisturizer, as heavier or greasy brands may interfere with the application of your makeup.

, Makeup is all about highlighting your best features and downplaying the features you're unhappy with. Consider which features you will want to pay the most attention to, and then determine your skin tone and the colors that might work best:



Pale skin: use light colors. For your eyeshadow, a shade approximately 2-3 times darker than your natural skin tone may work best. Consider a dash of gold or bronze in the inner corner of your eye to brighten up your eyes, light brush, and mascara that is lighter on the bottom lashes than the top.

Normal/Tan skin: light browns will work well with eyeshadow, and pink or silver on the outer side of your eye can make your eyes pop. Your lips might benefit from lip balm/gloss that is darker in color, like a deep cherry. When considering blush, apply only lightly, and contemplate leaving out eyeliner.

Dark skin: brown and pinks might be the thing for you. These colors go well on the eyelid, with dark brown being applied in the crease. Coral or orange colors do well with darker skin tones on the lips. Avoid mascara on the bottom lashes. Wear dark blush., Now that you have some idea what features you want to bring out (or hide) and a basic color palette to work with, you will likely need:


Beauty blenders
Blush (optional)

Remember, a little foundation goes a long way. Using too much foundation can make your makeup looked caked on and far from cute!The closer the color the foundation is to your skin tone, the better chances your product will blend well with your skin.

, Acne and skin problems affect people of all ages, and using some concealer on top of your foundation for trouble areas might help you achieve a cuter, clear skinned look, especially if you suffer from bad blemishes.

, Though this step is not necessary, applying a little setting powder can help with shininess and help your makeup last longer. Lightly apply the powder where you have used foundation.


Oily skin can benefit greatly from the use of powder.

, Blush can be a tricky creature, and if you put on too much it will be noticeable. Give yourself a refresher on applying blush if you feel your technique could use some work. Using only a small amount of blush, apply it with a brush to the apples of your cheeks.Now you are ready to apply bronzer to your cheeks to give your skin a glow others are likely to find adorable.


Try not to contour your face too much. Many people associate the ""cute"" look with girlish features, which are less angular. Too much blush or bronzer could turn your look from ""cute"" to ""fierce.""

, Blend your blush in as evenly as you can. Clumps can ruin your look, or can create uneven coloring that appears splotchy.

, This is optional, and depending on the length of your lashes, might not be an option without eyelash extensions and a heated eyelash curler.There's nothing like the innocent appeal of curled lashes to increases your cute factor!

, To do this, you'll need mascara, and finding one that suits you might take some looking. Perhaps brown or clear will suit you best in place of the classic black, and apply your mascara.


Use a single coat of mascara; you don't want clumps in your lashes!Wait for your mascara to dry a bit before attempting to curl your eyelashes again.

, This youthful shine and soft bubblegum finish will complete the look you've been dying to pull off. Lighter colors will give you more of an air of innocence.

Nails.",How to Get the Look of a Popular Girl," Hair should be trimmed every once in a while and kept looking shiny, frizz-free, and healthy. Not greasy--that's gross. Do cute styles like braiding your bangs, doing a messy bun with your bangs out, doing a poof with your bangs, scrunching your hair, French braiding. The possibilities are endless! It needs to look cute and clean. Straight long highlighted hair with side bangs is ideal, however, there are lots of popular girls who prefer their hair curly. Buy hair accessories like bobby pins, hair clips, hair bands, and Beret's. Bottom line, see what styles in hair are trending in your school and try them out.;
, Soft foundation, some concealer, a bit of face powder, light eye shadow, mascaras, eyeliners, lip glosses. Start your own trends in make-up. People will like that you look nice as well as be you being a nice person. So not too heavy on the make-up.

, This is probably the most important factor. If you're trying to be popular, gradually wear what is ""popular"" (and what makes you look confident) as you climb your way up. If you want, start a trend at your school. When you choose your clothes, make sure they're durable and able to last a long time. It is not worth spending your money on a flimsy shirt.


At some schools, American Eagle, Aeropostale, PINK (in Victoria's Secret), or Abercrombie & Fitch are all what the popular kids wear. At other schools, popular kids go to Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Target, Charlotte Russe, Delia's, or Kohl's. At some schools, it's about the ""preppiness"" with sporty brands like Nike and Under Armor,while at other schools, clothes are about being casual, unique and trendy. If you're creative enough, go to thrift shops or Goodwill and see what you can find. Make sure your outfit goes along with what you think is ""popular""!
Fashions include funky colors, cool patterns, and denim.
If your school's popular kids are more trendy: Look for fashion scarves, V-neck solid tops, skinnies, short shorts, miniskirts, graphic tops and pretty tanks, cardigans, bandeau bathing suit, V-neck sweaters, hoodies, jeggings, tights, sweats, Uggs, moccasins, flip flops, slippers, knitted beanies and knitted gloves and canvas shoes. If you don't like any of these (meaning that you don't feel sociable and yourself in), or if the popular girls don't wear them, it's okay to not wear them. As long as your outfit doesn't portray Dora The Explorer or any ""little-kid"" icon, it's totally cool.
If your school is such that the popular kids are like the stereotypical cheerleader, buy some things from the above and also include cute undies to make you feel fabulous. It's a confidence booster for many. You should also invest in a cute purse, bikini, about five pairs of pajamas and winter coat.

, Popular kids will often wear whatever they think is cute or cool while following trends and putting their own spin on it (so they still feel comfortable and sociable in what they wear). That's the key! Also, cellphones with keyboards, laptops, an Instagram, a Facebook and iPods are good to have. That way, you can socialize with others and keep up friendships! Also, try some flashy accessories. You know, the kind that everyone loves but is too shy to wear? It will make you seem confident and trendy.

, Long-ish, non-bitten nails are pretty. Solid nail polish color is preferred over different patterns on each hand. You can also do French nails.

Build muscle.,
Do short intense workouts.,
Gain weight slowly.",How to Get Sexy Curves (for Teenage Girls)1," Try workouts that are great for your hips, thighs, and butt. Skip the cardio, which will make your muscles lean, and go for anaerobic exercises that will help you get thicker.Do squats, lunges, and other repetitions to build muscle in your butt and get thicker thighs.
Do crunches to work out your core muscles and cinch your waist.

Build your shoulder muscles to create an hourglass figure. If you have narrow shoulders, bulking them up a bit will make your waist more dramatic.;
, Short, intense workouts will build more muscle than slower, longer workouts. Pick a weight or resistance move that makes you feel tired after 12-15 repetitions. Weightlifting, squats, lunges, and crunches are all good choices. Do this every day or every time you work out.When you have gotten into the habit of doing this workout and you are no longer tired after 12-15 repetitions, slightly increase the weight or increase the number of repetitions.

, Curves are muscle and fat, so you need to eat a healthy diet in order to build those. It's not good for you to gain or lose too much weight at once, though, so make small adjustments that you can keep up. You may be able to gain as much as a pound of weight a week safely, but not everyone can or should—talk to your doctor before you start a comprehensive weight gain program.Eat a full meal after you work out. Your body needs carbohydrates and protein to build muscle.
Eat calorie dense snacks, like nuts, hummus, and full fat yogurt.
Enjoy junk food, candy, and soda in moderation. They shouldn't make up the majority of your calories.

Go for tight or draped clothing.,
Wear a pencil skirt.,
Go for high necklines.,
Get a bra fitting.",How to Get Sexy Curves (for Teenage Girls)2," If you drown your figure in thick fabrics that stand away from your body, you won't show your curves. However, if you wear form-fitting clothing, you can make the most of what you have. Wear clothes that fit but don't squeeze your figure.

Clothing that drapes across your figure at an angle can also emphasize your curves. Try clothing that falls in horizontal folds at your neckline or across your hips.

, If you want to add some classic va-voom, a pencil skirt hugs hips and nips your waist. Go for a skirt that ends below your knees: the narrow knee-line will make your hips look wider.

Pencil skirts should fit you snugly without showing your underwear or being too tight for you to sit.

, These will make your chest look fuller. For extra attention to your chest, consider blouses and shirts that are tight at the neckline and bust and then fall away in loose lines over the waist., As long as you wear a bra, it is time for a bra fitting.

Cross your legs.",How to Get Sexy Curves (for Teenage Girls)3," When you're being photographed, or just when you're having fun showing off, flaunt your curves by standing with a jutting hip. Instead of planting your weight evenly on both feet, try putting your weight on one foot. This will tilt your pelvis upward on the side of the weight bearing foot.Exaggerate the pose by jutting that hip a little further.

, Place a hand on your waist or hip. The space between your inner elbow and your waistline will draw attention to your hips and make your waist look smaller.Try dropping one arm behind your jutting hip instead, for a sultry look.
If you're really hamming it up, raise an elbow and put your hand behind your head.

Use tea bags as eye compresses.,
Apply a caffeinated eye cream.,
Press a cold spoon to your under eye.",How to Get Rid of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes Without Makeup1," The caffeine in tea can help reduce swelling and darkness under the eyes. After you’ve brewed some tea, remove the bags and squeeze out the excess water. Refrigerate the bags for 10 minutes, and then lay down with the bags over your eyes for at least 15 minutes.Chilling the bags ensures that they’re not too hot to place over your eyes. The cold temperature also helps reduce any swelling under the eyes when you use the bags as compresses.
Be sure to use caffeinated tea bags.;
, If you aren’t a tea drinker, an eye cream that contains caffeine can have similar effects. The caffeine helps constrict the blood vessels to eliminate puffiness and discoloration. Dab a small amount of the cream under each eye and pat it in gently until it’s absorbed.To improve the benefits of the eye cream, store it in your refrigerator. The cold temperature will further help reduce the swelling under your eyes that can cause dark circles.

, If you don’t have tea bags or a caffeinated eye cream on hand, cold spoons can help get lessen the look of your dark circles. Dip two clean metal spoons in water, and then chill them in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. When they’re properly chilled, place the rounded side of the spoons against your eyes for 5 to 10 minutes.If you plan to wear eye makeup, make sure to use the cold spoons before you apply your eye shadow, liner, and mascara.

Take an antihistamine for allergies.,
Wear a sunscreen daily.,
Use a retinol eye cream in the evening.",How to Get Rid of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes Without Makeup2," If you have allergies, the histamines released by your immune system in response to your triggers may cause swelling and broken capillaries under the eyes that leave you with dark circles. Use an oral antihistamine to help limit your reaction and keep your under eyes bright.Be sure to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter pills to ensure that they won’t cause a reaction with any other medications that you’re taking.
Itchy eyes are also common with allergies. Rubbing your eyes frequently can cause the pigmentation under your eyes to darken. An antihistamine can usually relieve the itchiness, but try to avoid rubbing your eyes in general.
When your sinuses are congested, fluid can build up under your eyes that causes swelling and darkness. Using a neti pot to flush out your sinuses may help alleviate your dark circles.

, The skin under your eyes is extremely thin, so it’s vulnerable to sun damage that can cause hyperpigmentation. To keep your under eyes bright, apply a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher all over your face, including your under eye area, every day as part of your skincare routine.Avoid getting any of the sunscreen in your eyes. It can be extremely irritating.
To avoid having the sunscreen run into your eyes, you may want to use a stick formula.
Natural sunscreens that use minerals such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide tend to be less irritating for the eyes.

, You can help reduce discoloration and swelling under eyes by incorporating an retinol eye cream in your evening skincare routine. Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A that helps fade hyperpigmentation and smooth fine lines, so it’s an ideal ingredient in an eye cream. Dab a small amount of the cream under your eyes, and pat gently until it’s fully absorbed into the skin.Retinoids make your skin more vulnerable to sun damage, which is why it’s important to use your retinol eye cream at night and wear sunscreen during the day.
Retinol is a potent ingredient that can sometimes irritate the skin when you first begin using it. To avoid dry, flaky skin, you may want to start by using the eye cream every other night until your skin is used to it.

Get a good night’s sleep.,
Avoid foods that can lead to puffiness.,
Keep your head elevated while you sleep.,
Use your ring finger to apply eye creams.",How to Get Rid of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes Without Makeup3," You may notice that your dark circles are more obvious on nights when you get little sleep. That’s because a lack of sleep usually makes your skin paler so the darkness under your eyes stands out more. Make an effort to get enough sleep every night to minimize the look of dark circles.Adults typically need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night.
Teenagers typically need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep a night.

, Certain foods can cause puffiness and bloating that lead to dark circles under the eyes. It’s best to stay away from overly salty foods, alcohol, and carbonated drinks if you want to get rid of your dark circles.Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help reduce puffiness and bloating too. Aim for about 8 glasses of water a day.
Certain foods also improve blood flow to the skin, which can help reduce dark circles. Try to incorporate foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as walnuts, salmon, soybeans, and spinach, in your diet., When you lie down at night, fluids can accumulate under your eyes and make the area appear darker. By elevating your head slightly as you sleep, you can keep those fluids from building up. Add an extra pillow to your bed to help prop up your head as you sleep., When you apply eye cream or concealer under your eyes, you probably use your finger. But if you apply too much pressure, you’ll increase the amount of friction, which can cause your skin’s pigmentation to dark. Apply products under your eye with your ring finger because it’s the weakest of your fingers so it will be the most gentle.Using your ring finger can also help reduce fine lines and wrinkles under the eyes because you won’t be tugging on the skin as much.

Be sure to purchase a thermal protecting spray (try Aquage Beyond Body Thermal Protecting Spray), as well as a quality flat iron (see Tips).;
, Ah, highlights! They can take even the drabbest hair and morph it into the mane of a model, and yes, they can brighten up an entire face. For dark brown hair, chestnut, caramel, and honey highlights look cute! For black hair, dark blue highlights look really good and natural. For light brown hair, medium brown and blonde highlights look natural. For blonde hair, choose lighter and darker shades of blonde, and possibly the lightest brown. For redheads, burgundy, auburn, and orange highlights are AMAZING. If you cannot afford the salon, then use Clairol Herbal Essences, lemon juice, cinnamon, rosemary, or better yet, have your friend or cousin who has more experience with coloring her own hair do it if you have never done it before. If you can, try to go to a salon as they are professionals and know what they are doing. T-bar highlights are cheaper and rarely go over $40 per application.

, Smelling good is very important, as it can make you feel sexy! Scent is the strongest sense tied to memory, so you always want to smell your best.. but how you ask? Well, showering at least once a day (hopefully you do that already) and using shampoo and conditioner that smells beautiful. Try Dove and/or Herbal Essences as they have yummy scents and make your hair silky soft! If you are African American try using Motions products. I hear they have AWESOME scents and GREAT results!. As for body wash, go for Bath and Body works Cotton Blossom (Sea Island Cotton) as it smells like you just stepped into a laundry basket, and everyone loves that smell! Follow up with the Cotton Blossom Lotion after you exit from the shower so that you ferment the smell upon your body even further. Now, comes perfume time, there are so many to choose from but nice ones are anything from Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy Girl by Tommy Hilfiger and Romance by Ralph Lauren are the best. Provocative Woman by Elizabeth Arden is also a pretty smell. Try going to a Department Store such as Macy’s or Kaufmann’s to see what scent is for you, and get some free samples while you are there before purchasing.

, If the eyes are the windows to the soul, then the eyebrows are the pretty curtains. Always keep them groomed, whether you choose to tweeze or wax ($7-$10) Waxing really doesn't hurt after you do it for the first time (you develop a tolerance for it!) and can last longer than tweezing. They really do make you look sexy if done right! Another alternative to tweezing and waxing your eyebrows is threading. It has a huge cult following in the South Asian and Middle Eastern community where a person uses cotton thread to remove eyebrow hair. It is quick and painless and has the precision of plucking but is as fast as waxing. Give it a try at your local salon!

, A lot of girls go get acrylic nails done at those cheap nail salons, and although they may look pretty and tempting – whatever you do, don’t get them on in attempt to make your hands look beautiful. Honestly, they destroy your real nails underneath – before they apply the fake nail, the technician saws away at your beautiful nail bed making it rough and course and then applies toxic glue to make the acrylic stay on. You soon end up going every week dropping $15-20 dollars or more plus tips and sometimes you end up in the nail salon for hours! Save your time and money and just go for a traditional manicure every other week or so and take care of your nails at home. If you really do want those long nails, try going to Rite Aid and getting press ons – they may only last an evening but its better than destroying your cuticles. You and your nails will be happy!

, Pearly whites are essential to any smile, so make sure to brush at least 2 times a day and/or after every meal! Don't over brush as this destroys your tooth enamel. Use whitening toothpaste and chew Orbit White gum (it really works!). Stay away from those gross suckers that turn your mouth shades of green and purple, in fact avoid all sugary food as it turns your teeth yellow. When drinking pop, use a straw and place it past your teeth so it goes right on your tongue and causes no discoloration to your teeth. If you want to splurge for a whiter smile, use Crest White Strips Premium. However, use these only once as they take off some enamel off your teeth (this is why they are white). They are a great investment as long as you continue to take care of your teeth!

, A healthy body is important. Gym memberships can get a little steep but it is a great investment! But, there are simple things you can do to keep your figure. Try doing at least 20-50 crunches every other day, and at least 20 push-ups after. This will define your abs and arms, which are very important! (hey, works for me!) For legs and butts, try just walking around – walking really does work! Take your pooch for a walk or walk around a campus with a friend near your home. Or, try going to the mall – you get to walk and shop at the same time! You can also buy barbells and do squats and lunges to stay in shape. Another good investment is the bicycle. Not only do you get your exercise ,but if you ride it to do some of your errands, you help the environment as well.

, For any girl or even guys now, as teens, if we get an unnatural or natural tan it can lead to skin cancer when we're older. So fake it don't bake it. There are loads of products out there now that can give you a fake tan, with no streaks and still be under twenty dollars. Its cheaper than have to get a cancerous part of the skin cut out, leaving a really nasty scar.

, Always take your vitamins! Try a Flint Stone every day, along with a vitamin that has some sort of collagen within it. This will lead to healthier skin and nails.

, Hopefully, you have made an investment with your highlights and your flat iron. Time to get a trim! You should go every 6-8 weeks for a trim as it makes your hair grow so much longer than you thought possible! Always use a heat protection product before you apply any heat to your hair! (Flat irons such as the Sedu can go over 100 degrees, and what does water do when it reaches over 100 degrees? BOIL! Do you want this to happen to your hair? No!) Shampoo, Condition, heat protectant.. and remember a playful side bang is in.

, There is no specific guide to dressing, as everyone is very picky about their clothes. If you want clothes that look designer, but aren’t try JcPenney, Kaufmann's, and maybe Sears on a good day. Also, stores like TJ Maxx and Marshall’s sometimes have beautiful clothing that you have to dig for but are less than 75% the designer’s price. You can find quality Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Guess?, and other designer clothing here for less than $20! Don’t be embarrassed going into these stores, as you see tons of women who carry real Louis Vuitton and Gucci purses shop inside there (which brings me to number 12) If you can't afford to buy designer clothes always, buy a few basic designer items for cheap(as explained above)make sure they're classics, ie: will always be in style and not be out of fashion next season; team your designer jeans w/a non-designer blouse or a designer logo tank w/cheap but trendy shorts, etc.. this will make you look rich enough and at the same time self-confident enough to be seen in less expensive brands! If you're going for a classic look, try your local thrift store. They just might have super cute and trendy clothes. But, if you really cannot get any designer clothes, clothes from Target brands (other than Circo), Old Navy, and Walmart are just fine. They are really cute and can look elegant and trendy even though they are cheap.

, Knockoffs for clothes are OKAY, but for a handbag? No way! If you carry around a real designer purse, people will assume that the rest of your clothes are designer as well. (It’s not a falsity!) Yes, they are very expensive and you will probably have to save your money for a long time to afford one or two. But, if you are on a budget try Dooney and Bourke, as they are usually less expensive than the others – think around $100-$150 for a small bag. Coach is a good choice as well, and is consistently becoming the standard for a quality designer bag. It is also slightly cheaper than the others. However, everyone loves a little Louis Vuitton. Splurge on either that or a Prada bag, as everyone recognizes these labels and can make you feel like a million bucks. However, if you can't splurge, you don't really need to carry a designer purse! If you can't buy one, a solid black or leather purse is fine and it looks really cute too. Just make sure that it isn't a knockoff brand!

, Go and purchase a silver piece – whether a necklace or bracelet. Make this your signature and everyone will assume that you are an heiress. For your other jewelry, go to Claire’s! You can accessorize so much with many cheap items, and while no one will assume it is as good as your Tiffany piece - people will assume that perhaps it was also purchased from an expensive jewelry store. Chandelier earrings are in, so get as many as you want in all different stones and colors. Pink and blue are essential, but try going for black beads as well - black matches everything and can really make an outfit look classy! Pearls are a classic and look very attractive with all clothing whether you are wearing a little black dress or cute couture. You can check out a thrift store for jewelry as well. Remember that you will probably have to shop from store to store to find something gorgeous ,but when you do, you'll have a classic, beautiful piece for twice as less as it's worth.

, Why is this almost last? Well, certainly it is not of the least! Makeup can either make or break your look, and of course the same look does not work for everyone! For foundation, don’t go to a drugstore. Get quality foundation from either Clinique or Elizabeth Arden as these will never, ever make you breakout as they use only the best ingredients in their products. However, for the rest you can just go to Rite Aid or Eckerd. For eyeliner, always use Almay as the brand provides a dark, smooth application as the applicator lines your eyes. Buy an eyelash curler, as well as any kind of mascara you choose along with a white-colored primer – this will really make your eyelashes pop! Use pretty lipgloss, whether you choose to invest in M.A.C. (expensive, but worth it) or Wet ‘n Wild (cheap with good results) your lips will always look kissable! Use a bronzer, again return to the Clinique counter as they seem to make the best bronzer. You can experiment with whatever brand you want, but use what fits your look and budget! A great blush is Orgasm by Nars. It is a beautiful pinky-peach shade with shimmer and has a cult following since it compliments so many different skin tones and shades. Paired with a great bronzer, it gives your face a beautiful glow. Now if you only shop at drugstores, buy some Fit Me foundation and concealer, Maybelline or CoverGirl mascara, any nice blush, some CoverGirl eyeshadow, and CoverGirl lipstick and gloss. You do not always need eyeliner or concealer. You won't even need foundation if you keep a good skin care routine.

, If you want to feel very, very sexy – buy gorgeous undies! Buy some push-up bras on sale at Victoria’s Secret along with some matching panties. They really do make a difference even though no one will see them.

, Have you noticed that starlets are always confident? They don't care about what their anti-fans or those crazed Hollywood gossip blogs and magazines have to say about them, and they don't care if anyone gives them mean comments about their looks. Don't hide behind your hair. Show your beautiful face! Hold your chin up high (but not TOO high), and sit up straight. Pull your shoulders back and walk like you're worth a million dollars, because you are. Believe in yourself and your abilities. Be confident. If you are not confident, then fake it. When others start believing it, you will too!

, Wash your face 2 times a day with a good cleanser and moisturize afterwards. Put on some chapstick. Take a shower everyday. In the shower, wash and condition your hair and exfoliate your skin with a loofah or puff. Pamper yourself with a hot bath, manicure, facial and massage twice a week.

, Even if you do all of the above, you might still look like a drab beauty and far from a gorgeous starlet! Wanna know why? Cause of your slouchy hunch. On the other hand, even if you choose to ignore tips 1-17 but stand upright and walk straight, you will portray a ""gorgeous starlets"" air of grace, poise and confidence. A fabulous posture is the difference that makes the difference so don't leave home without it!!

Use apple cider vinegar.,
Apply crushed garlic to the mole.,
Try a flaxseed paste.",How to Get Rid of Moles Naturally1," Though this method is not medically verified, apple cider vinegar can be used to “dry” out the mole, causing it to eventually fall off.Start by cleansing the top of the mole to remove any dust or oil. After washing, gently dab the area dry. Use your finger to apply some vaseline around the mole. This will protect the skin around the mole from the acid of the vinegar.
Dip a cotton ball into the apple cider vinegar. Hold the cotton ball against the mole and use a band-aid to keep the cotton swab against the mole. Leave it on overnight.
When you wake up, remove the bandage. If the cotton ball doesn't come off with the band-aid, let the cotton swab fall off on it's own. Don't tear it off yourself.
Repeat these steps nightly for a few weeks to see results. The mole should reduce in size and start to flake off.;
, Garlic is another natural remedy for mole removal that is not medically verified. Use a garlic press to crush several garlic cloves or mince the cloves with a knife.Start by gently washing the area with the mole with warm water. Dry the area with a dry towel after washing. Apply Vaseline or petroleum jelly to the area around the mole as the garlic can burn or irritate the surrounding skin.
Use your fingers to press some of the crushed garlic on to your mole. Apply a band-aid to hold the crushed garlic in place on your mole.
Wait four hours and then remove the band-aid. Wash the area again to wash off the crushed garlic. You can also leave the band-aid on over night. Use the crushed garlic method every day for no less than four hours and you should see results in one to two weeks.

, A paste made out of flaxseed oil, ground flaxseed, and honey is a natural remedy for mole removal but it is not a medically verified solution.Get a small bowl and put a teaspoon of flaxseed oil, a teaspoon of ground flaxseed, and a teaspoon of honey into the bowl.

Speak to your doctor about shaving off the mole.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery to remove the mole.,
Clean and care for the wound after the removal.",How to Get Rid of Moles Naturally2," During this procedure, the surgeon will remove the mole without making any incisions into your skin, so you will not need to get stitches. Instead, she will shave off the mole using a scalpel. The surgeon will likely use localized anesthesia on the area before she does the procedure.First, the surgeon will use a scalpel to shave the mole off so it is flush to your skin or slightly below the level of your skin.
Then, she will use an electrical instrument to cauterize or burn the area to stop the bleeding. Alternatively, she may use a solution on the area to stem the bleeding.
She will finish by protecting the wound with a bandage and giving you instructions on how to take care of the wound so it does not get infected.
Never try to shave off or surgically remove your mole on your own. This is a serious medical procedure and should only be performed by a certified physician and/or surgeon.

, Surgery to remove the mole is often the most effective way to get rid of it. The surgeon will make an incision and cut out the mole. Most moles removed by cutting with stitches are done in cosmetically sensitive areas where you want to remove the mole for cosmetic reasons.The surgeon will first sterilize and numb the mole and the surrounding area. Then, she will use a scalpel to cut the mole and a border around the mole. If the mole has a risk of being precancerous or cancerous, the surgeon will remove a larger border around the mole to ensure the mole has been completely removed.
The surgeon may use deep stitches or stitches on the upper surface on the skin, depending on the depth of the mole. If the mole penetrates deep into the skin, she may use stitches that are placed deep in the wound and are absorbed by your body. If the mole is not very deep, she may use stitches on the upper surface of your skin, which will need to be removed by your doctor once the wound has healed.

, After the procedure, you should care for the wound by putting a layer of petroleum jelly or Vaseline on the wound and a clean bandage. You should also clean the wound one to two times a day with water or diluted hydrogen peroxide.Continue to apply fresh Vaseline and a bandage to the wound after cleaning until the wound has healed.

Use make up to hide the mole.,
Cover the mole with your hair.,
View the mole as a beauty mark.",How to Get Rid of Moles Naturally3," If you do not want to try natural remedies or pay for surgical removal of your moles, you can try to use make up to hide your moles. Layer a concealer on top of your moles using a Q-tip or a concealer with a fine tip.


You can also try using specific make up products to hide your moles. For example, a concealer made for hiding tattoos can also be used on your moles, as well as tattoo “eraser” products, which are formulated to hide dark markings on your skin., If you have moles on your forehead or above your eyebrows, you may want to consider growing out your bangs so you can cover the moles with your hair. If you have moles on your neck or around your jawline, you may opt for a long hair look so your moles are less noticeable in these areas.

, If you have tried several home remedies to try to remove the mole and they do not work, you may want to consider embracing your moles. Though moles may appear unsightly to you, many beautiful men and women in fashion and art have moles on their body. Their moles were viewed as a sign of beauty and gave them a signature look. You can also try to view your moles this way and see them as a sign of attraction, not something to be hidden or removed.

If you're comfortable with wearing second-hand clothes, thrift stores offer great deals.;

Learn what a lash dip is.,
Think about your natural lashes.,
Consider the discomfort.,
Review your lifestyle.,
Look at the typical costs in your area.,
Contact a lap dish technician.,
Go to your lash dip.,
Ask when you need follow up treatment.,
Let your lashes dry for 24 hours.,
Sleep on your back.,
Be careful with oil-based makeup products.",How to Get Dipped Lashes," Before you get a lash dip, learn the basics of what occurs during the procedure. You don't want to get a lash dip done unless you are well informed about what the procedure is.During a lash dip, a jelly-like product will be cured onto your lashes. This will make your lashes look longer and increase their volume.
A lash dip performs the same type of alterations typical of mascara. It lifts, separates, and enhances your lashes. However, the changes will be more dramatic with a lash dip and the procedure will last about six weeks.;
, A lash dip is costly and some people experience pain during the procedure. Think about you feel about your eyelashes. If you feel like they're weak and difficult to enhance, even with mascara, then a lash dip may be for you. However, if you can enhance your lashes suitably with mascara, a lash dip may be an unnecessarily timely and costly procedure.If you're considering a lash dip for a big event, like a wedding, it may be worth the money. Many people get lash dips for special occasions so they can look and feel confident.

, For the most part, the procedure is relatively painless. During the procedure, your lashes will be separated with tweezers and then longer lashes will be glued on. If you have sensitive eyes, this may be somewhat painful. The procedure can also take up to two and a half hours, and it may be uncomfortable to sit for that long.You can look up reviews for different beauty salons online. Some salons may have reputation for quicker, less painful procedures.

, Lash dips do not work for everyone. You will need to wait between 24 and 48 hours for the lashes to dry. Up until this point, you should not get your face wet. You have to be somewhat gentle with the lashes as well. You have to avoid rubbing your face too hard after a shower and exercise. Before getting a lash dip, make sure you can work around the lashes so they don't fall out right away., The prices of lash dips vary. Most salons charge between $150 to $300 for the initial dip. After that, you will have to pay for follow up treatments if you want to keep your lash extensions long term.Make sure to read reviews carefully before choosing a salon. A lower cost may mean a lesser quality lash dip. Do not simply pick the place that offers the lowest rates.

, Once you've found a few places, contact the technicians. You can let them know you're looking for a lash dip. See what appointments they have open and ask them any questions you have about the procedure.If you have any eye sensitivities, or wear contacts, mention this to the technician. Contact lenses are generally removed prior to the procedure. It's also safe to get a lash dip if you have sensitive eyes, but a technician may have some advice on how to manage discomfort.

, Once you've settled on a technician, you can attend your procedure. The lash dip should take around two hours. You may want to bring a friend along, as the procedure may be a little boring.Remember to tip. Lash dips are expensive, so the tip amount will be substantial. Keep this in mind when budgeting for a lash dip.

, Once the procedure is over, talk to the technician about follow up treatment. Usually, there is a follow up appointment about two to three weeks after the first treatment. Lash dips generally only last six weeks total, so you may need to replace your lashes completely after six weeks have passed.Follow up treatments are generally not as expensive as the initial cost of the lash dip.

, You should not get your lashes wet for the first 24 hours after a lash dip. Avoid vigorous exercise that causes sweating during this time. You should also not shower or swim while waiting for your lashes to dry.Check with your technician before you leave the salon. For some procedures, you may need to dry your lashes for as long as 48 hours.

, This will prevent your lashes from falling off prematurely when they rub against the pillow. If it's comfortable for you, sleep on your back in the weeks after your lash dip.If you can't comfortably sleep on your back, try to sleep without getting your eyelashes on your pillow. Do not, for example, sleep on your stomach with your face in the pillow.

, Things like waterproof mascara and other oily products may harm dipped lashes when used around the eyes. Moisturizers and makeup removers should also not be used around the eyes.Remember, it is unlikely if you will need much mascara, if any, after a lash dip.

Primp.",How to Feel and Act Like a Queen," Hello manners. The Queen of England (and she's a pretty good example to follow) has had good manners since she came out of the womb. She always says, ""Please,"" ""Thank you,"" and never takes the last French fry, even when she's in a room full of her underlings (which is every room). She's nice to everyone, even when she doesn't feel like it -- though she'd never admit she doesn't feel like it.


A queen would never bark at people, ordering them around. She's nice, friendly, and always lets someone speak, waiting her turn to respond. She spends a surprisingly amount of time listening, considering how important she is!
She's even polite over the phone! And if she texted, she'd be polite then, too.;
, Not literally (though you could). That just means know all there is to know when it comes to this queenly topic. Even when people aren't in the room, a queen has fantastic etiquette. She knows how to eat soup, which fork to use for what, and how to act in any situation.


You know why she knows all this? Because she's scoured wikiHow's etiquette section. If you're thinking it's simple, there's movie etiquette, sushi etiquette, and even elevator etiquette, just to name three...Start reading up now!

, You may think a queen's day is full of mani/pedis and sitting with her legs crossed at the ankles, but it's quite the opposite. She's at the beck and call of her people and is always finding opportunities to help out. She might volunteer at homeless or animal shelters, help out at fundraisers, organize people to action -- anything to stay involved in her community. Since she knows she has power, she likes to use it for good!


So in your life, how can you use your royalty to assist others? Can you help them finish projects? Volunteer at your local hospital or nursing home? Go door-knocking for a cause you believe in? The majority of your day actually shouldn't focus on you -- it should focus on your loyal subjects!

, A queen embodies truth, justice, mercy, empathy, and fairness all in one. She is virtuous and strong and sticks to what she knows is right. She is not petty,selfish or manipulative. So keep your promises. Be honest. Don't waste people's time. And definitely don't be arrogant!


Arrogance is a sign of insecurity. Those that are bullies, that are full of themselves, that think they're better than everyone else are just trying to make that voice in their heads shut up -- the one that's telling them they're worthless. So realize that even though you're a queen, everyone has value. Everyone knows something you don't. So act with integrity -- fairly, justly, honestly, and gently.

, The Queen is always faced with decisions to make, and important ones at that. She hears out everyone's side of the story and then puts her two cents (pence?) in. She tries to accommodate everyone, but often knows she cannot. Whatever the situation, she handles it with tact and sensitivity. She's very diplomatic.


When you're presented with a situation, think before you speak. Weigh the facts, and comment as tactfully as you can. Let's say a friend of yours is going on a rant about how terrible gay people are. Instead of saying, ""Woah, man, you're totally out of line. What the hell are you going on about, you lunatic?"" she might say, ""While I and the majority of people capable of open-minded thought disagree with you, you're entitled to your own opinion."" She stands her ground and doesn't suffer fools, but she does so delicately.

, Sometimes the Queen wakes up in the morning and thinks, ""Maybe today I'll take a bubble bath, have a spot of tea, and go to brunch with someone I actually like."" And then she consults her agenda for the day and realizes she has meeting after meeting after meeting with virtual stranger after virtual stranger after virtual stranger and, better yet, she has to smile the whole time. This is part of the job description. So go into your ""Regaldom"" knowing it's not all glitz and glamour.


And do so with pride and a head held high! Complaining is not really in the queen's vocabulary. She has so many things to do on any given day, she just accepts it with grace. It's all worth it when she gets to spend a night getting dolled up to go to the opera with Michelle Obama. For free, of course.

, Work on expanding your vocabulary and speak clearly. Say each word fully (""speaking"" instead of ""speakin'"", for example) and stay away from most slang and all swear words. Use words like ""shall,"" ""might,"" and ""may."" It's definitely ""May I,"" not ""Can I,"" in any question. She might split the occasional infinitive, but that's as close to the line as she gets.

, You're a queen, for Pete's sake! Why wouldn't you be confident?! You're wonderful and everyone loves you. You're gorgeous, smart, and have great character. So hold that head of yours high. You got the right stuff.


If confidence is hard to muster, start by just thinking positively. The more positive you are about the world, the easier it is to be positive about yourself. It won't come overnight, but a positive outlook can spin the world in your favor before you even realize it.

, Because you are. Most people are, if they'd just realize and accept it. When you commit to this belief, it will radiate outward. Your actions will be affected, how people see you will be affected, and how you see yourself will be affected. If you believe you're capable of greatness, you'll aim for it. If you don't, you won't. Simple as that.


It's easy to strive for 110%. When we reach for the stars, there's a lot of room to fall. But if you don't strive for the best, you don't truly know what you're capable of what you could've had. And a queen deserves the best, doesn't she?

, You're entitled to the things you want, right? Well, within reason. People can always say no, so why not ask?! Ask your boss for that raise. Tell your friend to cut the crap or you're done. Demand Thanksgiving be partly vegetarian this year. If you're diplomatic and fair and full of character (and you are, right?), your demands won't be that out of line.


This is not an excuse to be selfish. Again, your bold demands should be well thought out and fair. Demanding your roommate give you her iPod is not a well thought out, fair demand. Asking her to do the dishes that have been sitting there for a week is.

, A queen is firm in her beliefs and opinions. She knows what she wants and the way she wants her world and the people around her to be. Since she's so confident, she sticks to her guns. She doesn't dilly-dally because she knows what's best!


And those bold demands of yours? Those need to be unwavering too. So when you ask for that raise, look your boss in the eye when you say it and don't back down when they say no. You can lose the battle without losing your stance. And when you don't get what you want, don't gripe! There's always tomorrow.

, Being a queen is not the same as being a diva. A diva is the type of woman who demands someone in front of her spraying perfume and someone behind her laying down rose petals.A queen, on the other hand, knows that she isn't really that different than those around her. They're people, too!


And how does she do this? Because a queen has been a queen all her life. It's all she knows, so it's not that big of a deal. She sits in the back of the room, minding her own business, not needing the spotlight because she knows she's the queen. It's not a big deal. She doesn't need a life-size cut-out of herself in her dressing room. She doesn't need people bowing at her feet, filling every toilet bowl she uses with flowers. She just wants to be treated with respect. That's all.

, And a queen is not afraid to fail! That's an Oprah quote,by the way, and if there's close to a queen in America, it's Oprah. Well, maybe Michelle Obama, but they're probably friends. Either way, she's right. When you fail, you're only perfecting your strategy. So, yes, queens fail. They just know how to get better after it!


The more you fail, the more things you've done. The more things you've done, the better you are at everything you do. And the more you fail, the more you'll know what not to do. So get to failing! You're just perfecting your queenliness.

, A queen, though rarely ecstatic (and rarely angry), is usually content and happy. She doesn't like to be negative or whiny. She's a queen -- what does she have to be negative about?! Life is awesome, so show it on your face! What's more, everyone's happy to see you, so be happy to see them!


Learning how to smile with your eyes is key -- people can see right past a fake smile, but smiling with your eyes makes you look genuine. That is, if you need to fake it. We all need to fake it once in a while.

, Practice proper posture and cross your legs at the ankles. Move gently, thoughtfully, and with dignity. Part of acting like a queen means you are elegant, and part of elegance is gracefulness and posture. How else will people be convinced?


A good way to start working on being graceful is getting into yoga or taking a dance class. Being familiar with your body is thing one when it comes to moving like a queen. And, as always, keep your chin up and your shoulders back. It's your palace, after all.

, Think Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman. Think Helen Mirren in The Queen. Heck, think Maleficent. They all have that regal, poised, elegant walk that only queens have. It's dignified, classy, and sophisticated. Mirror it!


You own the room. You own every room. Remember that. When you walk into one, it's like being home. Regardless of what or where the room is or who is in it, you own it. Why wouldn't you be comfortable?

, This is partly up to you. The Queen of Jordan obviously dresses differently than the Queen of England. There is no handbook they all have to read, no dresser that nixes certain ideas of theirs, no specific line called ""Queen Wear."" But if you want to get more specific: think class. Feminine, modest, timeless wear. That means pearls, knee-length dresses, and a slight heel. Though there's always a time and a place for pjs.


If people look at you funny, it just means you're doing it right. Wearing elbow-length gloves to the bar? Awesome. Pillbox hat to work? Sure, why not? A silk sash? Well, that might be taking it a bit far, but whatever trips your trigger.

, Let's just get this straight right now: don't carry a backpack. Don't carry a hobo bag, a messenger bag, a drawstring bag, or a tote. And god forbid you carry a duffel bag. Just don't do it. Stick to a clutch, an envelope purse, or a shoulder bag. Maybe a carpet bag if it's modest. And inside? Some glass, a bit of money, a compact and a few other small, necessary items.If you're curious, the Queen of England carries a Lauren handbag.While it doesn't have to be Lauren, that's a good prototype to follow.

, Obviously you're showering and using deodorant, right? Well, do a little more maintenance. Exfoliate. Put lotion on your elbows. If you're anywhere near grad school, think about night creams. Push back your cuticles. Deep-condition your hair. You don't have to do it every day, but do make it part of your weekly regimen.


And while you're at it, get a signature scent. A queen's always smelling good. Use it all the time and eventually you'll smell like it when you're stuck in some third world manure plant making business deals with the agricultural head honchos of the area. Or, you know, when you go camping and you accidentally forgot the bottle.

, A queen should take care of herself, sure, but she should also have others taking care of her once in a while! So go get your nails done, your hair done, and your make-up done. Get the whole shebang. Take a day at the spa. Get a mineral wrap. Do something where they put cucumbers on your eyes. In other words: go relax.


While queens don't have to do this part, it's a lot easier to feel like a queen when you have someone rubbing cream between your toes. And when you feel like a queen, it's a lot easier to act like one! Just remember to say thank you!

It's better not to buy really glittery and bright items the first time, because you can end up looking bad and too made up. Instead, choose light matte colors, which are perfect for everyday use.
You can buy a lip gloss in brighter colors for special occasions.

, You don't want to spend all your money on an eyeliner which afterward will cause an allergic reaction. So, search online for reviews, watch some online videos about these products and then make your decision.

, Brands of makeup you'll buy depend on how much money you have. Perhaps spend the most on foundation, concealer and mascara, because your eyes may be allergic to the components found in cheap mascaras. If your parents don't want to give you that amount of money that you need, try to save some money from your pocket money, find a part-time job or ask parents if they can give you more money if you would do some things at home, like vacuum cleaning or washing your clothes on your own or just simply get good grades at school and keeping your room tidy.

, If you're at a loss for what to buy, you can always ask for help one of that girls or guys who work in the beauty-section of the shop. Take your list to help guide your choices. Pick products carefully and patiently, and don't be nervous.

Maybe you can go to the mall with your BF, a person whom you can trust, no matter if she knows a lot about makeup or not.

,, Try on different styles; learn early how not to overdo your makeup, as it will age you and can leave you looking like a clown. It's better if you don't use your makeup at school until you learn some tricks and tips about applying it in the right way.

, This can take some trial and error. First, look in the mirror––do you like the effect you've created? Ask a friend, your mom, a sibling too––the advice of others is very important when you're starting out. Always err on the side of using less. Your own youthful features are beautiful enough already."

Finish with lipstick.",How to Do a Simple Makeup Look for School," You want a clean surface to work on. Make sure your moisturizer has an SPF of at least 10. Try not to wash your face in the morning, if you are doing your makeup then. Most dermatologists agree that not washing your face immediately before applying cosmetics is a pretty good idea. If you really feel that you need it though, why not take an efficient shower before bed at night, and dab your face with a damp towel in the morning? That can really wake you up, if done correctly. Be gentle with your skin, please.;
, If you don't need it, then please do not put it on; young skin often is not ideal for the application of foundation. If you do need it, try to buy mineral cosmetics, as they are better for your skin. Feel free to go for a tinted moisturizer if you need just the slightest bit of coverage. The easiest way to apply this is just with your clean fingers, or use some sort of foundation brush if you prefer it.

, Do this step if you have dark, noticeable circles under your eyes. Warm the concealing cream up with your fingers, then pat it on. If you have any other blemishes, then apply it there, too. Please, blend well. If you go to school with dots under your eyes and around your nose, you may as well look more ridiculous than beautiful.

, If you have a long face, only apply to the apples of your cheeks, if you have a short or rounded face, make long upward streaks, blend well. Cream blushes look very natural, but a powder blush will work, too - whatever floats your boat! If you think your face is a little too round, define your cheekbones by applying bronzer. You can find tips on the Internet about how to do this. Done well and adequately, it will appear that your cheekbones are more noticeable, often making your face appear thinner, or just more elegant. Try this out at home before going out with it as not everyone looks good with it. Ask your mother, sister or friend for advice if you need it.

, Try to use gold, beige, bronze, and cream. Only apply a colour if it looks natural and pretty on you. It doesn't matter what other people wear, or whether or not they do apply makeup. Cosmetics is a personal thing, and only looks beautiful if you go with what suits you. Want to copy the most popular girl in your school? FORGET IT. You will only look attractive if you apply the makeup that looks good on you, and you alone. Don't be afraid to ask advice from those who seem to know what they are doing with their cosmetics. You may gain some valuable knowledge.

, Use black or brown! If you want, a very dark blue or green will do as well. As said before, whatever floats your boat! Try out different styles, but remember to make it subtle and elegant. Don't do styles that are meant for parties and other celebrations, as this can be seen as unsophisticated. If you are dramatic with your makeup, you may be considered disrespectful of authority, too.

, This will open up your eyes even more, making them look bigger and showing off your beautiful eyes! However, if your eyelashes are already or naturally curled, you may not wish to do this. If you are not gentle, you may hurt yourself, so use caution, even if you are in a hurry. For most occasions, don't curl your lashes unless you think that you require it in order to look pretty. Everyone is pretty in some way. You may have heard positive people say it a thousand times, but yes, everyone is pretty and no one can defy that!

, For a bolder look, use two coats (re-dip your wand after applying one layer and apply another one). Bold is different from dramatic, but please try to let it remain subtle as well. Use black, dark brown or clear mascara, or whatever color complements your skin tone. If you aren't sure, you may want to talk to a female family member or friend, just for a quick consultation.

, Use a light, neutral lipstick and finish off with a clear or lightly colored lip gloss. If you don't like lipstick, a well-applied gloss can look even better! For special occasions you may want to apply a deeper color or even plum; it takes confidence, though. Plum is not always a good color for school, but for dark Chinese and Australian skin, it can look quite attractive.

Remove the coffee mixture.",How to Dye Your Eyebrows with Coffee," Add 2 tablespoons (21 g) of coffee grounds and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cocoa powder to a small bowl. Mix the two ingredients well so they’re fully combined.








Be sure to use caffeinated coffee grounds. Caffeinated coffee usually offers a richer color, and the caffeine is also thought to stimulate hair growth so it may help if your brows are sparse or patchy.
Adding the cocoa powder helps lighten the color that you get from the coffee grounds. If you can want to make the dye lighter, add more cocoa powder. If you want the dye to be darker, add less cocoa powder.;
, After you’ve combined the coffee grounds and cocoa powder, add 2 tablespoons (26 g) of coconut oil to the bowl. Stir the ingredients together well to create a liquid mixture.








You can substitute another oil, such as olive or jojoba, for the coconut if you prefer.

, While the coconut oil helps create a smooth, liquidy pigment to dye your eyebrows, you want it to stick to your brows. Drizzle a little honey into the bowl, and mix it into the coffee mixture to make sure that it will stay on your skin.








There’s no exact amount of honey to add. Start with a small amount, and test the mixture on your finger to see if it’s sticky. If it slips off, add a little more honey.
When you’re finished mixing the dye, it should have paste-like consistency.

, Once the coffee mixture is fully combined, let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes. That will give the ingredients time to bind together., To ensure that there isn’t any makeup, dirt, or other residue on your skin and brow hair that might affect the dye, it’s important to clean your face. Use your usual facial cleanser and water to wash your face, paying special attention to the brow area. Pat your face dry with a clean towel.








If you have very dry, flaky skin, you may also want to exfoliate your brow area with a facial scrub before dyeing the brows.
Be careful not to get any of your cleanser in your eyes. Most formulas will sting.

, Before you apply the coffee dye, you want to be sure that your brows in the proper shape. Use a clean spoolie or brow brush to carefully comb them into place, following your brows’ natural shape.








If you aren’t happy with your brows’ shape, consider having them professionally waxed, threaded, or tweezed into shape before tinting them.

, After you’ve brushed your brows into place, check to see if you have any stray hairs. Remove them with a pair of clean tweezers, so you don’t accidentally apply the dye in areas that you shouldn’t.







, When your brows are combed into place, dip an angled brow or eyeliner brush into the coffee mixture. Smooth it over your brows in your desired shaped. Apply a second layer to ensure that the entire area is covered.








You don’t want to apply the coffee mixture outside the lines of your brow. If you’re worried about being precise enough, mark the outer edges with a brow pencil so you know where to place the coffee dye.

, Once the dye is applied, wet a cotton swab with water. Run the cotton swab over any smudges or mistakes that you may have made to remove the coffee mixture from your skin.








You can also use a damp paper towel to remove any smudges, though it’s harder to be precise.

, When the coffee mixture is spread over your brow, let it sit in place for approximately 20 minutes. The longer that you let the dye sit, the darker your brows will be, so you can adjust the time accordingly.When you’re dyeing your brows for the first time, it’s best to err on the side of caution and stick to 20 minutes or less. If your brows aren’t as dark as you’d like, you can repeat the process.

, When the dye has sat on your brows for about 20 minutes, wet another cotton swab. Run it over your brows to remove the coffee mixture, making sure to get all of the residue off.








If you prefer, you can wipe the coffee mixture off with a damp washcloth. Be aware that it may stain the cloth, though.

",How to Apply Simple Romantic Goth Makeup for Prom," First of all, make sure your parents or any school official will not be offended by your intended apparel. Check your school's dress code to make sure you won't violate any rules.;
, Think about your overall concept. What color or colors are represented in your dress? What kind of makeup will match the dress? The suggestions here will work with almost all dress colors and are best suited to dark dresses. Buy your makeup supplies ahead of the prom and try out your makeup before the big night to make sure you're not missing anything or you've picked the wrong colors.

, Even if you want to make a statement in favor of being goth, consider that it may be too crass for the event. Keep your Goth style visible, but not in everyone's face. For example, do not use chalk-white foundation or you will look like you're attending a Halloween party. Instead, use a foundation matched to your skin and apply luminescent loose powder over it to add a nice glow. Consider applying highlighter directly under your brow bones and on your cheekbones to lighten these areas.

, Top it off with powder like you usually would. Remember to use foundation and powder on your eyelids too. This way, the colors of your eye makeup will come out better.

, Dab a little lighter shade into the inner corner of your eye and up to the beginning of your eyebrow. Using a light grey liner pencil, draw a fine curved line up from your outer eye corner, following and extending the curve of your lower eye rim. Join this line with a line drawn from your lid crease outwards (a bit like ""cat woman""). This is a guideline. Fill in the space in your guideline with a light grey eyeshadow and blend so that your guideline is no longer visible. Line your upper eyelid close to the lashes with a black or charcoal liner. Smudge it a little into your eyeshadow. If you want a smoother transition, dip a liner brush in darker grey eyeshadow and apply it just above your liner from the inside to the outer corner of your eye. Blend it upwards.

, To make it more dramatic yet glamorous, Use a special eye glitter. Using loose glitter is dangerous, as it gets in your eyes and can do some serious damage.

, If you like, you can curl your lashes beforehand, but avoid heating up your curlers. This may very likely cause your lashes to scorch and break and you don't want to risk it. Eyelashes grow very slowly and your dramatic eye makeup will look awkward with broken-off stubble lashes. Tilt your head back when putting mascara on your upper lashes and forward for the lower lashes. This way the chances of getting mascara on your skin and having to do everything over are reduced.

, Take a large brush (powder or blush brush) and lightly sweep across the area below your eyes to remove any makeup particles that have fallen down. This is important to avoid looking tired or smudged even before the big night has begun.

, If you think that blush will ruin your goth look, remember that blush is important to even out the proportions of your face. Your cheeks take up a large portion of space in your face and leaving them ""blank"" might make you look sallow instead of vibrant, especially if you apply darker shades around the eyes. *Darker complexions look good with pinkish shades, while fair-haired people look good in peachy blushes. Use a little at a time and apply with a blush brush (or powder brush) on the cheekbone, sweeping ""up and out"".

, Remember to keep your lips simple if you want your eyes to be the center of attention. Consider some nude or lightly pink lip gloss. Berry colors look good on girls with slightly darker coloring (brown hair).

, If you feel uncomfortable with anything, go ahead and try different colors or amounts of your products. Here's where doing a ""dry run"" comes in handy. The most important thing is that you feel beautiful.

Use the same colour eye shadow to sweep a line following where your eyelid crease is, and stopping a few millimeters before the inner corner of your eye. Blend. Add a touch of white eye shadow to the inner corner of your eye to create a bright eyed effect, though be aware that while this will open up your eyes, it will also make them look smaller.

, Use a grey or black pencil to line from the outer corner to the halfway point of your eye. 2 coats of black mascara for green or brown eyes, olive or brown mascara for blonds or blue eyes.

, Fill in your lips using an angled or lip brush with a matching lipstick. Dab off any excess with a tissue. If you want a sheen, apply a dot of lip gloss to the center of each lip and smooth it outwards with your finger tips.

Stay hydrated.,
Exercise regularly.Try to get in at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day to keep yourself healthy.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Enhance Your Beauty3," Try to sleep at least seven hours every night. If you can work in eight or even nine hours, do it.Since the body repairs itself during sleep, your looks – and especially your skin – are directly linked to the amount you get. Lack of sleep can cause your skin to look dull. It can also cause dark circles and puffy bags to form under your eyes.Sleep deprivation might make conditions like acne and eczema worse, too.Sleep on your back to prevent eye bags and puffiness. Using a humidifier at night can also help with this.The recommended amount of sleep for healthy adults is seven to nine hours per night. Try to fall within that range every night.

Know your skin type!,
Find a good moisturizer for your skin type.,
Take note of what kind of products you want to use:


Oily skin: Stay away from anything ""oil-based"".,
Clean your face with either warm water or a facial wipe.,
Apply moisturizer on your face.,
Add foundation.,
Add concealer.,
Under eye concealer is the key to getting rid of dark circles.,
Add some powder.,
Add some color.,
Apply some highlighter or finishing powder, sparingly.,
Try to go for something that is very natural.,
Start with a matte white eyeshadow.,
Apply a dark matte brown eyeshadow.,
Lightly color your upper lash line.,
Color your lower lash line.,
Add liner.,
Put on some mascara.,
Curl your eyelashes.,
Before applying any lip product, moisturize your lips using a balm.

,
Use a natural lip color to complete the look.,
Apply bronzer to the hollows of your cheekbones and blush on the apples of your cheeks.",How to Apply Natural Makeup for School," If you tend to be shiny, you have ""oily/acne prone"" skin. If your skin tends to be dry and sometimes flaky, you have ""dry"" skin! However, maybe you have an oily t-zone but dry cheeks? You probably have ""combination"" skin. People with ""sensitive"" skin might be easily irritated by scents or dyes- stay away from those. If you have none of the above, you're lucky. You have ""normal skin"".;
, A good moisturizer is the base of your makeup, it's like prepping a canvas! If you don't use the right one, your makeup might not last all day- you don't want to appear as if your face is melting! Try to look for anything that says non-comedogenic as to prevent clogging your pores.


Oily skin: Don't be afraid of ""hydrating"" moisturizers. The extra oil production can be caused by lack of moisture.
Dry skin: Moisture, moisture and more moisture! Get a good, water based moisturizer that will hydrate your skin without clogging pores.
Sensitive skin: If you have sensitive skin really gentle moisturizers are great for your skin because they provide moisture without scents or irritation.
Normal skin: Lucky you! You can pick whichever moisture you like, as long as it adds the ––moisture.

, If something says ""matte"" finish, gravitate towards products like that. Powders and lightweight liquids are best for you.
Dry skin: Anything that says ""matte"" can be very drying. Try to use products that say ""dewy"" or ""luminous"" finish. Those products will give you the natural glow you might lack.
Sensitive skin: Your skin can work with most products, just be sure that they are non-comedogenic. This way, your makeup will not cause your face to have a negative reaction.
Normal skin: Knock yourself out in the world of makeup. Since your skin should be pretty neutral, use whatever products you will be comfortable with.

, Make sure all the sleep and particles around your eyes are wiped off.

, Don't forget the neck area. This ensures that your face won't be dry and will have a dewy glow to it.


Optionally, apply a thin layer of primer. At school you will be moving around a lot, especially if you play sport. Primer keeps the makeup on your face for longer and also has a clean canvas for the makeup.

, Since we're going for a natural look, you want to go with something lightweight. A BB cream would be ideal for work or school. Apply this in an even layer, only use one-two small drops. Your skin should still peek through and any blemishes or spots can be dealt with later.


If desired, use a BB cream on all the parts of your face that need covering. BB stands for Blemish Balm, and BB creams are the easiest and most natural looking way to create flawless looking skin for school. Pat a very small amount of with your fingers, then use a foundation brush to blend it in. BB creams eliminate the need for concealer and powder, though if you have a very noticeable flaw, or very shiny skin, you may still want to use them. Make sure that if you use a BB cream it is the correct shade for your skin tone.

, Although this is optional, if you want to cover up the remaining blemishes on your face, it would be best to use one. Go for something that matches your foundation. Often, many brands will have different concealers to go with their foundations. Although, if you wish, you can use a little bit of your BB cream to cover up any more spots, that way you don't have to worry about colour matching!

, In order for your eyes to appear ""brightened"" pick a shade that is 1-2 shades lighter than your foundation. An under eye concealer should be lightweight,yet it should give you some coverage.

, Powder is optional, but only if you don't want your makeup to last. Just like foundations and concealers, you should use a powder for your skin type. This way, they won't dry you out or leave you looking like a cake face. Also, remember that powder should match your foundation and concealer. Apply this with a fluffy powder brush or the powder puff that comes with the product. Do so lightly and gently.


Note for oily skin/sensitive skin, if you used a powder foundation, skip this step.

, Blush can help to bring life back into your face! Make sure to use the right color for your skin tone. Sweep this across the apples of your cheeks to create a ""barely there"" look.

, Use your fingers to apply highlighter above your cheekbones, on your temples, down your nose, above your top lip on the area known the your 'cupid's bow', and just under your eyebrows. This creates a dewy, flawless look. Highlighter can also be used on your eyelids in place of eyeshadow, depending on how much makeup you want to wear. Don't use too much as you can look too shiny and greasy.

, If you would like to use eyeshadow, sweep a neutral shimmery shade over your lid. Pat a lighter shade in your inner core to brighten your eyes Take a slightly darker shade and place that in your crease. Blend this out to create a soft, defined look.

, Apply this on the centre of the lid to create more structure to the eyes. Also apply this on the brow bone, inner corner of the eyes and near the tear ducts. This will highlight your eyes and make them seem more awake.


Optionally, apply eye primer on your eyelids, first. This keeps eyeshadow lasting longer and also makes the shadow more vibrant.

, Either using a blending brush or your fingertips, work this around the outer V and crease of the eyes. Only use a little bit or else this will look too dirty. This creates depth to the eyes.

, Using the same brown eyeshadow, take a liner brush and line your upper lash line. Remember to use small 'dabs' and keep it as close to the lash line as possible.


If you want to strengthen and deepen the look, add some black matte eyeshadow to the outer third of the upper lash line. The black will look less harsh against the powdery brown.

, Using the same brown shadow, apply this on the outer third of the lower lash-line. Use a Q-tip or your fingers and smudge this outwards to give it a more natural look.


Alternatively, try white eyeliner on the lower rim of your eyes. This is the bit just above your bottom lashes. Also, put a dot of white eyeliner or highlighter on the inner corners of your eyes. Both of these steps make you look more awake and make your eyes look bigger.

, A gel or pencil liner is perfect for a natural look. Brown works well for light to fair skin tones and black is perfect for medium to dark skin tones. Pencil liner is the easiest to work with, so if you are a beginner start with that.


To widen your eyes, start in the center of your eye. Drawing close to the lash line, draw a straight smooth line until you reach the outer corner. Blend this out with your ring finger to diffuse this look.
If you want to define and thicken your lower lash line, start in the center of your waterline, and draw a line to the outer corner of your eye.
Use a white eyeliner on your waterline to brighten your eyes overall.

, Mascara really helps to define your eyes. It completes your eye look. To apply, use a wiggle technique to avoid any clumps.

, This will make them stand out and look longer and more voluminous, but is less obvious than mascara. If you do decide to use mascara, use a dry formula to create a more natural look.

,, You could use a matte nude lip color. Anything two shades lighter or darker is okay and looks the most natural. Apply a sheer lip gloss over it.

, Don't use too much.


Alternatively, try a lip and cheek tint for a natural, rosy look. Apply a small dot in the center of each lip and use a lip brush to blend it out. Do the same with your cheeks, but use your fingers or your foundation brush. Be as fast as you can when blending, because these products tend to dry very fast, but they also last a very long time, so you won't have to reapply at school.

Apply a nude pink, shimmery clear, or pastel pink/red to your lips.",How to Apply Tween Makeup1," This includes mascara, a subtle eyeshadow that matches the color of your skin, lip gloss, concealer, and blush or bronzer. You can choose either lip gloss or lipstick, but please avoid using both. Keep in mind that lipstick lasts much longer and looks more sophisticated and subtle, while lip gloss is more moisturizing, but does not last as long. However, lip gloss is easier to slather on at school, whereas a compact mirror is often required for applying lipstick. Use eyeliner only if you feel that your eyes are a little too small, and that you would like to enhance their beauty.;
, Only apply taupe (This is the light sparkly brown), light pink, light purple, so basically pastels, lip gloss and, if you need it, foundation.

, Blend into dark or red areas slowly. Check in a lighted space.

, Gently stretch your lower lid down and pencil in a thin line, close to the lashes. Smudge slightly with a cotton bud.

, Stop just above the crease. If you prefer the dewy look, then get a hazelnut color and spread that into the crease and at the outer corner of your eyes.

, Dip a fluff-brush in the blush/powder and spread it to the tops of your cheeks, just in between your eyebrows and just under your chin. Yes, under your chin! Blend well with your ring finger so that it's not very noticeable; but still adds some color to your skin.

, Then take your lip-color of choice and hold it steady in your hand. Lipstick is best because it sticks to your lips but doesn't look fake, but gloss is good, too. As long as it's not shiny.

, For school, a light liquid foundation or powder-based foundation is good for natural looking skin. If you don't have spot-prone skin, or you don't feel you need foundation, apply a light powder to areas which are the oiliest or most problematic.

, Apply this with a large brush to matt all areas of the face well and to avoid patchy skin.

, Apply loose powder gently over your primer/concealer, then take your highlight colour and apply lightly beneath your eyebrows. Then take your crease or brow bone colour and apply it lightly where you would like to have definition, and blend.

However, like many things in life, less is always more. So keep your beauty routine simple by sticking to the basics. All you need are a good cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Keeping your beauty routine simple will cut back on waste.For example, the ingredients in eye creams only vary slightly from the ingredients in your basic face moisturizer. Unless you have specific eye needs that you'd like to meet or you have very sensitive skin, you can use a moisturizer.
You also do not need ten different face creams that do the same thing. Stick to a product you like. If you try a product and do not like it, pass it on to a friend or family member instead of throwing it away.;
, Multi-use products mean less waste, as well as cost. Look for all-in-one make-up sticks that can be used on your lips, eyes, and cheeks. Additionally, opt for moisturizers that double as sunscreen.Dr. Bonner’s 18-in-1 pure-castile liquid soap can double as a shampoo and a skin cleanser.
Eyebrow pencils can double as day-time eyeliner.
Turn the remaining amounts of your eyeshadow into an eyeliner by applying it with a thin brush dipped in Visine.

, When using a product, try not to slather it on. A small amount of product will go a long way. Additionally, when you use a product, use the product in its entirety. Squeeze out and use every ounce of your product.Purchase a tube wringer so you can get the most out of your products.

, Monitor how frequently you wash your hair. If you wash your hair five times a week or every day, then you are washing too much. Washing your hair too frequently strips your hair of its natural oils and leaves a residue. It is recommended that you wash your hair only twice or three times a week.Use a dry shampoo in between washes to minimize oil in your hair.
Minimizing your shampooing will also save water and electricity.

, While brushing your teeth, washing your face, and doing other activities at the sink, turn off your faucet. Also, be conscious about the amount of time you spend in the shower. Shaving off two to four minutes can save four to eight gallons of water.Try installing a water-saving showerhead to reduce your water output.
Use biodegradable, rinse-free facial wipes instead of the traditional water and cleanser routine to wash your face. Try this a few times during the week., Use make-up brushes and hairbrushes made from recycled or sustainable materials, like bamboo. Use brushes that have synthetic bristles as opposed to real animal hair. Additionally, opt for energy-saving blow dryers to reduce the amount of electricity you use while styling your hair.Unplug hairstyling tools when you are not using them.
EcoTools has a great line of sustainable products.

, Origins will recycle used make-up products from any brand if you drop them off. Additionally, Aveda stores will create new caps out of recycled caps (like the hard ridged ones on toothpaste bottles) if you drop them off at their stores.MAC will give you a free lipstick for every six lipsticks you bring back to recycle.These deals are U.S.-specific; they may not apply in other countries.

, Also, buy brands that use glass to package their products. Glass is easy to recycle, and you can re-use glass jars for other purposes.To cut back on waste, opt for bar soap instead of body wash, which comes in plastic bottles.
The packaging of products that you can buy from Lush, Olivine Atelier, The Honest Company, Blue Avocado, and S.W. Basics is minimal, recyclable, and sustainable. For instance, Blue Avocado's products are made from 50 percent post-consumer recycled bottle fabric., Try to avoid products whose containers have the #3 recycling code, as well as a “V,” which refers to polyvinyl chloride or PVC. PVC poses great environmental hazards, as well as health hazards.Instead, opt for plastic containers with the #1 recycling code, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These plastics are most frequently accepted by municipal curbside recycling programs. They are also considered safe in terms of health.
Visit Earth911.org to find a polypropylene recycler in your neighborhood.

, The “natural” and “all-natural” labels that grace the bottles of many products may still contain toxic chemicals and additives. This is because the federal government does not regulate these labels. Choose organic products instead. These products contain the USDA organic seal.Stay away from products that contain petroleum byproducts. Identify products that contain petroleum byproducts by looking for mineral oil, petrolatum, or paraffin in the label.
Check your products in the Environmental Working Group’s database at EWG.org/skindeep to see how they score on the toxicity scale.
Check to see if the brand you buy your products from has signed the “Compact for Safe Cosmetics” at safecosmetics.org. Companies who have signed this pact pledge to replace harmful chemicals in ingredient lists with alternatives. Alternatives that are safer for the environment, as well as your health.

, This is the best way to know exactly what goes into your skincare products. Using homemade products will also minimize your environmental waste. Make homemade face masks, toners, and shampoos.Make a face mask by combining ½ cup of yogurt, ¼ cup of honey, and ½ cup of blended cucumber. Apply to your face, let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse off.Make a body scrub by combining 1 cup of coffee grounds, ¼ cup of raw sugar or sea salt, and 1/3 cup of essential oil. Mix and apply to wet skin in a circular motion, then rinse., When in doubt, make an appointment with your dermatologist. Tell your dermatologist that you are adjusting your beauty routine and that you would like to use products that are safe for both the environment and your health. Your dermatologist should be able to recommend some great products, as well as alternative ways to care for your skin, like exercise and diet.


You might also ask your dermatologist, ""what other exercise and dietary advice can you give to help me keep my skin and hair healthy?""

Smile!",How to Apply Makeup That Looks Good for School," Start by washing your face. If you have bad acne, use a face wash that is right for your skin and does not dry it. (products such as Proactiv, Clean&Clear, Neutrogena, etc.) If you only get some blemishes, washing your face with just a warm cloth and soap is perfect!;
, Make sure your foundation is the right color for you - otherwise you will look ridiculous! Put just a thin layer on that blends well with your skin. This will also help you use less concealer.

, Find a concealer that is right for your skin tone, and make sure you do not over-apply. Only use it on blemishes and dark circles: the powder or foundation will do the rest. If you have lots of blemishes use a thicker concealer. With a thicker concealer, apply it with a small brush and then blend it in with a bigger brush. You can also use your fingers: some makeup artists say this blends the concealer better.

, First, apply a primer to your eyelids if desired. This sometimes will help make sure that your eyeshadow won't go cakey and can help it to stay on longer. If you are going to wear eyeliner, do it before the eyeshadow as you can always touch it up after. When you apply eyeliner make sure you apply it as low on the lash line as possible. After your eyeliner, apply your eyeshadow. When choosing a color, make sure it matches your clothing, skin tone and eye color. Also, if you are a first time makeup wearer, be sure to start neutral. You do not want to go to school one day with no makeup then come back the next day with a ton of makeup.

, (This step is optional!) Make sure you smile when applying your blush. This will help you to get it on the ""apples"" of your cheeks, which is the part of your cheeks that protrude when you smile hard. Go with a color that matches your skin tone well!

, Use a mascara that is right for your lashes and the look you are going for (such as volume, length, or both). Apply mascara to both the top and bottom lashes, as this makes it look more even and it makes you look more awake. If you are dark-haired, use a black mascara, and if you are blonde, stick to brown. Applying too much mascara can lead to your eyelashes looking caked and messy! Be cautious.

, You can either use a gloss for a more young, perky look, or a solid lipstick for a more mature look. Find a lip colour that is one or two shades darker or lighter then your lips. Never more.

Consider stating the price.",How to Describe a Ring," When describing a ring, it helps to know how professional jewelers refer to each part.The band refers to the portion of the ring that actually wraps around your finger.
The shank can refer to the band as a whole, but it more commonly refers to the portions of the ring that sit on either side of a gemstone.
The gallery is the underside of the band and is the portion that actually sits on top of the finger.;
, Ring bands can be made from a variety of base metals, but gold, platinum, silver, tungsten carbide, titanium, and palladium are the most common options.Gold bands are classic and available in multiple colors. Yellow gold is the purest and most traditional. White gold is created when yellow gold is plated with rhodium, and rose gold is created when a copper alloy is mixed into the metal. Purity is indicated by karat size. Larger karats indicate greater purity.
Platinum is almost always 95 percent pure. It is a white metal that is very durable, heavy, and naturally hypoallergenic.
Silver is a white-gray metal that is very soft and weak against damage, so it tends to be an inexpensive choice. It is more commonly used in fashion rings than in engagement or wedding rings.
Tungsten carbide is gray metal made from tungsten and carbon. It is very hard, heavy, and durable. Even though it retains is luster, it cannot be cut and re-soldered due to its durability, so bands made with it cannot be re-sized.
Titanium has a naturally gray finish but is sometimes polished black. It is as strong as steel but as light as aluminum and is a popular choice for men's rings. The metal is also hypoallergenic.
Palladium is silver-white in color. It does not tarnish and is both hypoallergenic and flexible.
Rings may also use recycled materials. Recycled metal can come from a variety of sources and will take on the traits of its dominant metal., A ring may include special designs or other features that are not common enough to categorize. Even though there is no way to categorize these characteristics, you should still describe them when describing the ring.


Metalwork designs are a common example of such characteristics. For example, the band might be designed to mimic the shape of leaves, or there might be a carefully crafted wire flower centered in place over an otherwise simple band.
Another special feature worth mentioning might be an engraving. Most engravings are personal in nature. They can either be placed on the gallery of the ring or on the top surface of the band.

, Some rings consist of nothing more than a solid metal band. Others include one or more gemstones. The latter must be described in further detail since you'll need to elaborate on the gemstone type, quality, and placement.

, The setting style of a ring refers to the placement of gemstones along the ring. There are many different settings to choose from.The channel setting has two metal tracks with a row of tiny gemstones in between.
The bezel setting places a single gemstone within a thin, flat piece of protective metal.
With a pave setting, one large stone sits at the center of the band while the rest of the band is covered by many small stones.
In a prong setting, thin metal ""claws"" extend up from the band to hold a center gemstone in place. There will usually be four to six of these metal prongs.
There can also be shared prong settings in which small adjacent stones share prongs with the large center stone.
A cluster setting places one large gemstone at the center of the band and surrounds this gemstone with smaller outward facing gems on all sides.
In a gypsy setting, the stone or stones are sunk into holes along the band of the ring. As a result, the stones are flush with the band's surface. For that reason, this can also be referred to as a “flush” setting.
A tension setting is similar to a gypsy or flush setting, but the holes are more shallow and the gemstones rise about the surface of the band. Tension alone holds each stone in place.
With a bar setting, small gemstones encircle the entire ring and small metal bars separate each one from the next.
With an invisible setting, special grooves are cut into the band that allow the gemstones to sit securely in place without metal bars or prongs holding them up.

, Identify the center gemstone. If the ring has more than one gemstone, you will need to name each one.


Diamonds are a popular gemstone, especially for engagement rings. They also happen to be the birthstone for the month of April. Cubic zirconia looks similar but is less radiant and much less expensive.
Other popular birthstones include: garnet (January), amethyst (February), aquamarine (March), emerald (May), alexandrite (June), pearls (also June), ruby (July), peridot (August), sapphire (September), opal (October), tourmaline (also October), topaz (November), tanzanite (December), turquoise (also December), and zircon (also December).
Additional gemstones you might find are citrine (ranging in color from yellow to orange-brown), jade (bright green), lapis lazuli (dark blue), moonstone (typically colorless), morganite (soft pinks and peaches), onyx (black), paraiba tourmaline (electric blues and greens), and spinel (bright red)., In simple terms, the cut of a stone refers to the shape of the stone. Accent stones tend to be square or round, but the center stone can come in a wide variety of cuts.The round cut or brilliant cut is the most popular shape. It features a round crown and girdle with a smaller conical base.
The oval cut has a symmetrical oval crown.
The princess cut is a square cut.
The banquette cut looks like a narrow triangle.
The triangle cut has a triangular crown.
Marquise cut stones are almond-shaped or football-shaped.
Pear cuts are also known as teardrop cuts. The top of the crown is pointed and the bottom is rounded.
Heart shaped stones are, as the name suggests, shaped like hearts.
The emerald cut looks like a tall rectangle with cut corners.
The radiant cut is a blend between the emerald and brilliant cuts. The outer shape looks like an emerald cut but faces are strategically placed to refract light like a brilliant cut would.
Trillion or trilliant cuts look like triangles with curved sides.

, The carat is the standard unit of measurement used to weigh gemstones. A larger carat size indicates a larger stone.


One carat equals 200 milligrams.Gemstones can also be measured in size, but when describing the stone, you would usually only mention the carat weight.

, Naming the type of gemstone does not adequately describe the color of the stone. Color is broken down further into three separate characteristics: hue, tone, and saturation.


The hue refers to the primary color of the stone. Some stones only come in one hue, but others are available in multiple hues. For instance, jade is always green, but moonstone can be colorless, gray, brown, yellow, green, or pink.
Tone simply refers to how light or dark the color of the stone appears.
Saturation is the intensity of color. Stones with bright, vivid colors are more saturated than stones with a light tint of color.

, Gemstone clarity essentially refers to the amount of inclusions contained within the stone. Stones with fewer inclusions have greater clarity.


Inclusions are cracks and cuts that are visible from inside the stone.
Some accidental inclusions decrease the value of a stone while carefully crafted inclusions can increase its value. Certain gemstone types are more likely to have inclusions than others.

, Oftentimes, rings are purchased with a specific meaning or purpose in mind. You would usually label such a ring by it intended purpose without giving the matter a second thought.


Engagement rings and wedding rings are the most obvious examples.
Birthstone rings might be given as a special gift for someone's birthday.
Class rings are usually worn to acknowledge and celebrate one's high school or college graduation class.

, When describing your ring, you may also indicate the size of the ring. Sizes are based on the diameter of the ring band.


Adult ring sizes usually range from size 4.5 to size 13.Size 4.5 rings are 0.58 inches (14.8 mm).
Size 5 rings are 0.61 inches (15.6 mm).
Size 6 rings are 0.65 inches (16.45 mm).
Size 7 rings are 0.68 inches (17.3 mm).
Size 8 rings are 0.72 inches (18.2 mm).
Size 9 rings are 0.75 inches (19 mm).
Size 10 rings are 0.78 inches (19.9 mm).
Size 11 rings are 0.81 inches (20.6 mm).
Size 12 rings are 0.84 inches (21.4 mm).
Size 13 rings are 0.87 inches (22.2 mm).

, Most rings stand alone, but some rings are sold in sets. Each ring in the set may look slightly different, but the overall design of all rings in the set will share some similarities.


Engagement rings are sometimes sold in sets with wedding bands.
Simple fashion rings may also be purchased in sets, but this is slightly less common.

, Including the cost of the ring in your description is not often necessary, but there are times when the circumstances may warrant it.


Always state the price in clear terms if you are describing a ring you want to sell.
Mention the price if you are debating whether or not to purchase a ring and are describing it to someone who may help you reach that decision.
Typically, you would not mention the price of a ring you already own when you are only describing it to friends or acquaintances.

Dye pubic hair.",How to Deal With Pubic Hair," It's not just the hair on your head that needs washing -- your pubic hair needs a little love and attention too. Every time you take a shower or bath, use a gentle, fragrance-free soap to wash the pubic hair. Be gentle -- pulling the hair down there can hurt!


Your regular shampoo or body wash is too harsh to use on the sensitive skin down south, so don't put it anywhere near your pubic region. Use an uncolored, non-fragrant bar of soap reserved specifically for that area. Don't rub it directly on the pubic hair - lather it up on your hands first.
Also be very careful to avoid getting soap on or inside genitals, as it can cause irritation and itchiness. This is especially important for women, as even the gentlest soap can upset the PH balance of the vagina, leading to inflammation or infection.;
, Even if hair removal isn't your style, you'll probably want to keep your pubic hair looking neat. The best way to do this is to give yourself a haircut! The best instrument to use is a small nail scissors, preferably one with blunted ends. This will allow you the greatest maneuverability and least chance of cutting yourself. Just be sure to set it aside, somewhere private, for pubic hair use only.


Don't use large scissors, as these can be awkward (and therefore more dangerous) to use. You can use an ear or nose hair trimmers in a pinch, but make sure it has a guard you can place over the blades to protect yourself. Never use an electric razor with rotating heads, as these are painful to use in the pubic region.
To trim the pubic hair, pull the hair away from the body and slowly and carefully snip it away, as close to the skin as you feel comfortable with. If you prefer, run a comb through the hair first, then snip the hair protruding through the fingers of the comb. You will have to rely on feel for most of the trimming process, though you should visually check your progress with a hand-held mirror at regular intervals.
Make sure that you clean up any fallen hair after you're done trimming, as leaving pubic hairs lying around the bathroom (especially a shared one) is a major faux pas. If possible, do your trimming over the toilet bowl, that way you can easily flush away any fallen hairs when you're done. Many think trimming is the best way to do it.

, Shaving is probably the most common option when it comes to pubic hair removal, as it is cheap, easy, relatively painless, and embarrassment free. You will need some gentle, unfragranced shaving cream or gel (both men and women should use a women's shaving cream, as it is the gentlest), preferably one designed specifically for removing pubic hair, and a new razor (dull blades will be less effective and can cause irritation).


First, trim the hair from the areas you intend to shave -- you can choose to just remove the hair around the bikini or brief line, or you can go the whole hog and remove it all. Razors work best and cause the least pulling and irritation on short hair, so aim to trim the hair to about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in length.
Soften the hair using hot water in the bath or shower for 3 to 5 minutes before you shave. Alternatively, you can apply a warm compress to the area to achieve the same effect. Apply your chosen shaving cream to the area, taking care to avoid the genitals. It may be wise to test the shaving cream on a small patch of skin 24 hours before shaving, as some creams may cause an allergic reaction.Pull the skin around your pubic area taut using your free hand -- shaving works best on flat surfaces. Begin shaving, without applying any pressure to the razor (if you need to apply pressure, your razor is too dull). Shaving upwards (against the direction of hair growth) will give you the closest, smoothest shave, while shaving downwards (with the hair growth) will minimize irritation for people with sensitive skin and reduce the risk of developing ingrown hairs.Once you've removed the desired amount of hair, wash the area thoroughly with warm water to remove any cream, pat the area dry with a clean towel, then apply a soothing lotion to reduce irritation.

, Depilatory creams are a good option for people who just want to tidy up their bikini or brief line, with as little pain as possible. These hair removal creams work by using strong chemicals which actually dissolve the hair so it can easily be wiped away.


As these chemicals are very harsh (as evidenced by their strong smell) it is not recommended that you use depilatory creams to remove all of your pubic hair, as they can be very irritating on the skin and have even been reported to cause chemical burns. They should only be used to remove excess hair outside the bikini or brief line.
Before using a depilatory cream, you should trim the hair you wish to remove. This will cut down on the amount of product put on an old pair of underwear which you don't mind getting cream on. Use the underwear as a guideline for where to spread the cream -- this will ensure that none of the cream gets on any delicate areas.
Leave the cream on the bikini or brief line for the amount of time indicated on the label. Never leave the cream on for longer than stated on the product instructions, as this can be very harmful to the skin. Once the time is up, wipe off or wash away the cream, as directed. Any unwanted hair will come away with the cream.

, Waxing is a very effective form of hair removal, with results lasting between 2 to 4 weeks. There are many styles of waxing available: you can just have unwanted hair around the bikini line removed, go for an extended bikini wax or landing strip, or get everything removed with a Brazilian wax. The same applies for men as women, though using wax to removing hair from the sensitive skin on the testicles is not recommended.Waxing is performed by applying a hot, stick wax onto the areas of hair your wish to remove. A strip of cloth is placed over the wax and then pulled away, taking both the wax and the hair with it.
As the hair is pulled from the root, it takes much longer to grow back than with other forms of hair removal, such as shaving, which only remove the hair above the skin. However, waxing can be pricey, so despite the longer time between hair removal, it can be an expensive option to maintain.
Although home waxing kits are available, if you have never used wax before it is recommended that you go to a professional salon to have pubic hair removed. Be aware that waxing can be painful, especially in such a sensitive area, though over time hair growth between waxes will diminish and pain should lessen slightly.

, Electrolysis and laser hair removal are two treatments available which can permanently remove or reduce pubic hair. Electrolysis is the only method which will completely remove pubic hair for good. It works by passing an electric current through the hair follicle, which fries the root of the hair and prevents it from growing back.


You will only need one treatment (though it may last anywhere from 2 to 12 hours, depending on the amount of hair) and you will never need to worry about the hair down there again! However, it is important to know that electrolysis can be quite painful (though not as painful as waxing) and is expensive.
Laser hair removal is a newer form of hair removal, which guarantees permanent hair reduction. It works by targeting the pigmented hair follicles with a pulsing light, thereby stunting hair growth. It is relatively painless, and the treatment only takes a couple of minutes, though several treatments will be required.
Although laser hair removal is an effective hair reduction treatment, it is not guaranteed to remove all hair and other hair removal methods will still need to be employed. As it works by targeting dark pigments in the hair, it is not effective for treating light-colored hair. Laser hair removal treatments are also expensive., It is important to understand that the decision to remove pubic hair is a personal one. So although it is becoming increasingly popular nowadays to go bare ""down there"", you should not feel pressured into waxing it all off if that is not something you feel comfortable with.


As long as that area is kept clean and neat, there are no major hygienic reasons to remove pubic hair. Most people just choose to remove it for aesthetic reasons.
It is important to be aware that there are many men and women who still choose to go the natural route, and let their pubic hair grow freely. So whatever option you choose, understand that it's perfectly normal!

, Irritation is just part and parcel of the hair removal process, and no matter what method you choose, you're bound to end up with some irritation, as least at first.To minimize those annoying red bumps as much as possible, you can:


Exfoliate the area with a gentle sugar scrub. This gets rid of dead skin cells and allows the skin to breathe. If you don't have any sugar scrub handy, make a simple paste from baking soda and water, which will also do the trick.
Moisturize the area with a gentle, non-fragranced lotion. Baby lotions and oils, along with any moisturizers containing aloe vera, are popular options which will soothe and calm the skin.
Wear loose, breathable clothing. Skin needs air in order to heal, so wearing tight leather pants directly after a bikini wax or shave job is not such a good idea. Try wearing cotton underwear and skirts or loose trousers for the day or two following hair removal.

, Ingrown hairs can be painful and can even lead to infection if left to their own devices. They commonly appear during the regrowth phase after shaving or waxing, If you have developed an ingrown hair in your pubic region, your can remove it as follows:


Take a hot shower or bath to soften the skin around the hair and open the pores. Pat the area dry with a clean towel, then take a sterilized tweezers and, applying pressure on either side of the hair, pull out the hair.
Dab a little topical astringent on the area, allow it to dry, then put on a breathable pair of cotton underwear. Continue applying the astringent over the next couple of days, until the area heals.

, If you've prematurely developed grey hairs in the pubic region, don't fret. Although not medically recommended, it is possible to dye your pubic hair at home using a store bought hair color. However, it is very important that you follow the proper safety precautions to ensure that you don't get any color in any sensitive genital regions.


Go for a color that's as close to your natural pubic hair color as possible. Pubic hair is usually a shade darker than head hair, so if you use hair color regularly, you may need to go a color darker than usual. Root touch up kits are ideal for dyeing pubic hair, as they provide just enough color and include a small brush for careful application.
Before dyeing, do a patch test to ensure that you won't develop an allergic reaction to the color. Then apply petroleum jelly to all of the sensitive parts of the genitals where you don't want the color to go.
Carefully apply the hair color, as directed on the packaging, and leave the color to develop for the minimum amount of time necessary. Wash the color away gently but thoroughly using warm water, then use a sponge or washcloth to remove the petroleum jelly."

It can be depressing to work hard at making a change and still feel as though you've made no headway, which is why a photo journal is so useful. Take a picture of yourself from the front and side at the start of the summer. Then, once or twice a week, take more photo sets of yourself the same way. Whenever you feel discouraged, look at your photo journal to see just how far you've actually come.


Wear minimal, form-fitting clothing. Leggings or running shorts and a tank top make an ideal ensemble. This way, you'll be able to track changes much more easily.





;
, Calories are your body's main energy source; other nutrients (such as vitamins) help regulate various specific systems and keep your body's natural chemicals in balance. You need both if you want to remain healthy; focusing on just one or the other won't help.


If you use more calories than you eat, you'll lose weight; if you eat more calories than your body can use, you'll gain weight. Fat is just your body's way of storing calories for long-term future use. When you use more calories than you consume in food, your body will burn away fat to make up the difference.
Nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids need to be maintained at fairly steady levels for your body to be able to function efficiently. Without nutrients, your weight loss will be unhealthy for your body, since it can't convert fat into calories as efficiently.

, The best way to burn lots of calories is through exercise. As opposed to just not eating, exercise allows your body to convert calories into useful results, like muscle tone, without denying you the nutrients you should be getting from regular meals. The key to peak physical fitness is combining lots of vigorous exercise with a healthy, nutrient-rich diet.


Some exercises burn more calories per hour than others. Swimming and “hard” martial arts like karate are near the top of the list; however, any exercise (even a walk) is better than none at all.
Once your body gets adjusted to regular exercise, it can take a lot of steady, low-stress work, like jogging or cycling. You should give yourself off days for more strenuous workouts, but don't be afraid to do at least some exercise seven days a week. More exercise is almost always better than less.

, There are two basic types of exercise: aerobic, such as running, swimming, and cycling, and resistance, such as weightlifting (and, to an extent, swimming). It's easy to run or jog some every day, but don't neglect weight training either. Both types are important to your overall health.


It can seem as though weightlifting is solely the realm of men, and designed to build huge, bulky muscles, but in truth, it's one of the healthiest types of exercise available regardless of your sex. The stronger your muscles become, the more efficiently they'll burn calories, and the faster you'll be able to tone up. You'll only develop bulky muscles if you go on a special diet and work very hard towards that specific goal. Regular weightlifting will tone and define your muscles, not turn you into She-Hulk.
If you plan to gain some weight, you don't have to stop exercising at all. Instead, just eat larger portions of healthy food to gain more calories.

, To support your vigorous exercise routine, plan to eat healthily every day. Start by setting a caloric intake limit; for most people, anywhere from 1400 to 1800 is a good place to start. Build your diet around that number, and emphasize nutrients to be sure you're getting balanced support as you work out.

Start with vegetables. Vegetables are nutrient-rich and in many cases, practically calorie-free. Eat lots and lots of them every day to give your body plenty of energy and keep your mood balanced.






Fill in the rest with fruit, whole grains, and lean meat. These items are generally considered to be the healthiest foods to eat overall, as they provide more important nutrients and allow you to fill up your calories without taking in much fat. Be aware that fruit is usually quite sugary; eat fruit in moderation to avoid the empty calories of sugar, which will cause you to reach your daily limit before you feel full otherwise.







, Of course, this includes your diet and exercise regimen, but don't forget to schedule other things you've got planned as well. If you want to get a tan, plan regular visits to a tanning bed or regular sessions in the backyard. For whiter teeth, talk to your dentist and follow the routine he or she provides for you (which often involves regular treatments).


A vital part of setting a schedule is setting aside time for plenty of sleep. Plan on getting at least 8 hours a night, and then adjust it up or down a bit if you need to. Without lots of sleep, your body will run itself ragged in a few days and you'll get sick or injure yourself.

, A new hairstyle, manicure, or other physical modification can make a bold statement when fall rolls around and it's time to show off the new you. Schedule appointments for things like this well in advance of when you plan to get them done, so you don't have to scramble. Set aside money early as well, to be sure you have enough to pay for what you want to do.


Some less common changes you can make to your body include colored contact lenses, tattoos, and piercings. If you're planning to get a tattoo, be sure it's something you're going to be happy with for the rest of your life (and be sure you're 18 – any younger is illegal). For piercings or tattoos, if you're living at home, be sure to get parental permission first – they will find out if you don't, and the fallout won't be pretty.

, At the end of the day, all the planning in the world won't change the fact that your body is designed to change slowly over time, not dramatically overnight. Increase your odds of a successful transformation by sticking to your plan rigorously from day one.


The fewer calories you consume and the more exercise you do, the more dramatic your weight loss will be; however, after the first couple of weeks of a new program losing more than a few pounds per week is unhealthy and unnatural.

Assuming a five pound loss the first week, you shouldn't expect to lose more than about 40 pounds maximum over the course of the summer (and it's more likely the number will be around 20-25).


The more exercise you do, the more exercise you'll want to do. That's great, but be sure you aren't running your body too hard too fast. Nothing kills an exercise regimen faster than a pulled muscle or sprained ankle. Try to work out enough so that you feel pleasantly stiff the next day, but not so much that your body feels sore or tight.

Grow your hair out.,
Play dress-up.,
Settle on a style.,
Purchase your outfits.,
Accessorize.,
Work on your makeup.,
Put it all together.",How to Change Your Look Over the Summer2," Summer is the perfect time to let your hair grow another couple of inches. This will give you a lot of flexibility to try new styles, and a good excuse to try different hair products such as shampoos and conditioning treatments. Keep searching until you find some that work perfectly for you.


At the end of the summer, about a week before your style debut, go to a trusted hairdresser and get your hair cut or trimmed so that it's just how you want it. This is also the perfect opportunity to retouch highlights or add color.







, Get a good friend and schedule some regular trips to clothing stores, just to try things on. Make it a point to go to stores that sell niche or specialty clothing, as well as mainstream retailers. While you're there, have fun trying on everything that seems interesting, even if it doesn't seem like your style at all. Critique each others' ensembles and take plenty of photos. After a few weeks, you'll have a great style portfolio to help you find your new look.


If you find something you absolutely have to have, don't hesitate! Often, the next time you come back, it'll be gone, usually for good. Try to keep such impulse purchases down to only the very best pieces, to keep your costs reasonable. If you're buying something every time you go out, you're probably not being picky enough.
Don't neglect secondhand and thrift shops on your adventures. Despite the fact that most of what they sell is ugly, they can occasionally provide a beautiful, unique item for your outfits. Thrift stores are great for retro-style looks in particular.

, Using your photo portfolio and images from magazines and the Internet, put together some ensemble ideas you think would look especially good on you. Focus on clothing first, and worry about accessories after that. If an item of clothing wouldn't look good without a specific accessory, it's probably best to skip it.


Keep a notebook or list on your phone and write down ensembles as you come up with them. Note the price and location of each piece, if you know it or have a general idea. Feel free to erase or reorder parts as you work. When one piece will work with multiple ensembles, mark it so it stands out – that one's a definite keeper.

, Start with the key pieces that you marked as being useful for multiple outfits, and then work from there. With your basic pieces purchased, it's easy to work around the problem of other specific pieces not being available anymore – just find something else that goes with your core piece. Again, start with clothes and shoes. Other accessories can come later.


If you've been adjusting your weight over the summer, buy as close to fall as you can, and be sure to try everything on to make sure it fits properly – after all, your body's a different size and shape than it was a few months ago.
You shouldn't need more than a few new pairs of shoes to complete most of your outfits. Be creative and think about how to repurpose one pair for several different looks.
Keep all your receipts. If you have second thoughts later, you can usually just return the item.

, Now is the time to purchase costume jewelry, belts, handbags, and other items that help complete your look. Search high and low for good deals – accessories can end up costing a lot of money very quickly, but with some patience and determination, you can also snag some incredible deals.


If you have some extra money, invest in a nice perfume. Perfume clerks at stores like Macy's and Nordstrom's can help you find a nice scent, or you can look up perfume discussion communities on the Internet.
Remember, jewelry in particular doesn't have to be high-quality to look good. High-quality jewelry is nice, of course, but carefully picked costume jewelry can also make a bold, smart fashion statement.

, The perfect time to experiment with new makeup is right after you've acquired a nice new wardrobe for yourself. Of course, if you don't usually wear makeup, you certainly don't have to start right now, but there are few better ways to cheaply and dramatically change your physical look to make your clothes and hair really “pop.”


Use good quality makeup, if you can afford it. Over time, most makeup is pretty cheap, but some of it costs a pretty penny up front. As long as you're able, invest in some of the nicer stuff, especially foundation, powder, and concealer. Those three elements give you perfect control over your complexion, making them the most important.
Experiment with feature-defining makeup. Lipstick, lip liner, eyeliner, and eyeshadow are the primary tools in your artist's kit for making your makeup a personal expression of style. Break open your supplies and try out new colors and combinations to come up with some great bold looks that will turn heads in the best sense of the phrase.

As with your clothes, it helps to have a friend over and try new makeup combinations together. You'll get great feedback and have more fun than you would alone.



, Finish your last sessions for tanning, tooth whitening, or anything else you scheduled. Clean and style your newly-cut hair, and put on your favorite new ensemble, starting with clean undergarments and building up through clothes, then shoes, then accessories. Apply whatever makeup style you want (don't forget to paint your nails a bit earlier, if you want to), and add any final touches like color contacts or nice perfume. Grab the right purse or bag, and step out with confidence to show off the new you!


If you can afford it, having a salon day the day before your debut will ensure you look and feel your absolute best.
Smile and be outgoing with everybody. Your confident glow will accentuate your new look, and people will be truly impressed with the change.
Don't stop taking good care of yourself just because the summer's over. By this point, good dietary and fitness practices should have become habits. Just stay in those habits and continue to look and feel your best.

You’ll also want to find tops that add weight or curves to your shoulders and chest. In doing both, you’ll distract from your behind while also using your clothes to add proportion for a more balanced figure.


Go for bold colors and patterns. Don’t over-do it to the point of being garish, but look for eye-catching colors and provocative patterns to keep all eyes up top.
Look for horizontal necklines. They draw the eye while also slimming the waist.
Try bell sleeves. They widen your shoulder line to make a clean line with your larger backside, balancing your silhouette.
Stock up on necklaces and scarves. These are two of the most valuable accessories you have for dealing with a bigger behind. Necklaces (especially larger ones) will keep eyes on your top and neckline while scarves add width to your shoulders.;
, If you’re chosen method of dealing with your behind is to reduce its presence, look for dark colors (especially in pants). Have tops (including jackets and sweaters) that reach low on your body, just after where your butt begins. The eye is drawn to where the garment ends, so gloss over your butt entirely.The A-line dress is praised for its ability to hide any behind. Find more than a couple that you like; if you can make them a part of your style, the A-line dress will be your best fashion friend.
Buy slimming shapewear/underwear. These will slim your waist, butt, and thighs for an overall slighter look.
Vertical features such as zippers and pleats make the waist and backside appear slimmer. Look for tops with these qualities.

, Look for large back pockets, low waistbands and wide legs. The pockets serve as a diversion for the eyes, the waistband will have your butt appear smaller, and flared legs help to even out your silhouette. If your intention is to draw attention away from your hips, avoid skinny jeans which taper at the ankle.


Find high-waisted shorts or pants for a classic look. The high-waist connects your butt to your waist to make it one seamless line, de-emphasizing your backside.
When shopping for jeans you’ll want to look for anything “boot cut” or with flared legs. Don’t be anything bedazzled or with especially busy patterns, especially on the behind. You’ll looking for jeans to complement your behind, not draw attention to it.

, More so than other articles of clothing, make sure your skirts are very well-fitted. You don't want to draw unwanted attention with an ill-fitted skirt that bunches up or slips at the waist. Pencil skirts are a solid option for wide hips as they even out your body shape. Fluted skirts are great for cloaking your butt and moving any attention down towards your legs., Boxer briefs and biking shorts will tighten the area around your butt and upper thighs for a tighter, smaller feel. In any case, make sure whatever underwear you have fits well enough not to bunch up. Bunching can be seen through pants and can make your backside look even awkward.

, Possibly the most important consideration for anyone with a larger behind, well-bought pairs of pants will go the farthest towards shaping and disguising your butt. General advice to follow is to have pants that fit at the waist (too high will make your butt seem long) and too avoid anything labelled “skinny.”For jeans, look for boot cut, carpenter, worker, and “relaxed-fit” jeans. This will sit more loosely on the waist and around the legs, which allow for straighter vertical line to your silhouette.
For dressier pants, stay away from pleats. They draw the eye to your hips and can make your butt seem bigger than it is. Flat fronts are the way to go as they have a slimming effect around your waist.

, Many might make the mistake of buyingover-large t-shirts in the hopes that they make your top half seem larger and more proportional to your behind. Unfortunately it ends up looking awkward and can make you appear overweight. Provided you have good pants that sit well at the waist, buy t-shirts which go down to where you back meets your butt for a clean vertical line.


Don’t confuse a tight with a good fit. An overly tight shirt will make your butt appear as though it’s sticking out. You want a shirt that doesn’t bloom or billow, but lies flat on your front and back.

, For collared shirts and button-downs, try not to tuck in when it’s appropriate. Unfortunately in business and formal situations this won’t be possible. Tucking in narrows your shirt and brings it closer to your torso, and can make your butt look like it’s sticking out. Instead, allow these shirts to sit loose around your waist for a clean line with your larger backside.Again, avoid any “slim” or “skinny” fits in button-down shirts. These will end up hugging your torso, making your butt look larger.

, Unlike girls, boys won’t have a lot of options for distracting away from a big butt. Flashy shoes, however, are the big-seated young man’s best weapon. Attractive, eye-catching shoes will draw the eye down quickly, away from your butt. Anything goes provided they match your outfit.

, Whether aerobics or weight-training, walking or jogging, you can work out to better tone your butt and body overall. A fit and toned big butt is better than just a large one. You can do extra exercises for your glutes to shape them up even more.Squats are the go-to exercise for toning and shaping your butt. Fortunately squats are like many butt exercises, and require no equipment.
You’ll need to work out your waist and legs as well as your butt for a balanced look. Look for exercises that targets groups of muscles for added efficiency.

, If you have the time, yoga works towards toning your whole body and making you more flexible. Look for poses that target your glutes, thighs, and lower back. Yoga is relatively easy to pick up, and can be done at home for those a little gym-shy., Another way to get control over your body shape, a healthy diet will work towards a slimmer waist and slighter features. For most this will include having a smaller, better-shaped butt. Of course, eating healthy will mean different things for different people, so it’s best to consult your family doctor for the best tips on using diet to slim down. With both a healthy diet and a solid exercise regimen, you should be on the way to a nicer looking behind.

, Unfortunately, nobody gets to choose their shape. All of us have to cope with what we’ve got, and we should never hesitate to feel proud of it. Even though your big butt might make you self-conscious, remember that you’re not alone and also that plenty of people all around the world see a big butt as an attractive thing. What one bully might be willing to pick on you for might convince another person to ask you on a date. Don’t let your body define your attitude; let it be the other way around., The teenage years are a time when everything is exaggerated and over-examined, the body more than anything. You may think you have a big backside, but in actuality it’s just your anxiety and your environment making you self-conscious. If it’s something you’re trying to get to the heart of, try approaching a neutral third-party, such as your family doctor, about the concern.

, In all likelihood, you’re not done growing. Your body is still coming into its own and needs time to adjust. What looks awkward or unattractive now might become sexy and flattering. Try to accept how you look now, but don’t expect future change as a reason not to be proactive now; now is the time to become proactive if you wish to make a long-lasting change.

Be sure to get the ""wispy"" type of lashes; the hairs are tied to the lash strip and thus moveable., Take the pair of lashes with the thick-and-thin sections. Use your tweezers to slide the hairs about on the lash strip so that they are more evenly spaced. This will help make your false lashes appear fuller at the outer corner., If there is still some of adhesive left on the strip, use that to stick the lashes to the tray.

If you want a tapered look to the lashes, off-set the second pair by a little, so that they extend over the outer corners of the first pair. This way, there are fewer, thinner hairs towards the inner corners.

, If you off-set the lashes, be sure to snip off the excess at the outer corner.If the lash strip is still too long, then trim it down further."

Pour a small amount of cosmetic-grade glitter into a small dish, jar, or tray.,
Apply clear eyelash glue to the false lashes using the applicator that came with it, or a thin, pointed brush.,
Apply the glitter to the lashes.,
Wait at least 10 minutes for the glue to dry.,
Tap off any excess glitter.",How to Customize False Lashes3," This will make it easier to pick up. Do not use regular glitter from the arts and crafts store—even the finest, scrapbooking glitter is not safe for the eyes., You can put the glue wherever your want the glitter. One of the most popular areas is just below the lash strip, but you can also apply it to the lashes themselves. Avoid applying the glue directly onto the lash strip. This will put the glitter too close to your eyes, which can result in irritation.

If you do decide to apply the glue to the lashes themselves, plan on doing the underside as well, once everything dries. This way, the glitter will be visible when your eyes are both open and closed.
If the glue causes the lashes to clump together, use a straight pin to separate them., There are lots of ways in which you can do this. You can gently pat the glitter on using a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush. You can also sprinkle the glitter on using your fingertips. Finally, you can always dip the lashes into the glitter itself.Do not wait for the glue to get tacky. The sooner you apply the glitter, the better.

, If you used a lot of glue, especially along the lash line, you may have to wait longer than 10 minutes. If you don't wait until the glue is completely dry, then the glitter may peel off., You can also gently brush it off using a very soft eyeshadow brush. If you notice any gaps, simply repeat the process: apply some glue, pat on some glitter, let it dry, then tap it off."

Get a pair of dramatic lashes.,
Get some tiny rhinestones.,
Apply a line of eyelash glue to just below the lash strip.You can also apply a small dot of glue to one of the outer lashes instead.Use the applicator that came with your eyelash glue, or a very thin brush, to do this.,
Use tweezers to pick up a tiny rhinestone, and press it into the glue.,
Wait for the glue to dry.",How to Customize False Lashes4," The best type of false lashes for this method are the type that are long, thick, and full. Avoid thin or wispy lashes for this method, as they won't be able to hold the weight of the rhinestones.

If the lash strip is very long, measure the lashes against your eyelid, and snip off any excess from the outer corner.

, The rhinestones need to be the smallest you can fine. You will be essentially wearing these on your lashes, so anything too big will be too heavy. White rhinestones will give you a classy look, but colored rhinestones are great for events, holidays, and other special occasions.

You can also use small sequins or confetti for this.,

Some people find it easier to make a puddle of glue on a tray, and then dipping their rhinestone, sequin, or confetti into the glue with a pair of tweezers.
Do not apply the glue directly to the lash strip, or the rhinestones will get in the way. They may also irritate your eyes.

, If the rhinestone doesn't land exactly where you want it, use the tip of your tweezers to gently nudge it into place. Do this for all of the rhinestones., You are using more glue than you normally would to attach the lashes to your lids, so the glue may take a while to completely dry. Rhinestones are also heavy, in terms of lashes, so the glue needs to be perfectly dry. If you don't wait long enough, the rhinestones may slide around or fall off."

Get some dramatic lashes.,
Get some feathers.,
Take the feathers apart, if needed.,
Trim the feathers down.,
Draw a thick, line of eyelash glue where you want the feather to go.,
Wait for the glue to get tacky, then start placing the feathers.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Curl the lashes using an eyelash curler.",How to Customize False Lashes5," This method works best with lashes that are already thick and full. Avoid wispy or natural style lashes; the contrast between them and the feathers will be too stark.

If the lash strip is long, measure the lashes against your eyelid, then trim them down from the outer corner to fit.

, You can use lots of different types of feathers, including flat, wing feathers, soft and fluffy feathers, thin and wipsy feathers, and peacock feathers. You will need to prepare the feathers differently, however., If you are using thin, wispy feathers, you don't need to do this. Other types of feathers, however, will need to be taken apart so that they'd look more proportionate against the false lashes. Here are the recommended ways to take apart each type of feather:

If you are using a flat, wing feather, peel a strip off of the stem. Next, separate the strips down to thinner sections.
If you are using soft and fluffy feathers, peel off all the soft strands until you get to the stiffer strands at the tip.If you are using a peacock feather, simply pluck a few of the green-blue strands off of the stem; you will be using these for your lashes.

, Even if you are using a thin wispy feather or a peacock feather strand, you still need to cut it down. Place the feather where you want it to go, and see how much you need to cut off. The feather should be no more than twice the length of the longest lash. Once you have figured out the length, trim the feather down starting at the base using a pair of scissors.

If you are using the flat, duck type feathers, you can even trim the tip into a point, curve, or angle.
If you are using a soft, fluffy feather that you ""shaved"" down, trim the tip down so that it's smaller.If you are using more than one feather, play around with different lengths to create a tapering effect.

, Put the glue along the lash strip as well as just below it., Make sure that the base of each feather bumps up against the lash strip. Avoid placing the feather onto the actual strip, or it will poke your eyelid. You can tell if the glue is tacky when it starts to turn clear.

You can place the feathers with your fingers or with a pair of tweezers.

, This may take up to 2 hours. If you move onto the next step too soon, the feathers will fall off., This will help the feathers blend in better with the lashes. After this, the lashes are ready to use."

Expand your closet.,

",How to Become More Noticeable in Public Middle School (Girls)," To expand your closet to its potential, think about what you usually wear and ask yourself these questions:


Do I have a wide variety of colors? What other colors do I need?
Is my closet almost only one color? Do I have clothes in fashion?
Do I have clothes in fashion is one of the most important questions to ask yourself.;
, If you don't have either one of those stores nearby, go to a store you think is the most popular maybe by looking at the type of TV commercials there are on TV.

, Also, having a wide variety of colors gives you a very likely chance of not being labeled as things because of your clothing. BUT, be sure to get different 'types' of clothing too. Not just t-shirts but long sleeve t-shirts (if you're comfortable in them) and blouses. mixing things up are good for your reputation.

, If you have nice clothes but not hair, it ruins everything you've worked for. Try keeping your hair simple 'looking'. By this, not too long. Having your hair down to your butt is not cute.

Keep your length either to your shoulders or right below the shoulders. If you would rather wear your hair down most of the time, try layering your hair, putting highlights in it, or getting bangs.






Be sure to have the highlights natural colored in order to look like your hair was sun kissed.






If you like wearing your hair up in a ponytail, and only a ponytail, either get very little layering or no layering at all. Otherwise, you won't be able to put ALL your hair in a ponytail.






Also, if you prefer wearing your hair up, be sure to not wear the same headband all the time or be sure to wear a headband sometimes if you like wearing your hair without a headband. Finally, DO NOT put hair extensions in your hair. Especially colored ones..







, If you have any blemishes, you will be needing to take care of your body a little bit better., Nails are important too. In this day and age, neon colors are very popular as nail colors. Especially for the finger nails. For the toes,wear whatever color you chose to wear. Just don't get a french pedicure.
,, Not so shy because soon enough, people will be wanting to talk to you, and you'll scare them away with your shyness. Be nice to everyone. Don't swear as it is vulgar and rude. .

Spend money on things that will fit your new look.",How to Change Your Image (Mostly for Girls)," What style do you want to go for? Don't go for styles that everyone wears but doesn't even suit you. Preppy? Punk? Girly? Decide what you want to be and make a list of all the clothes and accessories you will need: skirts, studded belts, more black clothing, smaller clothes...etc However, be sure to have some wardrobe essentials (solid colored shirts, jeans...) in case you don't want to dress the same way every day.;
, The easiest way is to watch TV shows and/or movies with characters with styles that you like. For instance, if you want to be a rocker, watch Degrassi's Eli (the goth boy), if you want to be preppy watch Paige or Manny. Note their outfits, the way they talk and act... However, don't go as far as pretending to be someone you aren't. It's not about WHAT you say (you should always be firm about your beliefs), but about HOW you say it!

, If you're going for a rocker, you may want to listen and get to know some classic rock artists and learn their music. You can also choose sports, fashion, books, movies... Take up new hobbies which you enjoy and give off the vibe you want.

, Experiment with different make-up styles and(or) hairstyles. Eyeliner and mascara go with just about every look. Try getting a natural looking eyeshadow.

, You don't want to go in a full fledged preppy or rocker look. Go for just a few key things to show your look has changed. If you choose an outfit that is too showy it will look like you just decided to change your look the week before, but if it's simpler, it'll look more natural. Most preps don't come to school in a mini, polo, sunglasses, heels everyday. Change should be gradual, and never too dramatic.

, If you're with your friends, ask them to help you find the clothes or accessories which look better on you according to the image you have in mind. However, try to buy things which are versatile: a plain black shirt can help you look rocker-like, but can also be used in other looks depending on how you combine it. That way you will have more clothes in case you decide to change your style or try out another image for a day.

Don't change who you really are, because in the end it's still you.",How to Be the Girl Everybody Looks At," Nobody will want to be you if all you do is stare at the floor! Keep your chin up and make eye contact with everyone. Smile at them, too. That shows you're confident and that you know what you're doing - even if you don't. They will admire your confidence (but don't become overconfident).;
, It's very important. People will judge you for what you're wearing. If you can purchase designer clothes, why not? But if you can't, shop in Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, American Eagle, Urban Outfitters, Abercombie and Fitch etc. instead.

, Nobody will want to be around you if you smell bad: they'll avoid you! Bathe or shower every day, and wash your hair every other day. Wear slight, natural makeup: lip gloss, face cream and maybe a little eyeliner. Brush your teeth and floss, and take care of your skin by drinking at least 8 glasses of water daily. Wash your face every day, too. It must be flawless! Brush your hair twice a day.

, Make sure your room is clean, and just everything you have. Keep them organised!

, Clean your room manually so it doesn't get dirty. Get lamps, they light up the room and make it look bigger. Don't cover all your walls with pictures and posters, that will make them look small. Just a few would do the trick.

You'll have to have the stylish girl, the smart girl, the sporty girl and the party girl! You will be the flawless foursome.

,



Host a party at one of your houses, and invite as many people as you can. That way people will get to know you and they will think you're cool, but make sure your guests don't get bored! That would be very bad for your reputation.

,


Believe it or not, boys talk more than a lot of girls. If you flirt with one boy, all of his friends will know who you are on the next day. Be friendly around them and don't just call every boy a jerk.

,


You and your friends have got to be super duper close, so host a sleepover every Friday night. Try it like this: first Friday at your house, the other in your other friend's house and so on. Share the gossip, but don't start rumors.

,


It will be fun. Being popular means lots of drama, so you are going to have to need something to pour your feelings in. Just make sure that it's in a safe place for nobody to read!

,


Don't let anybody bring you down! If somebody is being mean to your friends, be with them on that one, and they will be there for you too. You must have the best comebacks or else this one won't work.

,


Don't be mean to everyone! People will hate you and you will be famous for your bad attitude and that isn't what you want.

,


That's a must, you have to keep in touch with the people around you. Get everybody's phone number and keep them just in case.

,


Add everybody you know, just not the lame people... or they will annoy you and brag about talking to you... and there goes your reputation. But don't be mean to them!

, Be yourself, and never lose your personal flair!

If you want a longer haircut from a salon, ask for a style that will compliment your hair’s natural texture. All you will have to do is brush it.

, Make sure you wash your clothes regularly so that you always smell clean. Shirts, underwear, socks, and swimsuits should be washed after every wear. Jeans, pants, and bras can be worn two to three times before washing. However, if you sweat a lot in your clothing, wash it before wearing it again.

Does the item of clothing fit?
Have you worn the clothing in the past twelve months?
Is it damaged or worn? If so, is it worth repairing?
If you saw this item while you were shopping, would you buy it?, If you clean several times throughout the day, your home will seem effortlessly clean.

Quickly tidy the kitchen before you go to bed. When you wake up, your kitchen will be refreshingly clean., Larger cleaning jobs, such as vacuuming and scrubbing your bath tub, should be done once a week.

Monday: Vacuum all carpets.
Tuesday: Deep clean the bathroom.
Wednesday: Clean any wooden or tile floors.
Thursday: Clean out your refrigerator.
Friday: Organize your desk or work area.

Becoming beautiful starts to unfold when we learn to recognize our weaknesses and when we choose to overcome them. We learn to take hold of our choices because life becomes what we make of it.;

It always pays to be humble and to keep in mind that somewhere out there someone could look better than us.

, Advancement and growth comes only to those whose heart, mind and soul (HMS) that is open.

Show off your great personality.,
Take good care of yourself.,
Accentuate your best features.,
Wear something red.,
Put on a pair of high heels now and then.",How to Be the Girl All the Guys Want1," Positive personality traits can cause someone to look past negative physical traits and feel attracted towards you.For example, a guy who is normally attracted to thin women might feel attracted to a girl who is slightly overweight if she is kind and outgoing. Try to identify your positive personality traits and let them shine!


Identify your best traits and watch for opportunities to show them off. For example, if you are a compassionate person, then you might want to engage in some volunteerism. If you are a responsible person, then consider running for class president.
If you think that you need to work on something, then that is okay. For example, if you are shy, then you might want to work on being more outgoing. If you have a hot temper, then you might want to work on controlling your anger.;
, You can’t change too much about the way you look, but one study showed that people are more attracted to people who take good care of themselves.Make sure that you take time to groom yourself well every day. Some basic things you can do to increase your attractiveness include:


Showering every day.
Styling your hair.
Brushing your teeth.
Wearing clean clothes.

, Men’s preferences about looks and body type vary widely, so try not to set your sights on looking like a photo in a magazine.Instead, embrace the figure and features you have and try to accentuate them as much as you can.


For example, if your best feature is your eyes, then you can emphasize them with eye makeup. If your legs are your best feature, then opt for shorts or a short skirt to show them off.
You can even use a little make-up if you feel like it. You should not wear make-up if you feel uncomfortable doing so, but wearing make-up has been found to increase men’s perception of attractiveness.Try wearing a little make-up and see how it makes you feel. If you like it, then make it a part of your daily routine. Keep in mind that you do not have to wear much make-up to accentuate your best features. For example, you could try wearing a bit of brown mascara and clear lip gloss for a look that brings out your natural beauty.

, Women who are wearing red seem more attractive to some men.You don't need to wear red all of the time to take advantage of this, but wearing a red top now and then or adding a pop of red with an accessory might be worth a try.


If you like, you can add a pop of red to your outfit every day with some red lipstick, a pair of red earrings, or a red scarf.

, High heels have been shown to make men feel more attracted to women.Since high heels are not very comfortable, you may want to save them for special occasions, such as a school dance. You can also try wearing some lower high heels.

Make eye contact and smile.,
Try mirroring a guy when you talk to him.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Be a good listener.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Be the Girl All the Guys Want2," Making eye contact is a powerful way to show a guy that you are interested in him and smiling shows that you are happy and approachable.The next time you are around a guy who you think is cute, try locking eyes with him for a few seconds and flashing him a smile. Doing this will let him know that you think he is cute and you’d like to speak with him.


This might feel awkward the first time you try it, but keep in mind that he is probably nervous too.

, Mirroring is when you adopt a similar posture to the person with whom you are speaking. For example, if a guy leans in on his elbow, then you could lean in on your elbow as well. Doing this shows that you are interested and increases feelings of closeness.Try using mirroring when you are first getting to know someone. You may even start to do it without noticing if you are really enjoying the conversation.
Don’t copy every move your conversation partner makes. Just mirror him occasionally.

, If you want to talk to a guy, you don’t have to wait for him to talk to you. You can just go right up to him and say “hello.” If he responds with a smile and a response, then he probably wants to talk to you too. If he ignores you or gives a curt answer with little or no facial recognition (no smile, no eye contact), then move on to someone else.Try asking a question to get a conversation going. For example, you could say something like, “Nice day today, don’t you think?” Or, “I love this café! Don’t you think they have the best coffee?”

, Being a good listener is also important when you are talking to guys. You may be seen as more attractive if you have the ability to show that you are interested and paying close attention to what a guy says. Some good listening skills include:Paraphrasing. Try repeating back what a guy says now and then to show him you were paying attention.
Nodding. Giving an occasional nod will show that you hear and understand what he is saying.
Avoiding distractions. Never get out your phone or look away when you are talking to a guy you like because it will lead him to believe that you are not interested in him.

, Asking open-ended questions will encourage your conversation partner to talk more than asking a closed question. Closed questions only require short answers, but open ended conversations invite the other person to elaborate.For example, you will get a yes or no response if you ask, “Did you have a good day?” Instead, try asking, “How was your day?” This question will show the guy that you want him to talk and that you want to listen.

Keep some things to yourself.,
Be (somewhat) unavailable.,
Reign in your emotions.,
Exit early.You should think up a plausible reason for leaving beforehand so you're not scrambling to think of one off the top of your head when someone asks, ""Aw, why are you leaving?""",How to Be the Girl All the Guys Want3," Don't give away too much information about yourself, and try to allude to fantastic or strange things you have done. You don't have to lie or be disingenuous, you can tell a story that expands upon your experiences in a thrilling way.


For example, instead of explaining how you know an obscure fact about baseball, instead laugh, say, ""A girl has her ways. Maybe I'll tell you sometime,"" and breeze forward in the conversation.

, You don't have to arbitrarily shoot down plans or minimize your time with the boys to next to nothing, but by making yourself scarce you'll make the levels of dopamine (the pleasure chemical) rise, which will make finally being able to see you a real treat., It is important to avoid getting too emotional when you are first getting to know someone. You don't have to be cold or make him feel like his accomplishments are nothing to be proud of, but an excess of emotion may be a little overwhelming. Try to play it cool as much as possible. This will only increase your air of mystery and make him wonder if he really can win you over as his girlfriend.


For example, don’t jump up and down and scream if he asks you on a date. Instead, try smiling and saying something like, “Sure, that sounds fun. What did you have in mind?”

, This can work well with your mystique, as you can allude to a vague appointment. Be polite, cheerful, and assure everyone you'll meet again soon.


You could say: ""I promised a friend of mine I'd help her with a little project. Nothing serious, but really, it's kind of a long story. I hate to leave, but I'll see you soon, for sure.""

Dress in attractive, work-appropriate clothing.,
Fashion your hair.,
Utilize a light mist of cologne or perfume.Don’t bathe yourself in the stuff, but utilize it to enhance and compliment your natural scent.,
Keep your facial elements symmetrical.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Get in shape.,
Change your facial expression.",How to Be More Attractive to Someone at Work1," Attend carefully to how you dress.How you look plays a big part in attracting the attention and admiration of folks in the office. Go for office chic and classics (tasteful suit and tie for a man, modest dress or skirt and blouse for a woman), while steering clear of outfits you might wear for clubbing or a bar night out with friends.


If you have to wear a uniform at work, consider dressing it up with accessories or sharp shoes. If that's not allowed, always aim for impeccable grooming.
Select designs that accentuate your shape, while still having a professional, business flair. If you wear scrubs or a specific uniform for work, the best way you can ensure you look good is to have it tailored to fit your shape. Otherwise, choose outfits that compliment your body type. Avoid wearing low cut tops or outfits that are too tight.
Avoid showing too much skin. While showing some cleavage or your bulging biceps at the bar may be the usual socializing way to attract someone you're interested in, doing so at the office is a no-no and may earn you an unwanted reputation. Refer to your common sense (and your employee handbook) to ensure you remain within corporate dress code, while accentuating your best features. Check out others around you if you're not sure where the line is drawn.
Regardless of your gender, wear red, even if it’s just a trim of red, or a red shirt with white blouse or dark suit. Both sexes are more attracted to potential mates wearing red than those in wearing other colors.;
, Men could consider getting a pompadour or Freeman’s cut. The Freeman’s cut leaves several inches on top while keeping it close, possibly fading up, on the sides. The pompadour evokes a classic, effortless cool like that of James Dean, with a longer, textured top and tapered sides. Don’t try to perfect your hair; a little messiness is masculine and sexy.


Women can wear any number of styles -- short, long, curly, straight -- but to attract a coworker, the important thing is to keep it looking nice.
Hair which is greasy, too loaded with hairspray or product, or dyed unnatural colors tends to turn men off.
Wash and condition your hair every couple days (washing every day can strip essential oils from your scalp).
If you want to dye your hair, stick with red, black, blonde, or brown., Women, especially, tend to use scent in order to determine whether a partner is compatible with them.

, Shave evenly on both sides of your face to ensure your facial hair is balanced. Alternately, when growing a beard or mustache, make sure it comes in evenly. Women might interpret patchy facial hair on an unconscious biological level as indicative of a man in poor health.Women should apply makeup carefully in order to achieve a balanced skin tone.


The one exception is your haircut: it’s okay to have an asymmetrical part, but don’t give yourself a dramatic comb-over.
Both men and women should think about tweezing their eyebrows. Bushy, uneven brows are not attractive.

, A diet full of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables will give your skin a healthy glow.Produce is loaded with antioxidants and natural pigments which add a rosy hue to your cheeks. Eat about two cups of fruit and three cups of veggies each day in order to meet the recommended daily allotment., Visit the gym to work out more.Do both cardiovascular exercises (like running and biking) and strength training (like lifting weights or doing squats). Becoming trim and fit is an easy way to make yourself more attractive. Even when you’re in a job where you can’t show off your six-pack abs or chiseled calves, people will notice when you’ve lost weight and gained energy.

, The level of attraction men and women possess varies with different facial expressions.Women appear more attractive to potential mates when they smile more. Men, on the other hand, appear more attractive to women when they look brooding, proud, and powerful. Place your hands on your hips when standing, walk with pride, and make eye contact with people. Pound your fist on the table to make a point when addressing people.


To look more brooding, furrow your brow. Imagine you’re slightly worried about something. Don’t frown, but don’t smile either. Keep your mouth in a straight, tight line.
To look more powerful, you could also practice power poses. Stand, don’t sit, were possible. Lean forward on the table with both arms splayed out in a “V” when addressing someone. Do not cross your arms or sit with your hands in your lap.Both men and women benefit from using open body language like uncrossing your arms and standing upright. Try using open body language to boost your sex appeal.While seated, gay men and straight women might employ the face platter -- a pose in which the hands are placed over each other and then under the chin, with the elbows resting on the table.Gay men should also try smiling or laughing more often to attract members of the same sex."

Impress your coworkers with your hard work.What's more appealing in a workplace setting than a brainy individual?",How to Be More Attractive to Someone at Work2," Do you want to get a raise or promotion? Do you want to persuade your coworkers to support one of your pet projects? Or do you simply want to date someone you work with? All these things are easier when people find you attractive.Dating a coworker can be messy. If this is your goal, carefully consider the repercussions if the relationship were to go south: you might get fired, transferred, reassigned, or just have to endure an unpleasant work environment where you face your ex every day.

, Don’t try to become more attractive to everyone at work. Do not date multiple people in your workplace or you may get a bad reputation. Dress and tailor your appearance to appeal to the individual whose affections you seek.


Find out what the person whose interest you’re trying to attract is into. What makes them laugh? What impresses them? What music do they like to listen to? Having a common interest with someone will make you more attractive in their eyes.

, Certain physical positions can nonverbally express that you’re available and interested in someone. When you show you’re interested, the person you want to appear more attractive to will see it as a green light and if they’re interested too, they will reciprocate. Laugh loudly or spread your arms out if you’re a man. If you’re a woman, make eye contact, look down for a bit and gather or comb your hair. Then, look up at the person you want to attract without bringing your chin up., There’s a fine line between acting interested in your coworker's life and being potentially invasive. Be approachable and act interested in all of your coworkers, but don’t go overboard with personal comments or questions.


Ask very open-ended questions (“How are you?”, “What are you working on these days?”) about your co-worker's personal and working life and let them give you the cue as to how much information they're willing to share.
Remember people’s names and their life details. People tend to find you more attractive when you continue to call them by name and if you demonstrate that you actually know something personal about them. For example, you could say, “Hi Bob, how was your mom’s 75th birthday party last weekend?” Remembering these specifics shows that you care, which definitely makes you attractive to others.
Spend time establishing your ability to be confidential. Once they know you're a good listener, they'll find you more attractive.
Don't support office gossip or undermining talk. Let others know that you won't be drawn into gossip or casting aspersions on others in the workplace.

, Be generous with your time and earn the reputation that you're the kind of person who is helpful without being conditional. Assisting others with no hope of reward is the kind of quality which attracts others.

, “Great job on that report” is a kind comment which will make them feel good. You can also, within reason, praise a coworker’s appearance. “That’s a nice tie” is an acceptable compliment which could attract your coworker. “Your butt looks great in those pants” is an inappropriate comment which constitutes sexual harassment.

, Consult coworkers for their insight and solicit their participation in projects or even a personal dilemma, depending on the extent of trust within your relationship. During a group project, turn to a coworker and ask what he/she thinks about a certain statistic or idea. Bringing people together and getting involved can be pretty sexy, especially when individuals feel that you have personally made an effort to help their talents shine in front of others.

, Make yourself more attractive to others in the office by forming more personal relationships with those coworkers you feel a connection with.


Plan outings, dinners, and events with your coworkers so you grow closer with them.
Be as inclusive as possible of other coworkers you're less inclined to want to spend outside-of-work time with. Have a chat at the water cooler, find out about their pets or children, and ask after them regularly. Don’t exclusively yourself In other words, spread your charm around.

, A brainy individual who does what he or she sets out to do! Demonstrate your powerhouse intellect while working on a collaborative project or presentation, in a way that bolsters everyone's participation and leaves nobody out. Always be subtle, and don’t brag.


Be a dependable, stand-out employee––someone that every coworker (and boss) knows will get the job done above and beyond expectations.
Be that “go to” person that everyone knows is the best man or woman for the job. More than being just someone to ""go to"", be a willing guide, teacher or mentor to others. When everyone knows you're willing to both listen and give useful advice, you'll attract positive attention.

Be a happy, positive person.People generally gravitate toward positive, engaging personalities and dislike grumpy, standoffish folks.,
Be comfortable in your own skin.Confidence shows in the way you carry and present yourself at work.,
Be courageous.",How to Be More Attractive to Someone at Work3," People are more attracted to individuals who seem to laugh and smile more often. Take time to appreciate the little things at work and when you see coworkers in the morning, make eye contact, smile and greet them by name. Praise the good things they do.


When you encounter difficulties, try not to let them get you down. Think of them as opportunities to help you grow through challenging yourself to rise above adversity.
Don’t worry about problems at work or at home; have confidence you’ll solve them when they need to be solved.
Don’t dwell on workplace mistakes. Instead, celebrate your successes and those of others.
At office parties, seek to be the life of such a party without becoming the butt of office jokes. Avoid getting hammered and doing something extremely embarrassing (which would definitely take you off the running list of being the attractive person in the office). Instead, maintain a clear head and approach parties as networking opportunities and as a chance to make your awesomeness even more evident.

, Don’t boast about how great you are––instead, walk with pride, make eye contact and smile.


Maintain good posture at all times. How you carry yourself sends a clear message to those around you. Standing and sitting tall and walking confidently but with ease will let people know that you have self-respect and personal dignity, qualities which are supremely attractive.

, If you want to have an attractive personality, be courageous at work. Make decisions that you stand by because you believe in their worth, even when others do not. Share your vision for project outcomes even when others are groaning that it's not possible. Having the confidence and courage to voice positivity and take chances others won’t can make you very appealing.


Avoid being arrogant or aloof. Instead, be humbly confident in your skills and aptitude. Although you should already be competent and able in your current role, make every effort to avoid coming across as conceited about what you do. There’s a fine line between letting your smarts shine and being a braggart. Avoid “tooting your own horn” or pointing out that you think you're smarter or more capable than another coworker.

Try to be in fashion, somewhat.","How to Be the ""Best You"" in High School"," Keep hair clean , well-conditioned, shiny and combed/brushed at all times. Recommended shampoo/conditioners are Suave, VO5, Tresemme, or Biolage (all very cheap, ranging from 1.99-16.49) If you have an off day and don’t have time to wash, rub some talcum powder (0.50) into your roots, some anti-frizz (3.69) on your tips and brush it out, from roots to tip, to at least give some impression of cleanliness. If you choose to work against your natural texture buy an iron (straightening or curling, whichever) and use it smartly, with your heat-shield (3.99) and frizz-ease (7.17);
, Yup, that’s right: your face. Wash it 2-3 times a day, with a recommended face wash for your skin type, not too cheap and not too expensive. Keep bushy eyebrows plucked just the right amount. This means lugging your booty to CVS or Sally Hansen’s and buying a professional-quality kit. They’re only 7.99 when they’re not on sale. If you have embarrassing nose hair, trim it with those special little machines that go for about 15.00 at any regular beauty store. Point is: KEEP IT CLEAN-CUT.

, Not the clothes on your body, but your body in itself. You should always be showered with either a citrus or fresh scent. Orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit soaps all fall under the citrus category, and are commonly on sale at Marshall’s in those cute little boxes shaped like books. Fresh scents are harder to distinguish. They’d be Granny Smith Apples, clean linen, freshwater, champagne bubbles… these are all examples of popular bar and liquid soap smells that are usually running for 2.99 in the box set at T.J. Maxx. Any moisturizer or self-tanner should match your soap. Shampoo and conditioner should be neutral, like “Waterfall” from Suave or “Freesia” from VO5.

, Pedicures aren’t always practical, but at least make an effort to keep them on the leash! This is classified as: cut to a reasonable length, filed to your desired shape, and slicked over with some top/base coat, to keep it from breaking off. Then, if you want, you can gloss them toe-toes over with a fun color like turquoise or coral, from the Hard as Nails collection (2.39 a bottle!) Avoid sparkles or crackle polish because it takes a lot of effort to scrape off, even with extra-strength polish remover (1.00)

, Is your hairstyle still holding, or slowly unleashing it’s frizzy wrath? Fix that! Do you have some smudge on your face, pointing out that tiny breakout on the tip of your chin? Fix that! Do your pits sort of, well… sting your taste buds when you raise your arms? Fix that! And are those doggies barking? Well… please fix that.

, School is a big chunk of your life, no matter what color's in this season. So set aside time for:


Read through notes and textbooks for an hour a day. Make sure to jot down a few key points to review and clarify before the big test.
Take good notes. It's pretty much rewriting the messy scribbles you take down during class into clean, legible notes, so that you always have material to fall back on when you have to cram.
Clarify. Just read a paragraph of the material. Find the main idea of that section. Write it down, and a quick sentence explaining what it is. Repeat for the rest of the material. You get it done quicker than expected, and it's better than just reading through boring texts and trying and failing miserably at memorizing stupid, pointless details.

, Fashion is pretty important in high school. Some girls live and breathe by it. But you shouldn't be so obsessed. Take note and buy some in advance. Wear them around to school and such, and when the trends become actual trends, move onto the next one. But only choose trends you feel comfortable in. What's the point of dressing like someone else if you're NOT someone else?

Before you buy any makeup, visit a makeup expert. They can give you a makeup lesson on how to apply makeup, explain what colors are right for you, and answer general questions. You can find makeup experts at department stores, makeup stores, and spas.;
, Adolescence is the perfect time to adopt a good skin care regimen. This is the time when breakouts are most likely to occur. Taking care of your skin can help prevent unwanted blemishes and acne. Skin care is also pivotal when wearing makeup. You always want to start the makeup application process by washing your face.



Determine what kind of skin you have. Do you have oily, dry, or combination skin? This indicates the kind of face wash you should buy.
If you have dry skin, use a mild cleanser. Cream cleansers are good for dry skin.
If you have oily skin, try a cleanser with salicylic acid or other acne fighting ingredients., After washing your face, apply a light moisturizer. This hydrates the face and prepares it for your makeup application. Moisturizer is important as you age to prevent early signs of aging.


For girls with dry skin, go for a more intense moisturizer, like one with glycerine. For girls with oily skin, choose a light, oil-free moisturizer.Moisturizers with rice proteins can help absorb oil.
Make sure to apply SPF product every day, too. The sun is one of your skin's worst enemies. Sun damage can lead to wrinkles, damaged skin, or even skin cancer. After applying your moisturizer, dab on some SPF made specifically for your face. Try a tinted moisturizer with SPF added so you can do two things with one product!

, Concealer is your best friend when you have breakouts or blemishes. Concealer is a product that helps cover and camouflage dark circles and blemishes on the face. Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone. Dab the concealer on the red spot; make sure not to wipe. That will take the concealer off. Blend gently with your finger. Brush some loose powder over the spot to set it.


Make sure to set concealer with powder that is one shade lighter than your skin. When it touches the concealer, it will darken.Don't choose a concealer stick that is too white, pinky, or ashy. Try to match it as closely to your skin tone as possible.Concealer can also be used under your eyes if you happen to have any dark circles or need lightening. Use a yellow-based concealer to lighten under the eyes.

, Foundation is used to create an even skin tone. Teenaged girls don't need foundation; at this age, you already have beautiful skin. Most makeup experts suggest that during your teen years, less is more.Concealer is probably all you'll need at this age. Foundations can be heavy, making you look dirty, cakey, and much older. You want to look natural and highlight your natural beauty.


If you have oily skin and want to wear foundation, choose an oil-free foundation that has therapeutic qualities for your oily face. You can buy these foundations at the store, or go to a doctor to get medical foundations.
If you want to wear foundation, go light and natural. The foundation should match the skin color of your neck.
Squeeze a nickle-sized amount of foundation into the palm of your hand. Use a foundation brush to draw the foundation on your face like a six-point star starting from your nose. Draw a line from the nose to the forehead, nose to your left and right cheek, nose to your left and right jaw, and nose to your chin. Then, use a sponge to blend the foundation into your skin. Lastly, use the brush to spread and blend the little bit of remaining foundation onto your neck.Foundation brushes are larger than blush, concealer, or powder brushes. Foundation brushes and sponges can be bought at most major retailers.

, Like foundation, powder isn't necessary for young skin. It just covers up your natural glow. In addition to using powder to cover up your concealer on blemishes or under your eyes, you can add a little powder to your T-zone - your forehead, nose, and chin. This is the spot that is most likely to get oily through the day. Apply pressed or loose powder with a foundation or powder brush over your T-zone. It will help absorb the oil, but not cover up your natural glow.


Never use the same brush for multiple makeup types. If you used a foundation brush with foundation, don't use the same brush to spread powder on your face. Always use separate brushes.

, Sticking to this rule gives you plenty of time to apply the makeup you need without going overboard.To give yourself a Five Minute Face, limit your makeup time to five minutes in the morning. Don't rush; limit what you put on to what is essential: concealer, mascara, blush, and lip gloss. If it takes you longer than five minutes to apply your makeup, odds are you're applying too much.


Embrace your natural beauty. Keep in mind that makeup is supposed to enhance your beauty, not cover it up. Don't think that tons of foundation and powder is how you should wear your makeup. That might be true as you age, but at this age, enjoy your natural glowing skin.

, Using a brow brush, clean mascara brush, or toothbrush, comb your eyebrows up and over. Don't comb your eyebrows inward. This keeps them looking neat and growing the correct way.









Don't over pluck your eyebrows. Many teen girls thin their eyebrows too much. All you need to do is keep them neat and brushed.

, Eyeliner is used around the lids of the eyes to define the eyes. A bit of eyeliner is an option for your look. Less is more works for eyeliner application - too much eyeliner can give you raccoon eyes or make you look dirty. Go for brown or light grays or even purple. Wear black on special occasions or the weekend when you want to look extra special.


Apply the liner on the lower lash line and smudge with a cotton swab. Apply it to the top lid, keeping close to the lash line. Smudge with a cotton swab.
Black eyeliner is not for everybody. It can make your eyes look smaller. The smaller your eyes, the lighter your liner should be.

, Mascara is used to define the eyes by thickening, lengthening, and darkening the lashes. The only two things you probably need as a teen girl is mascara and lip gloss. Using a brown mascara, place the brush at the roots of your top, outer lashes. Wiggle the brush outwards, coating the lashes with mascara. Do the same to the inner lashes and the bottom lashes.









Be careful of clumping mascara. Wiggling the brush can help your lashes not to clump. You can also brush your lashes with an eyelash comb to try to prevent clumps. Don't over apply - too much mascara can cause clumps.
Blue eyes look good with dark brown mascara, while dark eyes look good with darker mascara.
Not everyone should wear black. Decide which shade of brown or black enhances your eyes while still making you natural. You want to save shocking, intense eyes for special occasions.

, Select a natural, shimmery shade for your everyday look. Apply the eyeshadow with an eyeshadow brush to your lower lids. Don't go all the way up to the brow line.


If you have brown and hazel eyes, wear warm colors like copper and gold. If you have brown and green eyes, try gray or plum.You can also have fun with crazy colors, like blue. Just remember that these are generally not everyday colors, but for special occasions.

, Go for a natural look when wearing blush. You just want to give your cheeks a touch of color. Never wear extremely dark blush colors. Instead, go for bronzers or pink rosy colors.


To apply the blush, smile to find the apples of your cheeks (the round parts). Brush a light amount on your apple, then your nose, forehead, and chin.

, Lip gloss gives you a natural color while adding shimmer. If you want a bit of color, try a lip tint. Go for soft pinks or tans. Avoid dark colors; they will give you a hard, old look.

, Never sleep in makeup. Sleeping in makeup causes blemishes, rashes, and can cause early aging. Buy an oil-free makeup remover to remove your makeup at night. Soak a cotton ball in the remover and wipe it over your face to get all the day's product.


Makeup remover is important to help prevent clogged pores and rashes. It is specifically designed to remove makeup and makeup residue, which your cleanser isn't. Always use makeup remover before you wash your face. Use a formula for face makeup, and a separate special formula for your eyes geared towards removing mascara and liner., After removing your makeup, wash it with a cleanser. This removes any dirt, oil, and impurities your face has acquired throughout the day. You can use the same cleanser as you did that morning. Also moisturize your face to keep it hydrated.


Only wash your face twice a day. Overwashing your face can cause breakouts and break down vital skin cells., Makeup can lead to clogged pores even if you wash regularly. Purchase an exfoliating scrub containing benzoyl peroxide, which will help you remove any leftover impurities that can cause acne or blemishes.

, Pat your face dry with a clean towel and apply a moisturizer. ""Simple"" is a good brand to start off with if you are new to facial routines.

, Get the make up supplies you need. Make sure that they are right for your skin tone (i.e. foundation) and they don't dry out your skin.

, If you have any areas that you want to conceal, you should do this before you apply foundation, but always remember to get concealer in a lighter shade than your actual skin tone, because it will make your eyes appear brighter and refreshed.

, Using a foundation brush would be ideal. Remember, do not over-do this, that's what most people do wrong. Your foundation should be a tiny dollop on your finger, not a huge load!

, Make sure it's all rubbed in, and get yourself a translucent powder and a powder brush and apply all over face, especially your nose and forehead, to reduce shine during the day.

, Use either blusher or bronzer. Bronzer gives a nice natural looking glow to your cheeks, which looks really good. Choose, and simply apply either one of them to your cheeks with a brush, in large upwards sweeps.

, Just a tiny line of eye liner underneath the bottom lash line, or water line if you prefer. Brown is good, but black makes them stand out just ever so slightly more. Some color make your eyes stand out more (ex. Purple looks good with hazel eyes). If you really want to stand out use lots of eyeliner on your top lid.

, Do your mascara on your top lashes in wiggling motions, to get rid of any clumps along the way. You can put a little on your bottom lash line, just not too much.

, A slick of peachy/pink lipstick should help to reduce chapped lips, especially during winter months.

Makeup is a fun way to enhance your features, but it is not meant to change your appearance. Only wear a little bit of makeup and keep the colors you wear to school natural., Choose a loose powder color that matches your skin tone. Use a large brush or a puff that comes with the powder. Put powder onto the brush or puff and apply it to your face. Start by putting the powder on your nose and cheeks then work your way out., You can use a clear mascara or black or brown mascara.

Stick to simple colors like shades of pink. Apply the lip gloss on your lips to make them appear shinier and brighter.

, Wearing makeup can impress your date, but don’t change who you are. If you are going on a date, wear as much makeup that you feel is true to yourself. If you never wear makeup and feel uncomfortable in it, then don’t show up to the date with a ton of makeup on. If you will feel more confident with a little bit of makeup on, then wear makeup for your date.

, You will want your skin to glow on your date. You can apply a tinted moisturizer like a BB cream for your date or you can apply a powder. Use a large brush or a puff to apply powder to your face. Remember to use face makeup that matches your skin tone and to wash it off at night.

Consider getting a waterproof mascara if the date is outside and you are going to be sweating.

, You can put a small amount of blush on your cheeks with a blush brush. Look in the mirror and smile. Apply blush only to the “apples” of your cheeks. These are the areas of your cheeks that pop out when you smile. Apply a small amount of blush in a circular motion., Use a lip tint or stain for your date in a bright or neutral color. Lip tint won’t come off when you eat so you won’t have any embarrassing lip stick marks on your face part way through the date.

, There are many types of foundation. You can just apply a powder foundation or you can apply something with more coverage such as a liquid foundation or a moisturizing BB cream. Make sure your foundation matches your skin tone and that you wash it off at the end of the night. Sleeping in foundation can give you acne., You can use natural eyeshadow colors such as beiges and browns or colorful eyeshadow. Less is more when it comes to eyeshadow so be careful not to put on too much. You can use just one color or mix two or three shades of a color.

Cultivate it, work to achieve it, and follow the steps in this section to build it. Just be aware that it can't be faked—it has to come from the inside.;
, Hunching over can not only cause back problems but makes you look as if you have no self-confidence. Sit-up straight too, for the same reasons.

, Smiling will make you appear happy. confident, and outgoing. It will also keep you from looking tired and in despair.

, It's only polite when talking to someone to look them in the eye. Don't stare—look at different parts of their face occasionally, but beyond that, maintaining good eye contact will show confidence and self-assuredness on your end.

, Your clothes and how you wear them say a lot about you, and will have an effect on how people perceive you. Wearing unflattering or extremely poorly-sized clothing says you don't care about how you present yourself.

The particular style is not as much a factor as how you wear it. You can wear whatever style is comfortable for you, whether it be trendy, alternative, casual or sporty, as long as it's appropriate to who you are. For example, if you're 30, and dress like you're 15, you'll look like you're trying to recapture your youth, not like you're a trendy 15-year-old. The same is true for any style—if it doesn't accurately reflect who you are, it will be seen as either clueless or fake. Neither impression will suggest ""handsome"" to anybody.

, When you're at a mall or walking down the street, take note of guys who appear to be fashionable. What things do you first notice?


Women often look at shoes—a detail many guys gloss over. Because so many guys gloss over that part, taking the time to select, wear, and maintain a nice pair of shoes is a great way to boost how you're perceived.

, If you have absolutely no fashion sense and have the money, hiring a personal shopper can be a good initial step. They will help you identify your style, select clothes for you and then show you where to obtain these clothes on your own in the future.


If you don't have the money, have a stylish friend or relative go shopping with you for the day.
Listen to them, but be aware that they may have their own style sense that's not quite your style sense. If most of the choices they're suggesting don't appeal to you, don't feel like you have to go with their suggestions. Thank them for their time, and try another personal shopper more attuned to your sense of style.

, Having a signature item of clothing can help you stand out and draw attention to your style. Take Steve Jobs, for example. His signature look was a black turtleneck, blue jeans, and New Balance running shoes.


Jewelry, such as a trademark ring, necklace, or watch can be effective, and useful too.
Tinted shades. You should only wear these outdoors, but a good pair of aviators or tinted shades draws attention to your face.
Cologne. Avoid run-of-the-mill cologne and get a scent that no one else has. This can be a great conversation starter. Don't wear too much, though, or the conversation it starts will be behind your back, and it won't be complimentary.

, We all know how to talk, but being able to speak clearly and enunciate well will enhance how you are perceived.Know that voice is an impression itself.

, Wash your hands regularly. Your fingernails should be free of dirt and trimmed evenly. Do not bite your fingernails, or chew on your cuticles—you'll look nervous and neurotic.

, With extremely rare (and often accidental) exception, walking out of the house with bed head never looks good. Wash and brush your hair on a regular basis. If you have the time and inclination, consider using a paste or gel to style your hair, but follow the ""less is more"" rule with styling products, and don't use too much.
, Many people, perhaps unfairly, associate bad skin with bad hygiene. Wash your face thoroughly, especially after any physical activity. Avoid razor burn if at all possible. If you're prone to acne or other skin conditions, see a dermatologist to help you get your skin in shape.

, Do this every day—it's an invigorating way to start the day, and looking clean and smelling good doesn't hurt in the perception department, either!

, Eating healthy will help with many things such as keeping a good weight, avoiding cavities, having a good complexion, and being energetic.

, Getting eight hours or more of sleep every night will do wonders for your complexion, energy and overall appearance.

, Looking handsome goes beyond your style. Exercising regularly not only helps with your appearance, confidence, and energy, but releases endorphins that make you feel good, and therefore more appealing to others.

, Your options are either a mirror at the sink or in a stall. Some girls don't like the idea of other girls seeing them applying makeup at the sink. Others don't care. It really is your choice.


If it is a stall, make sure you have a magnetic mirror.

, Apply your primer, concealer, foundation, power, and bronzer first, or whichever ones you use. Make sure to blend well! The teacher will know right away if you went to the bathroom to do makeup if there's a big tan line on your chin.

, If you don't absolutely need it, don't apply it! You don't have a lot of time. Skip the foundation and concealer if your skin is fine, or ignore the bronzer if you’re naturally tan.

, Make sure you use neutral colors for eyeshadows, like browns, tans, beige, and so on. Don't forget to curl your lashes if you do at home, and apply a little mascara, not so much that it's super dramatic. If you do eyeliner, only on the top, because it tends to be darker and noticeable on the bottom.

, Use a clear, matte lip gloss or chapstick. Apply your blush or whatever else you do.

, Any rough lines? Super bold colors? Smudged mascara? Blend whatever you need, or wipe away any makeup that looks odd.

,, Wipe any spilled cosmetics off the sink or stalls, put all your makeup away, and wash your hands well.

, Leave the bathroom feeling beautiful. Tell your teacher you feel better or report to class with confidence!

Start by cleaning your face with a gentle cleanser.,

Next, apply concealer.,
Powder time!,
Apply some mascara.,
Apply some blush.,
Now for the finale!",How to Apply Clean Makeup (for Teen Girls)," When buying a cleanser, go for one that's for sensitive skin, even if you think your face can stand something harsh. Moisten your face with a warm washcloth so that it is damp. Apply the cleanser over your face in a a circular motion so that it exfoliates your skin properly. Rinse your face softly with a warm washcloth to wash away all traces of cleanser.;
, One like Clean and Clear ""Morning Burst"" moisturizer will add a slightly dewy complexion to your skin before you start applying makeup. A very important tip about facial moisturizer is to always make sure that it's lightweight! If it isn't lightweight, it could clog your pores and cause you to break out!

, Use a medium-coverage mineral concealer for darkness under your eyes so you appear awake and well-rested. Using a medium-coverage mineral concealer that is more on the liquid side will help from making your makeup appear matted, or be cake-like in appearance. Dab it on with your ring finger.

, Now, use a powder that is close to your skin tone to avoid making you look 'fake'. If possible, use a powder with an SPF to help protect you from the sun's harmful rays. Since foundation is not needed for a clean makeup look, you can just apply your powder immediately after your concealer. Do not apply concealer again once you have powder over it - your makeup WILL be matted.

, The key to having mascara look very natural is to buy it in the right colour for you. If you're a blonde, buy dark brown mascara, as black will come off too harsh. If you're a brunette, you can wear dark brown or black mascara. If you've got black hair, buy black mascara. If you're a redhead (depending on how red your hair is) wear dark brown or black mascara. As another option that suits all hair colours, wear clear mascara. Apply your mascara on top and underneath your upper lashes to give them a nice coating, and simply on top of the bottom ones. This will give you a nice look.

, Buy a colour that works for you. If you're fair-skinned, a light rosy colour is good. If you've got tanned skin, a light peach blush works. If you've got dark skin, go for a berry colour. Before applying your blush, swirl your blush brush into your blush and tap the excess off. Apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks for a healthy glow. To do this, lightly swirl the blush from your apples upwards, and blend out. Don't make your blush too harsh or you'll look like an overdone Barbie doll, which is not what you're going for.

, Finish off with a clear or light pink lip gloss with SPF (15 or higher). If you have dry lips, use a lip balm instead, to keep your lips moisturized. This should also have an SPF.

, Focus on under the eyes and around the nose if you have spots there. Leaving your skin with the moisturizer not soaked in makes the concealer creamier, and it will sink into the skin and not cake.

, This will make your eyes appear bigger and brighter.

, Dust the bronzer on the apples of your cheeks and sweep upwards to your temples to define your cheekbones.

If you forget to put on deodorant before you leave the house, find some hand sanitizer and wipe it on your armpits — it'll kill the bacteria that produces body odor. You might have to reapply a few times during the day.;
, Wash your hair thoroughly, and use a body wash or soap that has a fresh and clean scent.


If you usually take a shower in the morning, consider getting a fogless mirror for your shower so you can wash your face and shave while you're in there.

, How you smell throughout the day can make or break your attractiveness — if you get it right, people will be automatically drawn closer to you. If you get it wrong, though, it can have the opposite effect and actually repel people. Here are some basic guidelines to follow:


Don't wear too much. This is the most important thing about smelling good — it can't be too strong because it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Even roses can smell nauseating if you take a big whiff of concentrated rose oil. Do two or three pumps of cologne/after-shave maximum and only three pumps of body spray. Your nose will get used to the scent and stop smelling it after a few minutes, but other people can still smell you.
Find a scent that works with your natural smell. Everyone's body chemistry is slightly different, and as a result, not every scent fits every person. There are smells that ""work"" on some people and start to smell terrible on others. If you can, sample a cologne or body spray before you buy it. Wear it around for a day, and ask a friend to tell you how it smells a few hours later.
Try to match up your body wash and your cologne/after-shave. They don't have to be the same scent, but they should be similar so that they don't produce a clashing smell.
Put cologne/after-shave over pulse points. The parts of your body where large amounts of blood are flowing close to the surface will be a little bit warmer throughout the day, which will heat up the cologne/after-shave slightly and make it smell stronger. Common areas include the wrists, throat, and back of the neck.

, Men naturally have more testosterone than women, which is linked to an increase in pimples and outbreaks. Counteract this by taking care to keep your face clean.


Find products that are appropriate for your skin type. Here are the most common kinds:

Sensitive/dry skin: If your skin tends to be flaky and dry, or gets red and irritated easily, use an extremely gentle cleanser. Skip toner, and use a light moisturizer.
Combination/T-zone skin: If your forehead, nose and chin (or ""T-zone"") tend to be oily but your cheeks are dry, you have ""combination"" skin. Most people have this skin type, so look for a cleanser that's marketed for normal or combination skin. Use a gentle toner on your T-zone, and finish up with a moisturizer.
Oily skin: If your skin tends to be uniformly oily, find a clay-based or drying cleanser. Use a gentle toner everywhere on your face, and finish with a light moisturizer. If your skin feels oily during the day, pick up some face-blotting tissues from the skin-care section of the drugstore and pat them on your skin in the afternoon.


If you have acne, use a salicylic acid face wash and put benzoyl peroxide cream on pimples. If this doesn't help, see a dermatologist.

, Whether you choose to be bare-faced or have a beard, the key is taking care to groom your facial hair every day.


For a clean-shaven look, shave every morning before you leave for work or school. Wet your skin first, and use a sharp razor and shaving cream. Shaving against the grain (that is, in the opposite direction of hair growth, from your jaw to your cheek) provides a closer shave, but results in more irritation. If you struggle with ingrown hairs, try shaving with the grain.
Manage your beard, mustache or goatee. Make sure the edges are neat and clean, and trim any hair so that it's uniformly long. When you're cleansing your face, pay special attention to scrubbing the skin beneath any facial hair.

, You don't have to pluck your eyebrows, but it might help you look a little more well-groomed overall. Here are some basic pointers:


Find a good pair of tweezers. The two prongs should meet completely — this will make plucking less painful and more efficient. Alternatively (and pain-freely), you can buy a hair trimmer inexpensively - which is also handy if you have visible nose or ear hair.
Use the rest of your face as a guideline. Find a pencil and hold it up to the edge of one nostril, so that the pencil crosses your eyebrow. Hair that runs past the pencil and into the ""unibrow"" zone over your nose should be plucked. Do this for the other side as well.
Clean up your arches. If your brows still look a bit bushy after you've plucked or trimmed the middle, you can try removing a bit from beneath your arches. Remember, though, to only pluck 'or trim 'beneath your eyebrows — not the hair above the brow.


, Every two or three days, when you get out of the shower, take a minute to quickly trim up all 20 of your nails and clean out any dirt from beneath them. They'll be softer and easier to manage after you've been in the water for a few minutes. Both your fingernails and toenails should be trimmed short, so there's just a thin line of white above the quick.

, Combat bad breath and maintain a pearly-white smile by taking good care of your teeth.


Update your toothbrush. Your toothbrush should be replaced once every 3 months, or after you've recovered from a cold or other infectious illness. If the bristles are starting to splay out, you need a new one.
Floss every night. Not only does flossing get plaque and food out of your mouth, it's also thought to prevent heart disease.
Brush your tongue. Your teeth might be sparkling white, but you'll still be saddled with bad breath if your tongue is dirty. Using your toothbrush, make a few light strokes over your tongue whenever you brush. (Don't push too hard, or you'll damage the tissue).
Finish with mouthwash. Swish thoroughly for 20 seconds, and spit.

, Even if you're trying to grow it out, it needs regular cuts to stave off split ends. You can visit a professional stylist, or cut it yourself. Either way, consider these schedules:


If you prefer to keep your hair short, aim to have it trimmed every 2 to 3 weeks. Make sure that you or your stylist shaves the hair that grows down the back of your neck.
If you're growing out your hair, have the ends trimmed every 4 to 6 weeks. Even if it's going to be covered, take care to shave the hair that grows down the back of your neck.

, Washing hair every day works for most guys, but you could stretch it to every other day if your hair is particularly dry.


Find a shampoo and conditioner that are designed for your hair type - dry, greasy, etc.
Buy separate shampoo and conditioner - products that combine shampoo and conditioner don't work as well
Ask your hairdresser's advice - they are experts! If you buy shampoo and conditioner from them, they may be more expensive than regular ones but are probably higher quality.

, You don't have to use a product to style your hair, but many men do. It can help your hair look shinier and healthier, as well as providing more hold and control. Here are some common products used to style men's hair:


Serums or creams. These can help you tame fly-aways or de-frizz curls without making your hair stiff and immovable.
Mousse. Use hair mousse to add volume and shine to your hair, with minimal hold. For best results, apply to wet hair and allow to dry.
Pomade, hair wax or hair clay. Use these products to mold your hair into difficult-to-achieve shapes, such as pompadours or curls (for naturally straight hair). Be aware that it can take several washes to remove these products, so apply them lightly. A pea-sized amount should be plenty if you have short, medium or thin hair. Use pomade or hair wax for a shiny, wet look; use hair clay for a matte, natural tone.
Gel. Unlike pomade, gel contains alcohol that dries out hair and makes for a stiffer hold. For the strongest hold, apply gel to wet hair.
Hair glue. Ever wonder how some people get their mohawks to stand straight up? They're probably using some variation of hair glue, which provides the strongest possible hold. Be wary of product build-up, and wash hair thoroughly.
Ask your hairdresser's advice! They will know what doesn't look good.

, Ask your friends what they think. And next time your have your hair cut, ask your hairdresser's advice on hair styles; also ask whether you should comb it or blow-dry it. You might have to experiment a bit to find out what hairstyle best suits your face and your style, but eventually, you'll settle into a look that works for you. Consider these options:


Part your hair. You can part your hair down the middle, to the side, or not at all. Try it a few different ways and see what you like.
Comb your hair in one direction, instead of parting, you can try combing the top of your hair in one way. If it's particularly short, try combing it forward; if it's longer, you could comb it back or spike it up. Again, try out some different styles.
If you have longer hair, you can try pulling it back into a ponytail, styling it so that it lands in front of your face, or combing back and tying up just the top section.

, If you're balding, it might be best to cut or shave your hair short, so that the difference between the two areas is less noticeable. Be sure to wash your hair right after exercising, as failing to do so is said to accelerate balding, and give yourself a nice scalp massage every time you shower.

, Yes, every single morning! Even when dressing casually for an ordinary day, don't just throw on whatever you have lying around. Select clothes that match and that suit what you'll be doing.

, When buying clothes, you probably can't tell what looks good on you - not least because you can't see all of yourself in a mirror. Also, what looks good on some celebrity or male model in a photograph may not suit you! So get a friend who dresses well and knows about fashion to come with you when you shop.

, Cheap clothes that fit look much better than expensive clothes that don't!


Try on every item before buying it - and ask your friend to check you out from all angles! Don't rely on marked sizes - they are only a rough guide.
In general, the bottom of your pants (trousers) should touch your shoes, long-sleeved shirts should cover your wrists, and the bottom of your shirt should hit your hips. Even underwear must fit well!
Be prepared to try on several items for each one you end up buying. If a store doesn't have something that looks great on you, go somewhere else - don't just settle for something that looks OK.
Don't buy clothes online - you won't have tried them on first, so they are unlikely to fit well. Also, without trying them you won't know whether they will look good on you (even if they look good on the model in the photo!)
Don't try to hide your body. Whether you're embarrassed about being too large or too skinny, trying to cover it up with baggy clothing only makes you look worse. You don't have to wear clothing that's completely form-fitting, but it shouldn't sag or leave too much space.
If you can't wear sizes off the rack, find an inexpensive seamstress or tailor. Maybe you have thin hips but long legs, and you can't find a pair of jeans that accommodates both. Buy clothing that's slightly larger than you need, and find someone to take it in so that it fits your measurements. Most dry cleaning businesses will do alterations for a fair price.
Get rid of old clothes. You might love that old T-shirt from high school, but it probably doesn't fit well anymore. Clothes and your body change size and shape over time. Even if they still fit, clothes that are more than two or three years old are probably starting to look tired or out of fashion.

, Here's a basic rule of getting dressed: light colors highlight, and dark colors obscure. For instance, if you like your shoulders but you're not as fond of your legs, you might try wearing dark-wash jeans and a light-colored T-shirt.

, The right color will make your skin look awesome, while the wrong one can make it look washed out and sallow. Again, ask advice from a friend! Here are some basic tests to try:


Determine whether you look better in white or off-white. Try holding a stark white shirt up to your face, then an off-white shirt. If you're like most people, you'll look notably better next to one or the other. Once you figure it out, stick to what works.
Determine whether you look better in black or brown. This one isn't as clear-cut as white, but some people look notably better in black over brown, and vice versa. When you settle on one, don't mix the colors — for instance, don't wear brown shoes and a brown belt with black dress trousers. Wear black shoes, black pants, and a black belt, or all brown.
Try to figure out if you prefer ""warm"" or ""cool"" colors. Cool colors are generally based on blues, purples, dark greens, and blue-based reds, while warm colors are based on yellows, oranges, browns, and yellow-based reds. An easy way to figure this out is to find something that's blue-red, and something that's yellow-red, and hold them up to your face. Which one looks better with your skin tone? (If you need more help determining warm and cool colors, search online for a color wheel that demonstrates this.)

, These pieces shouldn't fall out of style too quickly, and they should be made of quality materials that will last a few years. Pick up items such as solid-color polo shirts, solid or plaid button-up shirts, dark blue jeans, plain white and black T-shirts (without advertisements or graphic designs), a solid-color blazer, dark dress trousers, a dark and well-fitting jacket, lace-up dress shoes, and white sneakers. You'll always be able to put together a presentable outfit from these pieces.

, Some items of clothing can stand to go through several wears before they're dirty (such as jeans or jackets), but shirts, underwear, and socks can only stand one wear before they need to be washed. Set up a regular schedule for doing laundry so that you don't spend the morning scrambling for something clean.


When laundering shirts and pants (trousers), tumble dry them until still slightly damp, then hang them on hangers (or you can lay pants flat) until they are dry. This will reduce creasing.
Preferably iron clothes too, before they are fully dry. Even jeans are better ironed.
Store clothes (other than underwear) hanging or neatly folded, so they don't crease.

, It might seem irrelevant, but standing up straight makes you seem confident and in control, which people do find attractive. Proper posture can also make you appear taller. Keep your shoulders squared, your spine straight, and try to center your hips over your feet. Walk with confidence and don't drag your feet or shuffle. Also, don't stare at the ground, and putting your hands in your pockets can make you look shy or nervous.

, Offering someone a genuine smile is one of the easiest things you can do to seem instantly appealing. Practice smiling often, and try to get into a frame of mind where your grin is easy to trigger.


Develop a warm sense of humor. Find joy and laughter in the ridiculous aspects of life, and don't be afraid to point this out to other people. Try to keep your jokes free of references to bodily functions, sex acts, or disparaging other groups of people.

, When you're talking to someone (especially someone you like), demonstrate that you're interested and paying attention by making consistent eye contact.


Use eye contact to flirt. Throw several glances at someone sitting near you or across the room until he or she catches you. Maintain eye contact for a second, smile and look away.

, You don't have to be a stuffed shirt to show basic care and consideration for other people. Say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me,"" and show courtesy by holding doors open for people walking behind you.


Be respectful of other people. Don't tear down other people's beliefs, and don't be unnecessarily rude to them. If someone tries to start a confrontation with you, walk away calmly — this illustrates that you won't sink to the other person's level.
Don't swear or make crude comments in public. It's fine to let your hair down a little bit around your guy friends or your family, but avoid talking this way around people you don't know well.

, Being a competent conversationalist can help people feel more at ease and relaxed around you. Know how to casually inquire about how someone is doing, and let that lead into other topics of conversation. Ask open-ended questions (for example, instead of saying ""Do you have any plans this weekend?"", which can be answered with a simple yes or no, ask ""What are you up to this weekend?""), and stay away from contentious topics such as politics and religion.


To sharpen your conversational skills, try striking up a chat with a stranger next time you're waiting around in public, such as at a bus stop or in line at the grocery store. If you can get a genuine smile and a few lines of conversation out of the other person, you're doing well.

, When you talk to other people, try not to mumble or rush your words. Also, try to avoid speaking ""ghetto"" or with too much slang; many women find it unattractive when you do. Form full sentences, and avoid opening your mouth before you've really thought about what you're going to say — it will save you a lot of potential embarrassment.

, Sticking to a healthy diet can help you avoid bad breath and pungent body odor, as well as keeping you healthy and trim. Try incorporating some of these guidelines into your diet:


Avoid junk food and items that are high in sugar, it can cause problems for your skin and make you look older. These treats are fine every once in a while, but they shouldn't be an everyday thing. Try to limit modest amounts of soda, beer, candy bars, potato chips and other junky items to one ""cheat"" day per week.
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. You've heard it a hundred times, but eating plenty of raw fruits and vegetables is vital to a healthy diet. Consider trying to eat fresh fruit (such as apples, oranges, and pears) as a snack, and try to eat at least one vegetable at both lunch and dinner.
Learn to prepare food. Start with simple things - boil eggs, make sandwiches and salads, cook burgers and steaks, heat frozen veggies, boil rice and pasta. It will save you money, improve your health and impress people!

, Consistent physical activity can not only help your body look more attractive, but it also lifts your mood and keeps you from getting sick as often. Set up a plan that works for you, and stick to it. Here are some suggestions to get you started:


Do basic stretches, sit-ups, push-ups, and other exercises every other day. Stay consistent with the number of repetitions. Then, as your muscles improve, increase the number of repetitions you do and you will see results.
Try different weightlifting plans. Try to do as much as you can, but don't overextend yourself, and give your muscles rest days to heal and build muscle. Working out every day may actually be bad for you! However, don't be afraid of becoming way too buff. Bodybuilders in magazines look that huge because lifting weights is the only thing they do for a living. It won't happen to you.

The primary core lifts are Bench Press, Squat, Overhead Press, and Deadlift. Weighted pull ups and dips can be great accessories to these. If you need more chest work, consider doing Incline Press. If you would rather do more explosive workouts, consider Power Clean, Push-press. If this still isn't enough, consider doing bar snatch, workouts w/jerk, hang clean w/front squat, or other dumbbell lifts. If you have a membership, great, use the bar primarily, and use machines such as lat pull downs to supplement.


Walk, jog, ride your bicycle, or run for 30 minutes or for a mile or two as well (if you ride a bike, run, jog, or walk to school or work, then you can get well-exercised just walking, jogging, running, or riding your bike; this works on your stomach, legs, and back). It will help your body system to be more flexible and more upcoming to objectives.
Consider morning exercise. It can bring out your skin and make it look nicer throughout the day. Just make sure to take a shower after as well. Sometimes as you work out throughout the day you sweat. All that sweat would not smell nice. Taking a shower after a period of sweating to get fully clean would stop the odor.

, For some women, nothing is more attractive than being intelligent. Keep up to date with schoolwork and work hard to achieve those top grades. Read daily, and read a newspaper so you're up to date with current affairs.

For starters, before you go to bed, get a gel eye mask and put it in the freezer until it turns to ice - wear this all night to prevent dark bags forming under the eyes.,

",How to Apply Daytime Makeup (Teen Girls),";
, No one wants to reek and no one likes to be next to someone who does (obviously). A warm shower will assist in awakening your pores and get your skin ready for makeup. While in the shower, use a face scrub to help get rid of dead skin cells and dirt that have formed overnight.

, Tone: Put toner on a cotton wool puff and wipe once around your face. Moisturize: (Make sure it is oil free!) Wait for at least 5 minutes after you apply your toner (to make sure it's dry) and then apply a thin layer of moisturizer to your face. Wait 2 more minutes to make sure it has been fully absorbed into the skin. Remember to wash your hands with soap and warm water to keep your fingers clean, because you will be using them next!

, This is important because it's the foundation that makes you have a fresh and even canvas to apply your makeup on. You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good foundation. There are many drugstore brands that make department store quality foundations for £8-£14, like Boots or Super-drug. These places have brands like Max-factor and Number 17. If you have dry skin, you may want to use a liquid foundation and if you have oily skin you should try a powder foundation. Apply your foundation on the nose, forehead, cheeks and chin. Blend outward to the hairline and jaw line using a foundation brush, powder brush or sponge. Make sure you apply on your neck to help avoid foundation lines.

, If applying a gel eye mask before bed didn't help, you may need to apply concealer underneath your eyes with a yellow color-based concealer to help hide the dark eye circles. For acne and blackheads or any other red marks. You can either use a skin-toned concealer or a green concealer. You can blend your concealer with a cosmetic sponge or your finger, but never tug at your under-eye skin because it causes premature wrinkles; Pat your concealer gently instead.

, Apply bronzer with a powder brush across the forehead, down the nose, on the chin and on the jaw line to contour. Apply a blush on the apples of your cheeks. Make sure the bronzer and blush suits your skin tone.

, Apply a natural eye shadow on your lid and use a darker neutral shade on your crease.

, I recommend liquid eyeliner for the top and pencil for the bottom of the eyes. REMEMBER to use the same tone (brown, black or aubergine work well). Sweep well over the lip of the eye while holding your skin to prevent kinks later.

, Curl your eyelashes for 5 seconds, while this step is optional, it really helps open your eyes. Be careful when using an eyelash curler as eyelashes could be pulled out if used incorrectly.

, Using a brown or black mascara, apply lightly to your lashes, starting at the root of your eyelashes to the tips. You may wish to apply mascara to the lower lash line as well. For a more flirty look: first apply to the back of the lashes (looking down) and zig zag to prevent and clumps. Do the other side by sweeping in an upwards direction. Leave to dry for a few moments.

, Dust a translucent powder lightly over your face to set the makeup.

You've been wearing the same one for a long time and something new could be good!""
To tactfully suggest he not wear as much cologne you could say something like ""Have you ever noticed how some people wear so much cologne or perfume? Why don't people know that one or two sprays is enough?"" This way he gets the information without becoming embarrassed.

, Choose flattering clothes that flatter your body type. The colors should complement your skin tone, and they should vary with each clothing item that you purchase. During your shopping trips, ask your family members for fashion advice in order to receive the best outfits. However, choose your outfits based on your personal style, not what others want you to wear. What you wear should ultimately represent your personality.

Be positive and proactive.",How to Be a Perfect Girl," Practicing good hygiene gives you a clean canvas for looking pretty and appealing every day. If you're not a morning person, shower at night. Try putting these steps into your routine:


Shower at least once a day. You don't have to wash your hair once a day (more on that later), but you should clean your body that often. Already had your daily shower, but you got sweaty working out/walking home/going to your job? Shower again.
Wash your hair often enough to keep it clean. African-style hair varies widely, but you can usually find a product to wash it at least once a week without damage, sometimes more. Other types of hair need washing every one to three days, with thinner and oilier hair needing more frequent washes. If your hair is oily, wash it every day, but if it's not, don't wash it every day
Brush, floss and use mouthwash. Do all three twice a day, and you'll have a clean mouth.
Deodorize. Put a deodorant (or combination deodorant-antiperspirant) under your armpits as soon as you get up in the morning, and reapply as necessary. Don't use spray deodorant the other ones are better for you, and for the earth.
Take care of your nails. Treat yourself to a mini mani-pedi at least once a week when you get out of the shower. Clean under all 10 fingernails and toenails, and trim them down. For extra fun, throw on a coat of nail polish. Don't bite your nails because then it will cause pain, and big nails are way more attractive.;
, If your skin is glowing and clear, you won't need much makeup to look stunning — which is handy on days when you're in a hurry. If you're under the age of 11 never use makeup because when you grow up, your skin would probably be horrible. If you're a teenager you can use makeup, but simple ones, otherwise people will think your fake, and plus you don't want to be like a joker cosplay when you go to school


Cleanse. Use a cleanser that's appropriate for you. Unless you're working out you only need to wash your face once a day. In the morning you can just use hot water to wash your face. your skin type

Tone. Use a alcohol-free toner immediately after washing your face to balance the PH of your skin. Do this twice a day.
Moisturize. Apply lotion to your skin twice a day, before putting on makeup. If you tend to have oily skin, choose something light or gel-based; if you're dry, you'll need a heavier cream.

Stay clear of acne. You can use treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to combat pimples on your own. If that's not working, consider seeing a dermatologist. Whatever you do, do not try to pop zits! That can scar your face and lead to more zits! And when you do pop or poke them they get red! Makeup can work to cover them up in case of acne emergency.
Protect your skin from sun damage. If you're going to be outside for more than 15 minutes, put some sunscreen on any exposed skin. (You'll be thankful in 30 years, when your tanned friends have wrinkles but your skin is still supple and firm.)

, How you choose to manage body and facial hair is up to you, but most girls in Western culture remove any facial hair other than eyebrows. Consider these options for managing growth:


Plucking. This is the best and most common way to groom your eyebrows on your own. If you're not sure where to pluck, consider having your brows professionally shaped the first time. After that, you can do maintenance on your own by simply removing the small regrowth.
Shaving. Shaving is the cheapest and most common way of removing armpit and leg hair. Make sure your razor is sharp, and spread either shaving cream or hair conditioner over the area you're shaving — not only will it help you keep track of your progress, it helps you avoid cuts. If you are scared of shaving, another better alternative is to trim with a trimmer which is a more safer alternative as there is less risk of any cuts. Check out How to Get Smooth Legs without Shaving if you want to avoid shaving.
Waxing. Waxing yourself can lead to a disaster, but visiting a professional can be an efficient way to manage hair growth if you have the money. Make sure the beautician you choose follows strict health and safety standards.

, The hairstyle that looks best on you depends on a lot of factors — such as the shape of your face or the texture of your hair — but you can do some basic maintenance without going overboard.


Keep your hair brushed or combed, trim split ends every 6 to 8 weeks, and try not to go overboard on styling products such as gel and hairspray.
Check out How to Do Simple and Cute Hairstyles for some more specific ideas.

, Not everyone chooses to wear makeup, but it can be used to enhance your natural beauty. Remember to not wear too much makeup. Here are some basic guidelines:


Wear a foundation that's as light as possible. Foundation should cover imperfections without completely hiding your skin. Start with a sheer powder and, if that's not working, move up to a matte liquid.
Lighten under-eye circles. If you tend to get dark purple marks under your eyes (whether it's because of allergies or sleep deprivation), you can apply concealer to make the skin look lighter.

Apply eye makeup. You can go small and stick to some light eyeshadow, or go all-out with eyeshadow, liner and mascara.

Use blush to make your cheeks glow. Pick a shade that's close to what your cheeks look like when you blush naturally, and use a light hand — a little goes a long way here.

Wear lipstick or lip gloss. For everyday wear, choose a colour that's only a shade or two darker than your natural lip. For special occasions, try something that's close to the color of the inside of your lips.

, Being generally clean will already help you smell good, but you can take it a step further. Use scented soaps and moisturizers, and try a few spritzes of perfume in the morning.


Figure out what works for you. Something that smells great on your friend might not work on your skin — everyone's chemistry is slightly different.
Get samples. Some websites will sell small perfume samples at a discounted price, or you can go to a department store and spray samples on pieces of paper. Try a few to figure out what you like.

, Dress yourself so that you look attractive and put-together without being immodest. Here are a few ideas to consider when you're building a wardrobe:


Buy a few classic pieces. Straight-leg jeans, white button-up shirts, a good sweater, and a nice pair of boots are all basic pieces that can go with a lot of different outfits.
Don't be a slave to trends. Fashion comes and goes, so resist the urge to buy something outrageous just because it's ""in"" right now. Odds are, it'll be out before you get your money's worth from it.
Don't overdo the accessories. Follow the old adage: Remove one item before you leave the house.
Make sure you always have clean laundry. Your outfit might be full of great pieces, but it'll fall flat if your clothes are dirty. Set up a laundry schedule so that you're never scrambling for clean clothes in the morning.

, Most people are attracted to confident and optimistic personalities. Why? Probably because most people can be sad and withdrawn all by themselves, but being around someone happy lifts them up. Even if you don't always feel self-assured and happy, here's how to pull it off having magnetic confidence:


Practice strong posture. Keep your shoulders back, spine straight, and chin high. How you carry yourself communicates a lot to other people, so show them that you're capable and in-charge.
Compliment others instead of competing with them. When you notice someone doing something better than you, or what you wish you could do, pay him or her a sincere compliment instead of feeling envious. You'll feel great about doing a good turn, and it shows that you're not intimidated by the accomplishments of other people.
Fake it until you make it. No one feels confident and amazing all the time. But if you pretend you feel that way, you might actually notice your confidence improve as the day goes on.

, Flashing your pearly whites is one of the best things you can do to be considered perfect.


Keep your smile natural and easy. Don't try to pull your lips too hard.
Allow your eyes to crinkle. When a smile causes your eyes to crinkle (called a Duchenne smile), people see it as more sincere.
Have a sense of humor. Laughing not only makes you feel better, it can help put other people at ease, too. Try not to take yourself or anything else too seriously.

, Presenting yourself to the world in a way that's dignified and elegant can help you win respect and admiration from other people. Consider these methods:


Practice good manners. Say ""please"" and ""thank you,"" and don't badmouth anyone in public.
Try to avoid swearing. Cursing often will make others think that you're an unintelligent, immature person and would most likely ignore you. If it slips out, that can count as an ""oops!"" moment, but don't make it a habit.
Don't put down yourself or others. Nobody's perfect, and there will be times when you need to be critical. For the most part, though, try to avoid making criticism of yourself or other people part of your daily routine.
Remember your values. Peer pressure can be cruel and tempting, but it's only temporary. Your values are your reputation and your future. They are all you truly possess; they take a lifetime to build and a moment to destroy. Once they have been compromised, what have you got left?
Be mature. Know how to handle situations maturely and reasonably. You don't need to whine or cry to get what you want. It's fine to be goofy and have fun, but remember not to make a complete fool of yourself. Be cool, calm, and collected whenever possible.

, Your interests are what make you interesting and unique, so make time for them. Participate in sports, music, reading, hobbies or whatever else you enjoy — it'll keep you well-rounded and fascinating.


Participate in extracurricular activities. They're a great way to meet people!
Stay busy. Being busy makes you interesting, so that when you're meeting new people you have things to talk about. Think about it: you'd be more interested in someone who has several interests and always has something going on than someone who simply sits around the house all day.

, A perfect girl always tries to be smart and get good grades. Make time to study, set up a schedule for your homework, and try to take a genuine interest in what you're learning. It'll pay off big in the future.

, Always respect others and never let others tear you down, that will always lift you higher. Listen to your parents and respect them. Maybe once in a while clean up the house or do the dishes, they will appreciate it and you.


Remember to always listen to your parents, older relatives, and teachers. You might not agree with the things they say, but they are older and have more life experience. If you are obedient and pleasant when they ask something of you, they will notice and think highly of your maturity.
If you keep it up long enough, you may even be awarded more freedom. Just remember not to do anything crazy with your freedom or risk losing it.

, You should neither seek out arguments and confrontations nor let people walk all over you or take advantage of your kindness. Letting people boss you around can damage your self-esteem and self-image. You're your own person.


Instead, learn to quietly diffuse arguments by being agreeable but firm. Tell people that you definitely respect their beliefs, views, or opinions, but may not necessarily agree. If someone really bothers or scares you, don't be afraid to be firm and, if necessary, tell someone.

Just try to drink only water for a week or two and if you see any changes continue or drink at least two glasses of water a day.;
, Have a bath shower twice a day, use a good long lasting deodorant, change your toothbrush every three months, use a whitening toothpaste if you don't like the colour of your teeth, brush your teeth twice a day, NEVER leave the house without brushing your hair, always clean under your nails every morning, cut your nails to just over the skin (long nails are NOT glamorous believe me). I don't have to go over this you know that!

When you've saved up enough money then you can buy yourself a whole new outfit!

Your hair can be any colour, but the hairstyles are very exclusive: a ponytail (maybe add a ribbon as a signature accessory. Make sure it matches your outfit though!), or straight down (only if your hair is straight). Preppiness is all about being natural! You can straighten your hair on special events, though. Loose waves if your hair is NATURALLY wavy or curly, pigtails but make sure they are loose and under your ears(again ribbons are a good idea), braid your hair but not if it is cut into layers- hair sticking out is messy not preppy, headbands are cute with your hair straight down.

, Wear natural make-up you don't want to look like a clown or fake.

, Good hobbies for preppy princesses are hockey, tennis, lacrosse, golf, sailing, swimming, dance or cheer-leading. Try at be the best at whatever you choose.

, try to eat whenever you're hungry not three meals a day. Don't eat too much junk food maybe once a week. Chew slowly and stop when you're full.

, Don't change your hair color just for this purpose, it'll change your whole image and you may look fake and a lot different then what you probably look like originally. Stick to your true colors, don't fall victim to peer pressure.

, If you are a brunette with pale skin, then avoid the darker colors; they will flush out your skin tone.


If you are a brunette with medium-tan skin, then you're pretty much safe to wear any color. Try rich, deep shades of purples and browns to enhance your skin tone and give you a little glow.
If you are a brunette with dark skin, then you're lucky! You can wear practically any color you want! Just try to avoid black and try the different pastels to give your color a glow... you'll be impressed with your results!
If you're a brunette with freckles, avoid all reds and pinks, if possible. Try yellows and tans!

, A brunette keeps it natural, though. Wear a neutral cream eyeshadow and tan-brown cream eyeliner, and natural-looking brownish-black mascara. Wear a blush one-two shades darker than your skin tone, and avoid pure pink. For blush, tawny tannish-pinks are best. Wear a foundation to match your exact skin tone. If you want an extra glow, lightly sweep bronzer all over your face.

, Keep it healthy. Use a shampoo like John Frieda shampoo and conditioner made especially for brunettes. It will give you major high-gloss, and a healthy shine/sheen. Before straightening, don't forgot to use heat protection!

Surround yourself with nice, pleasant people and things.",How to Be a Hygienic Girl at School," Either at night or in the morning, it doesn't matter, as long as you're taking a shower. Make sure you use the proper shampoos and other various hair products. If you are one of the thousands of girls without access to clean, running water, do the best you can to keep clean by washing with water that you've boiled and then allowed to cool to a suitable temperature.


Try to stick to a consistent schedule, such as showering immediately after you wake up, or right after suppertime. This will make it easier to remember. You can bathe or strip wash too. Don't believe old wives tales about not showering or washing your hair while you've got your period. It's okay to wash, shower or bathe as much as you can.
During finals week, if this is applicable to you, or other eventful times, you may want to skip showering. If you do so, don't skip more than one day in a row.
Shaving body hair or facial hair is optional. If you decide to shave, try saving time by shaving in the shower while you let your conditioner set.;
, Apply deodorant every morning, and after exercising. You can take a small stick of deodorant in your gym bag if you have P.E. during the day. Experiment with different types of deodorants: solid sticks, gels, sprays, etc. until you find what works best for you. Keep some at home and keep a stick in your gym bag.


Body sprays and perfumes are banned in many schools because they can trigger asthma attacks. Make sure they are allowed at your school before taking them in.
Use an antiperspirant deodorant. It will keep you from sweating as much in the first place.

, While a napkin or paper towel may be okay in an emergency, they won't do the job nearly as well as something designed specifically for that purpose, if you have access to these products.

, Moisturizers and creams can help with dryness, itchiness, and flakiness. Here are several solutions to common problems:


Chapstick and lip balm can soothe chapped lips.
Apply an oil-free sunscreen on your face to improve skin health, make makeup base sit better, and reduce wrinkles in the future. The higher the SPF, the better it works.
Cuticle oil will help dry cuticles.
Manage acne with face washing and exfoliating in the shower with a wet washcloth. If your acne is greatly bothering you, consider seeing a dermatologist for a prescription cream.

, Never go to bed without taking your makeup off. Don't use a cleanser or face wash that is particularly oily because it will make your skin greasy. Use a facial scrub and cleanser that is made specifically for your skin type. If you have visible pores, use a face wash that helps minimize your pores and softens skin. Once you've finished washing your face, gently pat your face dry, and apply facial moisturizer to help keep your face soft, moist, and radiant.

, At least after breakfast and dinner, you should brush your teeth. After lunch at school, it is good to brush your teeth, and if you have braces you must clean the brackets. A mouth of plaque is not hygienic at all.


Replace your toothbrush every one to two months.

, Clean hair is a must when it comes to good hygiene. Start by washing it two to three times a week, but don't over wash your hair, doing so can lead to your hair getting extremely dry. Keep your hair smelling nice by putting in some leave in- conditioner with a scent (not too strong a scent, this may be irritating to those with allergies). Try to go with a nice, subtle scent so that your hair smells fresh and clean.

, You don't have to style it. Brushing it is just fine. Use a brush that actually gets the knots out instead of smoothing them into the rest of your hair. If you use the proper conditioning products and brush your hair as often as needed, you'll have a beautiful, glossy head of hair.


It's a good idea to keep a hairbrush in your locker or backpack so you have one if your hair starts looking knotty or stringy.

, Clothes are important. Wash your clothes every day or at least three times a week (use a scented laundry detergent and fabric softener)! Keep your clothes smelling nice and looking neat, don't settle for a smelly and stained t-shirt. Change your underwear every single day. Either in the morning when you wake up, or at night after you take a shower. This is important in making sure you smell nice and keeping you feeling fresh.


Shirts, dresses, and underpants should be washed after one day of wearing, while pants and sweaters can go two or three days if you don't sweat in them.

, Germs collect on your hands and can make you get sick. Wash your hands every time after you use the bathroom, and before every meal. In a pinch, use hand sanitizer. If your hands become dry, you can apply lotion to them.

, Some of these may only need to be done on a semi-regular basis.


Clip your nails every week or so, to keep them from getting too long. Long nails can break more easily, and can make typing or playing instruments a pain.
Always comb out and/or brush your hair daily, either before or after showering.
Clean your ears once a week to prevent earwax buildup. This helps keep headphones and earplugs from becoming gross.
If you experience vaginal discharge, place pantyliners in your underpants to avoid stains.

, Try to avoid ""acting"" unhygienic and doing things that are considered filthy (like burping, passing gas loudly, etc) Don't act out or up because you think it'll get attention. It may be funny at first, but you'll end up regretting it. If you're joking around

, Don't go to dirty places and don't hang around the dirty parts of your town. Try staying in places that are nice and clean, don't sit in places that may smell and be dirty, as this may lead to you smelling and getting dirt (and grosser things) on you. When walking outdoors, or in a particularly dirty place, always be wary of where you are placing your foot, who knows, you might even step in animal feces or something else.

Exercise at least 30-60 minutes a day to get a healthy and toned body.,
Go shopping for some new clothes that are fitting for the summer.,
Accessorize.",How to Be a Summer Hottie," Summer Hottie makeup should be light and fun. This is not the time to apply a full mask of makeup every morning. With rising temperatures and plenty of water activities, two key words in your makeup rotation in the summer should be sweat-proof and waterproof. Start off with a light tinted moisturizer in your skin tone. Look for one with SPF to protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays that can damage your skin. Apply a light brushing of bronzer to your cheeks. For eyes, apply a light wash of color over the eyelid in a summery shade that works with your skin tone. Finish off with two coats of waterproof mascara. For lips, a clear gloss is really all that you need. For nighttime, give yourself a little something extra with some waterproof eyeliner or a darker lip color. Though, to be super-safe, because mascara does smudge, even if it's waterproof, wear whatever eyeshadow you want, but then apply two coats of clear mascara. That gives them a boost and shine. They look naturally healthy. Then apply a lip balm with sun protection. Then over it apply a little lip gloss, not too much though or it looks tacky.;
, Heat, humidity, harsh pool chemicals and salt water can wreak havoc on your hair during the summer months. Now is not the time to try to force your hair to hold a time-consuming style. Keep it natural and work with your natural hair type. Try a sea-salt spray for some beachy waves. High ponytails and braided pigtails look super cute during the summer months. Experiment and find the best styles for your hair. Give your hair a break from heat styling as much as possible. If you must use some heat on your hair, always protect it with some sort of styling product.

, Go to the beach, pool or even just your backyard and get a nice tan. Don't forget to wear sunscreen, because no one looks good with a sunburn. If you do get sunburn, rub on some aloe vera wherever it hurts. If the thought of skin cancer freaks you out but you still want to go for that bronzed look, try a moisturizer with skin darkening compounds such as Jergens Natural Glow.

, Let's face it, you've been trying to get that tanned, toned body all year, but had no time to do it. Try to get a friend to exercise with you to make it more fun!

, Who doesn't want to go out walking in their cutest clothes? Going with friends to get their opinions is a good idea too. Fill in all the basics and don't be afraid to throw in some trendy styles of the season. Black can still work for the summer but make sure you have lots of bright colors, and white too. Before going out shopping, though, check your closet for the staples of a great summer wardrobe. Depending on your personality, and what you like to wear, the basic summer wardrobe should include:


A pair of shorts
A few pairs of jeans for those chilly summer nights
Lots of cute tank tops in different colors
T-shirts in different colors
2-3 cute sundresses to be used as a cover-up on the beach or for when you want to look cute out on the town
At least one flattering swimsuit that fits well
Hoodies for when it gets chilly out
Cardigans to layer over your tanks, tees, or dresses
A coat for those rainy days
A pair of the following: flip-flops, boots, tennis shoes

, Straw, shells, hemp, and other beachy trends look hot during the summer months.

Get enough sleep.",How to Look Good (for Boys)," Going without showering and deodorant causes you to smell bad, but it also affects your appearance. Oil, sweat, and skin cells build up, particularly around your hair and armpits. This causes ugly stains on your clothes and leaves your hair looking limp. Wash your entire body and use shampoo and conditioner on your hair., Many boys think of skin care as a girl activity, but your skin also becomes dried out. To prevent your skin from feeling too rough and cracking, get in the habit of applying moisturizer at least once a day. Wash yourself in the shower with a gentle soap first and then apply a mild face wash product. Apply a small amount, about a teaspoon, and use your hands to spread it.Try to choose a moisturizer that matches your skin type. Oily-skinned people should avoid oil-based moisturizers and those with sensitive skin should avoid alcohol-based or fragrant moisturizers.
Other skin treatment products can be added, such as acne treatments.

, Everyone knows the worry that comes along with blemishes. Stress, oil, and stray hairs cause it. Make sure to gently wash your face with soap and water every day and after sweating. Keep away from any oil-based moisturizers. Seek out treatment products that have benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid on the label.Benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria while salicylic acid unclogs pores. Some products will have both.
Speak to a doctor about acne problems that can’t be controlled by hygiene and store-bought products.

, Tanning exposes your skin to harmful sun rays, which damages your skin and causes it to age and droop. Girls may go to tanning salons, but avoid following them. The burnt orange look isn’t attractive. Instead, wear sunscreen when you go out to keep your skin fresh.

, A good smile always will improve your look. Brush your teeth at least two to three times a day, particularly after meals or after consuming something acidic. Whitening strips can also be bought at the store to combat yellowed teeth.Ideally, visit your dentist for a cleaning every six months and get braces to correct misaligned teeth.

, Other people also notice your nails. Make sure you keep them clipped with no sharp edges. Clean out any leftover grime with soap, water, and a nail brush. , Now that you’re clean, choose a hairstyle that fits your face and personality. Usually, a symmetrical cut with a square hairline looks best. Browse magazines or ask a stylist for ideas. It can take some experimentation to find the one that works for you.For example, if your forehead is tall and exposed, choose a style that covers it.
Use pomade, clay, or another natural styling product to maintain your look.

, The unibrow has become the source of Internet jokes. If your eyebrows touch or are too thick, consider using a tweezer to pluck them or trim them slightly. Remove the middle part, but don’t let the eyebrows look too thin or circular. Also pluck noticeable ear and nose hair., Look to others to find out what looks good. Steer away from embellished jeans and graphic tees when you want to look your best. Rather, sparingly use bright colors. Opt for more khakis, polos, dress pants, and plain-colored shoes, especially before you develop your own style. Keep your clothing choices simple., Let go of clothing that has holes in it or is too loose or tight. Instead, find what rests well on your body. For example, your jeans and t-shirt should not be baggy. Your shirt hem should fall on your hips and your jeans should end at your ankles.A tailor may be able to refit good clothing you want to keep.

, Bad posture makes you look rounder and weaker. Practice holding your head up and your back straight. Don’t let your shoulders roll forward. Remember not to slouch when you sit as well. You’ll feel better and more confident., Processed foods require no effort to eat and are everywhere in flashy packages and fast food restaurants. These make you tired and turn your body flabby. While you don’t have to swear off pizza and soda entirely, limit your portions and substitute in lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and healthier options when possible.The exception is if you’re naturally thin. You need to intake more calories, and this can be done healthily through fish, potatoes, dairy, protein drinks, and other foods., Lifting weights is useful for building muscle, but simply staying active helps tone your body. Turn off the computer and go outside. Playing sports helps, but you can also run around the neighborhood or do yoga to slim down.


A current guideline is 30 minutes of physical activity every day., Lack of sleep is noticeable. Your skin looks older, sagging and wrinkling. You’ll develop bags under your eyes. In addition to this, lack of sleep affects your brain’s ability to function. Many people tend to eat poorly when deprived of sleep, gaining weight."

Get perfectly white teeth.,
Always wear spotlessly clean clothes.,
Dress stylishly and chic.",How to Be a Stereotypically 'Perfect' Girl1," You want to wash your face at least twice a day. Acne is genetic and sometimes can not be stopped with just regular face wash, so see a dermatologist to see what they can prescribe you with. Cerave works very well and is dermatologist recommended. Do not scrub too hard as it will leave your face red. Buy washcloths only to be used by your face and wash them and your pillowcase frequently. Everyone likes a clean face.;
, Straight hair is the normal stereotype style, but curls work great too. If you have straight hair, you should wear it in loose curls every once in a while (twice a week is good), if it's curly, straighten it occasionally! Be sure to get your hair cut about every 3 months.

, You want to brush your teeth twice a day with whitening toothpaste. Then floss. Then rinse with mouthwash.

, Make sure that when you wear something that you put it in the wash as soon as possible. That way the clothes smell better and more like the detergent you're spending a fortune on. And to help the environment use the 2x concentrate bottles. People notice if your clothes smell clean or dirty.

, Have a good sense of style. Wear a graphic t-shirt with jeans, a nice tank top with a skirt/shorts. Putting ribbons in your hair either as a headband or as a bow when your hair is in a ponytail is a very cute way to top off every hairstyle. Designer Sunglasses are super cute, but if you can't afford it then knock-offs or just regular sunglasses are cute. Big purses are 'in' right now and so are designer purses, but designer are always expensive so look on eBay or just look around and you can find ones that look similar at a low price.

Familiarize yourself with the benefits of using tampons, as well as how to choose the best type, how to insert them, and how to remove them so you can prove to your mother that you're ready to use them.If you’re not sure how to find information about tampons, start with the internet. Use your favorite search engine to search for terms such as “using tampons” and “tampon benefits.""
Your school nurse may also be able to provide pamphlets with information about tampons.;
, While tampons are usually completely safe, there are possible risks if you don't use them properly. If you don't change your tampons often enough, you can develop toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is a serious condition.You can also develop TSS if you use tampons that are too absorbent, so it's important to use the right ones. Browse the tampon aisle at your local drug store to check out the absorbencies of the products that are available to see what would work best for you.
Make sure that you know the symptoms of TSS, such as high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle pain, rash, and vaginal discharge, so you know what to be on the look out for.

, If you have friends who use tampons, talk to them about how they asked their moms to purchase the tampons for the first time. They may be able to provide some good tips on how to initiate the conversation and persuade your mother to agree.For example, you might say to your friend, ""I know you got your mom to buy you tampons. How did you ask her?""
If you have an older sibling who uses tampons, they may be able to provide firsthand advice on the best way to approach your mother.

, If you’re really nervous about talking to your mother about tampons, it may help to get feedback from another adult. Talk to another adult who you trust, such as an aunt, grandmother, or friend of your mother’s, and see if they have any advice on the best way to approach her.If you’re close with a friend’s mother who’s already agreed to let her child tampons, you might ask her for advice. She can speak to you as a mother herself and explain possible concerns that your mom might have.
If you’re close with your dad, you may even want to talk to him first. In many cases, though, that can be an even more uncomfortable conversation than with your mom so be sure that you’re comfortable enough with your father to talk about your period.

, Having a face to face conversation with your mom is the most direct way to ask her to buy you tampons. However, if you’re feeling awkward or uncomfortable, you may prefer writing to your mom so you have time to gather your thoughts and make a compelling case without getting flustered.Consider sending a text or email to your mother about the tampons.
You can also write a letter or note to make your case.
If you’re feeling particularly nervous about talking to your mother, you may ask someone else to broach the subject with her first. You can ask a sibling, aunt, grandmother, or family friend to approach your mom.

, If you decide that you are going to have a conversation with your mother, it’s a good idea to come with a “script” so you know exactly what you will say. It can even help to write down some notes so you know that you're covering the most important points.Be honest with your mother. You may want to start the conversation by saying, “I have something important to talk to you about but I’m a little embarrassed.”
When you’re planning what to say, it’s best to start your sentences with “I feel” so your mother doesn’t get defensive. For example, you might say, “I feel that using tampons is best for me because I'm so active in sports.”
Make sure to include a line or two in your “script” that shows you know how to use tampons. For example, you might say, “I know I have to remember to change the tampon every four to eight hours.” That will prove to your mother that you’ve done your research.

, Once you know what you want to say to your mom, it's a good idea practice in front of a mirror. If possible, you may also want to practice in front of someone else so you're comfortable stating your case in front of another person.If you have another trusted adult in your life, you might ask them if you can practice in front of them.They can provide feedback so you know if what you plan to say is persuasive or needs work.

, Whenever you’re asking your mother for something, timing is key. You want to talk to her when she’s in a good mood so she is more receptive to what you’re asking. That’s why it’s best not to start the conversation right after she’s gotten home for a long day at work or in the middle of preparing dinner.If you want to be sure that your mother is open to having conversation, you may want to set a time to talk. For example, you might say, “Mom, I want to talk to you about something. Can we do it this afternoon after soccer practice?”
You may want to ask your mom to go for a walk or a drive, so you have some quiet time to be alone and you’ll know that you have her undivided attention.
If you really want your mom’s in the best mood before you ask, consider taking her out for coffee, frozen yogurt, or some other treat that you can share.

, Pad can sometimes feel bulky and heavy, so tampons are often a more comfortable alternative. That's especially true if you're involved in activities where you move around a lot, such as sports, dance, or cheerleading. In particular, tampons are usually the best option if you’re a swimmer because you can still swim when you’re wearing one.For example, you might tell your mother, ""I hate the way pads feel when I'm playing soccer. I feel that a tampon would be comfortable when I'm running around.""

, Because tampons are smaller than pads, it's often easier to carry them with you. Tell your mom that you won't have to worry about fitting them in your bookbag, gym bag, or locker so you'll never be without protection if you unexpectedly get your period.For example, you might say, ""I can easily fit a couple of tampons in the inside pocket of my backpack where pads won't fit.""

, Because pads are larger and more bulky, they can sometimes show through your pants, skirt, or shorts. Explain to your mom that you'll feel more confident with tampons because they're not visible at all.For example, you might tell her, ""I always feel nervous about people seeing my pad when I'm wearing skinny jeans. I wouldn't have to worry about that with tampons.""

, After you’ve explained to your mother why you want her to buy you tampons, be ready to listen to her response. She may have concerns about you using tampons, and even if you don’t agree with them, be respectful and consider her point of view.If your mother is concerned about the possibility of TSS, remind her that the condition is fairly rare. Reassure her that you’ll change your tampon every four to eight hours as necessary, and you know what symptoms to look out for.
If your mom is concerned that using tampons will affect your virginity, you can tell her that’s a myth. The only way to lose your virginity is to have sex.
If you haven’t had sex yet, your mom may think that you can’t use tampons, but that’s another myth. You may prefer to use “slender” tampons, though, because they’re easier to insert., Don’t demand an answer from your mother about the tampons right away. Tell her that you’d like her to take some time to think about it. If you pressure her for an immediate answer, chances are she’s just going to say no.To make sure that she doesn’t forget to give you an answer, set a time for you two to talk again. For example, you might say, “Take some time to think about this. Can we talk again tomorrow night?”

, Your mother may agree to buy your tampons with certain conditions. If it’s important to you to use tampons, you should have an open mind. Following her conditions may open the door to you being able to use tampons freely.For example, your mother may tell you that she’ll buy you tampons but you can only use them on days when you’re participating in sports or other physical activities. That may not be exactly what you want, but it’s a step in the right direction.
Your mom might agree to buy tampons for you to use, but request that you talk to a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional to ensure that you know how to insert them properly.

, Whatever your mother decides regarding the tampons, it’s important to accept the decision maturely. If she says no, you will definitely be disappointed, but throwing a tantrum over it will only make her less likely to change her mind in the future.If your mom tells you that she won’t buy you tampons, tell her that you respect her decision but hope she will reconsider in the future. For example, you might say, “I respect that you feel this way right now, but will you please continue to think about it?”

, If your mom does say no, you’ll probably want to ask her to buy you tampons again the next day -- resist the urge. Your mom is going to get annoyed if you keep asking her every day. Give her a couple of months to get used to the idea before asking again.If your mom says no, you might ask her right then when you can talk about using tampons again. If you agree on two months, be patient and wait the full two months before bringing up the topic again.

Talk to a plastic surgeon.",How to Grow Facial Hair Fast," Oil, dirt, and dead skin can create an impossibly thick barricade for your hair follicles to break through. You can grow facial hair much faster if your face is consistently kept clean.


Wash your face with warm water and a gentle facial cleanser once in the morning and once in the evening. A gentle cleanser is recommended over standard soap, since standard soap can be too abrasive for the skin on your face and may cause irritation.
You should also wash your face any time of the day that it gets notably dirty with sweat or oil.
If an itchy rash develops as your facial hair grows in, try using a dandruff shampoo two to three times weekly to relieve the irritation.Switch to an exfoliating facial cleanser once a week to strip away dead skin cells.
After washing your face, use a moisturizing facial lotion to keep the skin hydrated and to prevent dead skin cells from gathering and clogging up your follicles.;
, As such, one of the best things to do in order to keep your facial hair grow faster is simply to let it grow without disruption.


Hair growth increases faster immediately after you shave, but it decreases hair growth shortly thereafter. As such, any increase in hair growth that does result from shaving gets canceled out.
Note that your facial hair can get a bit unsightly as it initially grows out, so it is recommended that you start at a time during which you do not need to appear at work or any formal social events.

, While this may seem a little unconventional, a light massage over your face can encourage the hair follicles there to grow in faster and thicker.


Apply gently yet even pressure along the areas of your face over which you want to stimulate hair growth. Rub in small circular motions, and massage your face consistently for about 10 to 15 minutes twice daily.

, Simply put, stress thins out your hair, making it difficult to grow a beard, mustache, or goatee. Reducing stress as much as possible can greatly increase the rate at which your facial hair grows.Both mental and physical stress can cripple your immune system, thereby limiting your ability to grow facial hair.
Stress can be nearly impossible to eliminate completely, but you can take small steps to limit the amount of stress in your life. Try meditation or exercise as a means of releasing anxiety or talk to others about effective ways of reducing stress.

, Proper rest is a key element in maintaining all of your body's functions, including hair growth.


Sleep is a period of time during which your body regenerates lost cells, and hair growth tends to increase during periods of sleep. If you sleep for less than six hours each night, growing facial hair quickly is all but impossible. For best results, sleep for at least eight hours nightly.

, As with sleep, regular exercise is also a key element of maintaining bodily functions, including hair growth. Focus on aerobic exercise, which improves blood circulation.


Good blood circulation helps you to maintain a high metabolic rate. In other words, all of the nutrients you take in that can help stimulate hair growth will reach the hair follicles in your face much faster if you have the sort of good circulation promoted by aerobic exercise.
Even mild to moderate aerobic exercise is better than nothing. Take a brisk 30-minute walk each day after work, or better yet, go for a jog.

, Smoking weakens the body's immune system, and with a weakened immune system, your body may not be able to grow hair as effectively as it could.


Nicotine reduces your body's ability to absorb nutrients. As a result, the nutrients needed for hair growth cannot reach your hair follicles well enough to work.
Moreover, nicotine also constricts blood vessels, which prevents your blood from going where it needs to go.

,


The hair itself is built partially of protein, and healthy hair is coated in oils and fats. As a result, a healthy, fast-growing beard or mustache needs both protein and fat. Additionally, protein and fat can increase testosterone, another key player in growing facial hair.
Beans and fish are healthy sources of protein, and eating more of these foods can stimulate faster, bushier hair growth.
Eggs and animal fat can be effective, as well, but limit your overall intake of these fats since they can cause circulatory problems if consumed in excess.

, Sugar, on the other hand, can actually make hair weaker. Eating too many foods high in sugar can make it harder to grow facial hair.


Natural sugars found in fruits and dairy are less harmful than those found in candy, baked goods, and soda. ok

, Vitamin B7, also called biotin, is one of the most important vitamins to have when trying to grow facial hair. Vitamins B5, B3, and B9 are also very important, though.


Biotin is found in nuts and egg yolk. You must ingest the biotin for it to be effective, though. Applying it topically will not help. If you cannot get biotin naturally, take a biotin supplement daily.
Vitamins B5 and B3 improve your circulation and can be found in chicken, beef, fish, egg yolk, avocado, milk, and many whole grains.
Vitamin B9, or folic acid, directly impacts your ability to grow thicker hair and can be found in cereals, nuts, and leafy green vegetables.

,


Vitamin A helps maintain your follicles and sebum, and it can be found in carrots, broccoli, and leafy green vegetables.
Vitamin C improves your immune system and can be found in potatoes, citrus fruits, green peppers, tomatoes, and dark leafy green vegetables.
Vitamin E improve circulation and can be found in beans, nuts, and leafy vegetables.

, In order to stay in your peak bodily condition, you need to be fully hydrated at all times. Only in your peak condition can your facial hair grow as fast as possible.


As a general rule, drink roughly eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses each day.

, Eucalyptus is thought to help stimulate hair growth, but you should never apply eucalyptus oil directly to the skin. Instead, dilute it with water or use facial skin care products containing the plant as an ingredient.Dilute eucalyptus oil by combining four parts water with one part eucalyptus. Apply directly to the skin with a cotton ball and let sit. Note, however, that if your skin becomes irritated, you should wash the treatment off and avoid it in the future.
Facial cleansers and moisturizers with eucalyptus are more highly recommended than oil.

, Amla oil is thought to be one of the most helpful natural oils you can use to coat the follicles in your face.


Mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) Amla oil with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) mustard leaves, blending until a paste forms. Apply this paste to your face and let it sit for 20 minutes before washing it off.Any remaining paste can be saved in the refrigerator for two to three days.
In addition to Amla oil, other oils that help with facial hair growth include jojoba and grape seed oil. These oils can be applied directly to the skin without mixing them with mustard leaves.

, These ingredients can be combined into a thin paste that should be applied to your face twice daily to help stimulate facial hair growth faster.


Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) ground cinnamon with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) vitamin-C-rich lime juice. Apply this to your face and rinse off after 25 to 30 minutes.
Stop immediately if irritation occurs.

, This topical hair growth drug is traditionally used to stimulate hair growth on the top of your head, but some preliminary findings suggest that it may help stimulate facial hair growth, as well.


Purchase a bottle of minoxidil. Hold the can upside-down and press the nozzle to squeeze out some of the foam onto your fingers. Gently massage this foam into your face, concentrating on areas in need of speedy hair growth.You should usually only apply 1/2 capful of foam or 1 mL of solution two times daily. Read the instructions on the label to avoid accidental overdose.
Consult your doctor before trying to use minoxidil to stimulate facial hair growth.

, This is an oral drug traditionally used to stimulate hair growth on the top of you head, but as with minoxidil, some findings indicate that it may help facial hair, too.


This drug can increase your testosterone by 10 to 20 percent, resulting in increased body and facial hair.This medication is only available by prescription. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid accidental overdose.
Usually, the medication will be taken in tablet form once daily. You should take it around the same time each day., Men who really have a hard time growing facial hair may lack the testosterone needed to do so. Careful testosterone therapy can help remedy this problem.


Therapy is usually performed through injections or topical applications. There are oral treatments, as well, but these can cause liver damage and are not recommended.
Your doctor needs to monitor testosterone therapy carefully. Too much of this hormone can actually further inhibit your hair growth.
Note that this may not be a “fast” solution, since testosterone therapy can take up to a full year to really kick in.

, If you are desperate enough and no simpler solution has worked, a plastic surgeon might be able to transplant some fast-growing hair follicles from other parts of your body to your face.


The treatment is simple and usually performed on an outpatient basis. You may experience minor skin irritation, but that is usually the worst of it.
As with testosterone therapy, however, this is not the quickest solution possible. You may need to wait up to two full years before adequate facial hair growth is achieved.

Barbie takes care of her body.,
Having a cell phone is a must.",How to Be a Barbie Doll Teenager1," It's what Barbie would do. Barbie is kind, brave, confident, selfless, and polite. Don't curse, smoke, drink (alcohol), or spit. Don't correct people all the time or yell -- be patient. But this don't not mean you have to be a doormat. If you see an injustice make sure everyone knows how wrong it is and defend what or whoever is the victim of the injustice.;
, Be nice and considerate to others. If you feel yourself getting angry, take deep breaths (not in a theatrical obvious way) and count to five. This will hopefully stop you from saying something rude to someone! You can even try meditation for a great natural stress reliever.

, Get good grades if you are not already. If you aren't doing well at school, talk to some teachers and the guidance counselors to see what can be done. If you work, then try to do your best at your job, even if it is something as seemingly-insignificant as flipping burgers. Come in with a smile every day, whether you go to work or school.

, You definitely don't need to (and shouldn't be) cracking jokes every second, especially at others' expense. Someone's feelings are not worth a cheap laugh. But it is important to have a sense of humor. Practice telling a few funny jokes if you want, but it is easier just to make up a few witty retorts on the spot in the course of conversation. And like Reader's Digest says, 'never start a joke with 'this is the funniest joke ever'. It sets the bar too high.'

, Just because you want to be like Barbie in some ways doesn't mean that you have to be stupid. Barbie isn't stupid. Continue to read books and study, as well as stay away of your surroundings. Be careful-- some people might take you for a ditz. It's up to you to prove them wrong!

, You are beautiful! Be kind, sweet, and lady-like to other people (especially adults and teachers).

, Do not have a ""school is stupid"" attitude. Barbie is a smart cookie as she has been featured as a surgeon (1973), an Astronaut (1965, 1985, and 1994), and even the US President (2000)! Talk about girl power! Challenge yourself and take A.P. courses, if you can. If you are still in middle school, try to sign up for Gifted, Pre-AP, Honors, or I.B. classes. Try to get some high school credits.

, Barbie is physically fit! When it comes to sports, play glamorous ones, like swim team, synchronized swimming, lacrosse, volleyball, track, cheerleading, etc. Ice hockey, football, softball, soccer, field hockey, and even basketball are out of the question! Beach volleyball is great for summer! Don't do any sports that are mainly associated with boys. There are boy and girl teams for all of these sports, but the latter section is less feminine. But if you want to play a sport that is less feminine or less popular, still go for it! Be who you want to be!

, Barbie always has something in her movies and doll lines that she is especially good at: ice skating (Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus) or science (Barbie Princess and the Pauper; Analiese) but you don't have to be an ice-skater or a scientist; whatever you're good at and enjoy doing-- maybe art or writing, riding horses, or soccer. Take your hobby to the next level by entering an art show, trying to publish a book, going into a horse show, or trying out for travel team! Your friends don't necessarily have to be into the same thing as you, either, but you should share your interests with them if you think they would like them.

, Volunteer at your school's charity events, or the Soup Kitchen. Try to go to Beach Cleanups and volunteer at the local library. Donate canned food for the food drive and clothes and toys for the needy. Make a donation to Good Will every 6 months or less. Just generally be a helpful and giving person in your community.

, Barbie has tons and tons of friends! Be kind to everyone and gain many friends. Having a Facebook account is mandatory, but Myspace, Twitter, or AIMS are great, too. If you can't have a social networking account (parents won't allow, too young, etc.), use your phone and e-mail to your advantage. Give your email and number to all of your friends, far and close, but don't spend too much time on the phone, and remember who your real friends are.

, You are only a teen once, enjoy it! Date, have fun, shop, and flirt! Have the time of your life, but don't get a bad reputation.

, She has an amazing body. Take care of your body by being active and eating right. It's not what you look like that matters, it's what is on the inside. You don't have too have a figure like Barbie's; hers is impossible to attain and a human would look silly with that physique!

, If all you can afford at the moment is a cheap phone, go with that for awhile until you save up for a nicer phone, like an LG Touch, iPhone, Blackberry, Pantech, Sidekick, Android, or really any type of phone made for texting. Smart phones are the best. Unlimited texting is preferable for talking to friends and boys! If you have a cheap phone, decorate it with nail polish and sequins and glitter! Personalize it!

Remember you can change your look but it's not always good to change your personality if you want to fit in, so, with that being said, be yourself.",How to Be a Beautiful Teenager," Brush your teeth, use mouthwash, and floss daily - twice a day. Also, try chewing sugar-free gum after meals. You don't want to smile at your crush (or anyone else) with some cabbage in your teeth. Have a packet of mint gum nearby to chew when your breath isn't great! Get braces if you have to, and don't be ashamed to wear them - you'll be the one smiling in the future with lovely teeth when your braces come off!;
, Deodorant is probably a healthier choice than antiperspirant since there is no aluminium in deodorant, but antiperspirant works better and is easier to find. A bit of perfume is great as long as it isn't strong and it gives off a nice scent. For perfume, try some celebrity scents that aren't cheap (for example, you could try Justin Bieber's Girlfriend perfume or Taylor Swift's Wonderstruck perfume) or you could try something from a beauty shop (for example Bath & Body Works or The Body Shop). These types of shops are also great for finding deodorant without aluminum in it.

, It might not seem like it matters much, but being in shape and being healthy makes a huge difference. It's not as hard as it seems. Make sure you eat healthy foods, and stay away from fatty/sugary foods, eat lots of veggies and fruits, and exercise at least 30-60 minutes a day. After doing a good cardio workout, like running, for 30 minutes you raise your heart rate which puts your body in ""fat burning mode"". Try to burn more calories than you eat a day, and make sure you never skip a meal. It makes your body take muscle tissue into your metabolism and makes you store fat, making your metabolism run slowly resulting in weight gain. Also, after a cardio workout (dancing, running, kickboxing etc), try a mild strengthening workout, like yoga or pilates, but not something intense like weightlifting.

, Use shampoo and conditioner at least 2-3 times a week. On the days you can, let your hair get greasy. This sounds gross but the natural oils are really good for your hair. However, when your hair is greasy, pull it back into a ponytail and/or wear a hat or large headband/hairband so that your hair looks a little bit nicer.

, It's a good idea, if you're doing any facial hair removal, to go get it professionally done. For best results with shaving, exfoliate your legs first, towel dry, then cover legs in shaving foam (lots of it!) and shave. Be careful not to get into the habit of over-shaving (shaving every day, for instance) as it will just make the hair grow back thicker and it'll end up being a huge hassle. Plus, you'll probably accidentally cut yourself while over-shaving.

, You don't have to go to a salon. Just get a nail file and/or nail clippers or manicure scissors. You can shape your nails with a file or clip off uneven parts with the clippers or manicure scissors. If you want a natural look, apply clear nail strengthener to them or a neutral colour like beige, light brown, or pale pink. If you want a funky look, then go for any colour you want, just make sure to fix them if they chip at all. Chipped paint looks terrible. If you want to, try some nail art.

, Stop biting your nails, picking at skin blemishes.

, Seriously! It makes you a lot prettier and approachable. Just make sure your teeth are clean!

, Don't plaster it on, and use neutral colours. Use bold mascara to make your eyes seem bigger. Lip balms and glosses are cute, or use lipstick to achieve a bolder look. If you don't want lip stuff on your lips, you can moisturize with lip chap. Acne is very common with teens, you can cover it up with concealer and foundation. Fit Me or Cover girl works great, and is super cheap! Maybe buy a good, gentle face wash to help clear it up.

, Don't wear really tight clothes if you're a little bigger, and not wear really baggy clothes that fall off either. Make sure your clothes are clean and tidy. If they have stains or holes (unless they are those famous ""ripped jeans"") just throw them out. Don't wear the same outfit two days in a row and make sure all of your clothes are clean and wrinkle-less.

, Yep, that's a bit clichéd, but it's the truth! Being yourself will make you look even more beautiful.

Remember, confidence is the key and when your confident it will make you feel more beautiful than what you already are!"

Keep natural hair.,
Oil your hair using natural sprays, creams, and moisturiser.,
Air dry and use a thick wide comb when damp, rather than using a hot hair dryer comb.,
If you have a weave, wrap your hair when you sleep, though this is a basic.,
Leave space between each weave, about as much space between each weave as you last kept it in.,
Think long and hard before using chemicals.,
Make sure you follow instructions on a perm before you have one, always.,

Be fashionable, but don't ruin your hair and complexion to do so.,
Using a hot comb can straighten black people's hair, but like the hair dryer extension, can damage it just as much, or even more if it's very dry.

,
Don't drastically change the way you look.,
Do not ever try 'acting like a black girl or white girl' to fit in.,
Remember, not everyone who's not black is racist either.",How to Be a Beautiful Black Teenage Girl," It emphasizes the uniqueness of being black, as no other race has it. It takes a lot of work to keep wild hair happy at first, but once you've done the first things it should be easy.;
, When washing, it's best to use two layers of conditioner that is designed for black hair, as it is manufactured to lock in moisture more than products aimed at other hair types. Don't use hair grease, though, as the chemicals in it aren't good for hair shine and can thin the hair.


Oiling your hair is especially important as the kinks in black people hair make the natural moisture stay at your roots, which is why black people's hair is always dry. Shampoos for straighter hair are designed to get rid of the natural greases, which black hair needs to grow. Using the wrong shampoos and not enough moisturizers is the main reason why black hair cuts/breaks off. Castor Oil, Black Castor Oil or Coconut Oil is a good product to keep on hand. Coconut Oil is good for your skin as well.

, Using the hair dryer extension is okay if your hair has been moisturised properly for a while, though using hair oils afterwards is essential.

,


Weaves should be taken out from 1-2 months, depending on how messy it gets, how tight it is and what type of weave you have.

, This will help prevent hair loss and a chipping hairline. It also stops thinning hair and some bold patches. However, remember; full hair loss is very rare with weaves. It only tends to happen to people with dryer and shorter hair or people with much shorter hairline hair than their central hair.

, Perms/relaxers are quite extreme. If you don't have one and are thinking of getting one, watch a documentary such as Good Hair, which explains the chemicals and side-effects of perms.


On the positive side, perms don't require as much combing attention as natural hair and can be styled into styles that white people tend to have. As having a perm/relaxer can cut about half of your hair length off at a time, some people use black hair extensions to attach to the hair, though the glue can cut it further.

, Have a specialist do your hair as they have done it many times before. Perms can burn. A lot.

, Look around a market or in areas where the majority of the area is black. Makeup designed for darker skin can often be found in areas where hair products for African Americans can be found, so it shouldn't be too hard to find if you know where to look.

, For blush, if you are daring, try a dark purple. This doesn't look good on everyone, but if your skin is dark enough you can pull it off.

, It can sometimes turn out wrong, and it's also very hard to get off then.

, It's like when white people put on too much fake tan. You look orange, and your eyes will just look dark so you'd look like a panda.


Buying darker foundation can be okay when they match your darker areas.

, The stereotype is that black people love cocoa butter. So long as you're not allergic to them, coconuts are not only great for black hair, but also black skin. They are full of nutrients and cocoa butter even lightens/darkens your scars to make them less visible.


Cocoa butter is very good for moisturizing skin and it helps keep dry patches looking less dry. Also, the moisture can last even after a bath (though it's best to apply at least once a day, preferably in the morning).
Other great moisturizers are Shea butter and Aloe butter. When choosing products, look for ones with few chemicals and not a lot of fragrance. Remember: the further down the ingredient list, the less it contains.

, Hair dye can damage black hair, and most of the time won't make a difference or only dye thinner parts of the hair.

,, Giving in to try to look 'white' is one of the last things a black girl should even be thinking. Black is beautiful, you are beautiful. Embrace this. If people tell you your hair looks nasty because it's curly or says something about your weave, ignore it, violence is never the right answer, don't let them get to you.


When people say racist things regarding your skin color right to your face, it can be annoying. If these people are your 'friends' tell them that what they said was not right and provide a bit of evidence of why it was if wanted. If they do it again, it's highly suggested you ditch them.

, Act how you know you should act with dignity and respect. Saying 'yo' in sentences and enjoying reggae or rap music isn't what all black females prefer to do. Act the way you feel comfortable acting even if it is portrayed as ghetto or white.

, There are people of color out there who don't care about whether their friends are a different shade to them or not. Look for those kinds of people rather than hanging with people who degrade you for being black who more often than not are white.

Flawless tresses are crucial when it comes to being like Barbie!,
If your hair is currently a dull, boring color, jazz it up!,

Of course, you don't have to be a blonde. If you take care of your hair it won't matter what color it is. Barbie is also known for her long, flowing hair. If you, like most people, don't have that, then try some clip-in or weave-in extensions! They're fast and easy, and most of the time are pretty affordable and look great!


If you want to bleach your hair blonde, make sure you have it done professionally! Have your roots redone frequently if your hair is a darker color, since sometimes showing roots look trashy.
If you have roots and can't get rid of them try wears headbands and scarves and hats, wear your hair o cover your scalp, or make some highlights with lemon juice.

, Highlight your hair a lighter shade, so it really sparkles or change hair care products. Vinegar in hair makes it softer and shinier. If you want one or two stress of color, that's pretty. Remember to style your hair in a way that compliments and please you!

Dress classy and presentable(not trashy!,
Barbie wears a lot of pink.,
If you wear a school uniform, try to sass it up by unbuttoning the first few buttons, and layering shirts underneath.,
When going to the beach, wear a cute bikini!,
Know your occasions.,
Shoes, shoes, and more shoes!,
Have at least five pairs of shoes, for different events.",How to Be a Barbie Doll Teenager3,")Don't wear skimpy tube tops, booty shorts,etc. If you can't afford to buy expensive clothes, go to Marshall's, TK Maxx, Ross, or Target. No one will ever know the difference between a shirt from Macy's and a shirt from Target, if the Target shirt is well taken care of. Remember, you should let your face give the impression, not the rest of your body. There's not need to follow particular trends; whatever looks good on you and you like is what you should wear.

, You don't need to wear so much pink, but do pick one color to be your 'main' color, something you like and that looks good on you. Of course, you don't have to wear this color all the time.

, Also, try to roll up your skirt, but just a little bit, let's you get caught. If you are allowed to wear heels, wear them! If you have to wear panty hose, put on some sheer black or nude ones. Wear a skirt when possible, and buy your uniform shirts a few seizes too small-- most of them are made to look big on you! Just remember don't be trashy.

, If you are wearing a one-piece, make it a cute one with a dip back. Wear a headband and a side ponytail along with big glasses if you don't plan on swimming, but if you do, opt for a back ponytail and leave out a little hair. Try a sarong that is short or a tennis style cover-up. Don't just spend all of your time tanning if you want to swim--just don't wear any makeup!

, Sporting events have very casual outfits, so be sure to wear something pretty, but easy to move in. 'Formal occasion' on an invitation may need an evening gown, or it might just mean 'no jeans'. Make sure you know how other invitees are dressing and read through an entire invitation

, As a Barbie Girl, you need to have lots and lots of shoes. For school shoes, during the winter, UGGs. If you can't afford UGGs, shoot for Emus or Bearpaw Boots. You can even do cowboy boots! For P.E. class, keep a pair of nice sneakers in your locker-- the more comfortable the better.


When wearing sneakers, wear low-cut ankle socks. For fun and if allowed, get them in bright colors, mismatch them, or add a fun print.

, Obviously more are encouraged. Keep on shopping! Take care of your shoes and polish them every so often-- white shoe polish for white shoes, black shoe polish for black shoes.

Have fun!",How to Be a Barbie Doll Teenager4," For starters, take a shower every morning, not necessarily washing your hair unless it is very oily.

, Use it in the morning and evening and after exercise. Don't be afraid to splurge on the good quality; you'll be thankful.

, Wax or thread your eyebrows every month or so, but if your eyebrows are dark, do it every two weeks. Do not pluck, unless there are stray hairs. If you do pluck, do it every 3 days. If you have an unsteady hand, live on a houseboat, or are just not sure what to do with your eyebrows, visit a salon.

, If you can't afford that, do it yourself! Great colors are blues and greens, reds and pinks, purples, and black. Even yellow or white is trendy! Keep toenails short. Although pink and French manicures are best, any color will do as long as you like it. Fake nails are fake looking and trashy.

, In the evening, use a cleanser, scrub, toner, wrinkle cream and moisturizer or acne cream. If you are 12 and under, don't use a toner. Use eye cream and anti-wrinkle/aging products at a very young age, like 12 or 13. It is good to start young and in the long run, it will prevent wrinkles.

, You can even use Clean and Clear, Biore, or Clearasil. Do olive oil face scrubs but don't go bed with too much oil in your face!

, Have Altoids mints on hand at all times! Go to your dentist appointments regularly.

, If your parents or older siblings smoke and you smell like smoke, cover it up with perfume. Use a sweet scent like vanilla, citrus, lavender, or pumpkin, but any nice scent is good. Continue using the same scent so that people may begin to associate you with it.

,, It looks trashy and garish.

, Mascara, if you need it to pick up your eyes, is great, but a pale grey or tan eyeliner is optional.

, Barbie is a fun-loving gal. Hang out with friends, listen to music, go shopping, go on social networking sites and be a good student. Respect your guardians, too. They often know what's best for you. Listen to them.

Wear the right shirt.,
Wear the right suit.,
Wear the right accessories.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Groom correctly.",How to Dress Semi‐Formal As a Guy1," For semi-formal attire, you'll need to wear a button-down shirt. The most classic and dependable look will be the white button-down shirt, but you can have a little more fun with semi-formal attire and pick a shirt with a subtle pattern or stripes if you're attending a daytime semi-formal event.It's important to clean and iron your shirt before you wear it. No matter how nice the shirt is, you won't look right if it looks worn and wrinkly.
If the shirt has a subtle pattern, make sure it matches the suit and tie you're wearing. This doesn't mean it has to be the exact same color as the suit and tie, but that the colors should be in the same color family.
Having a patterned shirt can also help you add a personalized look to what may feel like a formulaic outfit.;
, You still have to wear a suit to a semi-formal event -- just remember to avoid the tuxedo. For daytime events, wear a light suit that is usually cream or tan, a stroller or a director's coat, or a jacket in black or dark gray wool. For nighttime events, wear a dark charcoal or a midnight blue suit. Make sure the suit slacks fit your form and aren't too loose, too tight, or wrinkled.For a more formal semi-formal event, you can wear a tuxedo-jacket, or black trousers with a satin seam.
You can also consider wearing a cummerbund.
A vest that matches your suit can also go nicely with your semi-formal attire.
A variety of suit fabrics work for a semi-formal suit. You can wear a suit that is made of wool, gabardine, cashmere, or a wool blend.
A blazer can also be acceptable for a daytime outdoor event.

, You can wear a simple tie that matches your suit for a semi-formal event. The tie should be light for a light-colored suit and dark for a dark-colored suit. You can have some fun and pick a tie with stripes or a fun pattern, as long as it isn't too silly. You should wear a simple black belt with your pants, one that isn't too thick.


You can also add some flair to your outfit by wearing a red pocket pocket handkerchief or a white silk scarf.
If you're accompanying a date to an event, you can add a nice touch by wearing matching accessories. For example, if she's wearing long gold earrings, you can wear a gold tie or put a gold silk handkerchief in your pocket.
Cufflinks can also be a nice addition to your look.

, For semi-formal attire, wear lace-up shoes, dressy loafers, or Oxfords. For night-time events, you can wear shined leather shoes. Pair your shoes with dark dress socks. If a light sock peeks out from your outfit, the effect can be ruined.You should generally stick to wearing black shoes, but dark brown shoes can also be acceptable if you're wearing a dark brown suit.
It should go without saying, but you should never, ever, wear dress shoes without socks.

, Remember to take a nice long shower, style your hair, and shave your face before attending a semi-formal event. If your hair is getting long, make sure you cut it before you attend the event, or you will look disheveled. Take time with your appearance before you leave the house.


Make sure your shoes are clean, your shirt is tucked in, and your collar is fixed appropriately.
Some light cologne can also help add elegance to your look.

Double check whether the host is using a very strict interpretation of ""semi-formal."",
Know what to wear for a strict interpretation.,
Pay attention to your details for a strict semi-formal look.",How to Dress Semi‐Formal As a Guy2," In strict, traditional terms, a semi-formal dress code requires men to wear black tie (that is, a tuxedo, or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom). The term ""semi-formal"" arose to distinguish black tie from white tie, which is worn only to the most formal of events. However, it is worth bearing in mind that many people are unaware of the distinctions between ""formal"", ""semi-formal"" or ""casual"" dress codes, and interpret them in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to find out what is meant by a particular dress code before choosing what to wear.

, Traditional semi-formal attire consists of a dress shirt, tuxedo (or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom), a black tie or bowtie, and black shoes. The dress shirt will typically have a winged, detachable collar (though standard collars are becoming more prevalent), and studs will be used instead of buttons. The black shoes can be plain oxfords or, more traditionally, opera pumps.

, Ensure that the cloth of your bowtie, cummerbund and jacket collar match. Wear a well-pressed shirt, wear black socks and never wear black tie during the day.

Do not overdress.,
Do not underdress.,
Remember that it's better to overdress than underdress.,
If you're really confused, ask the host.,
Make sure your actions match your look.",How to Dress Semi‐Formal As a Guy3," Overdressing at a semi-formal event can make you stand out like a sore thumb. The main thing you should avoid is wearing a tuxedo -- a semi-formal event does not call for it. If you're going to a daytime event, remember to wear a suit that is a lighter color, such as beige. If you wear a dark color, like midnight blue, you'll look overdressed.


One way to avoid overdressing is to check in on what your friends or date are wearing. This will help you see what is appropriate. Don't just ask one other guy who is equally clueless; ask a variety of people.

, Remember that the word ""semi-formal"" still includes the word ""formal."" Therefore, you should avoid a variety of more casual items of clothing, such as khakis, jeans, shorts, or linen or seersucker suits. You should also avoid only wearing a polo shirt without a suit jacket.


Though people still debate over whether or not a tie is required at a semi-formal event, you should wear one, at least to a night event, to avoid looking too casual.
Sport coats are also considered too casual for semi-formal attire.

, This is a golden rule. If you're in doubt and deciding between two articles of clothing, one that you're worried is slightly casual, and one that you're worried is overly formal, err on the side of formal. It's better to show up dressed better than everyone than looking like you missed the ""dress up"" memo.


And remember that if you show up overdressed, there are little things you can do to make your look more casual, from taking off your tie to removing your pocket handkerchief.

, If you've asked a few people who are attending the event and all of them are flummoxed, you can go ahead and ask the host about the dress code, if he's someone you know fairly well. The host may have a slightly nuanced vision of ""semi-formal"" so it could help to have his input. Don't be shy -- it's likely that other people have the same question.


If the host helps you figure out what to wear, you can already be on the way to making yourself the life of the party by giving other equally-clueless guests advice before the big day.

, If you're dressed in semi-formal attire, it's time to step it up in the classiness department in your actions as well. Try to avoid the things you normally do in casual clothes -- burping, cursing, loudly talking on your cell phone -- and try to match the actions of the people in your environment. If everyone is throwing down at a big party or laughing at inappropriate jokes loudly, then that can give you the green light to relax a bit, but if people at the party are committed to keeping the environment a little more formal, try to avoid embarrassing yourself.


If you look more classy, then you'll naturally feel a little more classy.
One way to act more classy is to complement the women at the event on their appearance. They made an effort to dress up, so you can make a small effort by telling them they look nice.

Select a style or two that you want to go for with your wardrobe.,
Start shopping for the style you like.,
Buy accessories that go with your style.",How to Dress to Impress Girls1," One example of a style is “the rocker”, he wears band tees, jeans, leather jackets and converse tennis shoes. Look at the clothes you already own, and decide what kind of style you may already have. If you don’t have a style yet it is helpful to decide what style is right for you.


First, it might be helpful to think about someone who dresses in a way that you like. Identify that particular style- for example, if you like plaid shirts, tweed jackets, bow ties and oxford shoes- you like the professor look. Before you decide on a style, ask yourself: does that look make sense for me and for my interests?
Choose from the following list of some common styles for men: the professional, the collegiate, the sportsman, the playboy, the minimalist, the professor, the rocker, the woodsman, the man of leisure. There are, of course, more styles than are listed there. Remember, styles are flexible. The objective behind choosing a style is to give you a template to build your style. You will be the most confident and attractive when your style becomes an extension of you. ;
, Ask the people you know who have that style where they get their clothes, and go to those stores to shop.


Do research online to find examples of men wearing that style, and then search for the companies or brands associated with that style. For example, if you like the woodsman style you might want to start shopping at Lands End.
Online shopping is another great option, and if you don't like crowds, it will keep you from rushing while you shop. In addition, there are online companies and consultants who will help you find the style that is right for you, however, this option is a bit more pricey.

, The right accessories will go a long way for your style.


Consider the accessories that go along with your style, for example, you can buy a classic pair of ray bans if you are going for the rocker look or a nice leather watch to go with the professor style.

Research - Look up some male fashion websites, such as GQ, Esquire, AskMen, or other e-zines for some style tips.,
Identify which fashion suits you the best, as a result of your natural looks, personality, and innate sense of style.,
Sort through the garments you already have, keeping things that reflect current fashion and suit your physique.,
Determine a shopping budget.,
List key items you should purchase for your wardrobe.,
Buy as many items on the list that you can within your budget.,
Update yourself on the latest fashion trends from websites, magazines and television shows.",How to Build a Stylish Wardrobe (Guys)," These can also be found on how-to websites such as wikiHow. Alternatively, you can use an internet search engine to find men's fashion or style tips, or perhaps look at fashion show offerings of the latest designer clothes for inspiration. Be careful to find a style that you like, and acknowledge that some things may work on you, while others will not. Beware of trends started by celebrities, as they are famous and prone to extremes of the latest trends, a habit the average man should strive to avoid.;
, Yes, you have an innate sense of style, you just have to find the clothes that fit it. And to do that, you need to look around. Look at lots of different websites, everything from Abercrombie & Fitch, to American Eagle, to Aeropostale, to Express, to SAKS Fifth Avenue. Look everywhere, in every price range, and in every style, for you may never know where you might find your perfect style.

, Make sure you keep clothes that fit your style and your body. Look at your clothes, and think about what looks cool. Also look at how it fits. If it doesn't fit both categories, throw it out or donate it to charity. Basics such as a good t-shirt or dress shirt may do wonders for your look, and provide an excellent base from which to start your new style.

, This does not mean you need to only buy at a thrift store. Choose reasonable priced stores. Good clothes cost more because most of the time they're worth more. The designer brands will almost certainly be of higher quality than the usual ready-to-wear offerings, although it is quite possible to find mid-range prices for clothing of excellent quality. The trick is to look. Once you go shopping, you'll learn to spot fashion disasters, style classics, and not least of all, the art of determining the quality of an article of clothing. But first, you need to...

,


It's always good to buy nice dark denim jeans, either in black, gray, or a nice dark blue. However, other clothing should not be forgotten! Black, gray, or brown colors are all neutral, and can be paired with almost anything. Look for different styles of pants, whether they are denim, cotton, corduroy, wool, or any other fabric, just find a cut that fits. And buy them in your size, no one wants to see your boxer shorts.
As for shirts, the classic black or white t-shirt goes a long way towards filling your wardrobe, as it's easy to wear, and you can put anything on over them. Dress shirts are another essential, with a good white dress shirt being as versatile as the white t-shirt. Polos are another good pick, flattering and classic, and very useful for layering, with t-shirts, dress shirts, or anything else that would fit your style. Branch out into other colors too, and bring along a female friend to help find out what colors, cuts, and styles work on you.
Shoes. As much as they may be a girl thing, you can't live without them. Ditch the athletic sneakers unless you're going all-out athlete style. As a matter of fact, ditch them no matter what. Odds are that they stink and you need a pair specific to working out. I would recommend a classic pair of black or brown leather shoes for casual wear, or perhaps some basketball, skater, or some other style of shoe. There are tons, so look around and find the pair that suits your lifestyle. Also, buy a pair of shiny black oxfords if you are ever going to need to dress up. Casual shoes and suits do not mix. Learn how to polish shoes.
Finally, you will want something to keep warm. Perhaps a blazer, sweater, or cardigan will do the trick. Adding another layer creates a whole new look, while simultaneously keeping you far warmer. Perhaps you want a track jacket? Or maybe some sort of pea coat? Again, look for something that reflects your style, and you'll wear it forever.

, After all, you need to have the basics to build up your wardrobe! Look at seams, hems, any place where fabric is stitched together. The seam should be straight, uniform, and there should be no gaps or holes. The buttons should be secure, and there should be no loose strings. No fraying, either. Also, feel the fabric itself. It should feel strong and soft, and different depending upon the fabric being examined. Beware, for some manufacturers coat their clothing in chemicals to lend a slippery, soft feel to their clothing. Rub your hands together after you touch a soft garment. Do they feel slippery or oily? This may mean that the fabric has been treated. Also, try everything on. Fits change from store to store, and even within styles and cuts within the same store. It pays to find clothes that fit on the first trip.

, Don't wear clothes just because it's ""in"" - wear something you actually like. By the same token, look for clothing that would be a good addition to your current style. Perhaps you decide you like the look of a sweater vest, or a cardigan, or a blazer. Add that to the list of things you'd like. Here, you have far more leeway in the hunt for an expanded wardrobe. Perhaps you dress up a lot, which might send you towards more ties, and different patterns and colors of dress shirts. Perhaps a second suit. Maybe a pair of brown dress shoes. Or perhaps you want a pair of skinny jeans, or maybe a great cardigan? Get inspired, look around, and always keep adding new things to your wardrobe, making it more versatile as time goes on. Don't forget belts, hats, ties, and scarves! While accessories for men may not be quite as expansive as for women, you are still given quite a few choices to add an extra touch of style to your outfit. Take advantage of them however you want!

Get your clothes tailored or altered so that they fit you correctly.,
Choose the colors you wear carefully.,
Be the best dressed guy in the room.",How to Dress to Impress Girls2," Take your suit to a tailor to have it fitted, or have a customer service representative at a reputable clothing retail store to help you buy clothing that fits. When you go to retailer or tailor, ask them how the clothes are meant to fit.


At Club Monaco, J. Crew and Banana Republic, they will take your measurements and have the clothing altered for you to make sure it fits correctly. In a study where men's faces were blotted out, men who wore a tailored suit, as opposed to a very similar looking store bought suit, were rated as being more confident, successful, flexible and a higher earners by the participants of the study. Studies have shown that people make snap judgments about you, based on how you are dressed. The study showed that small differences in the clothing, for example, if the inseam of your pants was too short, reflects badly on people’s impression of your personality and abilities. Take note if you are under 5’10 tall, most companies design clothing for men who are 5’10, and so the clothes made for men by most retailers probably won't fit you correctly. Luckily, Jaden Lam, Jimmy Au’s For Men 5’8 and Under, and Peter Manning NYC, have made clothing with you in mind. , If you wear the correct colors for your skin tone, you will accentuate your good looks, whereas, wearing the wrong colors will be unflattering. As a rule, bright red, pale pink, teal, and eggplant, look good on all skin types. Decide whether you have a warm skin tone or a cool skin tone. If gold looks best on you, then you probably have a warm skin tone. However, if silver looks best on you, your skin tone is probably cool. If your skin’s undertones are yellow, then you have a warm skin tone. Cool skin tones tend to have a rosy or pink undertone.
If you have a warm skin tone, wearing earth tones of ivory, orange, yellow, brown, and green, will be flattering for your skin type. If you have a cool skin tone, wearing jewel tones of pure white, black, blue, and true pink, will be the most attractive on you.
If you are going to a club and you want sex appeal, wear red; a multicultural study showed that men wearing red were found to be more attractive and sexually desirable to women. Warning, do not wear more than three colors together at once. It will distract from your desired effect.

, Always consider the context of where you are going when you are dressing, but err on the side of overdressing rather than under dressing.


When you care about how you look it shows, so be proud! Women will appreciate your care and will respect you more for it.
If you are unsure about the dress code for an event, call the host and ask him/her about what the proper dress attire is for the event.

Buy clothes that will last in the long run.,
Buy shoes of the best quality you can afford.,
Take some risks with your clothing choices.,
Wear clean and wrinkle-free clothes.,
Use cologne or body wash to smell good before you go out.",How to Dress to Impress Girls3," Purchase interchangeable and timeless pieces that will last a long time. Buy the best quality you can afford; and do not buy overly fashionable clothing pieces that will only last one season. , Shoes should be the cornerstone of your style. Nice shoes are the essential final piece for every outfit you put together.


Invest in a nice pair of brown longwings (oxford dress shoes), because they are perfect for both suits, jeans, and everything in between. You can look great in brown long wings everywhere except formal occasions. Buy a pair of simple white leather or canvas sneakers to make your casual outfits pop. These shoes will make you look younger, more fit, and more fun.
Get a pair of casual boots. Casual boots are great for doing outdoor activities or hiking down the street to your local bar.

, For example, you can stay true to buying interchangeable and timeless pieces by buying that leather jacket you have always wanted to own but never had the courage to buy. You never know, changing up your look may get the attention of women you are interested in.


Pay attention to people’s reactions to your clothing, but don’t get discouraged. Know your target audience, and dress to impress them. Ignore your guy friends who might give you a hard time.

, Take your clothes to the dry cleaner, or wash your clothes after you wear them, being careful to fold or hang them so they do not wrinkle.


If you are going out, take the iron to your clothes to make sure they look sharp.

, Take a shower with your favorite body wash before putting on your clean clothes. If you are wearing cologne, consider using a fragrance free body wash to keep your scents from clashing.


If you are using a cologne, make sure you use it sparingly, spraying a foot away from body, and choosing one or two places on your body to spray, like your wrist or chest.

Have confidence in yourself and your manliness.,
Be the sexiest version of yourself.",How to Become Sexy (for Boys Only)1," Confidence comes from having a well developed sense of self and a grounded stability. In specific terms this means, not bragging about your successes and being unwavering in your commitment to overcome personal fears and obstacles:


Accept yourself. You do not owe explanations for who you are and how you behave in the world. People won't acknowledge you if you haven't already learn to accept yourself. This means that you've faced your dark emotions and thoughts and have processed them, reached your own conclusions and have a purpose and ambitious path in life. By ambitious, this means different things for different people. Woman admire guys who know where they are going and actively work each day to move closer to what they want.
Confidence and Arrogance are two different things. Confidence is inner strength and arrogance is an outer show display and an unhealthy obsession with an individual's persona. The arrogant man spends all his energy persuading others that he's always right and can do no wrong. The confident man doesn't involve himself in such behavior. He knows he's not perfect and doesn't even consider the idea of perfectionism.;
, You have to want to keep yourself clean and your body lean. Outside influences can't do this for you and if they do their efforts will be short lived because change and sexual power comes from within. The sexiest thing a guy can do is work towards: first, finding out what he wants, then who he is and where he currently stands and working ferociously to get where he needs to be.

Just remember: confidence is key.",How to Be an Attractive Guy (for Grades 7 9)," Girls will only notice you if you don't try too hard. Make sure you try to talk to girls as much as you can! This helps in letting girls know you exist, and in finding the right girl for you!;
, That is one of the biggest factors why a girl likes a guy.

, You may want to practice talking to other girls first, but once you have it down, you can move on to your crush. Just don't flirt too much with the other girls. This includes finding out what to talk about and what not to talk about.

, Try to balance it 60% (about your crush) and 40% (about you) or 70%/30%. Show her that you're a good listener and are genuinely interested in the conversation. It is also suggested that you try identifying with her interests; point out common interests you have.

, Don't just throw on whatever in the morning and don't just let your mommy buy your clothes for you. Try to stay up to fashion. And fashion may seem expensive for you, but remember: Fashion can be affordable. You can even get fashionable clothes, including shirts, jackets, pants, and shoes, second-hand (for example, at Plato's Closet).

, Don't just let it go wild. Go to the barber; don't let your parents cut your hair. And when your barber asks you what you want, tell them a general (very general) request, and just ask them what they think would work best.

, Do this with other girls if you are just trying to find the right person to crush on. Science says our eyes change a certain way when we like someone. Then, when the other person sees this, their subconscious sees this and the girl will (most likely) be attracted to you. That's the reason why girls wear mascara.

, You want to talk to her often, get friendly with her, and get to know her, but don't do this all the time. This will get them thinking about you and whether or not you like her. Then all this thinking will lead to her liking you.

, ex. ""Ugh! I have horrible grades! I'm so stupid!"" ""No you're not! This was just a hard test! Don't worry, you will do better next time.""

, Girls hate jerks. Don't try to act like a bad boy if that's not who you really are. And girls love guys who are nice and polite to them. Also be polite to other people; they will see this and notice that you're not just flirting with them and that you are really a nice guy.

, Ask her on a date, but only if you feel ready. Most likely, you've never dated anyone. If you've never dated anyone, ask your parents or a trusted friend what to do. Just ask her out when you feel you two have gotten to know each other well enough. School Dances are a good chance for a first date.

, You are the gentleman. Don't try to seem like you are trying to buy their love though.

, Always be confident in everything you do! Even when you don't feel confident, force yourself to do the things you want, but don't force her to do the things you want. It's all about mental strength and will. Just try blanking out your mind and focusing on that one thing, but snap out of it once it's done.

When dressing for work or for school, respect the culture of that environment. Make sure you are projecting the appearance of a professional, competent person who is aware of where he actually is.
If you're going to a job interview, ask your contact what kind of attire their applicants usually wear. Wear either business casual or business formal attire. It's better to do over-dressed than under-dressed for an interview.
For professional networking events, industry conventions, or formal dinners, invest in a good suit. Choose a darker, classy color for increased versatility; grey, dark blue, and black are excellent choices.
You can wear a t-shirt of a band you like, or a little bit of camo if that reflects your interests, but always work it into your outfit so it looks like it’s in context.
For formal occasions, don’t try to get away with being underdressed. Show that you respect the event, and are involved in the moment. Dressing up will make you look more involved, approachable and confident.;
, You don’t have to force yourself to be anything you’re not, and it’s very important that your clothes accentuate who you really are. Just make sure that you’re not wildly inappropriate or projecting an image that doesn’t do you justice.


Wanting to dress well does not mean that you suddenly have to pay a whole lot of attention to fashion or be aware of all the trends.
Dressing well also doesn’t mean that you have to follow a lot of rules for tailoring and “what every well-dressed man should have”. You shouldn’t have to worry just because you don’t have a classic button-down oxford shirt in your closet.
If you have a casual, quiet, no-nonsense personality, it’s perfectly acceptable to have a simple wardrobe with just a few, well made, basic items.
If you have a dramatic personality that likes to make a statement, it would make sense to have that reflected in your clothes. Just exercise a little restraint to make sure you don’t go overboard.

, Dressing well means showing that you are comfortable being yourself, not hiding behind what your clothes say.


It’s good to wear clothes that reflect your interests, but avoid being a walking advertisement for a brand, a sports team, or musicians.
Avoid wearing shirts that display offensive or sarcastic statements. You will be more attractive if you project a positive image to the world.
Try not to look like you’re wearing a costume or uniform. Don’t dress all in camo if you’re not presently hunting or in the middle of actual combat.
If there is a celebrity you admire, it’s perfectly fine to use them as inspiration. Just make sure that you take your own activities and physique into consideration.

, You don’t need to have an ideal body to look good in what you’re wearing. Clothes can make a big difference in how your body looks, and can give the illusion that you are taller or thinner than you are.


Think of dressing as creating an optical illusion. Look at the lines and shapes your clothes make on your body, and consider how they relate to optimal proportions.
The ideal masculine proportion is tall, wider at the shoulders and narrower at the hips. Take an honest look at how your body matches up to this ideal, and look for clothes that hide and accentuate the right parts.

It’s OK to play with these proportions a bit, depending on the occasion and your social group. Just be conscious about how your clothes make your body look, and think about how to compromise good proportion with fashion statements.
Hip hop clothes, for example, tend to be a lot baggier, and can make a guy look bottom-heavy. Hipster clothes might make you look skinny. If this is the image you want to project, and you’re not going to a formal event or an office, that’s fine.



, Clothing companies use average measurements to determine sizing and fit to try to cater to many people. Individual people, however, usually have bodies that are a bit different.


The fit is the most important aspect of any article of clothing. No matter how cool the style is, if it doesn't fit you, do not wear it.
Look at how the clothes you try on make your body look, and be flexible when it comes to size. In one store you may be a medium, but in another you may be a large.
Remember that cotton clothing will shrink a small amount the first time you wash and dry the fabric. If you plan on drying your cotton clothes, look for sizes that are slightly too big to accommodate shrinkage. If you dry clean certain items, you won't have to worry about it.
Find brands that cater to your body type. You will probably find that some brands and stores tend to fit you better than others, and it’s a good idea to shop mainly at those stores.
Find a good tailor. Often clothes off the rack simply don’t fit, but can be made to fit with simple adjustments. Many good stores provide tailoring services at discounted rates if you buy from them.

For shirts, the seam at the beginning of the sleeve should start right where your shoulder ends. The length of the shirt should extend beyond the belt but not beyond the buttocks.
A good shirt will fit with the shoulder seam on the curve of the shoulder, and the cuff stopping just before the curve of the hand (where the hand meets the wrist).
For pants, the waist should fit you comfortably right above the hips. The pant leg should extend down at least to the top of your shoe, but not to the ground.
For shorts, choose a slightly wider leg than you would on a pair of pants. Shorts should stop somewhere between the top and middle of the knee.
European cut shirts are a bit different from American cut. The European cut is a little slimmer and more form-fitting along the sides, while American cut is a little baggier, allowing for more room.



, The colors on your clothes reflect onto your skin, eyes, and hair, and depending on your particular features, some colors will be more flattering than others. Colors can also improve your mood, and wearing colors that are a bit trendy can help you look current.


Experiment with different colors, and find the ones that suit you best. A good color should make your skin look healthy, not pale, blotchy, or sickly. Your eyes look clear and bright, not bloodshot or tired.

If you have blue or green eyes, try wearing a blue shirt or tie to bring them out. Also, certain shades of red or brown might “cancel out” your eye color and make you look tired.
If you have fair skin and dark hair, you might consider wearing clothes that complement this contrast. Wearing a lot of tans or khakis might make you look “washed out.”


The colors you wear should make you feel happy and at ease. Pay attention to how the colors you wear make you feel. Also, if you’re not comfortable wearing a particular color, don’t wear it, even if it‘s trendy or the color of your favorite team.

Some people love wearing bright colors like yellow and orange, but they might make other people feel self conscious.
You’ll probably notice when you go shopping that there are some colors that are popular for a season, such as fluorescents or mustard yellows. Some up-to date color in your wardrobe is good, but always buy colors that make you feel and look good, regardless of the trends.


Some colors are considered classic and never go out of style, such as brown, black, khaki, gray, and navy blue. These are great colors to use, but again, consider your skin tone and how you feel while wearing them.

Buy the pieces you wear everyday and expensive pieces in these colors. That way they will be versatile and you can wear them for a long time.
Remember that even though these colors are “neutral” they can still be either flattering or unflattering on you. For example, black looks too severe on some people.



, Opt for high quality materials and sturdy construction. This is especially true for basic pieces like pants and more formal pieces that you expect to wear for a long time.


You don’t necessarily have to spend a lot of money on clothes, but always look for quality. Plan to spend more money on more important pieces, and less money on trendy items or things you will wear through quickly, such as T-shirts.
Second-hand stores are a great source of high quality items. Also, buying from an expensive brand doesn’t necessarily guarantee quality. Use your best judgement when picking clothes no matter where you shop.

, Often, the difference between looking put-together and looking cheap is in the details. High-quality accessories can make even simple clothes look great.


While it may seem feminine, having a variety of shoes will help you dress appropriately for different occasions. Varying shoes day-to-day helps keep your look fresh, and your shoes will last longer.
Sneakers are great for the casual, sporty look. However, try to stay away from wearing athletic sneakers all the time, unless you want to look like a teenager.
Black formal shoes are a must for more formal occasions. While they're expensive, they're a great investment to make, especially if you take care of them. Try not to get formal shoes with a square or too-pointy toe: they won't be classic forever.
Desert boots or chukkas straddle the line between casual and formal, perfect for those nights out on the town when you want to spiff up your wardrobe without going overboard. Go for a nice neutral color like sand, brown, or grey.
If your shoes look cheap or are uncomfortable this can bring down the whole outfit. Badly fitting shoes can also affect your posture and mood, which definitely detracts from your overall presentation.
For formal occasions, always look for a great tie. This can add a lot of style to an ordinary suit.
Be careful of hats and caps, and make sure they are well-made and appropriate. Wearing a cap backwards never looks classy. Also be aware of how a hat will make your hair look if you plan on taking it off.
Wear jewelry sparingly. You don't want to look like Mr. T, or have more jewelry on than any of the ladies in the room, but a nice watch and some cuff-links can definitely help your look.

, If you are uncomfortable, people can tell, and it makes you less attractive. However while it’s comfortable to wear sweatpants, a baggy t-shirt, and running shoes all the time, this makes you look lazy and unkempt.


There are plenty of presentable clothes that are also comfortable. Making style as well as comfort a priority when choosing your clothes is very possible.
Tuck in your shirt, unless it’s a t-shirt. You may hate tucking in your shirt, but a tucked-in shirt makes it look like you care about your appearance. Don’t try to hide your gut by keeping your shirt un-tucked--a tucked in shirt actually makes you look thinner.
If clothes are made from a comfortable material but are still uncomfortable, this may be an issue with the fit.
Always plan for the weather. If you’re sweaty or shivering, you won’t look well put-together.

, Always make sure that you are clean, well groomed, and holding yourself up straight.



Have a good grooming routine. Smelling bad or looking dirty or sweaty is never attractive.
Don’t wear too much cologne.
Get a haircut that is flattering and up-to-date. A good haircut should complement the shape of your face. A good hair stylist can help you choose one.
Make sure your clothes are clean, ironed (if necessary), and in good repair.
Don’t slouch, fidget, or have an overly exaggerated walk. Your clothes will look better if you carry yourself with ease and confidence.

, You never know who will see you, and you should always strive to make the best impression.


One's attire is one of the first things noticed by others, and these first impressions are long-lasting.
You never know when you will run into the person of your dreams, a potential employer, or a local news crew looking to do a story on your life.

Choose your style.,
Exercise.,
Keep clean and fresh.,
Don't be obnoxious and loud,but also don't clam up.,
Be Chivalrous.",How to Be a Sexy Teenage Guy," If you need to, do some shopping. There are a few different styles for guys these days. Go to a store you like and pick up shirts, hoodies, shorts, jeans, Whatever you're comfortable in. And for the jeans: Make sure they fit! If you really like the style and they fit in length but not waist, Get a belt. No one needs to see your underwear.;
, If you are uncomfortable with your body, then do something. But, being a health nut is not always a good thing, and you should never skip meals or throw up or over exercise to get ""the perfect body"". If you feel like you should lose or gain weight, you can do it, but unhealthy and unnatural routes are extremely unattractive. Want muscles? Lift weights. But don't start out lifting 200 pounds. Start at where you are and just build. Want to lose weight? Check your diet, see what you can do to make it healthier. Run or walk, if you want to exercise, even swim. Do what you can and something that won't exhaust you.


Also, eating less carbs (a low carb diet) may help.

,


Use deodorant or antiperspirant. One of the worst things is when a guy either doesn't shower and tries to cover his smell with a cloud of axe or he just goes around smelling like a locker room.
Take care of your self and show that you have good personal hygiene. Brush your hair and teeth every morning for a more polished and well kept appearance. Keep your nails trimmed.

, If a girl likes you, she'll want to talk to you and know more about you. Be confident in yourself, and never forget that you're worth something. However, going overboard and being rude is not desirable.

, The sexiest thing to any woman is a man that will open a door for her, pay for dates, and walk on the street side of the sidewalk. Being a gentleman and having good manners is a great way to get girls and adults to like you.

Make sure you have good hygiene.,
Be seen as the guy who has it together.",How to Become Sexy (for Boys Only)2,"


Taking a shower every day to every three days is mandatory. If you aren't sweating a whole lot, two days is pushing it, and even if you aren't sweating a lot at the third day, mark you should take care of it regardless.
Brush twice a day, and floss once a day. People don't take this seriously enough and soon come to regret it. If your teeth are more than a tiny bit crooked, you should consider orthodontics. A straight smile makes a big difference.
Wear deodorant every day. Body odor is not an attractive smell, and nobody around you enjoys it. It's a simple routine that can reap large benefits in your friendships and relationships. Most deodorant doesn't smell enough to ever be ""Too much"". Apply liberally and make sure you get antiperspirant deodorant every time, it'll save you shirts in the long run.
Cultivating a scruffy look, especially at an early age till the time you are hitting middle age can be very successful. This does not count those dirty looking mustaches you see from time to time, shave that if you have it.
Pluck your uni-brow or shave it, either way keep it off your face if you have one. No exceptions.
Wash your face every day. This helps to clear up both red acne and blackheads. However, if you are a teenager a little acne is totally normal. If you're having trouble with blackheads, get anything with ""Salicylic Acid"" in it in a 1%-3% concentration and follow the directions on the bottle. If you're having trouble with mostly red acne, grab a tube of Benzoyl Peroxide 8-10%. Both of these are very cheap (Ten bucks and under) and last weeks. They are the same ingredients as ""Proactive"" which runs for prices much, much higher.
Using cologne to your advantage is a smart move, but don't overdo it. Wear nice clothes. The style of clothes that you wear doesn't matter, because you're expressing your personality. Whatever you choose to wear, though, should be clean and ironed (if appropriate). Also, do not wear pants in such a manner that reveal your underwear. This is not sexy to people who possess a mature and respectable sense of fashion. If you are going to wear jeans, make sure they are not too baggy. This, too, does not look good.







, This is a very good way to be. What this means is have your finances in place, be able to provide for more than yourself and don't get yourself involved in petty arguments."

Conversation is a cruel mistress who will never fail to frustrate and surprise you.,
Don't swear a ton, but don't cringe either.",How to Become Sexy (for Boys Only)3," She also holds the keys to all the beautiful women beyond her doors. The most important things to do are to open fearlessly, watch her body language and realize that it takes lots of practice. Guides exist to help with the amount of practice it takes, but there is no substitute for going to the mall and anywhere else women gather to talk to them. Over, and over, and over, and... On to the next bit.

, Everyone does it, most people do it frequently including the girls you think are completely crazy attractive. Just keep it somewhere between classy and normal and you'll look good.

Be funny!",How to Become Sexy (for Boys Only)4," Women love a funny guy. Puff your chest out a tiny bit pull your head back. That's what cocky feels like; a little swelled up and goofy. When you mix a little bit of cocky and a little bit of funny, you can get amazing results. Women don't just appreciate humor, they appreciate humor along with sexiness and social tact.

Be yourself.,
Be charming.,
Be witty.,
Be social.,
Be confident.,
Show an interest in others.,
Be positive.,
Don't put people down.",How to Be a Really Cool Guy1," Looks are important, but not nearly as important as being who you are. Learn to be less concerned with how you come off to other people and more concerned with having fun, joking around, talking about your interests, and doing what you want to do. If you can make anybody laugh, that's a great start.


Don't be ashamed to let people see what makes you unique. If you're into birdwatching, cool. But if you want to hide that you're into birdwatching, then you're not being cool at all.
Don't hide where you came from. If you're from the South and have a Southern drawl, don't try to hide it because you live up North. People will appreciate that you're different.
Don't act too cool to care. If you really care who wins the baseball game that night, show it. Don't act like nothing matters to you just to be cool.
Always be yourself. You can try to improve parts of your personality, but being authentic means not being afraid to be who you are.;
, If you want to be a really cool guy, then you have to know how to charm everyone in your presence. A charming person walks confidently into a room and can talk to anyone he passes with ease, humor, and a smile on his face. You should be able to flatter an eighty-year-old woman or crack up an eight-year-old boy; to be truly charming, you need the magic touch that lets you make everyone feel at ease in your presence.


To charm a person, show more of an interest in him than in talking about yourself. Ask about a person's interests or feelings and nod intently and make eye contact to show that you actually care.
To be charming, remember a person's name when you meet him, and always use it the next time you see him.
Laugh easily. Charming people are always laughing or making other people laugh. Don't be afraid to gently tease a person who is receptive to it.

, Being witty is a part of being cool. If you want to be a really cool guy, then you have to be able to make people laugh, to speak on your toes, and to maintain a light and winning banter with almost anyone who calms your way. To be witty, you also have to be sharp, and to offer incisive and clever comments at the right moment.


If someone says something funny, don't just laugh -- answer back with a funny comment of your own.
Watch other witty people you admire, from comedians to your funny uncle, to see if you can pick up on their tricks.
You'll need perfect timing to be witty. Deliver your jokes when everyone is listening and loudly enough for everyone to hear. If you make a joke too quietly or when someone else is talking, it won't be cool if you try it again.

, Don't be fooled by the movies. Cool guys don't pose in the parking lot on their motorcycle until they're surrounded by women. Call up people, make plans, take risks, and make friends that you can trust and respect. If you're social and hang out with a lot of people, then you'll look cool because you have a variety of friends.


Accept invitations. Don't turn people down just because you don't think it will be ""cool"" to show up somewhere.
Don't always be social. Though it's great to hang out with others, give yourself some time to do your own thing and develop your personality.
Be friendly -- to everyone. Don't only be social and nice to the cool kids -- truly cool people are cool with everyone.


, You could be amazingly good looking, but girls won't notice you if you speak timidly or have slouched posture. Hold your head up and your chest out, and look everyone in the eye. Work on your self esteem to get rid of any problems you may have with insecurity. This is not an overnight process, but you won't gain respect from others until you respect yourself.


Walk tall with your head high, showing that you're proud of who you are.
Speak clearly and slowly enough so that everyone hears what you have to say.
Make eye contact when you talk to people. This shows that you're comfortable with yourself.
Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself. This shows that you're even more confident. You don't have to be self-deprecating to be able to laugh at yourself sometime.

, Who wants to hear someone talk about himself all the time? Find out what your friends are interested in or working on and ask them about it. This will earn you a reputation as someone who is caring and considerate.


When you talk to someone, ask, ""How are you?"" This shows that you actually care about the person.
Ask a person about his interests. People love talking about their interests, and will think you're cool for caring enough to ask.

, You don't have to give everyone a thumbs up or grin like a fool to be positive. Being positive just means being upbeat, looking for the good in things, and talking about the things that make you happy instead of bringing people down. Nobody likes a person who is negative and constantly complaining, so you should avoid doing so when you can. Instead, focus on the positive things, and you'll see how quickly people think you're cool.


Every time you hear yourself saying something negative, say three positive things to counter what you've just said.
It's okay to complain or be negative once in a while if you're really feeling upset or annoyed. Just don't make it a habit.
If someone else is being negative, you can also make that person feel better by making him see the good side of things and by making him laugh. People will appreciate your ability to make them feel better. That's very cool.

, You may think it's cool to make fun of people who are less cool than you, or calling people ""losers"" because they don't meet your standards of coolness. However, putting people down doesn't make you look better -- instead, it makes you look insecure and desperate to make other people look bad so people see you in a more favorable light.


Instead of putting people down, you can tease or playfully poke fun at your friends. They'll tease you back and you'll both have fun, instead of entering a storm cloud of negativity.

Wear fitting clothing.,
Have good hygiene.,
Show confidence.,
Try to be mysterious.,
Be healthy.",How to Be Sexy (Skinny Guys)," Once again, this is where your figure becomes your best friend; you can wear tight fitting clothes. The same rule as above applies here; Avoid purchasing clothes that are too tight, and stay away from baggy clothes. Everybody has their own style, so experiment with yours. Try to mix things up and buy something you wouldn't usually wear, it may work in your favor. Some girls seem to think that button up shirts on guys are very sexy, so give that a go, but keep in mind that not everything will suit you.


Purchase some skinny jeans. You're skinny, so make the most of it! Lucky for you, you can pull of the oh-so-famous skinny jeans. Of course, refrain from buying skinny jeans that are too tight as well as avoiding ones that are too loose. When you find the right fit it will really work well in your favor. The girls will love it.;
, Be sure to present yourself well by showering, brushing your teeth, and wearing deodorant every day. Also consider shaving and cologne, depending on your need.

, It's not always clear why exactly, but confidence can be quite sexy. Now this doesn't mean you have to go around acting cocky and showing off, this simply means you should take pride in yourself and realize how brilliant you truly are. When you are comfortable with yourself, you will exude confidence without even trying.

, There is something quite alluring about mysterious men, so bring out your inner mystery and give it a go. Being skinny can give your movements a slightly awkward or eerie touch, which can get people curious about you. You can also be mysterious by being a little bit introvert occasionally (but of course, there is no need to isolate yourself). Also, there is no need to spill all your secrets, if you don't reveal much about yourself then everyone will be dying to know about you. Mysterious guys = Alluring = Sexy.

, If you wish to be sexy, staying healthy is a must. Eat healthy foods to keep yourself healthy, drink plenty of water to flush out intoxicants and participate in physical activity to keep your body toned and sexy.

Read a book.,
Keep up on current events.,
Get physically active.,
Pursue your interests.,
Pick up a skill.,
Develop your interests by yourself.",How to Be a Really Cool Guy2," Read several books. Always have a good book at home that you are reading. Books can be a great icebreaker and can stimulate conversation at parties. Plus, someone who is well-read is always attractive. The more you read, the more you know, and the more you'll develop a unique perspective on the world.


If people call you a nerd, just laugh it off. Anything is cool if you make it cool.
Reading will also make it easier for you to talk to a variety of people, not just one narrow social circle. Truly cool people can talk to almost anyone.

, You don't need to tear through several newspapers per day, but having a basic understanding of what's going on in the world will give you a reputation of being smart and knowledgeable, both of which are attractive qualities. This process can be as simple as going on Google News and reading two or three of the biggest stories each day.


You don't have to sound like a know-it-all to bring up something interesting and relevant. People will think it's cool that you have time to think about the world -- not just yourself.
If you have no idea what's going on in the world, you'll look clueless -- and that's just not cool.

, Being physically fit and active is already cool. Even if you're not a big athlete, going to the gym or running can get your blood flowing and can improve your physique. Being physically active will also develop your confidence, which is very cool.


Sports are also a great way to make new friends and bond with other people. Join a sports team or two in your school, and see how many new friends you make.
Physical activity also releases endorphins which make you feel better, improving your overall mood and making you more appealing to hang out with.

, Whether you join a club at school or take a screenwriting class in your community, doing something that you love will not only make you more interesting, but it can help you make new friends. Don't be shy about pursuing your interests, even if some of the things you love may not be traditionally considered to be ""cool.""


If you join a club, you can eventually have a leadership position in the organization, which is very cool.

, The more you can do, the cooler you'll be. Learn how to fix a car, build a table, finish a deck, or even to cook the perfect steak. If you have a skill, you'll not only be useful to others, but people will think it's cool that you took the initiative to do something.


Once you've mastered a skill, you can even teach it to someone else. Now that's cool.

, Though certain interests, like team sports, can be developed better in groups, part of being cool is being able to spend time learning things on your own. Anyone who is comfortable spending time by himself and who even likes spending time by himself is much cooler than a person who is so socially eager that he's desperate to always be hanging out with people.


Spend time learning to play the guitar, picking up a new language, or just writing down your thoughts in a journal. This will help you figure out who you are and you'll become cooler in the process.
If you're always around, people will take you for granted. But if you're sometimes busy because you're catching up on some alone time, then people will appreciate you more when you're around.

Have the right body language.,
Maintain good hygiene.,
Look after your skin.,
Be assertive.,
Have cool style.,
Style your hair.,
Don't forget to smile.",How to Be a Really Cool Guy3," Though being cool should come from within, people can make assumptions about you if your body language indicates that you're insecure and unsure of yourself. To have cool body language, just stand tall, keep your head high and your shoulders open, showing that you're proud to be taking up space.


Don't hunch over, or you'll look like you're cowering.
Don't cross your arms over your chest, or you'll look uncomfortable and insecure. Instead, keep your arms at your sides or use them to gesture as you speak.
Don't fidget with your hands or your clothes, or you'll look insecure.

, Have you ever met a cool guy who reeks of sweat and never brushes his teeth? Didn't think so. Shower everyday, use deodorant to cover up body odor, brush and floss your teeth twice a day and wash your hair regularly. Carry some mints or gum around with you to get rid of bad breath. Be sure to also wash your clothes regularly.

, Wash your face with warm water and rub on some moisturizer afterwards. If you have dry skin, moisturize with a product meant for dry skin. Avoid products with fragrances if your skin is sensitive. For oily and combination skin, use a moisturizer without alcohol and that is meant for oily/combination skin. For acne problems, Clearasil offers a number of products ranging from face washes to pimple creams.


Watch what you eat and drink. A healthy diet and drinking lots of water is also great for your complexion. Oily and greasy foods will make your complexion more oily and greasy, too.

, Don't be afraid to take up space when you sit or when you move around. Don't be afraid to be louder, even though it will create some social pressure. When you speak, slow down your words to show that you value what you're saying and you're not worried that you'll get cut off. Make good and fearless eye contact.


At the same time, know when to let other people take center stage. You can't assert yourself 100% of the time.

, Make sure your clothes fit properly and actually look good on you. Try to find colors or patterns that especially look good with your skin tone, and wear them most. Even a simple wardrobe like a t-shirt and jeans is fine as long as it fits and suits you.


If you need to go shopping for clothes, invest in only a few items of clothing of more expensive, higher quality clothing instead of buying lots of mediocre and cheap clothes. An example is Hollister.
Experiment with different styles, and try to find the one that plays off of your strengths and identity, whether you're preppy or going for more of a rocker or hipster look.
Having cool style means wearing what you love no matter how ridiculous you may look. If people make fun of your clothes and you stop wearing them just to please people, then you're not being cool.

, Just because you have nice clothes doesn't mean you can forget about your hair. Make sure it's in a style that suits you and that is comfortable and easy to maintain. Wash your hair regularly, and if it's short, try different hairstyles.


If you need to get a haircut or want a new style, the best method is to splurge on an expert hair stylist once, take a picture of that haircut, and get it done at cheaper places later on. If they style your hair in a certain way that you like, have them show you how to recreate that look on your own.

, You may think that it's not cool to smile, or that only dorks grin from ear to ear for no reason, but quite the opposite is true. If you're nice and smile at people, they'll feel welcomed and will want to get to know you. If you're too cool to say hi, then you'll just be hanging out by yourself in the corner while everyone else has a good time.


A smile makes a lasting impression. Even if people don't know you well, they'll like you if you smile at them. And if you don't smile at them, they'll think you're a jerk or a grouch before they even get to know you.

Devote time to being fashionable.,
Take stock of your current style.,
Don’t change who you are just for the sake of being fashionable or trying fit in with what’s popular.,
Read websites and publications devoted to male fashion.,
Look for brands and stores that appeal to you.,
Update your wardrobe for current trends.,
Organize a shopping trip.,
Give away any clothes that you don't wear.,
Mix and match clothes from your new spiced up wardrobe.,
Accent your wardrobe with accessories.,
Wear a watch.,
Wear a belt that fits your outfit.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Groom yourself.",How to Be a Fashionable Teenage Boy," Developing your personal style takes a certain amount of enthusiasm and passion. Finding a style that you like can really help you when getting started.


A great way to start, especially if you don’t know much about men’s fashion, is to read blogs and magazines that are devoted to style, and take tips you like from them.
Look at celebrities that you like for style cues. Pick a celebrity you like who has a similar body type as you and see what clothes you already own that look similar.
A great way to start is to also simply search “men’s style tips” and see what is currently trending. Then take a look at your current wardrobe and see if you can emulate popular styles.;
, Compare your style to the current trends and see how you can incorporate any of your clothes into a fashionable look.


Look at what’s currently in style in terms of colors, patterns, and fit. For example, clothes that offer a slimmer cut and a more tailored fit might be what’s popular.
Perhaps you have a lot of clothes that have patterns that are out of style. Compare what’s popular to what you have and separate outdated items from popular items.
While taking stock, you may find that you have some older clothes that have come back into style that you can take out of retirement.

, Changing to a certain look or style just because it’s ""the cool thing to do"" doesn't mean it’s right for you. More than anything else, be yourself.


Part of being fashionable means feeling comfortable in not only your skin, but your clothes. If you have a favorite shirt or sweatshirt, you don’t have to get rid of it just to be fashionable.
Keep clothes that make you feel comfortable for now. You may find that when building outfits you can use some of them.

, These include GQ, Esquire, Fashion Beans, or Reddit’s Male Fashion Advice.You can find places and forums where people will share style tips and wardrobe ideas.


Don’t buy into everything you read. People sometimes get very adamant that there is a right and wrong way to be fashionable. While there are trends in fashion, it is largely subjective.
These resources are also a great way find looks and clothing items that may fit better into your budget. You may see a jacket or pair of jeans that you really like, but are too expensive. You can use these resources to find similar items at a better price.

, When you find a brand or store that has a lot of clothes you really like and that fit you really well, you can easily upgrade your style and feel confident.


How clothes fit on you plays a big role into looking fashionable. Just because you love a particular item doesn’t mean it will always fit you correctly, depending on your body type.
Depending on your height, weight, and overall body type, certain clothes will fit you better than others.If you’re a bigger guy, avoid horizontal stripes and opt for vertical ones. Vertical stripes will draw the eyes downward and make you look slimmer.
If you’re a slimmer guy, you can wear clothes that are tighter fitting and will accentuate a tight waist.
In general, being a fashionable teenage boy means wearing clothes that create visual tricks which will make your body look as evenly proportioned as possible. Some people like tighter fitting clothing while others go for a more relaxed fit, but for the most part, you should avoid overly baggy clothes. A more tailored fit will make a huge difference.

, Being fashionable requires a bit of creative improvisation. Experiment with new looks and disregard anything that you don't feel comfortable with.


Updating your wardrobe can seem like a daunting task and can easily get expensive, which can be difficult especially if you’re still growing and don’t have a lot of extra money, but you can do a lot with a little.
Separate your clothes into two categories: clothes you like and wear, and clothes you don’t wear. Clean out your wardrobe by donating or selling the clothes you don’t wear.
Then take a look at your “keep” pile. Note which clothes are fashionable and which ones aren’t. This will help you start to build a base for your updated wardrobe.

, Ask a parent, older sibling, girlfriend, or any fashionable friend to go shopping with you. They might be able to offer advice and pick out some great clothes for you.


Your siblings or your friends will be able to give you advice on what works or doesn’t work for you and can help you pick out something that you might not on your own.
Create a list of clothing items that you need as staples.For example, you may want to get one pair of jeans you can wear for almost any occasion, a pair of chinos, a casual button down shirt, dress shirt, and a sweater.

, Often times we hang onto clothes that don't fit or we hardly ever wear. Gather up these clothes and donate them to a charitable organization or sell them to a resale shop. Be prepared that your parents may be reluctant to throw out clothes that still fit you.


If your parents are reluctant to let you get rid of the clothes you already have, you can try selling them to earn your own money for new clothes. Just make sure that you are upfront with your parents.
Being a teenager can make it hard to find the right fit since you may grow several inches in just a few months. Check out consignment stores for cheaper clothes, or shops like H&M and asos, which offer plenty of trendy items at lower prices.Shopping at stores that offer lower prices can also help you to convince your parents to update your wardrobe.

, It doesn’t take a lot to create several different looks. Think about the occasion that you’re dressing for and pick out items that look appropriate.


If you’re going to school, you may want to wear clothes that you’ll feel comfortable in all day.
You can also create several fashionable looks with a few staple items like a dark pair of jeans. You can wear jeans with sneakers and a sweater to school, add a blazer or light jacket and change into boots if you’re going somewhere after school. You’ll create a whole new look in a few minutes by adding or changing just a few items.
Mix and match items based on your mood. Maybe you’re in less of a classy mood and more in a street style mood. Pair your sneakers with jeans or joggers, a plain t-shirt and a light jacket.

, Small accents to your wardrobe will go a long way in enhancing your style. Consider wearing an accessory that can be your signature like a scarf, hat, bracelet, etc.


Remember that being fashionable is subjective, and you should feel comfortable with the amount of accessories you wear.
Look for accessories that you might already have that are sentimental to you like a necklace.
Own your style. Maybe you like to wear bracelets, necklaces, and even earrings. Don’t let others’ opinions make you feel awkward for choosing to wear what you wear, because you’ve put in the effort to show off your own style.
Use accessories to tie in a color palate or create some pop. One item that people often overlook are socks. Colorful and patterned socks can add some extra style to your look.

, Being a fashionable guy means looking put together and mature no matter how old you are. One item that really does this is the watch.


Even though we may have phones that tell time, a watch is an invaluable accessory, and can tie a whole look together.
Wearing a watch shows that you’re punctual and reliable and adds a level of maturity to your look.
You also don’t have to spend a lot on a nice watch. Get a watch with a nylon band that can easily be switched for another one to match the rest of your outfit.
A watch is also a great gift to ask for. And you can tell your parents or whoever may be giving you one exactly which one you want.

, Besides holding your pants up, belts serve as a way to tie your whole outfit together, and a belt that doesn’t fit right will stand out.


Belts are a great way to connect your shoes to the rest of your outfit. Wearing a brown belt that’s the same color as your shoes will make you look more put together and fashionable.
While sometimes it looks good to wear black and brown together, it can be tricky to pull off. Avoid wearing a brown belt on black pants or jeans as it usually looks mismatched.
Get a belt that’s the right size for you. Nothing undoes an outfit like having a belt that’s way too big.

, The right shoes complete an outfit, so don't become dependent on a single pair.While one pair of shoes can be paired with several looks, some just aren’t right for every occasion. You don't want to wear skater shoes at a formal event.


It’s always easier to wear nicer shoes with a casual outfit than it is to wear sneakers with a dressier one. For example, you can pair loafers or wingtips with jeans and a button down or sweater and look good. And while it’s not impossible, it’s a lot harder to wear sneakers with a suit.
Just because you’re a teenager doesn’t mean that you can’t wear dressier shoes either. Loafers, oxfords, wingtips, and nice boots can go a long way when looking fashionable.
If you don’t have the budget to own a bunch of shoes, you can get a lot of mileage out of a few staples. Consider nice sneakers, a pair of boots, and a pair of dressier shoes to start out.

, Clothes that fit well and that look good will only get you so far. Part of being a fashionable male means taking care of your body.


Whether you like your hair long, buzzed, or somewhere in the middle, consider adding some product so that it looks styled and not like you just rolled out of bed. And be sure to wash it on a regular basis.
Be honest with yourself about facial hair. Some teenagers can grow a full beard by 16, while others teens (and even adults) can’t. If you can grow facial hair make sure that it’s trimmed nicely and not like you were raised in the wilderness. If you can’t grow facial hair well, or it’s patchy, then shave it. A clean shaven face always looks better than patches of peach fuzz.
Keep your nails clean. Dirty or long nails are never attractive and can make you look like you don’t care about your appearance.

The first thing you should do is to wash your hair.,
The first hairstyle I would suggest would be to do a messy bun.,
Let's have some fun with the ends of our hair!,
Half up-dos are my favorite hairstyles!,
Go with the popular styles with a unique twist!,
Having your hair down with a cute headband is important to have once in a while!,
Only dye you hair if you are 110% sure you won't regret it.,
Have you ever heard the saying, 'Less is more' or 'Natural is best'?",How to Make Cute Hairstyles for High School," Or simply use some dry shampoo. In fact, washing your hair everyday is not good. Dry shampoo should not be overused too, but it's rather cheap and smells nice. Brush your hair if you have straight hair and gently stroke your hair if it's curly.;
, It can be playful, charming, elegant or sleek. Some variations would be 'The Donut' or the 'Braided Messy Bun'. Brush or stroke your hair and tame flyaway hair with hair-spray. If you don't have any, this is just a temporary solution, use water to weigh it down. There are many ways to achieve the look, but my favorite is to tie it into a high ponytail and wrap it around the elastic. If you want sleek and elegant, make sure it's tight and no hairs are out. If you prefer a young, playful look, tease your hair a little before tying it up.

, Messing with the bottom of our hair is fun and trendy. Some are easy and don't take long as well. One look would be have tightly curled ends. If you don't have a heat curler, go traditional! The dollar store usually carries some curlers. Just put them on the ends of your hair the night before. Plus, since it's only the bottom, they'll be easier to sleep on. Beware, the curlers on the middle part of your hair tend to get loose more easily. Another style would be to temporarily color them! Using soft, I repeat, soft pastels, to color you hair is messy, but can be kept tidy, and is bold. To start, get a water sprayer and lightly mist your hair on the bottom, about 30% wet or so. Then, choose a color, and rub downwards. Don't go up and down, that's just asking for tangles and hair loss. This works for dark hair too, but I would just suggest using darker colors. Lighter hair shades should stick with lighter shades, but the fun thing about this is, that you can experiment! Or, be even more bold and give yourself some highlights too! These usually last for a couple of days, so no commitment! You can let it air-dry or use a hair dryer, although that'll make it loose a bit of color. After that, use a straightener or curler to seal in the color. If you don't have one, I think it'll be fine to skip this step.

, My most favorite one is easy and cute. Grab a bit of hair at the front, and separate. These are going to act as innocent tendrils. Then, not adding the front hair you separated, proceed making a tiny ponytail. Of course, along with your tendrils, make sure to leave some hair on the bottom. I suggest collecting hair from the top to make your mini ponytail. Tie with elastic and add a cute scrunchie. Done, easy as pie.

, Want to make a braid? Try a fishtail or dutch braid. Curly long pigtails are super cute, yet still socially acceptable. It works well with straight hair too. Use black, and sophisticated elastics to be a bit more mature. Curling your hair, if you have straight hair, is fun and cute. Plus, they'll turn back into straight strands eventually, so you don't need to use a straightener! If you don't want to use curlers, or a heat curler, see some videos on how to get curls with house-hold items you probably already have!

, Give your hair a break from daily torture, and relax it a little bit! Tight ponytails and braids can cause hairs to be pulled, which will lead to hair loss. Loose low side-ponytails are super cute, and not as damaging to your hair. Loose buns look young and sweet.

, Especially if you're considering dying it a dark color. If you're not ready to make a huge commitment, try highlights or just dying your ends. Even better, use soft pastels. Which don't last long.

, Well guess what? They're true. It's always better to go natural and use as least as you can. Enjoy your locks and embrace them 'cause they're yours. Of course, it's always fun to play and mess around with them, but they're a part of us too, so treat them nicely.

, Make sure that the magnets are all the same size, and just a little bit smaller than your jewelry pieces.

Regular black magnets will be the least painful to wear, but they won't be very strong. Silver, ""rare earth"" magnets will be stronger, but they may also more painful for some people.


If you have sensitive ears, do not use the silver-colored, ""rare earth"" magnets. They are too strong, and can pinch your ears., Set the other magnets aside for later.

Decide whether to go prepaid or postpaid.,
Switch off your Android device.,
Insert the new SIM card.,
Turn on your phone.,
Use the new SIM card.",How to Set Up an Unlocked Android Unit," Although you can still use the SIM card from the network carrier your Android phone was originally locked in with, you may want to try using another carrier since that is the entire point of having your phone unlocked in the first place.


To help you make an informed decision as to which network carrier to try next, consider the various offers, plans, and monthly recurring costs of different carriers.;
, Older phone units use regularly-sized SIM cards while newer ones use the micro SIM, which is half the size of the former. It’s best to bring the SIM card originally used on your Android device before you have it unlocked, and to ask the shop personnel to give you a new SIM card from your chosen provider in the same size.

, After making up your mind about which carrier to use, purchase a SIM card if you want to go the prepaid route. This kind of card will be roughly around $3. If you go for postpaid service, most network service providers will include the SIM card for free., Some Android units have SIM slots placed inside and behind the battery at the back of the unit. You need to turn off your phone to get to the slot by pressing the Power button for a few seconds.


Some Android units have a “hot swap” feature where the SIM slot is outside the phone, usually along one of the sides. For these units, you can remove and insert a new SIM card into the slot without having to turn off the phone.

, After removing the battery (if needed), insert the new SIM card carefully into the slot provided. Make sure that the card is locked securely in place before you place back the battery.

, Press the Power button for a few seconds to switch on your Android phone. Wait for the Home screen to load before you start using the device.

, Once the Home screen is up, make calls, send text messages, or surf the Internet to make sure the SIM card is working smoothly.


After inserting the new SIM card, the carrier should automatically send to you the network data configuration settings for your Android to be able to browse the Internet using mobile data. All you need to do is to tap “Save” once you are prompted to do so after receiving the settings.
If you’re unable to use the new SIM card, make sure that your Android device has indeed been unlocked to all networks.

Skip pale, neutral lipstick tones., Different kinds of faces look best with different hairstyles. Choose the style that will best fit your face shape.Round Face- Wear your hair down with long layers. Angle the hair in the front and stay away from bangs. Middle parts work well for round faces. Avoid bob cuts and side parts.

Oval Face- This shape can wear any hairstyle- long or short, with or without bangs, curly or straight, waves or layers- all work on an oval face, but one of the best hairstyles is long, voluminous layers.

Heart-Shaped Face- Wear bangs that are cut straight across the face or swept off to one side. Wear your hair in layers that fall around your cheeks. Shoulder-length and chin-length hair looks best. Slicked-back or sleek, straight looks don't work as well.

Square Face- Wear hair wispy and falling in front of your face at your jawline. Side-swept bangs and hairstyles that are high (teased) at the crown work well. Avoid blunt haircuts and bobs.

Oblong Face- Straight-across bangs with a side part look best, along with layered, wavy styles. Avoid middle parts, and hairstyles that are high at the crown.

Triangle Face- Try layered hairstyles that taper at the jaw line. Stay away from longer hairstyles, but don't go as short as a bob cut.

, Wear clothing that flatters our bodies and instills a sense of confidence when we put it on. Decide what kinds of clothes accentuate the best features of your body, while downplaying other areas you’re not as comfortable with. There are certain clothes that look universally great on different body types. Hourglass Body (curvy with a small waist)- To highlight curves and accentuate a thin waistline, try a wrap dress, pencil skirt, belted jacket or sweater, or wide legged pants belted at the waist.

Apple Body (thinner on the bottom, heavier on the top)- To accentuate thin legs, while de-emphasizing the waistline, try a flowing top, low-waisted straight leg pants, circle skirt, or shift dress.

Pear Body (heavier on the bottom, slimmer on the top)- To draw attention to a small waistline, while downplaying hips, butt, and thighs, try an A-Line skirt, fit and flare dress, embellished shirt, bootcut or flare pants, or structured jacket.

Banana Body shapes (thin with few curves)- To create the appearance of curves, while highlighting thin areas, try a ruffled top, mini skirt, side cutout dress, tapered pants (like skinny jeans), or cropped jacket.

, Decide which colors best complement your skin-tone and features. Choose clothes within that color palette to underscore your natural beauty.Warm Skin Tones- Try wearing red (especially warm reds like tomato), peach, golden yellow, golden brown, olive green, gold

Cool Skin Tones- Pick clothes that are red (with cool undertones such as cherry), pink, blue, teal, turquoise, purple, mint green, silver

, Accessories add pizzazz to an outfit. Even the most basic of clothing can look great when dressed with the right accessories. Consider the kinds of accessories that will complement your outfit and reflect your personal style.Big earrings dress up any outfit and bring attention to your face.
Long necklaces emphasize your top.
Belts break up the monotony of an outfit. They can cinch your waistline to accentuate a small waist, or be worn across the hips to bring attention to small hips.
Basic clothes should have more and bolder accessories. Flashy outfits with loud prints should use fewer and more simpler accessories.
Don't be afraid to mix metals when wearing jewelry.
Don't wear too many accessories at once.
Wear accessories that say something about your personality.

, Each morning before school or the night before, take a shower or bath and wash yourself thoroughly with soap or body wash. Cleanliness is key in achieving a comely appearance.

, Frequency of hair washing is an individual preference, depending largely on your hair type. Figure out how often you need to wash your hair for it to maintain a clean look. For some, this may be every day, for others a couple of times a week. Use shampoo every time, and conditioner if desired.

An antiperspirant will also help to eliminate sweat stains on your clothing, adding to your hygienic appearance.

, Studies have shown that people find a smiling face more attractive than one with a scowl.People are naturally drawn to happiness and will gravitate toward you if they see your happy, smiling face. A smile will also make you look more approachable to others., True beauty comes from within. If you feel beautiful on the inside, it'll be reflected in how you look on the outside. As celebrity makeup artist Bobbi Brown once said, ""Feeling confident, being comfortable in your skin — that's what really makes you beautiful."", We all want the perfect body, thick lustrous hair, pouty lips, and impeccable skin. Very few people have all of these qualities. Be thankful for the things about yourself that you love, and learn to embrace the imperfections. "

, Blow drying too much can cause your hair to dry up, so avoid doing this most days.

, Wash your skin every day and night. Don't pile on thick foundation; let the skin breathe.

Choose an oil-free moisturizer, to avoid minor infections and clogged pores.

, Here you have a choice, even if your school doesn't allow makeup. A tinted moisturizer, to even your skin tone, conceal flaws and save time (foundation and moisturizer in one) - or some mineral powder with concealer on top will work for both a non-makeup school and one that allows it.

, For bright flushed cheeks, choose a baby pink blush and, using a brush, dust it on the tops of the apples of your cheeks, then blend.

, Putting on chapstick before going to sleep with help keep that moist feeling when you wake up. Lip gloss is always an eye catcher.


Make sure you wash off yesterday's lip products before putting on a new coat. Lip stainer can stain your lips a color you don't like, and it takes a lot of time to wipe that stuff off.
No harsh reds or deep purples. Light pinks are okay, but the recommended choice would be a nice, nourishing chapstick.

, Line your upper eyelids in black, brown or smoke-gray eyeliner, and lower eyelids in white eyeliner. Curl your eyelashes and put on one or two coats of a good, non-clumpy mascara.


Get an eyeshadow in smoldering gold. Dip your pinkie in it and dab it at the corner of your eyes, then across the bottom of your lids. Use a concealer to cover up your dark circles.
Go a little natural and light with the eyeshadow. Fake eyelashes are not a good idea.

, Use a sweet or citrus cream, moisturize your entire body (but not your face). Perfume is another good way to keep a fresh smell lingering on you. Good smelling hair products work well too, if it doesn't damage your hair.

, For example, a lace shirt, skinny jeans, high tops. Or, for a more preppy look, a skin tight cherry that is not too long, some cute bracelets, and extra-high sandals. You don't need to wear designer clothes to feel good, just an eye for what looks best on you.


If you have a uniform, make sure the skirt is short, the shirt is a little loose, the tie/bowtie is loose and long and you have at least one bright, cool accessory and preferably two.

However, make sure you go to bed early enough that you can function. A tired person is not an attractive person. Losing too much sleep will give you dark circles and bags under your eyes. Do the basic things - get some breakfast and have a drink as soon as you get up.;
, Wash your whole body thoroughly with soap, shampoo your hair at least 3-4 days a week, and condition it at least twice a week. Use a shower gel to make your body smell fresh. Get out and dry off, but leave your skin a bit damp.

, Make sure you put on a decent amount and massage it into your skin.

, Pluck any stray eyebrows, put moisturizer on your face, file your nails if they are rough or broken, and if you have gotten up earlier, you could even consider re-painting them if they are chipped.

, For school, just sweep on a thin coat of your favorite eyeshadow (try earth tones so you don't look like a clown: light gold, bronze, caramel etc. . .), and use about three swipes of mascara (curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler BEFORE putting on mascara if needed). Make your skin look clear with some foundation, and dust your face lightly with loose powder to stop your face from getting shiny. This will keep the look fresh and natural. Don't forget to gloss up, a nice pink or clear lip gloss will add just enough shine to your face.

If your hair is still wet from the shower, either towel dry it or use a blow dryer.

If you choose to use a blow dryer, leave it a bit damp so that your hair doesn't get ruined from the heat.



Straightening your hair is a great way to get a chic look. It's fast and easy, but don't do it everyday or it will ruin your hair. Remember to use an anti heat spray or mousse to protect your hair and make sure your hair is completely dry!!)

Ponytails are very nice because they help to show your beautiful face.

, Put on some deodorant and some body spray. Take out the outfit you planned the night before. Clothes should be clean and creases should be ironed out.

Apply makeup.,
Choose shoes.",How to Look Great for School (for Girls)," Preparing an outfit beforehand is always useful because it avoids getting late and having a fashion crisis the next day. If you have to wear a school uniform, have it washed, ironed and ready. If you don't have a school uniform, take some time to choose an outfit. Try to wear comfortable, clean and appealing clothes, rather than dragging anything out of your closet. Make sure you pack all your books and school stuff into your bag the night before to avoid forgetting important things. Try to make your lunch earlier as well. Be sure to brush your hair before you head off to bed. This will make it easier to brush in the morning. Also, try straightening/curling your hair the night before school, to avoid dramas in the morning.;
, If you stay up late, not only will you be tired, but you'll be stuck with dark circles and bags under your eyes, and endless yawning fits and unrefreshed skin. Fix a regular time or period in which you go to bed, that will ensure you get enough sleep. For example, if you have to get up at seven in the morning for school, you can go to bed anywhere from nine to ten, or if you're older, eleven. These times all make sure you have a good chance of getting at least 6-7 hours of sleep. However, if you're a light sleeper or take some time to settle down, make your bedtime earlier to give yourself some extra snooze time.

, If you straighten or curl your hair, set the straightener/curler to heat up while you're getting ready. Double check all your books and school supplies to avoid any disasters.

, Having a shower after you wake up ensures that you feel awakened, refreshed, and ready to take on the day. Try to avoid a bath, since this may instead relax you and put you back to sleep. Use a fresh shower gel or soap to help you wake up and smell great throughout the day. If you're washing your hair, use quality products and take time to massage them properly into your scalp.

, When you get out of the shower, wash your face thoroughly. If you use a cleanser, make sure to rub it in with gentle, circular motions. You can also use a skin soap, or even plain water, as both are healthy and good for your skin. Rinse your face thoroughly, then pat it dry, don't rub it. Afterwards, take a quality moisturizer suited for your skin type and apply the right amount to your face. Use a body moisturizer or cream to moisturize your whole body. After showering, your pores will be open, and moisturizing is more effective.

, Get dressed in the clothes you put out the night before. Make sure that everything's clean and in good quality-no stains or tears. Try to be quick while you're dressing, as this gives you more time.

, If you have to wear a school uniform and it's strict, bend the rules. Wear a necklace, bracelets, rings, etc. Try wearing a long sleeved shirt of a different colour underneath your uniform shirt, or leggings underneath your school skirt. If you can wear anything you want, simply add in jewelry to complete your look.

, Dry your hair if you've washed it, using an ordinary hair dryer or a blow dryer; your choice. When your hair is dry, style it. Try to choose a style that will stay in during the day, and that looks good but is still relatively simple. Some good styles include:

The regular ponytail-a simple ponytail at the back of your head. You can blow dry or straighten your hair, use ribbons and bands, or leave outside bangs to customize this look.






A side pony-this works well for all types of hair. If your hair is wavy, leave it in a loose, flowing side pony underneath or next to your ear. If you have curly hair, a side pony resting next to your neck looks good. If you have straight hair, you can either pull the side pony high, to the middle of your head or low.






A messy bun-simply twist your hair up and leave the ends out to fall messily over the bun. This look, when done correctly, stays in all day, is simple but still looks very attractive.






Half up, half down. Pull a small section of hair at the top of your head into a ponytail. You can leave it in a ponytail or turn it into a mini messy bun. Then leave the rest of your hair loose. This works perfectly on straight hair.







, You don't have to wear makeup; if you feel confident, simply stay plain. However, if you wear makeup daily and can't live without it, then you can still wear it. Try not to use too much. A foundation and concealer will help cover up any blemishes in your skin, and a bronzer or blusher is optional, but can give your cheeks an appealing flush. Eyeliner looks good either thick or subtle, and if you want, you can use mascara to lengthen your lashes. Lip gloss will help you maintain healthy glowing lips. Try not to cake on too much makeup, especially with concealer and foundation.

, If you're stuck with uniform shoes, try customizing them with subtle but cool shoelaces. You can also try wearing black ballet flats or mary janes-a lot of girls at private schools get away with this easily. If you're free to wear whatever you want, pick shoes that are comfortable and sensible, but also match or add flair to your outfit. Converse or ballet flats go with almost anything.

You are now ready for picture day!",How to Look Great on Picture Day," This will improve your complexion. Use a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. You should start this anywhere between one to two weeks before picture day.;
, You can find something to wear that you already own, but buying something new is always fun. Make sure you select a shirt in a color that looks good on you. There are a couple of ways to figure out which colors look best on you:


Ask your parents or friends which colors they think look best on you.
If you get a lot of compliments when you're wearing a specific color, it probably means that it flatters your skin tone and hair. Remember that in most pictures all that matters is the top you are wearing.

,, Practice the style that you have in mind to ensure that it's easy to do and that it looks nice. For a sleek look, flat-iron your hair. For a cute look, pull back the top layer of your hair into a ponytail and secure it with a bow or barrette. Make sure you don't put all of your hair into a tight ponytail, or you'll end up looking bald. Straighten your hair, alternatively, and let it loose but don't allow it to cover your face and eyes.

, Don't overdo it, especially with foundation. Stick to your basic regiment, but add a few special details. Try wearing gold eyeshadow, curling your eyelashes, and wearing sparkly lip-gloss (if you have braces, try a matte, natural lipstick instead).

, Figure out what smile looks best on you. Try closed and open-mouthed smiles. For a natural open mouth, smile, push the tops of your back teeth with your tongue.

, Make sure to keep your smile natural. Hopefully, it goes well!

Have a sense of humor.",How to Turn Heads," Color is incredibly important in making an immediate impression. Colors like grey or beige have a tendency to make you part of the background, so wear them sparingly, or with a more exciting color.The color that turns heads more than anything other is red. You can make a big color statement by wearing a red dress, or go for a little more toned-down and wear red lipstick, a red sweater, or a scarf.
Jewel tones are also good for garnering attention. If you can, try to match one to a shade in your eyes so that it makes your eyes stand out. Purple and green are good colors to try out (although not necessarily together).;
, Highlighting more than one good asset (like wearing skin-tight everything) has a tendency to make you seem like you're trying too hard to get attention. You may get attention, but it won't be the same as turning heads.


Pick one thing to emphasize. For example: if you want to emphasize your gorgeous legs you might wear a short skirt, a pair of tall boots and a sweater on top. This way anyone's gaze is drawn to your legs.
Soft, touchable fabrics (like cashmere or soft suede) can help to highlight your best body parts. They drape more easily and draw the eye to your silhouette rather than each individual part of you.

, Not only is an interesting accessory a good way to capture people's attention, it also presents a good conversation piece. You want to try to find something that's unique and flattering to you.If you're a crafty person you could make something: a scarf with a really interesting and intricate pattern, gorgeous jewelry, even clothes.
You could also look in vintage shops, and local artist bazaars. You're certain to find unique pieces and you'll be supporting your local economy!

, Of course no one ever looks perfect, but you can make yourself look good by making sure your clothes fit you properly. Again, clothing that's too tight makes you look lumpy, and it screams that you want attention. Clothing that's too loose makes you look like you don't want any attention at all.


Wearing the right bra can make a huge difference to your appearance and to your comfort level. The best thing that you can do is get measured by a professional. There are some things that you should watch out for. The right bra won't leave red marks, or uncomfortably squeeze you anywhere.
You want to make sure that even things like jeans fit you properly. Don't just buy any old jeans that seem close enough. Hold out for ones that don't pinch around your waistband and that have the right length (or are easily hemmed to have the right length).

, There's nothing more noticeable than the state of your hair. Studies have shown that people are typically attracted to shinier, more lustrous hair, because it's a sign of health. Make sure you are regularly washing and conditioning your hair.People notice high volume hair in particular. Give yourself a shot of confidence with a bit of a bouffant look that will draw the eye.
There's also some studies that say that people tend to be more attracted to longer hair. So if you've got longer hair, let it curl over your shoulders rather than tucking it out of sight in a bun or ponytail., One of the main things people notice first about someone is their skin. Healthy, glowing skin is attractive to people and more likely to catch their notice than skin that hasn't been taken care of.


Eat right. You'll want to eat a lot of vegetables and fruits (the dark leafy greens like kale tend to be the best, as well as berries like blueberries). Make sure that you get at least five portions of vegetables and fruits each day, emphasis on the vegetables.The health of your digestive tract also has an important effect on the health and clarity of your skin. Make sure that you're getting plenty of probiotics to help regulate your digestive tract. You can get this through sugar-free yogurt (good to eat with blueberries!).
Exercise can also help improve your skin, because it can reduce stress (something that can have a negative impact on your skin) and can increase your blood flow, leading to a healthier glow., Since people tend to rate others as more attractive if they have whiter teeth, you want to make sure that yours look healthy. White teeth can be seen as an indication that you effectively groom yourself and that you're healthy.Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss them at least once per day. Brushing and flossing will keep your teeth in good repair and help you to avoid cavities.

Try whitening your teeth safely by using over-the-counter treatments, if you can't afford to have a professional whiten your teeth. While it doesn't necessarily contribute to the health of your teeth it makes them seem like they're healthy and cared for.

, Lips are another thing that people unconsciously notice about you. This means that you want them looking good and cared for, and as plump and kissable as possible.


Make sure that you keep them moisturized. Drink lots of water and apply lip balm when they're feeling dry. Get the kind with sunscreen to protect them from the sun.
Avoid licking your lips because this can aid in drying them out. If they're dry or uncomfortable, keep applying lip balm.
Put a little color in them. The perfect way to catch people's attention is to rouge up your lips. You can wear tinted lip balm or you can put on some bright red, ""look at me"" lipstick, over your lip balm.

, There's nothing like makeup to enhance your already delightful face. If you're trying to turn heads then you don't want to just stick to the typical ""natural"" look or even just go for smokey eye. Obviously a little red lipstick will help you out here, but there are some other ideas, as well.



Try out flirty, sparkly eye make-up. Eye make-up that catches the light and sparkles is a sure way to make people look. It also makes you seem a bit daring, which will further intrigue those around you.
Colorful nails can also create an exciting impression. Try out something brightly colored to catch the eye, or an interesting pattern that makes people look closer. Always try to keep your nails nicely maintained and clean, because people will register that, if only subconsciously.

, The thing about turning people's heads is that it matters very little whether you are the most attractive person ever, or whether you have the best wardrobe. If you aren't confident about yourself, then you're unlikely to attract the attention you desire.


Walk tall. You want to exude confidence by the way you walk and sit. Act as if you have a string that is attached to your chest and gently pulling you upright. Not only will this make you walk more confidently, but it'll show off your chest as well.
Cultivate poise in the way that you move. You don't want to strut like a supermodel, or be in a hurry. Avoid slamming doors, running, or clomping your feet on the ground.

, You can't wholly get rid of negative thinking, unfortunately, but you can make it so that it doesn't take over your life. Consistently thinking negatively about yourself will determine how other people think about you, too.Pay attention to how you think about yourself. Do you have a tendency to think things like ""No one is ever going to notice me"" or ""I'll never be attractive enough to turn heads?""
Once you've determined some of your negative thought patterns, it's time to replace them with the positive, or at least with the neutral. For example: if you think ""No one is ever going to notice me,"" replace that with ""My new red boots are fabulous; I'm sure other people will think so, too.""
Don't compare yourself to others. This is a truly futile move, because someone else is always going to get more attention than you, be more attractive, have more admirers, and so on. Work on being confident in yourself and not worrying how you compare to other people.
This will take a little time and a little paying attention to achieve. You won't be able to defeat all your negative thoughts in a single day, but by giving it a little time and gradually working on your though processes, you'll find that you're thinking less negatively about yourself, and so will other people.

, Striding straight forward without a look at anyone works for people like supermodels and actresses. If you want people to notice you, you have to act like you're interested in other people and are open to them noticing you.


Smile at people. This flashes those pearly-whites of yours (important for drawing attention) and it shows that you're noticing other people.
Make eye contact with people. This makes it so that you're impossible to ignore as you enter a room.

, This may seem like a strange step, but it's one that a lot of people, especially women, get hung up on. They desire the attention, but once they get it, they have a tendency to curl up into themselves or start feeling awkward.


Turning heads is about keeping the momentum rolling. Once some people have started to notice you, if you let that propel you forward, rather than getting self-conscious and retreating, you'll find that you'll get more attention.

, People are attracted to good humor and to laughter, which is contagious. It's also a good way to connect with other people. This doesn't mean that you need to be a laughing loon, but cultivating some humor goes a long way towards getting attention.


Example: if you're at a party you might consider telling a funny, and true, anecdote. Perhaps you got lost trying to get to a party, perhaps your cat left cat hair all over the dress you were intending on wearing to the party. Telling something like this is funny because it is true and it helps to humanize you.
This will also help keep you from being embarrassed if things don't quite go as planned (your heel breaks while you're confidently striding into the room, or you run into something).

Straightening hair only takes a few minutes, and as long as it’s not too humid outside, it will save you the trouble of having to constantly check for frizz, kinks and sloppy waves. Simply straighten your hair in small sections from root to tip, seal the deal with a little hairspray and go confidently forth.If you have a lot of thick, curly hair, straightening will take longer and may be more difficult.
Straightening can make an excellent fallback plan on unsalvageable bad hair days. If all else fails, just straighten it out.;
, For a more bouncy, playful look, curl your hair into sweeping waves of tight ringlets. Curling your hair can be time consuming, so make sure you get started early enough to allow plenty of time. One good thing about curling is that you can get as tight or as loose a spiral as you want, allowing for a more customized look. Curled hair also has the appearance of being thick, full and voluminous.You can decide how you want your curls to look by changing your curling technique. For tight curls, use a higher heat and leave the hair wrapped around the curler longer. For more relaxed curls or waves, use a low heat and only curl the middle portion of the hair briefly., Sometimes you just don’t want to mess with a head full of hair first thing in the morning. On days like these, just pull your hair back into a ponytail or bun and be done with it. High ponytails and intentionally messy loose buns are actually in style, so you’ll be able to pull off a fashionable look with minimal effort.Even though it doesn’t require a lot of work, pulling your hair back still gives you many options to choose from.

, If you want to look a little more put together than a basic ponytail or braid but don’t want to spend hours styling, arrange your hair neatly into a braid. An ordinary plait or rope braid, or more sophisticated French, Dutch or fishtail style, will be all you need on low-maintenance mornings. You’ll look classy and put-together, and, best of all, once it’s braided it will hold tight, meaning you won’t have to worry about messing it up throughout the course of your day.Braiding is quick, and can be done as soon as you get out of the shower.
If you don’t know how to braid your own hair, have a friend do it for you when you get to school.

, Girls with short hair have lots of options for when they want to look good for school. After washing and conditioning your hair, sweep it to one side in a neat, sleek part, or work in a little styling product and comb it up to achieve some spiky height with a modern flourish. A traditional pixie-style cut will give you a mature look without a lot of work. Undercuts, bobs and wavy curls are also popular choices for ladies with short to mid-length hair.Find a style that works for your specific hair length, texture and face shape.
Short hairstyles can save you a lot of time showering and getting ready in the morning., Take advantage of the natural body of extremely curly or afro-textured hair. Natural hair lends itself to many different fun styles. Longer hair can be plaited, moisturized and ironed for gorgeous ringlets or simply shaken free for maximum volume. If you have shorter hair, you might choose to twist it into sections or wear it like a close-cropped perm.

Comb your hair to tame it.,
Part your hair to one side.,
Wear your hair messy for an edgy look.,
Allow curly or shaggy hair to air dry.,
Shave it off.",How to Style Your Hair for School2," For most guys, a quick once-over with a comb after getting out of the shower in the morning is all they’ll need to keep short hair under control. Pay particular attention to cowlicks and flyaways, and use a little mousse, gel or pomade to smooth problem areas. A few quick swipes and you’ll be ready to head out the door.A quick and painless combing can do the trick for guys with fairly straight, easy to style hair, but it may not be enough to get other hair types, textures and lengths looking good.

, Hair that is slightly longer has a tendency to lay in a certain orientation, and when your hair starts going in different directions, you have a disaster on your hands. Prevent that tousled bedhead by neatly parting your hair down one side. Just wet a comb, or use a nickel-sized dab of pomade, to keep hair slick, smooth and looking sharp.Part your hair in the direction it tends to lay naturally.
The parted, slicked hairstyle on men was popular with classic movie stars, and has made a comeback in recent years.

, Perhaps you prefer to look a little rough around the edges. If this is the case, make sure you’re doing it right. Work a little gel or pomade into your locks and brush, shake and pull like a madman until they look perfectly disordered. Using a product will help hold your hair in place so it doesn’t go from intentionally messy to unintentionally chaotic.A little messiness goes equally well with casual or dressier outfits, and will tell people that you’re the confident, carefree type.

, Guys with wild hair should avoid brushing or messing with their locks too much after showering. Too much dry-styling can cause longer hair to become frizzy and stick out. Instead, let your hair air dry so that it keeps its natural shape and make sure you use a strong conditioner to give it some extra weight and moisture. Brush your hair lightly with your fingers when you need to make adjustments.Blow drying and brushing removes moisture from hair and breaks up natural curls.Leave-in conditioners and other moisturizing products are available for guys with dry, uncontrollable hair.

, This is the equivalent of pulling your hair back for guys. Don’t feel like bothering with styling your hair anymore? Just buzz it off. Problem solved! Your morning routine will be no-maintenance from now on, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be short on style. Try out a fade or military-esque crew cut to get a clean, tidy look that requires little to no work and goes with almost anything.Hair can be buzzed to different lengths, giving you more options.
You should only shave your head if you're confident that you can pull it off. Most people have no idea how they'd look with no hair, or the condition of their scalp underneath, and once you it's gone it'll be too late to change your mind.

Clean and condition your hair regularly.,
Brush your hair to eliminate tangles.,
Avoid excessive heat.,
Style hair with products made from natural ingredients.",How to Style Your Hair for School3," Wash your hair thoroughly every time you bathe, or every other time, if you have especially dry or damaged hair. Shampoo first and rinse completely, then apply conditioner and allow it to sit for a few minutes. Work the lather into your scalp to wash away dirt and oil, and condition the shaft down to the tips. Use hair products that contain healthy vitamins, proteins and oils so that your hair will stay strong and healthy.Washing your hair too much can also damage it. Your hair needs a light coating of natural oils, so consider only shampooing every other day (or even every two days for those with curly, frizzy hair) and use a little conditioner on the ends in the meantime.Cleansing conditioners and natural shampoos that make use of essential oils can also get your hair clean without drying it out.

, Invest in a good soft-bristled brush or wide-toothed comb and use it often. Combing and brushing rids hair of pesky knots and tangles, which can cause damage if left untreated. If you want the kind of smooth, flowing, silky hair you see on your favorite celebrities, you should make frequent brushing a hair care priority.Brush your hair before you shower to prevent it from being poofy once it dries.
Choose a brush that works best for your hair type and the style you’re trying to achieve., Too much straightening, curling and blow drying robs your hair of its natural moisture and leads to breakage. Use these styling techniques sparingly, and make sure to protect your hair with heat-treatment products when you do. If you usually blow dry your hair, start using a medium or low heat setting instead of turning it on full blast. It will take longer, but you’ll have luxurious hair to show for it.Use quick, smooth strokes when straightening, and low heat when curling, to minimize the damage that the heat does to your hair.
Pulling your hair back too tight, wearing a hat all day or spending a lot of time in the sun can also be bad for your hair., Just like heat, the chemical agents in certain hair products can strip and damage healthy hair. Look for shampoos, hairsprays, styling aids and other products that are organic or water-based and don’t contain harsh chemicals. These are much better for your hair and scalp, and are becoming less expensive and easier to find as the popularity of natural hygiene products increases.Check the label before you buy a particular hair product to see if it’s made with natural ingredients.

Consider what is meant by Prince Charming.,
Remember, you are not a princess--and frankly, that is a good thing.,
Figure out who Prince Charming is to you.,
Create your own joy and source of fulfillment.,
Stop waiting around to be rescued.,
Enjoy your friendships.,
Look after your own resources and needs before all else.,
Map out what you really want out of a relationship.,
Have a good laugh about the whole Prince Charming thing.,
Remember that Prince Charming comes.....after everything else.",How to Stop Waiting for Prince Charming," Who is this guy, anyway? Ever notice that ""Prince Charming"" shows up in several fairy tales? It is true! (Note: Disney movies do not count. These stories pre-date movies by centuries.) Unlike main characters like Snow White, Prince Charming tends to be poorly described and has a rather shallow role. Fairy tales such as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty tend to bring in ""Prince Charming"" last minute and within a sentence or two live happily ever after. But other than that, we do not hear much about what he is like.


Do you really want a husband that is handsome, wealthy, but otherwise not noteworthy?
Is he in many princess stories? If he is, does that mean he was unfaithful to one or more princesses?;
, Being a princess in the Middle Ages was not easy, and came with a lot of restrictions and not a lot of power. For example:


Your one real function was typically as a pawn for your father to build alliances through marriage. What you thought about any future spouses was not a factor. Whether your betrothed turned out to be 6 months old or 60 years old was likely immaterial.
You were likely monitored every moment, and not allowed any boyfriends.
You could be forced into a convent. Noble females who were not married off for some reason were often placed in abbeys. It did not matter if this was something you wanted. Your parents could have you live in a convent your entire life.
Assassinations were a popular political move. This could mean your life could be at risk if politics are against you.
You may not live a life of luxury as you expect. The modern standard of living is so much higher than in the Middle Ages, we forget that we almost all live like royalty by comparison. The average princess in Europe did not have flush toilets, chocolate, ibuprofen, cell phones, ice cream, and so on. Forget about modern medicine, too.
Your father, mother, brother (if he was your guardian), or husband could legally beat you. You could not own your own property in most European countries. You could not divorce if you were in a bad marriage.
You had very little control over your destiny. There were remarkable princesses throughout history who did rise above conventions of the day. However, your life by and largely determined by your birth and sex, and not by your desires, skills, ambitions, athleticism, or anything else. Your fate was typically determined either by your father or husband who who had complete authority over you.

, For quite a few romantically inclined girls and women, Prince Charming is the idealized male who will take you away to his castle, fulfill your every need, and otherwise live ""happily ever after"". He by nature will handsome, and be focused solely on you.


Prince Charming, by nature is supposed to be ""perfect"". There is nothing wrong with fantasizing a bit about being loved by an idealized man. However, the danger is that this impossible dream can blind you to reality. You may miss out on great romances if you hold every potential future mate to an impossibly high standard. You may also be terribly unfair, expecting your partner to expect nothing from you, when relationships require give and take.
Being wealthy is a great goal, but few of us will achieve that. However, wealth does not guarantee happiness. Also, by pining for someone to provide for you financially, you may miss the fact that you can shift for yourself. You do not have to have someone do it for you.
Prince Charming is a figure that rescues the princess, rather than the princess saving herself. Although the princess has to endure hardship, and do things to get herself out of the situation, it is ultimately Prince Charming that does it for her in the end. Cinderella for instance, has to wait for the prince to put on the glass slipper. This is a very old message that tells girls to wait in silence rather than be proactive.

, Prince Charming isn't the answer to your lackluster life. You're responsible for your own entertainment, your own hobbies, your own enjoyment in life. A woman who is able to demonstrate to a potential mate that she's got it all sorted out and is happily self-responsible is a very attractive prospect for a relationship because the man isn't likely to feel he has to be her reason for being. Seeing it from this perspective can be very useful as it clarifies that guys can be scared away from a needy, ill-defined personality with few dreams or goals in life. Unless that is, you'd like to live with a control freak...

, Getting yourself out of your situation is hard work. It is easier to be passive and just hope someone notices your worth and comes to rescue you. But success and happiness tends to favor those who work hard and capitalize on whatever qualities they have.


Do you want a career? If so, start planning it out in stages and let your dreams run wild about where you want to be at certain stages of your life. Learn the skills necessary for achieving this, whether it is getting into law school or starting at poetry slams at the coffeehouse.
Do you want to be a full-time mom? And you still need to be well-rounded, happy, and resourceful for the sake of your own sense of fulfillment and for the happiness of your family. Simply sitting around counting down the days and years until Prince Charming appears will cause this to be your only option rather than a self-directed choice, so at least consider doing some part-time work or volunteering to keep yourself involved in society and to give yourself broader chances of finding Mr. Right.

, Friends are an important part of a fulfilled life and people with friends tend to feel less loneliness and alienation. By spending time with your friends, you are building solid connections for the long-term, hopefully even for life, with people who will always be there for you through thick and thin. Including after Prince Charming has been... and gone... Spend time doing fun things with your friends and be there for them, listening to them and caring about their concerns and needs as much as your own.


For all you know, Prince Charming is attracted by a woman surrounded by friends. And that has to be a match made in heaven because a guy who embraces your friends from the very start is indeed charming.
Don't neglect your guy friends. They are equally as important as your girlfriends. Not only can you learn a lot by hanging around them and asking the questions you don't think appropriate to ask your girlfriends, but you get to see a very different perspective of love, romance, and all that mushy stuff that might just help to balance your unrealistic expectations a little. And you never know whether Prince Charming is hiding out among your best friends.

, Many girls continue to hold a belief that they will marry well and that this will take care of all the financial nitty-gritty in their lives so that they don't have to face up to planning finances with great clarity into their future.This head-in-the sand approach is fantasizing and leaves you vulnerable to poor financial choices that can impoverish you. When Prince Charming either fails to materialize or does appear but isn't the wealthy benefactor able to take care of you in the way you've hoped, then things start looking grim. Over one-third to two-thirds of women in the 35 to 55 age bracket right now will be impoverished by the age of 70, with many women having to stay in the workforce until at least the age of 74 as a result of inadequate financial savings and pension coverage.Plan your personal savings and financial future as clearly and in as detailed a fashion as a man would do without question, and as someone who does give a care about her own financial needs down the track. This is not Prince Charming's role, it's totally yours. So, while you're waiting around for Prince Charming, establish the rules and boundaries about taking good financial care of you and decide now how you will ensure that this financial independence is sustained even after you've tied the knot.

, Think about how you will manage to practice ""positive illusions"" for years to come when your Prince Charming's personal habits start to grate on your nerves and yours on his but you still wish to remain content together and overlook the things that inevitably change...Maintaining your independence and space are important parts of having a successful long-term relationship with another person.


Think about the realities beyond the Prince Charming myth and how these make you feel. Comforted? Scared? Worried? Reassured? Write down the ways that you can tackle anything that concerns you in an independent way, so that when Prince Charming does arrive, he's a bonus, not a savior.

, Women are sold a bit of a myth when it comes to the whole Prince Charming concept but instead of seeing this in negative terms, it's a fantastic opportunity to teach yourself about having perspective, to think critically about the social tales fed to women, and to learn to have a sense of humor about something that can sometimes be taken a little too seriously. Prince Charming makes for great novels written by bored authors sitting alongside a chocolate box and he's a fantastic source of mid-afternoon dreaming on a lazy summer's day but really, wake up! Think about how this perspective serves you as a modern woman. Does it, really? Is this romantic vision likely to keep you happy and secure into your old age, or will you be happier and more secure focusing on being resourceful and capable yourself, regardless of what life throws at you?


Start imagining Prince Charming as a part of your humor repertoire; something you pull out when you want to make your girlfriends laugh or to cheer yourself up a bit about the dry spells between relationships but don't see it as anything too serious.
There really is no such thing as a ""Prince Charming."" There is no perfect man, just as there is no perfect woman. Saying that you will only choose ""perfect men"" can be a cop-out. It can make you avoid having to deal with the fact that your boyfriend is not perfect. It is easier sometimes just to get so picky that you overlook what is in front of you.

, Life goes on regardless of whether or not you've found Prince Charming, lost Prince Charming, or have had Prince Charming turn into a couch potato frog before your very eyes. Understanding as soon as possible that life is more than the sum of your Prince Charming dream will liberate you to expect a lot more from life and a lot less from Prince Charming. So, what are you waiting for? Life beckons...

Curl your hair.,
Define your natural curls.,
Straighten your hair.",How to Do Cute Middle School Hairstyles2," If you have naturally straight hair, this can be a great way to achieve a soft, romantic wavy look.


While your curling iron heats up, use a large clip to secure the top layer of your hair on top of your head. Starting at the back of your head, gather a small amount of hair and wrap it around the curling iron. Make sure that the wand is pointed down toward the floor.
Hold each piece of hair around the curling iron, and then release. After you finish the bottom layer of your hair, simply take out your clip and start curling pieces from the top section of your hair.
When you curl the pieces of hair near your face, curl them in the opposite direction of your face so that they won’t fall into your eyes.After you’ve finished curling, gently run your fingers through your hair to make it look more natural. Spritz with hairspray to keep it in place. This is a great style for hanging out with you friends on the weekends, and you’re sure to get plenty of compliments.
If you don’t own a curling wand or are usually rushed before school in the morning but still want wavy hair, use the braid method. When your hair is still damp at night, braid it into as many simple braids as you like. The more you braid, the tighter your waves will be. Sleep on these braids. Take them out in the morning, and run your fingers through your newly wavy hair., If you have naturally curly hair, you might simply want to define your curls so that they are sleek and distinct. This is a good every day routine for school.









When your hair is still damp, comb through it and apply a gel or a mousse. If you have thinner hair opt for a mousse, as it is lighter, but if you have thicker hair, you might want to go for a gel because it offers more hold.Use your fingers to help shape unruly ringlets.
Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer. If you use a diffuser, turn your head over, and push the diffuser up against your hair. The diffuser will help define your curls without making them frizzy.
Consider finishing with a styling spray meant to add shine and tame frizz, or just use a regular lightweight hairspray for a little bit of hold.

, Straight hair can be a nice change, and give you a sleek, polished look. If you have naturally curly hair, this is good way to go for a completely different look, but if you have almost straight hair, it can make you look a little more put together.


Before you start to use your flat iron, prep your hair. While it’s still damp, apply a heat protectant mousse or spray, and then blow dry your hair.If your flat iron has multiple heat settings, know which you should use based on your hair type: fine hair (250-300 degrees), average hair (300-350 degrees), or thick hair (350-400 degrees).
Section your hair with clips or bands, and straighten the bottom layer first. Start about half an inch from your roots, and pull the iron down your hair at an even, slow pace. This is more effective than multiple quick strokes. Leaving a bit of hair unstraightened at your roots will help it to keep some of its volume.
After you have finished, use a small mirror you can hold to view the back of your head in the mirror on your wall. Make sure you haven’t missed any spots.
Straightening your hair can be a great way to make a drastic different in your school look.

Choose a style and stick to it.,
Get in good shape.",How to Look Cool in School1," It’s cool to be creative and have your own style. Don’t go overboard. You don’t want people to think you look like a crazy person, but you can develop a style that suits you. If you don’t have a uniform at school trying wearing something a bit out there. People will think that it’s good if you’re confident about wearing it. For example, if you have to wear a button down shirt for your uniform why don't you try wearing a brightly colored one? Or a tie with strange designs?;
, This will help you look stylish during the day. If you’re rushing to find something to wear in the morning you might end up looking a bit more sloppy than you intended.

, Don’t stick with the haircut your mom gave you as a little kid. Try to find a hair style that you like and ask a hair stylist to cut your hair to look that way. You can even show them hair styles that famous actresses or actors have and ask them to copy that. , If you look good with sunglasses, wear them! The same goes for necklaces, or watches, or anything else. You have to judge what works for your particular outfit and style.

, If you have to wear a uniform at your school then you probably have a relatively strict set of parameters you have to follow. Still, you can alter this style in a way that suits you. Maybe you can wear a button down shirt with a flamboyant color or a particular tie. If you’re a girl you can wear dresses with different patterns or that fit you differently. Try to take some liberties with the uniform without getting in trouble. People will think it’s cool that you’re willing to challenge the rules anyways. , You don’t want your outfit to be all over the place. Try to find a style that appeals to you and then change it to fit your personality as you see fit. Maybe you like the alternative style of converse and corduroys.


For example, maybe you prefer wearing basketball shoes and a baggy sweatshirt. These are styles that work well together, and there are many more to choose from. Don’t try to look like everyone else, but use certain styles as potential guidelines. , Unfortunately, if you’re really out of shape it’s a little harder to pull off the cool persona. That’s not to say you can’t do it, and you certainly don’t need to have a six-pack. However, most people are more attracted to fit people.


For example, try incorporating aerobic exercise like running or biking into your routine.

Walk confidently.,
Smile.,
Don't always sit up straight.,
Lean up against things.",How to Look Cool in School2," If you're a guy walk with your chest out a little bit, not in a ridiculous way, but in a way that makes you look power. Keep your eyes up and your chin up. This is a confident walk and will make you look cool.

, Don’t mix up being cool with being aloof. You can be extremely friendly and mysterious at the same time. You don’t need to constantly reveal things about yourself. Just be friendly to those around you! Smile and wave at people in the hallway. The more that people know you, the more cool people will think you are. If you smile at people, they’ll want to get to know you.

, You're not in the military, relax a little bit. It's considered nerdy to have a perfect posture all the time. Slouch in your desk and put your feet out in front of you. You don't have to do this all the time, but it will help you look nonchalant. If you really want to take it to the next level you can put your hands behind your head too.

Don’t try too hard.,
Be confident.,
Try to laugh and remain lighthearted.,
Don’t be afraid to break the rules.,
Take an interest in others.,
Act modestly and excel quietly.",How to Look Cool in School3," This is huge. If it seems like you really want to be perceived as cool, no one will think you’re cool. Just try to stay low key. This is hard, but you can do it. For example, don't act too excited when you get invited to a party you really want to go too. Just say something like ""that sounds good man. See you there.""

, Don’t act like you worry about what other people think. Confidence can make any type of style or personality look cool. People are attracted to those who are unselfconscious and genuine.

For example, don't worry about breaking the uniform or being late to class now and then.

, If you want to make friends and seem cool, you have to be interested in other people. Don’t get caught up in your ego or your aura. It’s all well and good to try to be mysterious, but you should also want to get to know your peers. If you have a good conversation with someone, they will probably tell your friends that you are a cool person. Don’t shut any doors. Be willing to have conversations with any type of person.


For example, don't be afraid to have conversations with kids on the football team as well as kids who do theater. The more people who like you, the cooler you'll be.

, Being quietly very good at something is a classic characteristic of a cool kid. People will notice that you’re good at it, and if you don’t brag they will think you’re really cool as well. It doesn’t matter if you’re good at something if you talk about it all the time. Excelling at something is a very important part of being cool.

Play a sport.,
Excel at an instrument.,
Join a club or organization.",How to Look Cool in School4," Almost everyone thinks playing a sport is cool. However, just being on the basketball or football team doesn’t immediately make you cool. You have to earn peoples respect by being good at it. Make sure you practice your talent. It’s not cool to sit on the bench the whole time.


Physical sports are often considered cooler.

, Find and instrument and learn to play it! Once you get better you can join a band or start your own. People will think this is very cool, and you can even play in concerts or at your school’s talent show.


For example, try taking up guitar! Many people think guitar is cool.

, Find something that you’re passionate about and join the club. If you’re really into politics, you can join your schools political society. Try getting into student government. People will think you’re cool if you are active and involved in the school community. Making your face known is a huge part of being cool. Being an active member of a club could help you accomplish that.


For example, if you're in student government or the class president that's a great way for people to think you're cool.

You can either take a shower the night before or the morning of – but if you take a shower at night, you have a few more minutes of sleep in the morning.


You don’t have to wash your hair every day. People with drier, coarser, thicker hair can get away with showering it once or twice a week. But ‘’do’’ wash your body every day to stay smelling fresh, especially if you regularly exercise.;
, Put everything you need in your book bag the night before. This way you can concentrate on very looking good in the morning and don’t have to worry about running around finding your books and homework.


If you have to bring a lunch tomorrow, prepare it the night before, too. But don’t put that in your backpack – you can keep that in the fridge.
If there's something that has to be left out (say an art project that has to finish drying), make yourself a note and leave it on top of your backpack to remind yourself in the morning that it hasn't been packed yet.

, Find an item that you really like such as a shirt, shoes, a belt, a necklace, or even socks. Center your outfit around that item, and piece it together to make it look good. Hang it in a special place or leave it close to your bed. When you wake up, you don't have to rush picking out an outfit in the morning.


If you wear a uniform, make sure it is ironed and hung up in your closet. You do not want your clothes to look wrinkled and worn.

, You should get at least eight hours of sleep every night so you look good ‘’and’’ get good grades. Plan your day out so you can get a full night of sleep.


Everybody needs a different amount of sleep, but most people fall into the 7 to 10 hour category. In fact, the average teen needs a whopping 9 1/4 hours of sleep to feel rested.Aim for that number as much as possible.

, Resist the urge to snooze for just a few more minutes. Instead, go to the restroom and splash some water on your face to wake you up In fact, recent research says that hitting the snooze button can make you ‘’more’’ tired.Avoid it if you can – it'll make you run late anyway.


Give yourself 5 or 10 minutes more than what you think you need. This way if you’re running behind, you’re still on time. It’s the worst feeling to be rushed in the morning and feel like you don’t have enough time to do what you need to get done.

, Brush your bottom and top teeth in a circular or up and down motion for a solid minute. Don’t forget to brush your tongue to prevent bad breath, too.


Flossing and mouthwash not only kill bacteria, but they keep your breath smelling good for longer, too. If you eat breakfast early, consider gargling with mouthwash afterward to be extra fresh for school.

, To spot-treat and cover your new breakouts, use a concealer that is made especially to hide and diminish acne.


Experiment with how often you need to wash your face. For some people, two or three times is helpful. For others, once is as often as they can without drying out their faces.
Also, only use oil-free skin products. Coconut, olive, and tea tree are the three oils that will help your skin. The rest, like mineral, will clog your pores and cause you to break out.

, This could be showering, shaving, applying deodorant, lotion and/or perfume – whatever your routine is. Maybe brushing your hair, applying a little lip gloss? It doesn’t have to be anything fancy.


Try to keep everything to a minimum – natural is always best. This goes for everything from hair gel to eyeliner. Especially for school – save the crazy beauty routines for going out at night.

, Good thing you have that outfit all ready! Now all you have to do is slip it on and you’re set!


Take a look in the mirror to make sure you weren't going crazy the night before. Does your outfit look as good as you thought it would? Excellent.

, Do you have gym class today? Then it might be best just to brush your hair and do something basic with it. If it’s a lazier day, take the time to straighten or curl it.


If you want straight hair, dry your hair while combing it with a flat brush. You may want to actually straighten it with thermal spray and a flat iron, also.
If you want curly hair, skip the blow dryer, put some curling gel in your hair and scrunch. You could also try ""plopping"" your hair, which will dry it sufficiently and curl it at the same time.

, Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It should be something substantial, like eggs or ham (in other words, not a doughnut). It will give you the energy you need for the day.


If you don't have the time, grab something (like a cup of yogurt or a handful of trail mix) on the way out.

, Most girls look best with a natural look – a bit of concealer, blush, mascara, and a touch of lipgloss. If you’re worried about not wearing enough, bring those pieces with you so you can reapply at lunchtime.


This could be part of your beauty routine, too, but the later you do it, the longer it'll last at school. If nothing else, just reapply some lip gloss and you're good to go.

, Don't forget to pick a few pieces to add to your outfit. However, stick to a couple of main colors and an accent color – you don't want to look like a clown with a lot of colors. The rule is put everything on and then take one thing off.


Alternatively, stick to the either/or rule. You can either wear a necklace or a bracelet, for example. Wearing too many accessories easily becomes overkill. They distract from each other, too. If you're wearing just a necklace, it'll pop more than if you're wearing a necklace, earrings, and a bracelet.

, Is everything in your backpack? How’s the hair? Matching socks? Do you have extra clothes for gym? A sweater if it gets cold? A hair tie? Headphones? Check, check, and check? Then you're ready and looking good, for sure.


If looking good is a top priority for you, keep a small bag in your backpack full of supplies. A brush, a small bottle of hair gel/spray, and anything else you think you may need.

, For your base, use concealer/powder/foundation if you want to, but use very little, putting too much on will make you look strange. A tinted moisturizer, with a little color ( to always match yours) is ideal. Use a few flicks of mascara on your eyelashes, soft lip balm to keep your lips smooth and lipgloss for a gorgeous shine. Use eyeliner and shadow ( light, though) for a more noticeable statement. These looks are all very natural but equally amazing!

Assess your plans for the day.,
Choose clothes that fit well and feel comfortable.,
Accessorize based on your outfit and the day’s activities.",How to Look Good for High School1," When preparing to look good for school, it's important to think about how you're going to spend your day and plan ahead. Your ""look"" for the day may need to be tailored for specific details.


If it's a school day, does your school have a dress code? Will you be outdoors or indoors? What is the weather like? Do you need to layer for temperature changes?
A presentation, evening event, science lab, or extracurricular activity could also affect what you choose to wear that day.;
, You look better and happier when you are comfortable. Throughout high school you are still growing, so always make sure you have enough clothes that fit. Make sure your clothes are clean and that they match. If you do not feel confident in matching, here are some easy hacks for matching:


Don’t mix patterns. Don’t wear a checkered skirt/shorts and a striped top. Instead, wear a solid bottom with the striped top, and save the checkered bottoms for an outfit with a solid top. Too many patterns can give you a dizzying appearance! Try to stick with just one pattern.
When in doubt, stick with neutral tones and one color. Neutrals include black, white, navy, brown, and grey. Just about everything matches these neutrals! It may sound boring, but you can make your one color and big and bold as you want without worrying about matching. , On a school day where you are going to write a lot, you may not want a chunky bracelet that's going to make a lot of noise on your desk. You can pick jewelry, a watch, a purse, a scarf, a hat, or any other accessories you may want to wear that day. When thinking about jewelry, gold and silver are always safe bets if you are concerned about matching. Again, keep in mind any dress codes you may be violating. You don't want to style your hair for a hat, only to have to take it off!

You don’t need to spend a fortune to get cute clothing.;
, When you're rubbing sleep from your eyes and dashing to catch the bus, you won’t have time to play around with outfit ideas. Instead, lay out your clothes the night before. You can spend the time before bed trying on different combinations, checking out your angles in the mirror, and finding the perfect accessories. This will help you have a stress-free morning.This also will help you avoid any unexpected wardrobe malfunctions. If you have to dress up for a class presentation, you don’t want to discover a stain on your favorite dress that morning. By finding an issue that night before, you can at least find a great back up!

, This is especially helpful for anyone with a very strict school dress code or uniform. If you can’t do much with your clothing, work with accessories. A fun pair of shoes, a new bracelet, or a great pair of glasses can transform your whole look, and self-esteem, for the day. The same outfit can look completely different simply by pairing it with a scarf, statement necklace, or fun belt.You can find great accessories for low prices at places like Target or Walmart. If you shop at cheaper places, you can get more pieces to add a ton of variety to your wardrobe.

, A quick search of “school outfit ideas” will turn up more results than you’ll know what to do with.

, Unless you’re superwoman, you probably don’t have the time or patience to curl, tease, or blow out your hair every morning. That’s OK! Find a routine that works with your schedule. If you prefer showering at night, figure out a way to tame the bedhead easily in the morning. If you like showering in the morning, you could play around with wet hairstyles to save time blow-drying. And if you are a morning person, you can style your hair however you want in the morning!It’s helpful to have a quick “go-to” hairstyle that you like. You can watch easy and fast hair tutorials on YouTube to get some ideas. Buns, braided pigtails, and ponytails are all easy, quick, and can look super cute.

, School isn’t a fashion show, so there’s no need to whip out the fake lashes and bright red lipstick. Some schools might not even allow this. Instead, focus on simply enhancing your natural beauty.Most importantly, find a makeup routine that makes you feel the best and most comfortable in your skin. Confidence is the cutest thing you can wear.


It is completely your choice to wear makeup to school or not. If makeup is not something you want to add to your morning routine, that’s understandable! Whatever makes you feel most confident will make you look the most beautiful.

, The sleepiest of mornings can be disguised with a little bit of mascara. By lengthening, thickening, and darkening your lashes, you will make your eyes appear bigger and more open.It only takes a couple of seconds and voila! It looks like you woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.


Dip your mascara wand into the product, and make sure that the wand is evenly coated. Start at the base of your lashes and apply the mascara to the tips, wiggling the wand slightly as you go to avoid clumping.
If you want, you can apply multiple coats for extra volume.

, By adding just a stroke of product to the apples of your cheeks, you can make a huge difference. These products will make your complexion glow. They can also give definition to your face by creating the illusion of cheekbones.Adding a bit of sun-kissed color to your face can take you from drab to fab in an instant.

, Between homework, studying, extracurriculars, social lives, and family obligations, it’s often hard to do this. Whenever you are able, try hard to get enough sleep. Not only will you feel better, but you’ll look better as well. A lack of sleep can cause bags under the eyes and dull-looking skin. Aside from that, who wants to get dolled up when they only slept for a few hours? Sleep is an important beauty secret that people often forget.

, The cutest outfit won’t be able to cover-up body odor or greasy hair. Though it seems like obvious, make time to shower regularly and always wear deodorant. Don’t skip brushing your teeth to save time, and never underestimate a good face washing in the morning. It’s much easier to look cute at school if you’re clean and polished.


Don’t try to cover up a couple days of missed showers by going crazy with the body spray or perfume. It won’t fool anyone, and it can actually be distracting and gross in the close quarters of a classroom.
Bring a toothbrush to brush your teeth after lunch. It won’t take long to run to the bathroom and do this, and fresh breath is always cute.

, Just like with sleep deprivation, a poor diet and dehydration can make your skin look pale and dull. Additionally, a poor diet can make you lethargic and unmotivated. Make sure you’re eating a balanced diet and getting enough water. Not only will this work to your advantage physically, but it’ll make you feel better as well.Try to “eat the rainbow.” Fill your plates with colorful fruits and veggies, and you’ll be more likely to get the nutrients and vitamins that your body craves.
Don’t deprive yourself of special treats. Eating healthy is good for the body, but the occasional treat is good for the soul.

, Remember you’re beautiful, and try your best to exude that confidence. If you head to class in athletic clothes without a stitch of makeup, you can look glamorous if you feel glamorous. Although it’s a cliché, happiness is truly an attractive quality. Love yourself and what you have to offer, and you already look cute!"

Brush your hair thoroughly in the morning to get rid of any tangles.,
Assess what activities you will be doing that day, and plan your hairstyle accordingly.,
Don’t overdo the products.",How to Look Good for High School2," No matter how you plan on styling your hair, it needs to start out brushed! This not only immediately makes your hair look better, but also makes it easier to style.

If you have an event that day where you need to look particularly nice, plan to style your hair appropriately.

, Regardless of what products you are using, keep in mind that they are meant to supplement the natural beauty of your hair. Use the products you need to make your hair stay in place, but not so much that your hair appears greasy or too stiff.

Tend to unwanted body hair.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.",How to Look Good for High School3," Take a shower once a day using soap all over the body. Shampoo should be applied to your hair at least once a week. This shower should be in addition to any showers you take after gym class or any sports you participate in.

, Even if you don’t believe you will be participating in any strenuous activity, apply deodorant each morning. They make sprays, gels, and solids in a variety of scents!

, For boys, that means shaving or trimming the face consistently to avoid an unkempt beard. (If you haven't had the need to shave yet, you can skip this step!) For girls, that means shaving or waxing the underarms and legs.

, Dentists recommend brushing your teeth before you go to bed and in the morning after breakfast (or when you wake up, if you don’t eat breakfast). You should always use a toothpaste that contains fluoride, and don’t forget to floss! "

Decide whether you want to wear perfume or cologne.,
Apply makeup if you’d like.,
Get organized!,
Smile!",How to Look Good for High School4," There are many options, from light body sprays to the stronger perfumes and colognes. Fragrances smell slightly different on every person, so make sure you’ve tried yours on ahead of time to ensure you like the way it smells on you.


Keep in mind that strong fragrances bother some people, so keep in light if you decide to go this route.
You may choose to skip it altogether if you are going to be very active that day, or if you will be in tight quarters with people.
Another reason you may skip this step is if your deodorant is scented. You don't want too many competing scents. Perfume and cologne are totally optional!

, This is also optional, but makes some people feel more confident. There are many different kinds of makeup you can try, and the options can be overwhelming if you don’t use makeup often. Just try different products until you find the ones you feel the best in.


If you decide to wear make up, try to keep it looking natural and refrain from applying too many colors or products on the same day.
Always apply makeup on a clean face and remember to wash it off at the end of the day.

, Keep your backpack and purse (if applicable) tidy. You could have the best outfit and hair in school, but fumbling around with crumpled papers and items falling out of your bag could make you appear disheveled.

, You look great and you are totally ready for school. Go get ‘em!

Wash your face.,
Moisturize and don't forget sunscreen.,
Use a lip balm or moisturizer.,
Cover any blemishes.",How to Look Beautiful at School1," This is especially important if you have acne-prone skin. Start with a mild cleanser and gently rub it over your skin. Rinse with warm water and gently pat your face dry with a microfiber cloth.Wash your face 2 to 3 times a day, especially if you have oily skin. Washing your face will remove extra oil and dead skin cells, helping your skin look rejuvenated.;
, Immediately after washing your face, you should apply a moisturizing lotion. Avoid moisturizers containing oil, if your skin is already oily. Lotion will help lock moisture into your skin, making it appear hydrated.Always apply a sunscreen with an SPF of around 30.You can also find moisturizers that contain sunscreen. These will help prevent sun damage and wrinkling down the road.

, Even if you're sporting an all natural look, you'll need to keep your lips hydrated. Consider using a lip balm or transparent gloss. While they don't necessarily have to contain pigment or color, they'll keep your lips looking soft and healthy.

, While you may not want to cover your entire face with foundation or makeup, you might have some pimples or blemishes that you'd like to cover. Use a foundation or concealer stick to gently dab at the pimples or blemishes. Then, use your finger to gently blend it into the surrounding area.Avoid choosing a red-based concealer to cover red pimples or blemishes; it will be harder to conceal. Instead, look for a yellow or green-based foundation to counteract red problem areas.

Neutral colored clothes should be your bread and butter. Also, as a rule of thumb, primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) and complementary colors (orange and blue, green and red etc...) always go well together. Nearby colors like indigo and purple harmonize nicely too. Mix and match colors until you find an outfit that pleases the eye.


Remember to match the color of your shoes to the color of your outfit.
Blue jeans match everything.
If you're feeling daring, try an eye-catching monochrome look like an all red outfit.;
, The easiest way to look good is to wear well-fitted clothes. Your clothes shouldn't be baggy or skin-tight. They should flatter your body type.


There's no need to guess. Measure your pant size and remember it.
Try on clothes before you buy them. A medium in one brand may be a large in another. If you can, avoid ordering online so you're certain of the fit.

, If you're wearing a fancy button-down shirt, try to match it with nice khakis. Avoid sneakers with a classy outfit and go for something more like black, leather loafers. Similarly, if you want to go with something more casual, make sure you whole outfit is casual. All your clothes should work together. Or in other words, nothing should stand out.

, Depending on your school's dress code, add necklaces, bracelets, belts, sunglasses etc... into the mix. This adds depth to your look. If you're wearing neutral colors, use your accessory as an accent. A bright blue necklace or red shoelaces can bring otherwise drab clothing to life.


Don't overdo it. Too many accessories can make it look like you're trying too hard. Aim for one or two matching accessories per outfit.
Don't over match your accessories. If you're wearing a mainly blue outfit, avoid blue accessories.
You can match the color of your accessory to one of the understated colors of your outfit. A hint of red on your shirt and red earrings go very well together.
Accessories are a good way to express yourself. A crazy scarf or unique hat makes for an intriguing look.

, If you wear orange stripes and green polka dots with two different jackets, your look is too loud. It's better to err on the side of simple and elegant than complex and busy. From there, you can accent your outfit with trendy shoes, bright accessories, or an interesting hairdo.


On the other hand, if you just wear a t-shirt and jeans every day your style will get old. Try to find a reasonable middle ground.

, Mix in the occasional sundress and skirt for variety. Accessories are essential. Pay close attention to how your accessories and shoes interact with your outfit. Play around with your accessories until you find combinations that work.


Match your necklace to the length of your neckline.
Jean shorts and tank tops are a fashionable look for girls. Make sure you comply with your school's dress code, though.
Layer with jackets and undershirts to add more color and depth to your outfit.
Sweaters generally look great on girls.
Apply a light layer of makeup. Makeup is a good way to bring out the natural beauty in your face.
Other than your lipstick, makeup shouldn't be noticeable.

, Styles change, but collared shirts will always look good on boys. You can match easily with blue jeans and a light jacket. Wear a nice belt and matching shoes to round out your style.


T-shirts are a basic but perfectly acceptable look.
You can experiment more with colors once it's warmer and you can wear shorts. Colored and patterned shorts are very fashionable, especially if they match your outfit.
When it's colder, layer with a light jacket, overcoat, hat, and scarf. Make sure all those elements are working together.
Sweaters are a timeless look for boys too.

, Don't wear the same clothes every day. Change your style and adapt to fashion trends. Using these general rules, play with your outfits and create a style all your own!

, Wrinkled clothes don't make for a good look. Crisp and smooth clothing is far more fashionable. If you take the time to properly store your clothes, you'll instantly look better dressed.


Nicer clothes like button-downs and blouses should be ironed before they're worn.
Organize your wardrobe to make putting together an outfit quick and easy.

, It doesn't matter how good your hygiene is; if your clothes smell bad, you'll smell bad too. Don't wear t-shirts more than once, and only wear pants that you know aren't dirty.


Use a scented detergent so your clothes naturally smell good. Though if you have eczema or chemical sensitivities, avoid fragrances and scents as they can irritate skin.

, It's a good idea to carry around a lint roller and instant stain remover. Be careful not to spill on white clothes. If you have P.E. or an outdoor field trip, bring a change of clothes.

, Your shoes aren't just functional. They're an important part of your outfit. You can clean your shoes when they start to get brown, and if you can't see their original color anymore, it's time to buy new shoes.


Be careful not to wear white shoes in grass or mud.
If it's raining, wear boots or shoes you don't mind getting dirty.

, Take care of your uniform by washing it and ironing it frequently. Keep it away from any pets and keep it dry if it's raining.


You have less room to express your style with a uniform, but you can still make differentiate yourself with accessories and unique hair style.

, Find a shampoo and conditioner that's right for you. Wash it daily to maintain healthy hair. Then, brush and comb your hair how you like it.


Blow dry your hair if it's long.

, Do some research on hair styles and find one that suits your tastes and your hair type. You aren't stuck with the style you have. Put some thought into your hair and make it look how you want it.


Find a quality hair salon nearby. Ask the stylist's advice and build a relationship with them. Specific hair cuts are better than generic ones.
For girls, hair ties and braids are your friend. You don't have time to do your hair up every day. Put your hair in a bun or ponytail for an easy hair style.
For boys, short buzz cuts are safe. If you grow it out, make sure to comb and part your hair appropriately.

, Exercise three or four times a week. If you aren't on a sports team, make time for physical activity. This will help you maintain a healthy body type.


You don't have to go to the gym to stay in shape. Go for a bike ride. Try yoga. Play basketball with your friends.
Don't stress about your body type. A healthy lifestyle and consistent physical activity will get you the body you want.

, Know your skin type. If you have oily skin, use an oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, use moisturizer rich in essential oils to revitalize it. A little attention to your skin can go a long way.

, Wake up early and use the morning for hygiene. You should wash your hair thoroughly and clean your whole body with soap or body wash. If you have facial hair or excessive leg hair, you can also shave in the shower.


If you have longer hair you should condition it too.
You can also shower at night before bed.

, After a hot shower, your pores open up. This is the perfect time to wash your face. Apply a gentle face soap to clean your skin. Then, dry your face with a soft towel.


If you have acne problems, make sure your face wash fights acne and oil too.

, White teeth and fresh breath are central to your cleanliness. Make sure to brush for at least two minutes and floss once a day.


It's a good idea to carry breath mints or gum to freshen up during the school day.
Mouthwash helps too.

, Not only should you smell clean, you should actively smell pleasant. Before you leave for school, put on the deodorant or perfume of your choice.


Don't put too much on or it will be overpowering.
If you have the tendency to sweat, make sure your deodorant is an antiperspirant too.

Keep it simple.,
Apply blush.,
Focus on your eyes.,
Wear a cute lip gloss or lipstick.",How to Look Beautiful at School2," If you choose to wear makeup at school, you'll want to stick to a quick and natural look. Start with a freshly washed face and apply a light foundation or tinted moisturizer all over to even out your skin tone.Don't choose heavy cakey foundations, since they'll wrinkle and crease throughout the day. Instead, stick with light coverage and a light dusting of powder.

, Pick a light pink or peach color, whatever will show up best on your skin tone, and apply it to the apples of your cheeks.


Look for a blush that matches the color of your cheeks after you've been exercising., Simply fill in your brows to accentuate your natural brow line. Then apply eye shadow in a neutral or natural shade. If you choose to wear eye liner, pick a dark brown, navy, or rose gold shade, depending on what works with your skin tone.Stark black liner may look too harsh for school. Finish your eye makeup with a swipe of mascara.


Avoid wearing dark or metallic eye shadows which are better suited for evening or weekend looks., If you want to keep it on the simpler more natural side, pick a peach or pink lip gloss that you'll be able to easily reapply throughout the day. You can also choose a richer lipstick, but don't choose something too dark. Save darker and metallic colors for parties or the weekend.

Blot oil off of your face.,
Apply a face mist or moisturizer.,
Consider using an all-over makeup stick.,
Freshen up your lipstick or lip gloss.,
Avoid reapplying mascara.",How to Look Beautiful at School3," Even if you start with a freshly washed face and apply minimal makeup, oil will accumulate on your face, making it shiny by the end of the day. To keep the shine to a minimum, pack some oil blotting papers in your backpack or locker. Take a minute and gently blot them over your face to remove excess oil.Most oil blotting papers are designed to leave your makeup intact.

, If you choose to go the no-makeup route, you might enjoy brightening your skin in the middle of the day. Simply spray a face mist to hydrate your skin or apply moisturizer to give it a little glow.


Some face mists are antibacterial which can help fight acne., Several makeup sticks provide all-in-one coverage, so you can freshen up your eye makeup, lip color, and cheeks, all with one product., Lip gloss or lipstick is often one of the first things to wear off, so reapply it throughout the day. If you're short on time, keep a tiny mirror in your backpack and apply it while walking to your next class.

, Think twice before adding another swipe of mascara. It will start looking caked on and dull. Instead, add a layer of clear mascara which will add a glossy shine to your existing mascara, without adding weight to your lashes.You can also add a tight line of eyeliner in any color to give a little boost to tired eyes."

Keep it messy.,
Pull your hair into a top knot.,
Braid your hair.,
Pull your hair into a ponytail.",How to Look Beautiful at School4," If you're running short on time in the morning, keep your bed head hair. Wet your fingers with water and run them through your hair, focusing on any frizzy spots.You can stop there, leaving your hair loose, or you can pull it up into a messy bun.


If your hair is shoulder length or shorter, keep it loose. The messy bun will only work if your hair is long enough to quickly pull back, without resorting to pinning it up.

, This works with best if your hair has a lot of volume. Blow dry your hair to create extra volume, then comb it up onto the top of your head. Make a ponytail at the top of your head. Take the tail and wrap it around the elastic band that's securing the ponytail. Secure the knot with hair pins.You can also braid the ponytail before wrapping it into the knot, for a more finished look., You have lots of options when it comes to braiding your hair. Create one braid that falls straight down the back of your head, or one that angles across the side of your neck. If you have time or straight hair, create a sleek braid for a put-together look. Or keep the braid chunky and loose, with tendrils tugging out of the braid., If you're short on time, simply throw your hair up into a loose, messy ponytail. If you have more time, consider a sleek and styled ponytail. Wear it on the top of your head, low towards the nape of your neck, or off to the side."

Pick out the clothes the night before and make sure they are wrinkle free and make sure the right shoes, boots or sandals go with the outfit.",How to Look Awesome for School," Not every night; it will dry out your hair. Washing your hair at night is suggested. If you do it in the morning, you will be forced to use heat on it, which will damage it! Showers are very important because the will make you feel fresh and clean.;
, However, don't wash your face too much; it will dry up and cause acne!

Figure out what products you need for your face. Different products help for different issues. I suggest having facial soap, astringent, a good facial scrub, and a light facial lotion.







, This will also boost your confidence. It can be fun to exercise! You just need to find something you like, and make sure that you change it up every once in a while. Healthy food can be delicious, with the right spices and stuff. For example, doesn't grilled chicken covered in minced onion sound appetizing?

, Brush it out once a day, and make sure you don't use too much heat of product. If you must use heat, put some conditioning protection on your hair first. If you'd like to, wear your hair in a crazy but pretty style every now and then (it's the style that looks ""cool"" right now). This will sure get you some attention!

, This will make your teeth nice and your breath fresh.

, Never wear the same outfit two days in a row, especially shirts. Try to have a good variety of clothes. If not spice up your look, or wash those clothes everyday .If you wear uniforms, you can wear them two days in a row, if the uniform is clean. Nobody will notice. Just spray on a pretty scent, and you're good to go.

, Set your alarm clock about an hour or two before you need to leave for school. Sometimes by chance you may wake up late so get your stuff ready the night before. This means picking out your outfit the night before, putting your homework in your book bag, and putting whatever you need to bring to school at the door.

, If you're a boy, use cologne. If you're a girl, use good smelling perfume. But too much cologne or perfume can be overbearing.

, Have a tube of lip gloss, and some concealer in your backpack or purse. Put either a pink or tan blush on your cheeks and nose. Put a tiny bit of mascara on your eyelashes, top and bottom (only top makes the eyes appear smaller), but not too much. If you want to, use a little bit of eyeliner,make it heavier for maybe a punk, emo, or Gothic look. Make a fine line if you want to look conservative.

,,, If you need new clothes, look through stores such as Forever 21, Abercrombie and Fitch, Justice (for Elementary School girls), Hollister, Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, Delias, H&M, A'Gaci, Wet Seal, Papaya, and PacSun. If you want to look unique from the rest of the crowd at school, try boutiques or second-hand stores such as Plato's Closet or Goodwill. If you're creative enough, go through your local thrift shop to see what you can do with stashes of vintage clothes. Different clothes that are pretty are sure to get you some compliments!

Be clean.,
Get your beauty sleep the day before.,
Care for your hair.,
Apply makeup.,
Dress nicely.,
Be nice.",How to Look Awesome at School (for Girls)," Nobody likes a stinker. Take daily showers and cleanse your face twice a day with moisturizers. Brush your teeth twice each and every day and wear nice perfume (be 100% sure it works on you, since not all perfumes smell the same on certain people than what they do when you sniff it from the bottle) Wear deodorant, too.;
, Sleep at least 10 hours , otherwise you'll wake up looking like a raccoon. Make sure you wash your face at night and the next morning, so you look fresh and clean and so your skin doesn't look oily.

,



Wash it every other day, because shampoo dries it too much if used daily. If you do this and your hair becomes oily, choose a different shampoo/conditioner or wash daily. Make sure that you don't fall asleep at night with wet hair, because it's really unhealthy for it and that could make you really sick. Get a haircut you really like, and trim your hair once a month to keep it that way and to prevent split-ends. Buy spray that makes your hair shine, but don't use too many products on it because it can cause dandruff and it could even fall out. Don't iron it too much, because this will dry your hair out. If you don't have a lot of hair but want it, check with your doctor to make sure it's safe for you and take one folic acid pill once a day, which you can buy at your local Walmart.

Brush your hair really well, maybe a little blow-drying. Don't straighten it, though. This will damage your hair. Many girls do it everyday and later on, they struggle to grow it back to the way it was before they started straightening.

, Apply some concealer, foundation, mascara, blush and chapstick. Some people choose to wear chapstick instead of lip gloss because it smells good and it also makes your lips shine. The mascara will open up your eyes and make you look effortlessly fresh.


Wear light eye shadow, a little eyeliner, and mascara. If needed, wear lip gloss. Lipstick only looks good on some people, and it makes your lips feel sticky. Don't over-do it. You will look like a poser. Also, not all girls need make-up, so if it makes you look flimsy, don't use it.

, If you wear a uniform, pull your skirt up a little bit, so you look cute and stand out. Make sure you iron your uniform the day before so you look clean cut. Simple and clean cut means elegant, and most girls that don't worry about that just look messy and trashy.


If you don't wear a uniform, never wear the same outfit more than once every two weeks. You could wear the same shirt twice in that time period, but not the same shoes/bottoms with it. Make sure you have cute hair clips and/or headbands, and wear cute bracelets, earrings and necklaces. Don't be afraid to shop at stores where no one else is shopping. You could find really cute things that could make your look unique, so that no one else copies you, make sure to say ""I forgot"" or ""my aunt bought it for me"" when someone asks where you got it. If you have uniforms at your school, find your way through them. Buy the cutest belt you see, wear shoes that stand out, and wear accessories.

, Be very polite, but stand up for yourself and your friends. Also, don't be quiet and shy, just be confident. Make good grades, study hard, don't do anything stupid, and make good friends. Don't roll your eyes or gossip about a person for no reason. If someone is bothering you, just ignore that person. You have a life to live, and you don't have time to argue with someone. Just laugh and walk away. Wear clothes in your comfort zone so that you'll look relaxed. Everyone will love how effortlessly cool you are.

Before you start school, have a day for your headmaster or someone to show you where all your classrooms are.,
Also, ask the school if they could set you up with a buddy on your first day so they can tell you who's nice and who's not - it's best to have someone show you the ropes!

",How to Fit in at a New School for Teenage Girls1," While they're doing that, look at all the other girls in the class and see what type of clothes they're wearing. Depending on the school, you may be required to wear a uniform. Usually, it's a choice between skirts or trousers. If your new school requires a uniform, try to choose similar clothing styles as the other girls. However, if your school doesn't require a uniform, just go for your own style but avoid breaking the school dress code (ex: high skirts will get you in trouble).

, If you have more of a bob, deep-part your hair and make a simple three-strand braid with your bangs. Use a small elastic to tie off the end of the braid, and use bobby pins to tuck the braid under the hair on the side of your head opposite your part, right above your ear., Short, wavy hair lends itself well to mini-braids. Create tiny two- and three-strand braids from the hair around your bangs, even if you can only do a few twists with each braid. Next, pull the braids back and tuck them into your waves for a fun look.To make sure they stay put, pin the braids back with bobby pins.

, Emphasize your bob's natural waves by loosely wrapping a few dry strands around a curling iron for a few seconds, then spritzing a wave-defining product on your hair.

Add a touch of spray wax or pomade on your fingers and run it through your hair for definition., Short, curly hair can be tricky to work with, so sometimes, the best thing you can do is let it take its natural course.

, If your hair is less pixie, more short bob, this is a cute, easy look to pull off for short curly hair. Create a very deep side part by placing the part right above where your eyebrow ends., Create a rounded part on the front of your hair using an afro comb. Starting from the left side of the front part, take a piece of hair and twist it over towards the right. Pin the end of the strand into your hair, and comb back the rest of your hair.To finish off the look, pin the remaining strands onto the back of your head with additional bobby pins.

, Open up a rectangular silk scarf and align the middle part with the back of your head. Tie the scarf once right above your forehead, and tighten it backwards until the knot is sitting about one to two inches behind your forehead. Tie the scarf once more, securing it at the back of your head. Before tying the scarf, spritz moisturizer your hair to keep it from getting frizzy.
All your hair should be above the scarf when you tie above your forehead.
After you first tie the scarf, be sure to smooth out its back so it doesn’t look crumpled.
Tuck in any of the scarf's loose ends to keep the 'do looking neat.

Secure the braid with a hair tie or elastic.
When you're starting the braid, the smaller the piece of hair that you take the better.

, If your hair has that rough but cute second-day hair texture, just pull it back into a loose pony at the nape of your neck. Next, pull out pieces of hair from the pony so they frame your face for a soft, casual look.


Spritz your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to make sure your hair stays in place.

, Start by shampooing and conditioning your hair the night before. Part your hair however you prefer, and divide it into four sections.

Pull it through a styling donut until the donut rest at the base, and wrap the ponytail around the donut, securing it with bobby pins.If you'd like, you can pull some strands loose around your face for a softer look.

, When your hair is still damp, apply a volume-boosting product to the roots and use a rattail comb on your roots to boost the volume even more. Diffuse or air dry your hair.If you don’t mind a little frizz, you can gently backcomb pieces of your hair all around your head. Don’t go overboard and tease your whole ‘do, though.

, Curly hair already has all the texture it needs to stand out, so you don't need to do much. Wet your hair in the morning and apply a leave-in conditioner while it’s still damp. Comb through the conditioner with a wide-tooth comb, and let your hair air-dry.Once your hair is dry, don’t touch it - doing so will just create frizz.

, Gather a 2-inch section of hair from the front of your head and create a two-strand braid with it. Curl the end of the twist and secure it with a bobby pin.

You can take a thin strand of hair from the underside of the pony and wrap it around the elastic so that the tie is not visible.
Brush out flyaways by spraying a toothbrush with hairspray and running it with a front-to-back motion across your hair.

, Twirl the hair that frames your face into two chunks. Pull them and the rest of your hair back into a pony at the nape of your neck. Take the top layer of the pony and pull it through the elastic.

Repeat the pattern until you run out of hair.Secure the end of the French braid with a small elastic.

, Wash your hair, apply your typical hair products, and air dry it. Section your hair into two horizontal parts. Pull the lower part into a low pony and gather the top of your hair back into a somewhat loose pony to help maintain volume.The trick with this style is to leave your hair slightly loose rather than tightly pulled back. This will give it an effortless, casual feel.
For greater volume, create a deep side part at the top of your hair to allow for more poof.

, Open a cotton towel on a counter or a table, and place your head down against the towel, with all your curls on top of your head. Put the towel over your head to the nape of your neck, and twist the sides of the towel. Pin it in rolls on the back of your head to your head and them your hair sit for 20 minutes.Make sure to start with hair that's still wet. You can apply a mousse or cream if you like.
After air-drying, part your hair at the highest point of your eyebrow. Finger-comb your curls to the appropriate side of your head., Pull your hair up into a ponytail at the top of your head. Put small elastics every inch or so along the entire length of the tail. Pull on each “hair bubble” gently to increase the poof.If it’s easier, you may want to flip your head downwards to create the original ponytail.

, Run a curl control or curl hold cream through your hair after showering. Set your blow dryer on medium and use the diffuser attachment to gently dry your hair. Spray on a medium-hold hairspray to keep your look intact throughout the day.

, Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and apply a nourishing oil, such as coconut or olive oil. If your hair is especially dry, you might want to apply both a water-based leave-in conditioner and then a naturally-occurring oil to seal in the moisture.A leave-in conditioner with nourishing oils can also work well.
Sleep with a satin pillowcase or cap to preserve the moisture.

, Part your hair where you want the cornrow to start, and create a small, traditional 3-strand braid with the first section of hair. Continue to braid, adding more small strands to the middle section of the braid, until you reach the end. Secure the braid, and repeat until your whole head is braided.


With this hairstyle, you’ll only have to wash your hair every few days. You might even be able to get away with once weekly., Part the front section of your hair, and create five or six mini-twists with the hair from that front part. Move the twists upward and gather the ends on top of your head. Twirl that section of hair into a knot, then secure it atop your head with bobby pins or a colorful elastic.Start by moisturizing your hair with oil and a leave-in conditioner so your locks are more manageable.

The night before you start school, make sure your schoolbag is prepared and that everything you need is in it.,
Next, check tomorrow's weather so that you are aware of the temperature and what type of clothing you should wear.,
Your hairstyle doesn't need to be fancy; it can just be your favorite.,
Set your alarm clock at an appropriate time to wake up, keeping in mind that it isn't healthy to wake up too early or late.,
Memorize your schedule.,
Be sure any forms or applications that require your parents' signature and/or yours have been filled out and completed.",How to Fit in at a New School for Teenage Girls2," Write a list of what you'll need and set out your schoolbag's contents on the floor, checking every item off the list as you place it in your bag. To ensure you have a good start at your new school, you'll need to make sure you are organized and prepared for the classes. After your schoolbag is prepared, set it by your door so that you don't forget to grab it on your way out! Items that you may want to consider adding to your schoolbag's inventory are:


A small box of pencils, pens, highlighters, and other writing utensils that you may need
Notebook paper
Folders for each class (to keep your notes, homework, tests, etc. in it)
A binder (to organize your folders, notes, and any other papers you may receive)
Pencil sharpener (some schools' pencil sharpeners don't work very well)
Lead (for any mechanical pencils you're using)
School books
Notebooks (easier to take more organized notes with than notebook paper)
Planner (to write down any homework assignments);
, Choose what outfit and hairstyle you plan to wear the next day so that you have more time to prepare. Suggestions for outfits:


Wear a comfortable outfit that defines who you are, not what you want others to think of you. It doesn't need to be anything fancy, but you must dress decently in order to avoid looking sloppy. However, refrain from dressing smartly (ex: tucked in shirt, tight pants) or formally. You want people to be comfortable. Also, choose colors that complement you and bring out your eyes and skin tone.






Make sure your outfit will not violate your school's dress code if it has one. Read all the rules so that you are knowledgeable of what is and what is not acceptable. It's best to do this in order to avoid feeling humiliated about your outfit on your first day at your new school!






Avoid adding too many accessories to your outfit, as you will look overloaded and not so great. Add only one accessory to your outfit. If you choose to wear more than one, follow the famous rule: remove one item before walking out the door.






Be confident in your outfit. If you appear confident while wearing your clothes, people will like it better than if you appear insecure about your clothes.

, It's best to wash your hair the night before school so that you have attractive, good-smelling hair! However, refrain from wearing the same hairstyle every single day, as this gives people the impression that you have no variety.


If you have a favorite hairstyle, don't be afraid to change it. Perhaps you could even spice it up a little, such as adding a braid in appropriate areas that won't make your hair look awkward. Slip in a cute headband or hair accessory.







, Remember that you'll need enough time to prepare in the morning, so wake up a little earlier than usual for more time.


If you find that you have problems getting up, set the alarm far away from your bed, but in a place where you can still hear it. When the alarm rings, you'll be forced to get up.
For an extra boost of needed energy to encourage you to start the day, massage your ears for two minutes, concentrating on the tips. Your eyes will instantly open up and you'll feel great! Plus, it's healthy for you and keeps the blood flowing to your brain.

, Although it may take you a while to be able to navigate around the school easily, it helps to know what classes you're going to have instead of having to look at your schedule after every class. If you're afraid you still won't be able to remember, keep your schedule in your pocket for reference so that you may be able to easily pull it out and glance at it.

, You'll want to leave a good first impression upon the school, so that they aren't behind because of your failure to turn in a form in time.

Make sure you wake up on time so that you will arrive at school on time.,
Before classes start, hand in any forms or applications to a staff member or ask a teacher for guidance.,
If you have time to socialize before class starts, do so with your new classmates.,
Before you start showing your true self, observe how others act.,
Smile and keep it soft and natural!,
Don't be afraid to start conversations with your new classmates, even if you aren't familiar with them.,
After you get to know people more, invite any new friends on outings after school so that you can get to know them better.,
Have fun and relax at your new school.",How to Fit in at a New School for Teenage Girls3," Extra bonus points if you can arrive at school early! It's best to get to school a little early so you have more time to get to know your classmates, ask any questions as needed and learn your way around the school before classes start. Plus, arriving early gives people a better impression of you - that you're almost always on time and you're ready to get the school day started - than it does when you walk in late, interrupting the class and the teacher.

, You don't want to forget to do this, so it's best to complete this task first thing when you arrive!

, Although it may be hard and perhaps even scary, avoid being shy or talking quietly. Speak in a clear, confident voice - it will raise people's opinion of you - but avoid sounding overly loud and obnoxious. It's fine to be a loud person, but there is a limit to how appropriate your loudness can be! Being shy will make it harder on everyone, especially you. People will start to simply ignore you and not even realize you're there!

, Note how things are done around in this school. Once you have all the information you need, you can start being your lovely self!


Putting on an act for everyone will soon get tiring, especially if you stay at this school for years. People are smart and will quickly catch on. Then, your reputation will be ruined and people will refuse to be your friend - no one likes a fake person!
Don't be afraid to let yourself shine! Just because the popular girls at your school have their own opinions doesn't mean you have to have the same as they do. They know nothing about you, and you don't have to let them push you down.

, Your smile is the best tool you have to attracting people; it will give you an irresistible glow that draws people to you. Show off those pearly whites, but avoid fake or strained smiles. Smile only when it's natural, or you'll come off as an annoying fake.

, Simply find something about them you can truly and comfortably compliment them on, but don't just leave it as that! Keep the conversation flowing! For example: ""I like your shoes. Where did you get them?"" or ""I love your hair! How did you get it like that?""


Never let awkward silences be the case. Since you don't know anything about your classmate, ask them a few casual questions that are appropriate to talk about. People often enjoy talking about themselves, but remember they don't do it endlessly!
Don't forget to tell them a little about yourself as well.
If your classmates appear to be snappy or bossy, don't worry about it or think that they dislike you (unless if it's really obvious). They may be like that all the time, but really, they have a nice personality underneath. Don't give up on them!
If there particular people you soon find that you dislike, never show any signs of hostility or disdain towards them. Act neutral towards anyone else that isn't your friend, no matter who the person is. This way, no one can say that you truly are mean to them. Plus, the whole class will start looking up to you!

, Don't turn down any offers that any of your classmates give you to meet outside of school, as this is your chance to know them and secure friendships.

, You'll be fine as long as you show your true self in appropriate ways!


Avoid showing the bad qualities of your personality. Focus on the good qualities, but don't be proud and refuse to acknowledge your flaws!

"
"
Avoid straining to be someone who you're definitely not.,
Don't push the school rules.,
Refrain from gossiping or talking behind other people's backs, as this will ruin your reputation and make your year come off as a bad start!,
Avoid interrupting people while they're talking, or their opinion of you will be lowered.,
Avoid coming off as snobby, overly confident or vain, as this will push people away instead of attracting them.",How to Fit in at a New School for Teenage Girls4," Right now is your chance to start fresh and be yourself, since you're in a completely new group of people who don't know anything about you. No one knows what your true personality is, and it's important that you're who you want to be. That way, your personality will attract the right friends, not the wrong friends.

, While you and several others may think it's cool and that it will earn you more respect, others will laugh and your reputation will be lowered if you get in trouble. Plus, it's a bad start off to a new year and you'll be horribly humiliated. It's best to play it safe and follow all the rules, no matter how long you stay at this school!

, You have no idea what your classmates really are like yet, so refrain from judging them right away. Also, you'll want to avoid making enemies. Be nice and sensitive about other people's feelings.

, No one likes to be interrupted while they're in the middle of speaking! Find an appropriate pause to slip in your comment or part of the conversation, but make sure the speaker isn't just taking a breath!

, Act modest but have some confidence in yourself. Confidence is the key to attracting friends, as people will look up to those who are confident in themselves.

Leave your hair natural.,
Make a quick low pony.,
Try a twisted bun.",How to Have a Simple Hairstyle for School2," Your hair may look good enough as it is in the morning, allowing you to forego washing it, especially if you have short hair. Instead, apply your favorite styling serum, put on your trusted headband or hair clip, and dash out the door.


If you have curly, frizzy hair, spray a diluted version of the serum in your locks to avoid weighing them down.
To avoid greasy or frizzy hair, shampoo every 2 to 3 days, use a conditioner specifically designed for your hair type every day, and apply weekly or bi-monthly moisturizing masks.
Your hair will look best if you get it trimmed every 6-12 weeks, use a low heat setting when drying your hair or let it air-dry, and apply nourishing hair oils when the ends are dry., If you have medium to long hair, try a basic low pony for neat, polished hair. Brush your hair back, and calm frizz and flyaways with a smoothing serum. Pull your hair back tightly or slightly relaxed at the nape of your neck, and secure with an elastic for an easy, breezy 'do.For an even more put together but effortless look, take a strand from the base of your hair and wrap it around the elastic to hide it.

, Gather all your hair at the crown, using your non-dominant hand to hold it up. Twirl the entire length of your hair with your other hand, and then wrap it around itself at the crown of your head to form the bun. Use bobby pins or an elastic to secure it in place.


If you're having trouble forming the bun, it may help to create a ponytail at the crown of your head and secure it with an elastic. Wrap the length of the pony around the base to form the bun.

Wear headbands.,
Try hair clips or barrettes.,
Get creative with hair ties.,
Use ribbons.,
Adorn your hair with flowers.,
Revitalize hair with a spray.,
Use dry shampoo for greasiness.,
Apply molding paste to revamp hair volume.,
Combat dullness with shine.,
Avoid buildup with a scalp exfoliating treatment.,
Sleep on satin.",How to Have a Simple Hairstyle for School3," Headbands work well with all hair lengths and types. The key is to part your hair or comb it over, then slip on the headband ½ inch to one inch (between 1-2 cm) past your forehead. You can then push some strands under the band or keep it all swept back.


To make your look more striking, go for a patterned, sparkly, or knit headband.
You can also switch up your style by pulling your hair into a bun or a side braid after you’ve put the headband in place.

, Clips give you lots of easy, versatile options to work with for the school day. A big jaw clip can keep longer hair out of your face if styled into a bun or ponytail, while a pretty barrette can be used to tuck your hair behind your head.


If you have short hair, you can still use hair clips. For example, if you have bangs, you could part them to one side or swoop them up and secure them with cute mini claws.A banana barrette can be used to clip your ponytail vertically so that accessory is visible from the side.
Don’t forget the almighty bobby pins. They may get lost easily, but if you need to secure a bun, there’s no better choice.

, If you have medium or long hair, a cute hair tie can do wonders. Go for a non-slip grip tie so you don’t have to constantly re-do your updo. You can get a mixed pack so you can try different colors, or stick to a color that resembles that of your hair so the tie is less noticeable.For more of a fashion statement, pick up a hair tie that’s decorated with a flower or a gem, or choose a tie that has a patterned band.
Don’t use rubber bands in place of hair elastics - they’ll break your hair, not to mention it’ll be really painful to take them out., Wrap a ribbon around your head for a look that’s similar to a headband. Cap it off with a simple bow on top of or near your neck for an extra cute look. You could also weave a ribbon into a braid for a multi-colored, easy fashion statement.

, While a full-on flower crown may be better suited for Coachella than math class, you can still incorporate flowers into your everyday looks. Pick up a flower clip and place it to the side of your head. Or pin your hair to the side and tuck in a silk flower.Stick to medium-sized flowers for a school-appropriate look.
When using flowers, place them near hair pins so you don’t have too much going on at the same time.
Some headbands have flower detailing, so that’s a cute way to incorporate an element of nature into your school-day as well.

, You don’t have to wash your hair every single day. A quick and easy way to make unwashed hair look better is to fill a spray bottle with a few tablespoons of your favorite styling product mixed with equal parts water, shake it up, and spritz your hair all around.Washing your hair every two to three days can actually be better for your tresses than washing daily.Make this refresh spray on Sunday night so it’ll last you the entire week and you won’t have to worry about creating it in the morning.
Try not to go longer than 3 days without washing your hair.

, Dry shampoo removes most of the excess oil from your hair. It’s the perfect go-to if you wake up with greasier hair than you’d like. Apply the shampoo to the bottom layer of your hair, and avoid spraying it on top of your head because it can leave noticeable residue. If using a spray dry shampoo, spritz it at least 6 inches from your scalp to avoid heavy build-up.
Don’t fret if your hair looks white after applying the dry shampoo. Run your hands through your hair to distribute the product and get rid of the white cast.
Dry shampoo comes in two main forms: powders and sprays. Spray products are usually easier to control.

, Restore volume to your hair by applying flexible molding paste to the roots of your hair. It’ll polish your look and give your hair that slight oomph that it may be lacking.Warm thick hair paste between your fingers for a smooth application.Apply the molding paste to the bottom layers of your hair so it's not visible.
Dry shampoo can also restore the appearance of volume, so you can try that as well.

, To restore shine to your hair, apply one to two pea-sized drops of smoothing serum or oil. Warm it between your hands to activate the ingredients and work the product throughout the length of your hair. To avoid greasy-looking hair, avoid your roots and focus mainly on the ends of your hair.Coconut, castor, macadamia, argan, or olive oil work well for boosting your hair's shine.

, The best way to avoid buildup is to wash your hair. If you don't have time to shampoo daily, using a scalp exfoliating treatment once a week can wash away dead skin cells and lift the build-up.Many exfoliating treatments contain gritty particles that you have to make sure you rinse out well.If your hair is particularly greasy, you can try using this treatment twice a week.

, If you have curly, frizz-prone, or otherwise unruly hair, you may be waking up with rough hair because of your bedding. Cotton sucks the moisture from your hair, while silk and satin pillowcases help maintain the moisture in your hair.If you don't have silk or satin pillow cases, wearing a silk scarf, or satin cap can help protect your hair as you sleep.

Incorporate your school colors into your hair.,
Paint your face.,
Personalize a shirt by decorating it.,
Complete your Spirit Day look.,
Pay attention to the details on your socks and shoes, too.",How to Dress for Spirit Week or Day at Your School1," Spirit Day is the day to go all out, decked out in your school colors. Put together outfits in your head that exemplify those colors, by making everything you wear fall inline with the colors, from your regular clothes down to your socks and shoes.If you want to show intense school spirit, treat your selections like a diehard sports fan would at a football game. Paint your face or your hair. Don't just match your main clothes to the proper colors; wear socks and shoes that match your school colors, too.
If you want to go for a more minimal approach, consider just adding touches of your school colors to your outfit, like a t-shirt or a pair of pants that match your school's colors.;
, Your hair is a great place to show off your school spirit, as it really takes your outfit over the top. For instance, if your school allows it, wear a hat that matches your school colors to show off your spirit.


Another option is to add temporary hair dye. You can put in a streak for each of your school's colors. Make sure you school allows you to dye your hair in non-natural colors first. You can buy spray-in hair dye at your local drug store.
A cheap alternative method to temporary spray dyes is using Kool-Aid to color your hair, using a packet that matches one of your school colors. Make sure you use unsweetened powders to avoid sticky hair. Mix it into a paste, and apply it to a section of your hair. Wait for a 5 to 10 minutes, then wash out the Kool-Aid.You can also add colorful ribbons to your hair. Wear your hair down. Tie the ribbon onto a bobby pin, and place the bobby pin in your hair. You can also use ribbons to tie pigtails in your hair. Another option is to buy barrettes or headbands in your school's colors., Use face paint to paint your face into halves with your school colors. You can also just add a line or two of face paint in your school's colors or paint hearts. Place temporary tattoo stickers or faux eye black (reflective paint) underneath your eyes to give a nod to football players.You may also want to use face paint to paint sayings like, ""Go (team name)!"" or “Go, Fight, Win!""
If paint is too messy, consider using markers designed to be used on skin. Use the markers to draw designs on your arms and legs. Test them on an inconspicuous part of your face first, such as under your chin, to make sure they don't irritate your skin.

, Get a plain shirt from a craft store, and customize it with your school's colors. You can either start with a shirt in one of your school's colors and add details or start with a plain, white shirt and dye it to match your school's colors.Most craft stores sell tie-dye kits, which you can use to dye your shirt. Kits include things like dye, dye bottles, rubber bands, and gloves.
To tie-dye, wash your shirt first, but don't dry it. You want it to be damp. Twist your shirt up however you want it, such as wrapping it in a circle from the center until you get it in a tight bundle. Next, you hold it together with rubber bands, which will also leave white spaces between colors. If you've made a disc from your shirt, consider putting the rubber bands across the disc, like you're making pie slices. Make sure you protect the surface you're working on with plastic.
Now, add the powdered dyes to the bottles with water. Once you've shaken them up, squirt the dyes on the shirt, alternating your school colors on different sections.
Once you're happy with the results, wrap the shirt up in plastic and let it sit for about 8 hours. When the time is up, rinse it out in the sink until the water runs clear. Wash the shirt in the laundry by itself, and you're done.
You can now add lettering with fabric paint if you want. You can also just add lettering to a solid color shirt. You can either create free hand letters with fabric paint bottles or use sponge letters to add things like ""Go team!"" or ""Let's go panthers!""

, For your bottom half, you can wear jeans, a jean skirt, jean shorts, or soccer shorts that are the school colors. However, if you have nothing in the school colors, regular blue jeans will do just fine.


If you want to add more spirit to your bottom half and you don't mind ruining your jeans, you can draw designs on them in school colors.
You can also have people sign your jeans.

, If you have a pair of sneakers in your school colors, wear them. You can wear soccer socks in school colors or you can find brightly colored patterned socks at department stores.


You could also change out your laces for ones in your team's colors, or you could have your shoes be one of your school's colors and the shoelaces be the other.
Some people will also use paint markers or permanent markers to dress up a plain pair of shoes. However, you don't want to do that on shoes that are very expensive.
For example, you could get a cheap pair of canvas shoes, and then use painter's tape to outline places you want to paint a different color. That way, you can color in just what you want with paint. Make sure to use a durable fabric paint, though you can even use nail polish. Also, for more durability, consider spraying it with a clear shoe protector after you let the paint dry."

Try joining sports, which is one of the basics to becoming Sporty.,
Clothes!,
If you have a dress code, make sure to follow it, but push the limits.,
You should wear minimal makeup.,
For your hair, you can do mostly anything with it.,
If you have glasses, try to get contacts.,
You should have crystal clear skin that looks and feels soft, moisturized, and healthy.,
Your accessories should be minimal but existing.,
Remember What You're Becoming!,
Know your boundaries.",How to Dress Sporty to School," Here are some sports that are popular for Girls: Lacrosse, Tennis, Soccer, Swimming, Cheerleading, Volleyball, and Softball. You need to do at least one of these sports. Or any sport that appeals to you! You can play a ""boys sport"" if you want.;
, For a shirt you could either wear a sports brand logo shirt, a graphic t, a logo shirt/graphic t from places like Hollister/Aeropostale etc., even a tunic (keep in mind if the tunic is too fancy to wear with Soffe shorts, then it is too fancy for this style),or a sports team shirt. Really, any shirt will do as long as it is tight, has minimal patterns, and screams sporty. For pants wear sweatpants/yoga pants/jeans in the winter/fall, and Soffe shorts/shorts similar to Soffe shorts (they don't have to be the brand name ""Soffe"")/basketball shorts/or denim shorts/skirts (skirts only SOMETIMES!) in the spring and summer.For shoes wear a good pair of tennis shoes or flip flops. No sequins or any of that stuff just plain old shoes. For tennis shoes I suggest low top Converse sneakers, black is good because it goes with everything, but feel free to get your favorite color! Flip flops can be cheap plastic kinds in any color. You can also occasionally wear Topsiders, canvas shoes, and Uggs.

, For example, if you are allowed to wear khakis, navy blue, and black pants, wear skinny shorts or pants, that follow the rules. If you are allowed to wear jeans, wear jean shorts. Try to push the limits by making your pants a little shorter. For shirts, wear pastel colored (for traditional sporty gals) or bright colored (for popular sporty gals) polo shirts or school shirts. If you have to wear specific colors, try to change the color of that shirt just a little bit so you stand out. To push limits, get a shirt that is a little smaller than what you normally wear and make sure it is snug, but not skin tight. Shoes are usually whatever you want. If this is the case, wear Converse sneakers all the time and occasionally wear Topsiders, canvas shoes, and flats, but nothing with weird glitter, sequins, or sparkles. Just keep it simple.

, The only makeup that you should wear is lip balm, neutral or white eyeshadow with slight shimmer, mascara, and light blush, but only occasionally. You can also add some concealer under your eyes and on pimples.

, Only leave it down once a week and on the other days put it in a ponytail, pigtails, a messy bun, a half-up, a braid, pinning back just the layers, or any variation of these styles. Keep your hair straight, soft, shiny, and smooth. Use a keratin shampoo and conditioner. Also use a straightening balm. Wear hair ribbons when possible. The best colors are white and black. Make sure to use a deep conditioning treatment once a week.

, If you can't get contacts, get stylish glasses, like wide rimmed nerd glasses, small framed preppy glasses, or any kind of lens you want as long as it is stylish, cute, and totally you. But, only wear your glasses when necessary, or else you may be called a nerd.

, Get in a daily skin care regimen of washing, exfoliating, toning (optional), applying an eye serum (optional but recommended), and moisturizing. Do this twice a day everyday. Apply a spot cream to those pesky zits if you have them. Sporty girls do take care of their appearance believe it or not. Take care of your bodily skin by moisturizing daily, using a body brush before showers, and washing it daily.

, You should wear a pair of small earrings, like studs, small dangles, or tiny hoops. Wear these daily except during sports practices. Wear a necklace occasionally. It should be either a funky and chunky necklace or a tiny little silver chain with a huge or small pendant. Only wear these once a week. Bracelets can be cheap little wristbands, braided bracelets, friendship bracelets, plastic bracelets, etc. You should wear at least one of these daily. If you have none, make one or wear a hairband.

, This is not an article on being a tomboy! This is also not an article on being girly! In my head a ""Sporty Girl"" is one step up from tomboy, but one step down from girly girl. So no sequins, tons of pink, and ""Oh, my goodness! Like so totally AWESOME!"". But also no, only guy friends, baggy shorts and baggy t-shirts and sneakers everyday! You should try to get good grades and be a good person with no drama, because at a lot of schools you get kicked off the team if you don't get good grades or if problems happen, and you wouldn't want to be grounded by your parents inside while your other friends are kicking around a soccer ball outside!

, Sporty girls can wear pink. In fact, you should wear something pink with every outfit. Sporty girls should have tons of bright and pastel colors, but not much black. They don't really wear baggy clothes. But, tight skinny jeans and shorts are great. Soffe shorts are good for sports practices. Your shirts shouldn't be loose, yet they shouldn't be too tight. Remember to wear bright or pastel colors.

Find a twin.,
Go full-out costume.,
Dress up in characters.,
Wear matching outfits.,
Copy each other’s hair and overall look.",How to Dress for Spirit Week or Day at Your School2," Choose your best friend at school or a classmate to be twins with you for Twin Day. Keep in mind, that as “twins,” similarities will come from what you wear and how you’re styled, so don’t worry if you don't look alike in the face or in the way you're built.Decide on a look to wear. Think of your personalities and individual interests. Pick a theme that correlates with those things to decide what kind of “twins” you and your twin want to be.
You don't have to just pair off with just one person. You could also be triplets, quadruplets, or really any number of people as long as you're matching. Plus, if you see someone being left out of the fun, it's nice to ask them to join in with you.

, Choose costumes that coordinate or that match identically. For example, you could both be witches. Another option is you could be peanut butter and jelly. One of you could be a piece of bread with the peanut butter and the other could be the piece of bread with the jelly.If it's near Halloween, you can simply buy your costume from a store. You could also visit a dress-up shop in the area if it's not Halloween time.
Another option is to simply make matching costumes. With a good idea, you can easily buy everything you need to make a costume at craft store.

, You can pick your favorite television show and dress up as the same character. Alternatively, you could pick your favorite movie or book. To truly be twins, you should dress as the same character. However, you could also just pick characters from the same book or movie to be ""matching."" For instance, one option is to dress as Thing 1 and Thing 2 from Dr. Seuss's book The Cat in the Hat.Another option is to both dress up as the character ""Elsa"" from Frozen. Alternatively, one of you could be ""Elsa"" from Frozen and the other could be ""Anna."" You could also pick another Disney movie.
You could also both dress as Waldo, or you could be Mario and Luigi from the Mario games., Another option, probably the easiest option, is to just copy each other's regular clothes.To keep it really simple, you could just choose similar clothes you already own, such as a purple shirt and jean shorts. Check out each other's closets to see what you have that matches.


If you don't have much that matches, consider just purchasing a shirt that matches. You can also make matching shirts if you buy craft store shirts and fabric paint.
Then, just match what you wear on the bottom, such as both wearing a basic pair of jeans.

, To take being a twin to the next level, have your hair styled the same way, or don the same hat or accessory.For a whole other level of matching, you could even match your backpack, bag, or purse, so you look exactly the same.


For instance, you could both wear your hair in pigtails with matching purple ribbons.
For guys, you could spike your hair the same way, such as in a small fake mohawk, and then add spray-in color.
You could also wear matching headbands, so your hair is pulled back the same way.

Brainstorm an idea.,
Hit the thrift stores, and look in your closet.,
Gather your other materials.,
Don't forget the details.,
Give some character to your character.",How to Dress for Spirit Week or Day at Your School3," First, start thinking about movies and books you love. Don't think too hard, just start writing down ideas. Next, write out some characters from those books or movies that you might like to dress up as. Just go with things you love or that inspire you.Next, start narrowing down your ideas. Obviously, some costumes are going to take more time than others. You can buy some costumes if you have the money, but if you don't, you're going to need to get creative.
Think about how much time you have and what you'll need to make each costume. You may need to start as much as a month or two in advance to get a costume together.
Make a list of what you'll need. For instance, if you're going to be Mary Poppins, you'll need a hat, a red scarf, a long-sleeve white blouse, a black skirt, a bag, and an umbrella.

, Often, you can find parts for you costume at the thrift stores. You may have to spend some time going to a few stores to find all the parts you need. If you can't find the parts you need, you may end up making those or buying them at a more expensive store. You could also use pieces from your closet that you already have.For instance, for the Mary Poppins costume, you probably already have a white blouse or button-up shirt. If you don't have one, see if you can borrow one from a family member.
You'll probably be able to find a plain, black skirt at a thrift store, for example, but you may need to make the hat, as well as make additions to a plain umbrella. You may also be able to find the Mary Poppins-style bag at a thrift store.

, Look around your house to see if you have anything else you can use. For instance, if you already have a black umbrella, there's no need to buy another one. For what you can't find or buy, you'll need to make, such as Mary Poppins' hat, if that's your costume.To make something like a hat, you can either start with a plain hat and dress it up, or make it completely from scratch.
One option for a hat like Mary Poppins' hat is to use cardboard or foam core to make it, and then add paint and decorations.

, It's the details that make characters come to life, so make sure you're hitting all the details. For instance, with Mary Poppins, make sure you have the bright red scarf, the bright red lipstick, and try to create a head for your umbrella.You can use printouts for things like the umbrella head to make it easier. Just be sure to back it with cardboard to make it sturdier.


For Mary Poppins' scarf, you can just use red ribbon to make it easier.
For example, if you went as Darla from Finding Nemo, don't forget to carry a goldfish so people know who you are. Alternatively, if you go as a character from Toy Story, use tape to write Andy's name on the bottom of your shoe. The details make all the difference., Character Day is about looking the part, but it is also about acting the part. Borrow mannerisms from the characters you’re dressed like by watching the movie they are in again or by reading through the book again. Memorize their key phrases and mannerisms, and employ them throughout the day.


If you’re dressed like Batman for the day, lower your voice to a deep growl and say everything with a Christian Bale grunt.
If you’re dressed like Cher, twirl your hair, acting super girly, and end sentences with “as if.""

Wear something you already have.,
Find a lady's derby-style hat.,
Dress up an old hat.,
Make a fun hat.",How to Dress for Spirit Week or Day at Your School4," One simple solution is to wear a hat you have at home, anything from a baseball cap to tiara. You can also borrow one of your parent's hats or a neighbor's hat. Look around to see what you have.


It doesn't even have to be a traditional ""hat."" For instance, you could wear a mascot head.
You could also just tie a pretty scarf around your head to create a ""hat"" or gather a handful of fake flowers into a simple floral hat or headband.

, You've probably seen pictures of ladies wearing fun and crazy hats to events like the Kentucky Derby. These hats are very dramatic and often involve lace, ribbon, feathers, beads, and/or flowers. They're often very tall or wide, though some of them are small and dainty.You may be able to find a suitable derby-style hat at a thrift store for cheap, though you'll need to get lucky.
Another option is to start with another style of hat and turn it into a derby-style hat. For instance, you can find lady's straw hats at the craft store. Cover one in fabric. Flip up one edge by sewing it into the top of the hat, then add any decorations you'd like.

, One option is to find an old hat around the house or at a thrift store that you can dress up with crazy things, though ask your parents before using a hat you find at home. You could use things you find around the house or pick up a few things to make a crazy hat.For example, you could cover an old hat in comic book paper or playing cards.
Another option is to spray paint a baseball cap in crazy colors, then glue pipe extending off it like an alien head.

, For the most fun, consider making your own crazy hat. Come up with an idea, and then gather the supplies you'll need. You may need to run to the craft store, but you also may be able to make it from stuff you have lying around the house.For instance, turn a tiny Christmas tree into a hat by adding your own headband. You can even add a small strand of battery-powered lights and tiny ornaments. Try to secure them to the tree by gluing them in or wiring them in more securely, so they don't fall off throughout the day.Create a hat from cardboard or foam core, and then add all sorts of crazy decorations. You could even just go around your house and see what crazy things you could glue to it, with your parents' permission, of course.

Find great fitting jeans.,
Wear a fun skirt.,
Choose classic tops.,
Wear complimentary colors.,
Add versatile pieces to your wardrobe.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Complete your look with accessories.",How to Dress for School2," Jeans are the perfect school staple that can be worn just about everyday. Jeans come in a variety of different colors and washes so you never have to feel bored wearing them. Also, you can mix up the fit by having skinny jeans, boy-cut jeans, or flare jeans., Longer skirts that hit the knee are a great way to stay casual, but step up your look. Wear flowing skirts that fall away from your body, and pair them with casual tops likes T-shirts, long sleeve shirts, or blouses. You can choose any pattern or color skirt that you want, just be sure the fit is not too tight or too short.

, An easy way to look chic for school is to find simple tops you can wear repeatedly. Find classic cut tops such as crew necks, V-necks, and collared shirts. Buy neutral colors like black, white, navy, brown, and gray that are solid colors or have stripes. You can mix and match these tops with any style jean or skirt.The majority of your tops should be neutral. You should only have a few special tops such as a shirt with rhinestones or words that you wear occasionally.

, Modern fashion includes all sorts of styles and color combinations, but there are certain colors that clash together and should not be paired up. To create an outfit that is complimentary together, keep color in mind. Colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel are considered complementary such as blue and orange, pink and green, and yellow and purple. Wearing complimentary colors creates an attractive, color-rich palette.


For example, you could wear a pink shirt with a green cardigan, or a blue skirt with an orange sweater. Keep the color wheel in mind, but do not be afraid to match other colors you think work well together.

, Everyone needs to have essential pieces in their wardrobe that can be easily mixed and matched to any outfit. Here is a list of pieces you should invest in and how to wear them:


A plain white T-shirt is great on its own or for layering. You can wear it under a sweater, over a tank top, paired with a cardigan, tucked into a skirt, or left free with a pair of jeans.
A striped shirt, in any color, looks great with a solid, floral, or plaid skirt or jeans. Add your favorite cardigan, and you will create a classic look.Dark denim looks great on everyone. Whether the jeans are skinny, bootleg, or flare cut, they will pair perfectly with a striped shirt, floral blouse, or sweater.
Over-sized cardigans are a must have for current trends. You can never have too many cardigans to pair with your T-shirts, blouses, tank tops, or button downs. Start off with basic colors such as black, blue, and brown, and then accumulate more in brighter colors and designs that you can pair with just about any top.

, As the seasons change, and your outfits, your shoes should as well. It can be boring wearing the same flats, tennis shoes, or boots everyday. Allow yourself several options for shoes, and just be sure they are all comfortable.


Ballet flats are the perfect shoe to dress up or dress down, and they are very comfortable.Have a black and brown shoe option. This will help you always have a pair of shoes to match any outfit.
Steer away from wearing high heels to school. Unless you have a special school function, there is no need for a shoe over three inches. If you do wear a shoe like a stiletto, you might get other students questioning your shoe choice.

, You can make your casual outfits more interesting by adding jewelry such as a bracelet, earrings, necklace, or ring. Do not go overboard with your look as it is better to keep it simple by just adding one or two pieces.


Statement jewelry, like larger necklaces, may not be the best way to go for a school look. Opt for more delicate pieces when you are trying to create a look that is school appropriate.

Create classic looks.,
Stick with comfortable shoes.",How to Dress for School3," Every guy needs to have a pair of great fitting jeans. The exact fit is up to you, but they should fit you properly.

You will have many items to mix and match.Be sure to have cozy sweaters to wear come winter in several colors such as brown, black, blue, and green., Throughout the year, especially when the weather gets cooler, you will want to have a few button up shirts with a collar. Whether these are cotton or flannel, it will be a great way to enhance your style, and stay warm., A hoodie is the perfect way to stay warm, and keep your look casual for school. Since your hoodie is meant to be worn almost everyday during cooler seasons, opt for a neutral color with either no design, or one that is simple so that your hoodie will match the rest of your wardrobe.A lighter or thinner hoodie is a good way to layer with a button down shirt underneath., Modern fashion includes all sorts of styles and color combinations, but there are certain colors that clash together and should not be paired up. To create an outfit that is complimentary together, keep color in mind. Colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel are considered complementary such as blue and orange, pink and green, and yellow and purple. Wearing complimentary colors creates an attractive, color-rich palette.


For example, you could wear an orange shirt with a blue checkered button down, or a dark green hoodie with a purple polo. Keep the color wheel in mind, but do not be afraid to match other colors you think work well together.

, It can be easy to create a timeless, casual look for school by pairing staple wardrobe pieces together. It is all about layering. No matter what season it is, layering your tops together with a great pair of denim is always a great look. Here are some wardrobe ideas to follow:


Always start with a basic T-shirt. A white T-shirt is good for everyday, but you can mix up your look with a variety of colors in a crew neck or V-neck cut.
Add a polo or button down shirt over your plain T-shirt. If you are wearing a colored T-shirt, be sure that the shirt you wear over is complimentary. So if you are wearing a red T-shirt, try wearing a blue polo, or a blue checkered button down.
Wear a hoodie or cardigan. Depending on the season, you can add a third layer to keep your look interesting. Cardigans and hoodies are better to leave neutral so you can combine them with more pieces. Try a beige cardigan over your blue checkered button down, or a black hoodie.

, Unless you are required to wear dress shoes, keep your footwear casual. Shoe styles such as sneakers, saddle shoes, or canvas options are a great way to keep your look school ready. Black shoes pair with everything, but you can try wearing brown shoes when your wardrobe has Earth tones such as browns, greens, and blues."

Follow the school dress code.,
Dress casually.,
Be sure your clothes fit well.",How to Dress for School4," Every school has a different set of rules that outline what you are allowed to wear. Although these rules vary, most schools require you to dress on the conservative side, and never show your midriff. Check out your specific school rules in the school handbook, or by asking an administrator at the school., Although you might be tempted to wear your best Friday night outfit to school, you have to remember that school is not a party. You are better off dressing comfortably. Regardless of the dress code, conservative outfits that are cute and casual are always the best option. If you show up to school too formally, others might think you are trying too hard.Keep in mind, you want to dress in a way that allows your teachers to have respect for you and not be distracted by your revealing clothes.

, Any attention you receive for your clothes should be positive, and not because your shirt is ultra low, or your pants are too tight. You do not want to find yourself breaking school rules and getting in trouble for inappropriate clothes. School is a professional atmosphere, so you should dress the part. Always check your clothes throughout the year for a proper fit. A top that may have once fit you perfectly, might now be riding a little too high on your stomach. Use these steps to check your clothes before you leave the house:Raise your arms in the air, and if your stomach shows, do not wear it to school.
Bend over and touch your toes to check your pants. If you find that your underwear sits higher than the top of your pants, it may be time to get rid of them.
Bend over, and check the top of your shirt. If you have a lot of cleavage showing, pick a shirt that is more conservative.
Do not wear a shirt that shows your bra strap. Many schools require you to have at least three fingers of coverage on your shoulders.
Check the length of your skirt, dress, or shorts by putting your arms straight down by your side. If the length is shorter than your finger tips, it is not appropriate for school.

Check your school bag.,
Shave.,
Do double french braids in your hair for nice, wavy hair the next day.,
Paint and coat your nails the night before.,
Set an alarm.,
Go to the bathroom and wash your face.,
Take a shower.,
Brush your teeth.,
Make small adjustments to your uniform.,
Open the two French braids, if you did them.,
Apply your makeup.,
Be unique and follow the fashion in your area.",How to Get to School Looking Fashionable and Trendy (for Girls)," Make sure it is clean and functional, check for holes, scrapes, marks, etc. If your school allows it, add any badges or patches you'd like to personalize it. A bag in good order is considered trendy and fashionable in most schools.


Make sure all your homework is done and in your bag. If you have to rush it in the morning you will end up ruffled and stressed, which is very unfashionable.;
, Do both your legs and your armpits, especially if you will be doing physical education the next day. If you are a school girl of 12 years old, or less, or you don't have hairy legs, you can skip this if you want.

, Not only does this look great, it will save you a lot of time in the morning. This step is only relevant if you have hair long enough to plait, if you don't already have naturally wavy hair, or, finally if you believe that wavy hair is trendy and fashionable. You can get to school without doing a double French braid in your hair and be trendy and fashionable.

, It really works, for looking trendy and fashionable, according to some, and saves time trying to do it in the morning. Do not paint your nails if nail polish is not allowed at your school.

, Give yourself plenty of time to get ready for school. If you don't wake up on time, chances are you'll start rushing and your make-up will go wrong.

, This will make your face cleaner and can help reduce the build up of oils on your skin, combatting acne. You could also try using a face scrub for smooth, clean skin.

, Try not to get your hair wet if you did two French braids. Wearing a shower cap will keep your braids completely dry. Not only will you look and feel clean, having a shower is a great way to wake yourself up ready to look alert and refreshed for school. Not looking alert and refreshed is considered unfashionable and un-trendy by many.

, Make sure your breath smells fresh and your teeth are clean. Don't miss out any teeth!

, Jazz it up by pulling the skirt above your knees, un-tucking your blouse and/or adding a pin or badge. If your school allows, wear a necklace, bracelet, or ring or earrings. If you don't have to wear uniform, wear something that is considered trendy and fashionable where you are. This can be anything from flared jeans and a cute Hello Kitty tee-shirt to a gingham dress or a pair of neat shorts and a pretty blouse.

, You can keep your hair open or style it into a high ponytail.


Try other popular hair styles at school, like buns, ponytails or pinning a bit of your hair back and securing it with a clip.

, Don't apply any make-up until you are fully changed because you'll smudge it. Use an eye shadow that matches or compliments the color of your clothes. Lip gloss, foundation and a touch of mascara is acceptable at some schools. Don't go over the top though, and check what your school's policy regarding make-up is. If you are a school girl of 8 or 9, you might decide to be trendy and fashionable without makeup.

, Though these steps should give you a good general idea of what is accepted as fashionable in most schools.

Get to sleep early the night before.,
Begin with some stretches right after you wake up.,
Wash your face.,
Choose some accessories.,
Apply a nice smelling perfume or cologne if you want to.,
Choose a simple hairstyle.,
Keep makeup simple.,
Always have breakfast.,
Never forget to brush your teeth before you walk out the door.,
Check your schoolbag to make sure you have everything you need.,
Be homework savvy.,
Wind down at the end of each day with a relaxing and cleansing shower before you go to bed.",How to Look and Feel Great for School," It's important you get 8-10 hours sleep each night so you won't be tired the next morning. You don't want to look like you're tired all day, so go to bed early.;
, Stretching helps keep your body toned. You may want to consider doing some yoga poses, but regular stretching works as well.

, Cleanse your face using a skin care routine suited to you and don't forget the moisturizer if the weather is harsh outdoors. Toning your skin as well really helps. Apply sunscreen of at least SPF 15 everyday, even when it is cloudy. Boys have to put on sunscreen too, and though you don't have to put on moisturizer you may want to consider it.

, Boys will want to make sure to put effort in to their appearance. You don't have to go all out and use hair gel on your hair to look good. Instead try some accessories like baseball caps, 'boy' necklaces, and wristbands. Girls, accessories are a great way to express yourself. Try to pick accessories that are 'in' right now. Some accessories could be scarves, necklaces, earrings, bangles, and headbands.

, Keep it simple and low-key. Nobody likes smelling your choice of scent filling up the whole room all day long. Try to figure out what scent suits your personality. For free spirited girls, natural scents like violet suit you, for girly girls, scents like flowers, fruit, and vanilla suit you. Boys may want to try to buy matching deodorants. Just try not to over do it! Some may not like the scent, and it may annoy them. So choose wisely and don't over kill it!

, Simple updos and braids are good or you can get a nice haircut that does not need too much styling time every morning. You have better things to be doing than fussing with your hair all morning. Add a fancy clip or ribbon if you want to spice your look up a bit. Try to find hair accessories that make it simple to express your self; if you are a beach girl, then a headband with shells would be perfect for you. Boys, you can spike up your hair or use a style from a famous guy, especially one that you know lots of girls love.

, There is not much time in the morning for playing Cover Girl and getting enough snooze is definitely more important for growing bodies and glowing faces than a pancaked face. Opt for simplicity. Items such as concealer to conceal redness or under eye circles (which you won't have if you get enough sleep) and maybe a bit of little lip balm and/or gloss are good items. If you really want to put makeup on your lids, just try to keep it simple and natural. Black mascara and a natural colored eyeshadow is perfect for those who want to wear eye makeup. However if you don't normally wear makeup, make sure that you look fresh and happy!

, Eat something simple but filling, such as a fruit salad and a glass of water or toast and orange juice. Try to have a backup breakfast bar in the pantry to grab in case you didn't make time for breakfast. Remember that some breakfast is better than no breakfast.

, Brush your teeth until they feel clean. If you got food stuck in your teeth from breakfast, then take some floss and get that out too. That would be embarrassing. If you have braces, make sure to clean between brackets so you don't have gunk in your teeth. If you have problems with bad breath, rinse your mouth with a good-quality mouthwash and perhaps bring some breath mints with you to school.

, This might include such things as:


Essentials: Your school books, any homework, a planner, money (if you have to pay for something), lunch(or lunch money), a small snack, a drink, a pencil case, feminine products (always keep these handy if your a girl!).
Optional: make-up, tissues, breath mints, perfume, a mobile phone, a hairbrush or and a small mirror.

, It's always best to get homework out of the way early. Try to do it as soon as you get home. If you don't have time to, wake up early so that you can get your homework done before school. Always make sure that you do all of your homework. If you can't, get a written note from your parents or have a very good excuse ready. Learning is important and you are only cheating on yourself if you can't be bothered to do the homework.

, Take a bath occasionally with a school text in one hand and a massage brush in the other. It is very blissful. Also, listen to some calming music or nature sounds (waterfall, wind rustling though the trees, etc.). This will soothe you and get you ready for bed.

Look at what you already have.,
Look at what you already have and what you need more off.,
Now it's time to go shopping.,
Be careful with how much you spend and what you spend it on.,
When you're a teen, you're growing tons.,
Think about what you buy before you buy it.,
Borrow something from a friend.,
Even when something is too small, look and see if you can turn it into something else.,
Always buy things you need first.,
Know the popular clothing stores.",How to Gather up a Huge Wardrobe for School," Separate everything into tops, bottoms, dresses, etc. Color code your tops and sort your bottoms by length.;
, What are your favorite colors? What are popular colors? Do you need more of these? Here are general numbers of what you should have in your wardrobe:


20-30 t-shirts, cute tops, blouses, etc
5-15 tanks and camis
2-6 hoodies and sweatshirts
3-6 pairs of jeans
3-4 denim Bermuda shorts
3-4 short denim shorts
1-2 sweatpants
2-3 athletic shorts
2-3 formal dresses
3-4 sundresses
1-2 belts
Lots of accessories and undergarments
4 pairs of shoes

, Go shopping every month or every other month and buy a few things every time. During the summer, go shopping lots with friends. Save up between every time so you'll have more money to spend. After buying a few things every month/every other month, you'll notice that things really add up.

, Sure, that shirt looks cute but $30? Why not use that to buy a pair of jeans that you actually need? Some shopping tips: Think - the more I save, the more I'll have next time. I always tell myself - never buy a shirt that's more than $15 and never buy a pair of jeans, skirt, etc that's more than $30. Figure out your priorities so you don't spend lots of money on things you don't need.

, Don't buy something that's extremely tight. Buy something that's a little loose or big on you. Better for it to be big and fit for 2-3 years than buy it small and have it only fit for a few months.

, Should you really get that top from Abercrombie for $20 or should you go to Aeropostale and get something that looks almost exactly the same for only $10? And don't spend all your money on things like graphic tees (a few are okay though). Why spend $25 on a shirt that just says Hollister on it?

, Don't be afraid to ask. Want to wear a dress but don't have a cardigan to put over it? Ask a friend. Just be sure to be careful with it and always return it.

, There are tons of DIY videos on how to do this on YouTube., Have a diverse closet, not just a lot of the same things. It's good to save money. Go shopping every month or every other month and get 3-4 things each trip. Things will really add up and before you know it, you'll have an amazing and stylish wardrobe.

, For example: Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, American Eagle, Lacoste, Pac Sun, Ed Hardy, Bluenotes, Aeropostale, Diesel, Delias, and Forever 21. Go online first to get an idea of what these stores sell before going shopping. More info on these these stores is right below:


Abercrombie and Fitch- The clothes are preppy and classy, but it's usually over-expensive.
American Eagle- They send out many coupons through the year so the clothes become very affordable. You can probably sign up to get the coupons through membership online.
Lacoste- Lacoste has preppy, nice clothing but it is very expensive.
PacSun- It's a great store with variety. They carry many brands (DC, Hurley, Billabong, Element, Zoo York, etc.)
Ed Hardy- The colors here are very bright with the tattoo look.
Bluenotes- The clothes are unique and often have great deals.
Aeropostale- It's a very popular store. If you're a kid there's a store called PS which is basically Aeropostale for kids. Most of there clothes are tighter and form-fitting, and most of the shirts say ""Aero"" on them.
Diesel- Very expensive jeans ($200+), but are very comfortable and are extremely well-made. However, if you are still growing, especially fast, don't buy these as in 3-5 months you'll have outgrown $200.
Delias- Delias has lots of clothing variety. It has many sales and coupons that normally save you lots of money.
Forever 21- Forever 21 has reasonable prices and has everything you'll want to find from accessories to fancy dresses.

Select unique items to showcase your personal style.",How to Dress Cute for School," This is a challenge that can help you break out of your comfort zone. Try to find a different color for every day of the week. You can mix and match the other clothing and accessories you have based around this color. This will force you to create some cute outfits.You do not have to have a shirt or a pair of pants in your desired color. Maybe most of your shirts tend to be black, brown, and green, but you have a few more colorful scarves or vests.
Maybe a purple scarf could be worn with a black top and lavender shoes, for example. A red vest could be worn over a plain black t-shirt.;
, If you have an outfit that feels so-so, use a belt. Belts can be used to make an outfit stand out from the crowd.If you have a belt in an interesting color, or one that comes with a decorative buckle, you could tuck in your shirt for the day and wear that belt.
You can also tie a belt around your waist. A loose-fitting shirt or dress can highlight your figure better if you have a belt around your waist.

, You may feel like you can't wear the same outfit twice, but a good pair of pants or shirt can be used in multiple outfits. Try going for an unusual combination one day and see how you like your new style.For example, maybe you have a longer shirt that flows a little. You could wear it with a pair of skinny jeans. You could also tuck it into a skirt, or wear it with a belt down the middle.
If you have a button down shirt, you could wear it mostly buttoned up one day. The next week, you could wear it unbuttoned with a nice t-shirt underneath. You could also add a tie, if there's a more formal occasion happening at your school.

, A simple cardigan can add color and flare to an outfit. A dull sleeveless blouse or t-shirt can be worn under an interesting, colorful cardigan.For example, say you have a white, sleeveless blouse or a plain white t-shirt. This may look a little dull on its own. However, add a colorful or patterned cardigan. This can make your outfit cuter.
If you want to highlight your figure, a belt can also be wrapped around a cardigan.

, You can actually download a phone app that will give you wardrobe suggestions based on the clothing in your closet. If you have a smart phone, try using the app ClosetSpace.You upload pictures or descriptions of your items to the app. The app with then offer you suggestions on what to wear. You can cater those suggestions for a particular event, style, or season.

, Once you've found a good outfit, record it. If you're lacking inspiration one morning, look at recent photos. You may find something that inspires you to come up with a new outfit. Recording your best outfits will also help you start thinking about forming your own personal style., You can hang out with a fashionable friend, look at fashion blogs, and read fashion magazines. Look at people dressed in a variety of outfits. Notice what makes their style unique.If there's a particular model you like, start looking up pictures of him or her. Is there something unique about this model's style? Does he or she always wear sunglasses, for example, or tend to dress in a particular color?
Remember, fashion magazines are often trying to get you to buy something. As you browse magazines, remember you don't have to break the bank to be fashionable. Do not be tempted to order a $50 cardigan. Just write down the type you liked and you can probably find something similar, and cheaper, at a local clothing store.

, If you're in love with a particular color, this could be the staple of your wardrobe. If a particular color looks good on you, and you find yourself wearing it a lot, think about how you could always incorporate this color into your wardrobe.Undertones in your skin can determine whether you have a warm of cool complexion. If you have pink, red, or bluish undertones, you have a cool complexion. Colors like greens, blues, purples, and pinks look best on you.If you have yellow, peachy, or golden undertones in your skin, you have a warm complexion. You would look best in yellows, reds, oranges, and browns.Think about both your complexion and your color preferences. Personality may come into play as well. If you're loud and confident, red may be a good signature color. Once you've selected a signature color, try to add it to every aspect of your wardrobe.

, You can refer back to your wardrobe diary. You can also simply consider what kind of outfits tend to be most flattering on you.Pull five things from your wardrobe you wear regularly. Figure out why they work for you. For example, maybe you pull out three long and loose tops and two pairs of fitted jeans. Maybe you have a longer torso and slim legs, so longer tops and tight jeans work well for you.
Evaluate these items. How can they speak to a signature look? What is missing? Maybe you want a little more color. If your signature color is red, for example, a pair of red skinny jeans can be added to your outfit. Maybe you want to make things slightly more formal. You could look for a long button down red top.

, Pull out five clothing items from your closet you never wear. These can even be items you wish you had not bought. Try to figure out why they don't work for you.For instance, you pull out three t-shirts and two skirts. These are very different from the longer tops and tight jeans you pulled out earlier. Maybe t-shirts look awkward on you due to your longer frame, and you dislike that skirts hide your legs.
Now, you can begin to see what types of clothing you prefer. These types of clothing can be made into your signature look.

, You have an idea of what kind of clothes you should go for. From here, think about how to expand on what you have. You may find you can add accessories and new clothing items to cultivate your look.Returning to the example, you picked red because you feel bold and confident. How you can you make your clothing express this while sticking to the style that most flatters you?
More patterns could help with boldness. Look at a long, polka-dotted red blouse. Choose bright red skinny jeans, to be worn with black top.
What accessories convey boldness? A clunky red necklace? A bright red watch? A red belt? Maybe you could paint your fingernails red, or use striking red lipstick.

, Many people have a look defined by a signature item. Is there an accessory you love? Maybe you could incorporate this accessory into your style every day, or most days.Maybe you've always loved watches. You can get a wide collection of different watches and wear one every day. You can have some of these watches come in shades of your signature color.
Maybe you have a lot of affection for hoop earrings. Try to wear pairs in different sizes, shapes, and colors each day.

, If you want to shop to ramp up your wardrobe, make sure you don't buy anything you do not need. Certain wardrobe staples appear in most people's closets. Scan your closet for the following items prior to a shopping trip:A small black dress or a black blazer
Black trousers or pants
A white button down shirt
Blue jeans
Dark jeans
A white cardigan and a black cardigan

, If you need any of the above items, buy them when you're shopping. Something like, say, a black cardigan can be used in multiple outfits. Such items give your wardrobe more mix and match potential, adding to the cute outfits you can assemble for school., Go into your shopping trip having some sense of what you want. Remember your signature style. Select a few items that could be added to existing clothing in your wardrobe to create a cute outfit based around your style.For example, the warmer months are coming and you need some summer outfits. Your signature color is red, so look for red shorts, t-shirts, and tank tops.
Your shoes are almost always red, so you'll need a pair of red flip-flops or sandals.
You can also shop just for day-to-day items. You have a great button down red shirt. Buy a vest to go with it, as well as a watch with a red strap. This creates a new outfit from a single shirt.

, As you shop, be on the lookout for anything that can enhance your personal style. Keep in mind what you're known for in your school style-wise, and look for items that compliment this.Maybe your fingernails are always painted different colors. Browse the cosmetics section to find nail polish colors you have not yet tried.
Maybe you're known to wear a lot of wrist bands. Stop by a store like Hot Topic and buy some new wrist bands for your wardrobe.

Know what hairstyles will match with your outfit and what hairstyles will not.,
Have a schedule and stick with it, whether you're finished with your appearance or not.",How to Do Hair and Makeup for Middle School Girls1," This way, you know what you're going to be wearing and you can easily match it with your hairstyle and makeup. It also saves some extra time for you to focus more on your appearance!;
,


Avoid neon colors on your face, as it will give you an awkward appearance. Stick with calm, neutral colors.







, Your hairstyle will normally depend on your outfit and how you're planning to dress. (Ex: If you're dressing professionally, a messy bun probably will not do.)

, Although it is important to have a pleasant appearance, it is even more important to have some breakfast and get to school on time! If you're running late, spend less time on your makeup and more on your hair; divide your time equally. Or, to make things faster, go without makeup or let your hair down for the day!

"
For quick hairstyles when you're on the run, try a simple ponytail clipped up with a large, colorful alligator clip.,
Try a half ponytail.,
Quiffs are cute as well, and can be worn with pretty much any outfit.,
Ponytails are excellent for mornings when you find that your hair is oily or gross-looking, and you don't have time to wash it!",How to Do Hair and Makeup for Middle School Girls2," Messy buns also work great, as braids do too, depending on what type of braid you choose to do.


If you're in a hurry, it's best to stick with hairstyles you're most familiar with. That way, you can do them faster and have more time for your makeup or whatever else you need to get done.






If worst comes to worse, wear your hair down for the day. Brush it out and scrunch it to add some body and height. Spray it with hairspray to lock in the body for at least a few hours. If you have time, add a cute headband (having a few patterned headbands are recommended). However, be sure the headband matches your outfit!
You can also do your hair in the bathroom at school when you have time. Just be sure you aren't missing any classes or taking too long! You could also do your hair on the bus/car.

, It's cute, chic and you can enjoy having part of your hair down while having the rest clipped up! Try adding a little body to the top of your hair for some elegance.

, Just take the hair that falls in front of your face and comb it back against your scalp. Twist it two-three times and gently push it forward for a bump. Pin it in place. Either put the remaining hair in a low ponytail or keep it down.

, The best type of ponytails are the sleek, oily kinds, but you don't have to have gross hair to do a ponytail!

Stick with neutral colors when applying eye shadow.,
Stick to using concealer; not foundations.,
When applying lip gloss, be sure you don't put on more than you need.,
Only use a little mascara - too much will look awful.,
Try different looks - with and without mascara, with and without lip gloss, etc.,
Find the inner you and only put one what looks best on you.",How to Do Hair and Makeup for Middle School Girls3," It's best not to have neon colors sticking out, as this creates a frightening and intimidating look, not to mention a little awkward! Don't apply too much eye shadow - a little bit will do.


Try glittery eye shadow - it's cute and playful!







, If you prefer some makeup to even out the skin all over your face, use tinted moisturizers and BB creams. Avoid shades lighter or darker than your skin, or it will look awkward and out of place.

, A little bit will do, to give your lips a little shine. Too much will make it look out of place and gross! After you apply lip gloss, check to make sure none of it has gotten on the outside of your lips. Rub your lips together and gently blot overloaded areas with a tissue.

, Clear mascara will work best if you want the look of naturally long lashes. You want to give your eyelashes a little length, not so much that it looks like you need to shave!


If you're planning to use blush, do not use mascara. If you're planning to use mascara, do not use blush! Both will be far too much!







, Play around with it and have fun! However, it's best you try out new styles during the weekend at home, instead of on a school morning. You don't want to make yourself late!

, Don't apply something just because it's cool or looks great on a certain person. You aren't a supermodel; you need to see what fits and what doesn't fit you. Never stop wearing your own style, unless if it violates school dress code!

Buy a cool pair of jeans.,
Try to buy new blouses whenever you have some spare money.,
Skirts: Short skirts are always in and they should go to a little above your mid thigh.,
Shorts: If you wear shorts at the knees make sure they are jean.,
Accessories: Earrings are fine.,
Makeup: Always carry a lip gloss tube with you.,
Hair: Now this is the part where it becomes hard to decide, because it really varies from outfit to outfit.,
Shoes: Flats with gold or silver linings are stylish if added with black leggings, but if not, it's fine too.,
Bags: Before considering the fashion, be sure that your 'stylish' bag could contain all of your school supplies.,
Be Confident.,
Enjoy your fashion!

",How to Dress Fashionably for School (Girls)," You should have dark wash, light wash, medium colored, black, and grey jeans. There are many types of jeans you could choose, but skinny jeans are fashionable at the moment. Wear short tops over the jeans with decorative pockets at the back. Nothing too uncomfortable though.;
, A new blouse will make you feel great and stay in trend. Try to vary the shirts you buy. For example if you bought purple glitter shirt this week, buy a cute green blouse next week

, You can also wear something that kind of balloons it's shape as it goes down. If the skirt has to stick to your knees, please tuck in your shirt with wide belts. Jean skirts, corduroy skirts, skirts with laces, are necessary. Colorful leggings are also cute but if your outfit is really colorful try to stick to brown, black or grey. You don't want to overdo it .

, Never wear baggy shorts. Don't wear shorts that have pockets at the knee. You can also wear short- shorts which are very cute.

, They can really bring up the quality of an outfit, and could help you feel better for the rest of the day. Dangly, though not too big earrings are great for everyday. Hoops are okay too. Tiny earrings are very stylish if you wear your hair up.

, Gloss after a class, gloss after lunch, and gloss during the bus ride. If your skin is pale, go for light pink lips. If your skin is tanned, I recommend you wear dark pink shades. Orange lips, beige lips could be arranged depending on the whole outfit. You may also use lipsticks. A nude or light pink color lipstick works fabulous for school. Mascara is totally okay for everyday too, unless you have a particularly sweaty P.E class. Apply eyeliner in dark colors only. Such as: black, brown and navy. Blush is great in shades of pink or rose. You could also use BB creams they are basically tinted moisturizers.

, Only wash your hair 2-3 times a week. Wearing your hair down requires a lot of combing, if you have a straight hair. If you have curly hair, only comb it when its wet. You don't know when wind will mess with your hair, so hair spray is good too, to hold your hair in place. Cute hair pins are fine. Hair bands should be noticeable, if your whole outfit is plain. It adds a touch of sophistication to the whole look. Wear hair scarves they are in style now especially if you are a fashion person you would know and also if you area vintage sort of person. High ponytails, side ponytails, buns, chignons, braids, and messy up-dos are totally okay.

, Keds are CUTE, Converse are too so wear them. High-top shoes with colorful design is definitely refreshing if matched with plain look, or dark jeans. Remember that too much height is kinda going to affect your walking.

, Remember that jeans and backpacks with neon colors match, flair skirt with checkered backpack or clutches match, and big bags match for everything. So you should probably think about buying a bunch of cute bags in different styles and rotate them from day to day.

, Don't be afraid to wear something! Be confident in what you are wearing. Make it you.

Keep looking for one if you are old enough. If your school doesn't make you wear a uniform (which can be cute as well! Look at the girls in Gossip Girl for some cute high fashion accessories that can make your uniform even hotter.), find that one store where the jeans always fit you and you like everything they sell. For a preppier look, go to stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, Wet Seal, Aeropostale, American Eagle, and Hollister. For a high fashion look, search stores such as Juicy Couture, Nordstroms, Fashion outlets such as Loehmanns, and Forever21 (A lot of people say that Forever21 is too cheap looking, but if you shop online, a lot of the stuff is more high quality. Jeans are very inexpensive as well.) If you want to achieve that cool scene/emo look, go to stores like Hot Topic. Find that one store!;
, Hopefully it will be someone famous and beautiful, someone you think always dresses well. If it's Kate Moss, search topshop.com for her line. If it's Paris Hilton, look through her extensive lines of clothing and jewelry. If it's Blake Lively, search cwtv.com. There are countless celebrities out there with styles that are just begging to be brought into your own wardrobe! If you have trouble finding stuff you like while shopping, constantly ask yourself ""Would Angelina Jolie buy this?""

, Follow your unique style! Never wear all one label of clothing, it will make you look totally unoriginal.

, Don't act fake and be nice to the people around you, but don't be rude either. Being someone well liked at high school means that you're loved by all. So always have a smile on your face!

, Chances are, the young guy behind you doesn't have the nerve to say something yet either! Compliment someone! Even a ""I love that purse!"" or ""I wish I could do my makeup as good as yours!"" will make someone's day! Being popular means being nice!

, Save that for the many parties you'll be invited to now that you're popular! You will only need the basic stuff: Concealer (Get something non-comedogenic, so you won't breakout even more, I would recommend brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Bobbi Brown, Nars, or Mac. (Nars is the best place to go for makeup because they will find the foundation and concealer that makes your skin looks FLAWLESS!). For foundation or blush, go to a professional makeup counter to find the right color, because the wrong kind of color can make your face look dirty and tired. For mascara try Covergirl's last blast. For lip gloss try Sephora, YSL Golden Gloss, or Lancome's Juicy tubes. For some light eye makeup, such as a bit of black charcoal liner, and for a very light base color to make your eyes stand out even more, try Bobbi Brown! If you're going out, you can always experiment with smoky eyes, or a bold color of eye liner. Hey sexy!

, Find a good face wash and cleanse your face twice a day. Make sure ALL OF YOUR MAKEUP is removed before you go to sleep, or you'll breakout really badly. Using a toner after your cleanser can help to remove any traces of makeup and impurities. If you have acne, invest in a good acne cream that suites your skin type. Don't let your confidence fall because you have acne, instead treat your skin and try to improve it. Remember, in high school, almost more than 80% of teens breakout, so don't feel too self conscience if you have acne.

, Make sure people know your signature scent, but please, ONE spray only! No one should be able to smell you coming down the hall. It should be very light, and the only people who should be able to smell the perfume, are the people that are less than a foot away from you. Try to find your signature scent. Ask for samples at your local Nordstroms! They'll be happy to help. Try scents such as, Armani Code, La Perle Charme, Bath and Body Works, Pacsun's signature perfume, No Abercrombie though, Vera Wang's Princess, etc! Use a shampoo and conditioner that smells great!

, Go to the gym and take a class! Stay in shape and you'll feel more confident about yourself, not to mention that you'll look fantastic!

, Don't slouch! You might think that people don't look at your posture, but they do! Nothing is more unattractive than someone whose shoulders are slouched forward ALL the time. (Try watching One Tree Hill, and look at the main character, Peyton's shoulders. She's a prime example of a beautiful girl, who could be 10x prettier if she put her shoulders back!)

, Hair on your legs or under your arms is a real turn off! NEVER forget to wax! Boys love good smelling, moisturized, and smooth skin! It's better to wax rather than shave: It will last longer and the hair will grow thinner.

, Two weeks before your school starts, go get your hair done, girl! Go to a professional salon to avoid looking ridiculous on your first day of school. All the celebs have highlights and lowlights, so why can't you? They're not too expensive, and they make you look much more sophisticated. Bring in a few pictures of a haircut that you like so your stylist knows what you want.

, Try to spend an hour in the library everyday! It makes you feel good about yourself and you won't be labeled as just pretty.

, Teeth whitening is something that makes your smile more noticeable and prettier. Even if you can't whiten your teeth then still smile all the time (except when everyone is mourning over something). And bad breath is a total turn-off.)

,""'say it everyday, and soon the rest of the world will know it too.

, Try to talk to people you haven't met because being popular means knowing lots of people and being liked by mostly everyone. Start with a simple compliment like ""Hey, I love your hair! How did you get it so shiny?"" Also, make your locker stand out from the rest. It'll make people stop by and maybe ask to use your mirror. It gives you a chance to talk to someone new.

Thoroughly read through your school’s policies on attire, so that you can make practical choices when deciding on your ensemble. If your school has a strict dress code, be sure to follow it.


If you can’t locate the dress code, call your school or ask a fellow student.;
, If you’re tired of your current look, consider trying out a new style. When you’re choosing your outfit, specifically choose colors and styles that you like, but don’t often wear. Choose accessories that show off your interests, like with a necklace of a paint brush or favorite movie character. Make sure that you are still choosing clothes you feel confident about, even if they’re different than your usual look. You can change your look without breaking dress code or dressing uncomfortably.You can also change up your look by getting a new hair cut and/or color.
If your everyday outfit is a pair of jeans and t-shirt, considering wearing a casual dress or skirt to school.

, Draw some inspiration for your back to school outfit by choosing your own fashion role model. Whether this person is a celebrity or someone you know, spend some time looking at people who dress in ways you love. You can use this inspiration to figure out exactly what your ideal back to school outfit would look like, and can then work on putting the outfit together. You don’t have to dress extravagantly to channel your icon’s style. You can tone down the style to create a simpler and more practical version of their style.You can choose whoever you want to be your style icon, so long as their fashion inspires you. Many people see Audrey Hepburn as a classic and elegant style icon, while some prefer the wilder side of Madonna, or the glamorous Diana Ross.
Some other style icons are Steve McQueen, Basquiat, David Bowie, and the more modern style icon, Pharrell Williams., Think about what the weather will be like on the day you go back to school before putting together your outfit. Your first day back may be during the summer or winter. Don’t wear heavy, thick clothing if the weather will still be hot and sunny. You should also not wear thin and short clothing, like skirts without tights and T-shirts, if the weather will be very cold outside.


Bring a light jacket with you even if the weather is still hot outside. The air conditioning may be turned up in your classrooms.
Wear a jacket or sweater over a T-shirt that can be pulled off just in case the heat is turned up in your classroom.

, Whether your favorite store is a trendy shop in the mall, a vintage boutique, or a quirky thrift shop, take a trip to get inspired. You can buy a completely new outfit, a new piece to build your outfit around, or simply look around for inspiration. While you’re shopping, choose outfits that you know you can wear at school. Look for clothing that fits together to create your ideal back-to-school outfit, but can be worn again without being too recognizableIf you go shopping for a new outfit, look for articles of clothing that can be worn with other outfits. Button-down shirts, simple dresses and shirts, bright blazers, and printed pants can be mixed and matched.
Save up your money or ask your parents if they would be willing to help you buy a new outfit.

, Take your style icon’s fashion and your own personality into consideration when putting together an outfit. Base your outfit choices on the fashions you love the most. Select clothes that are your favorite colors and ones that make you feel confident.You may also identify your personality with styles like punk , Goth , hipster , and preppy .
If you always like to stand out from the crowd, start choosing bright colors or pieces with lots of detail.
If you prefer a subtle look, choose pieces that are understated, but still elegant.

, Even if you love a bold look, keep your outfit for the first day comfortable. You can still wear bright colors, interesting patterns, and unique styles without feeling uncomfortable in class. Remember, you’re going to be sitting in classes for most of your day, so avoid clothes that are made of itchy fabrics or that are too tight. Select clothes that will be easy to wear all day.Adding a flannel to jeans and t-shirt will give you a vintage look, and can add some style to an otherwise basic outfit.
You can make a dress more comfortable for a school environment by adding tights underneath and bringing a sweater.
You can create a bold look that is still comfortable by selecting brightly colored clothes, or wearing soft layers under fabrics that look stylish, but are uncomfortable.

, If you’ve changed your style and want to express that, wear a new outfit, but don’t be afraid to wear an older article of clothing with the outfit. Remember that you want to look stylish, but also be comfortable. If you have a brand new pair of jeans or t-shirt, compliment your outfit with your favorite cardigan or shoes. Or, bring an older, but loved hoodie to wear with your outfit. The familiarity can be comforting, especially if you are trying out a new style.Remember to focus on choosing pieces for your outfit that look great on you and express your own personal style, instead of wearing things that you don’t love but are trendy.

, School often starts back during the hottest part of the year, but it is good to bring a sweater or cardigan with you. A sweater can come in handy if the air conditioning is too cold in your school. It can also be useful if you’re wearing a shirt that is lower cut.You can keep the sweater in your backpack, or tied around your neck or waste when you’re not wearing it.
You can also bring a hoodie, but it will cover up most of your outfit.

, Once you’ve selected an outfit that makes you feel cool and confident, use accessories as a finishing touch. Adding accessories can make a casual outfit feel more stylish. Remember to keep your choices of accessories simple. Jewelry, scarves, belts, ties, bowties, and headbands count as accessories.If you’re wearing a casual outfit, wear an elegant silver or gold necklace or bracelet to pull the outfit together.
Wear a black or brown leather belt to make a casual outfit, like jeans and T-shirt, look nicer.

, It may be tempting to wear a new pair of loafers or heels, but try to wear shoes that will remain comfortable throughout the day. The shoes you wear should have been already worn and broken in. Blisters and uncomfortable rubbing could be caused by brand new shoes. Wear a pair of flats that you wouldn’t mind spending walking and sitting in throughout the day.You might wear a pair of boots, sneakers, or sandals, depending on the time of the year.

, You won’t want to carry around your school supplies all day in your arms. Bring a backpack that can fit all of your school supplies and necessary personal items. You should try on the backpack before brining it to school to make sure it doesn’t feel too heavy or uncomfortable.


You can also bring a small purse with your backpack. Or, you can bring a large bag that acts as your purse and backpack.

Clean out your closet.,
Figure out and define your style.,
Have good hair.,
Do not limit yourself to brand names.",How to Become the Most Stylish Girl in School," Take all your clothes out and place them somewhere that you can see them all at the same time (e.g., bed, floor). Separate your clothes in two sections; the clothes you like and the ones you don't. Get rid of the things that are out of style, don't fit, are damaged, or that you don't like anymore. Donate these things to charity, or if you want to make extra money, sell them to a local consignment shop or a place that pays on-the-spot, like Plato's Closet, or Uptown Cheapskate.;
, Everyone has a different style, and it is probably made up of many different tastes and fashions. Make it your own and make sure it's something you feel comfortable with. Read magazines such as InStyle, Lucky, Seventeen and Teen Vogue/Vogue for some fashion inspiration. Examine ads and articles and pay attention to what you like and dislike. When you go into clothes stores, buy the stuff you like best and won't regret buying. Try on and feel fabrics to see which you would like best to wear. Try to emulate the former and avoid the latter.

, Fashion isn't just about clothing. How many times have you seen a cute outfit ruined by bad hair? Find a style that works for your hair--it can be wavy, curly, straight, brown, blonde, red--whatever, so it looks natural, pretty, and flattering. Find a talented hair stylist and get tips from her/him.

, By doing this, you will only end up looking like everybody else. Which makes you look like you want to blend in when you actually want to stand out. Stylish girls' clothes always gets the eyes by looking different from the others. It's okay to shop at Abercrombie, American Eagle, Hollister, etc., but make sure very few of your clothes say ""A&F"" across the chest (especially if you're in middle/high school/college). Try to wear something different that will make you stand out, but in a fashionable, reasonable way. Scour second-hand shops, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, local boutiques and garage sales for unique garments and accessories.

If you are girly, go to stores like Forever 21 and Claire's. If you are preppy, go to places like USPA, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, or Lily Pulitzer. If you are sporty, go to Sports Authority, Aeropostale, or Under Armour. If you are beachy, go to Hollister, Abercrombie, or Tilly's. If you have a favorite store that isn't one of the above, you can go there too. If you're a girly-girl, get at least three pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of shorts, various colored tank tops/ camisoles, at least two regular T-shirts, and two shirts that you really like. Also get a couple of skirts in different colors and styles. If you are a tomboy get a about 5 pairs of cargo (Black) pants, 3 dark or black skinny jeans and lots and lots of colorful animation shirts.

If you are beachy, buy 3 cover ups, 2 bikinis, anything made of tweed, twill, or other loose fitting, flowy, boho fabric.;
, Join cheerleading. It's fun and slimming. You can also do volleyball, track, or what ever you enjoy doing. You could also do things like walking, jogging, and work your way up to running. Swimming is also very good. It builds your arm muscles and keeps you fit when you're not playing other sports. Don't join sports that have a stronger guy following like football, basketball, soccer, baseball/softball, etc. Track is half and half, as is swimming.

, Clinique and Mac are good sources of make-up. Only wear a little bit of blush, concealer, lip-gloss, bronzer, eyeshadow, and mascara if you like. Make everything look very natural and keep your face and lips moisturized. First, apply a concealer under your eyes and on blemishes. Then, apply a blush on the apples of your cheeks and a bronzer in your hollows. Put on gold eyeshadow, black mascara, and lip gloss. This is a quick, simple, and easy look for all styles.

, For girls Find something comfortable and fitting. Flats, flip-flops, canvas shoes, and simple tennis shoes look awesome with almost everything! Try to get one pair of each. Get canvas shoes, ballet flats, and topsiders if you are preppy, sneakers if you are a tomboy, flip flops and flats if you are girly, tennis shoes and sneakers if you are sporty, flip flops and canvas shoes if you are girly, and if you don't belong to any style, just wear a combination of them all.

, You can do you hair however you like. Pulling it back into a ponytail says that you aren't a hair freak, while still allowing you to look pretty, and sporty. Putting it in a braid, ponytail, pigtails, half-ups, or braiding hair near your face shows that you are preppy and clean cut, as long as your layers don't stick out. Hair when it is down is the best for a beachy look. For a girly look, leave it straight, curly on the bottom, natural, or in pigtails. Get a cut with long layers and/or side bangs/short layers near your face. Use a great smelling shampoo every 3 days followed by a matching conditioner daily.

, You should wash your face twice a day with a cleanser followed by a gentle exfoliation, eye serum/cream for anti-aging, a cold wash, and a moisturizer. Do this twice a day. At night apply zit cream to your zits. Your skin doesn't have to be flawlessly smooth and perfect, but you should take care of it nonetheless.

, Other than exercising, you should also have great hygiene by washing your body everyday, applying deodorant and sweet smelling lotion, brushing and flossing your teeth, and eating healthy. Your diet should consist of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean meats, and other healthy foods. Get a tan and be in wonderful shape. You don't have to be skinny to be in wonderful shape.

, It isn't all about the looks. If you look like the sweetest, cutest kid in the world and then turn into a total snob every time someone talks to you, no one is going to think you're cute at all. Be sweet and innocent, but also have a relatable, spicy side that is compatible with everyone. Above all, be nice.

, Try a new perfume, as it can really make people notice you more than normal. For girly girls, use a cute and sweet floral scent. For preppy girls, use a scent like citrus or vanilla. For sporty girls, just use your deodorant. For beachy girls, use salt scented or ocean scented. For tomboy's don't use any, just deodorant. Have your deodorant and lotion match the scent of your perfume by adding a few drops to your lotion and deodorant.

What to wear underneath?,
Dresses with an empire hemline or A-line dresses skim over the back brace and are flattering and fashionable.,
Skirts with layering or ruffles will hide any strange bumps or lumps caused by the back brace.

,
Use jewellery, embroidery, frills, embellishments and ribbons to cover up any strange lumps and draw attention to features you want to emphasis.,
Jackets, chunky knit cardigans and hoodies will give you the chance to wear form-fitting shirts and tank tops by covering the brace.,

Jeans.,
Hair is your best accessory!",How to Cover Your Back Brace for School or Going Out," Put on a tank top under the brace. A tank top that is the same colour as your back brace will make the back brace stand out a little less under a shirt made from a fine material. Many people find seamless, spaghetti strapped vest tops made from Lycra/nylon (like leggings) more comfortable than ribbed cotton. Experiment!;
, This also applies to choosing more formal tops.

,, Place a bright flower near your face, in your hair or on a belt around your hips to draw attention away from your bulky brace and towards your best features.

, Dark colours and busy pattern will smooth out your profile. You can also experiment with fabrics that are too clingy for wearing directly over your brace, such as satin. Blazers are particularly adaptable and are fashionable as well! For warmth and style, cropped jackets are sometimes very flattering. Hoodies are really popular but should be chosen with care. Ones that are lined or made from a thicker fabric will skim over the brace and are a fun way to experiment with colours and slogans that you might otherwise wear on t-shirts.

, Wearing peasant blouses, longer tops and short dresses will hide your bum and are great to wear with leggings which are comfortable and convenient to wear with a brace, as well as drawing attention to your legs if they are one of your favourite features! Trousers with flap style pockets will round out your bum and give you curves.

, Choose jeans with added Lycra for more stretch , experiment with high and low waistbands to find what you feel most comfortable in, consider going up a size to accommodate the brace (you can easily have excess material trimmed and pinned by a dressmaker for little expense), opt for jeans with flap pockets, try out a bootleg cut to visually balance the brace, try out Jeggings for comfort and fashion

, If you have long hair wear it flowing down your back, hiding the brace and distracting attention away from it. If you don't have long hair or want a change, wearing it across your shoulder in a plait will draw attention to your face and away from the brace. Piling your hair up and slick ponytails are also great ways of bringing attention to your face and hair.

If you don't like your skin, clear it up; if you don't like your hair, get it cut or grow it out. Don't change yourself to meet someone else's standards. Instead, make yourself the kind of beautiful you want to be.;
, Try getting a haircut two weeks before school starts. Go to a salon instead of a family member. Try looking through magazines to look for good hairstyles with your head shape or ask a stylist for suggestions. Try getting a good haircut every few months.
, You should wear whatever makes you comfortable. If you're going for that ""No Makeup"" makeup look try going for natural tones. You can add eyeliner which will give a bolder look to your eyes. If you want your eyes to appear bigger, try taking a brown liner and line it from the middle of your lash line out. Add mascara to make your eyes open up and look more awake.

, Try going for necklaces or bracelets. You can wear earrings as well. Hoop earrings or studs, whatever fits with your style and what you like best. Remember that being seen as ""hot"" you have to feel it. So if you can't wait to take something off, maybe you shouldn't be wearing it. Some stores you can get earrings at are: Claire's, forever 21, justice, and many others too!

, If you like your upper half better, try wearing lighter colored tops or blouses and darker bottoms. (Dress with lighter colored bottoms if you like your lower half better.) This will draw peoples' attention to the lighter colored top/bottom first. Some stores are: Macy's, Aeropostale, American Eagle, Hollister, Forever 21, but anywhere that you can find clothes you are comfortable in is good.

, Try going for a bold color and make it neat. It won't look good if you aren't patient it will look messy. If you have very short nails try getting a cuticle gel that can make your cuticles stronger when they grow out. If you want your nails to grow faster get a nail growth miracle from Sally Hansen, it works wonders.

, If you feel more comfortable in glasses, then try finding frames that suit your face. You can ask the salesperson for help on finding the right frame for you.

, Try to not go 3 days or more without taking a shower. When you wash your hair, try to put conditioner only on the ends.If your hair is oily, wash your hair every other day and in between use dry shampoo. If you have dandruff you could get a shampoo that helps dandruff like Head and Shoulders. You should wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner for your hair type and needs (frizzy, oily, dry, flat, etc.). Some great brands are Herbal Essences (smells amazing), Aussie (great if your hair gets really greasy within a few days), Pantene (if you just want clean), Garnier Fructis (good if you have thinner hair), and TresSemme (another amazing brand).

, It's true, you can shave or wax your legs but try waxing more than shaving it last longer and grows back thinner.

, Use deodorant, perfume/body spray, take care of your dental health, and shave to smell like a goddess.

,, If people are mean to you, don't listen to them. They might be insecure about themselves. They might be jealous or they are just mean people and in that case there is not point in listening.

, If someone asks to borrow something, try to lend it to them; if someone's having trouble with something, offer to help them. It's the little things that make people realize what a good person you are.

, You can be pretty and wear the same school uniform every day, obviously. Change as many items of your clothing each day as you think it requires to make you look pretty. Try fun socks, different hair accessories, bracelets and wristbands, if you like.

, To be pretty in Catholic school, some people believe it's vital to have your mother tailor your school skirt, or any skirts you wear at school. Do this if you think it'll make you pretty. Make sure, if you have a uniform, your mother's adjustments to your skirt don't break school rules.

, Virtually all schools allow the wearing of wrist watches. Almost everyone has slim wrists - nice watches are a great way to show your style. Choose a watch your think is pretty and wear it every day. Look for one with straps you can change if you like.

, Match your necklace to your outfit. Co-ordinate it with your watch if you like. Choose a pretty necklace. At a Catholic school, a small silver or gold cross might be very appropriate.

, Try to stand up straight, walk with purpose and look cheerful. Everyone has different ideas about what is pretty, but few people are attracted to slumping, slouching, scowling girls. You might not think that altering your clothes makes you pretty, but, you won't look as pretty as you possibly can if your clothes don't fit or you don't feel comfortable in them. Adjust your clothes to make them comfortable for you, as required.

, Hopefully, your carers think you are pretty just the way you are, and, you almost Crete are pretty in your own way, but, anyone who cares about you should be happy to help you make the best of yourself so talk about all this with your mom, dad or whoever looks after you.

, Love all people, regardless of race, religion, or origin. Talk to your mother about that, too.

Take care of your luscious locks!,
Take care of your face, particularly your facial hair.,
Take care of your body.,
Have style.,
Learn about fashionable men, whether through media, real life, or literary works.,
Act like you own the place.,
Keep an intimidating or straight face.,
Be sociable.",How to Be One of the Best Looking Guys in School," Notice how cool guys always have fashionable hairstyles. Type into your search engine 'latest hair fashion for men' and see what suits you best. Remember that you must not ever try too hard or you'll look like a wannabe... so always go for a look that actually has to do with your personality.

A very handsome and manly haircut that's quite popular is the one that is short, but a bit shorter on sides than on top.
You can use a little 'styling product' to make it even better looking, like hair mousse or hair pomade. But the trick is to NEVER use way too much of it, or your hair might look greasy and weird.



 

;
, Make sure your eyebrows aren't too bushy, and if you've got a unibrow, wax or tweeze it in the middle, so you can have two brows. Also make sure your beard and mustache is always perfectly shaved, and do it carefully so you don't get hurt. Also, make sure you clean your skin well with proper face wash and use face toner. This way, your skin will look always great, which will make your face appear more attractive.

, Always eat well and exercise everyday. You don't have to go too harsh on exercising, and you can do it home. Just make sure you eat at least five meals a day in moderate portions, and everyday make sure you do at least 60 push-ups (two sets of 30 or three sets of 20) and 30 crunches (two sets of 15 or three sets of 10) every day, week, or month; whichever suits you the most.

, Part of being good-looking is how you dress. And no, you do not have to dress like a million dollars. You just have to dress stylish and cool.


Don't go overboard. Don't go for styles that simply aren't you. If you do, you'll just look like a wannabe. People respect much more a man who looks good and stylish in an effortless and natural way.

, See popular male celebrities and see what they're wearing. And no, you do not need to spend a lot of money on designers. You just need to know what type of clothes are in style and get them in less expensive places. Most popular guys go for classic or graphic tees, long sleeve button ups (and they roll up the long sleeve, which looks very cool), cargo shorts and jeans. They also go for Nike sneakers and male flip flops. Besides, a good thing about being a guy is that you don't have to have many clothes... other guys and even girls won't care that you're wearing the same shirt twice a week, as long as you're looking good in it.


Accessorize just a little. You can wear a ring or a male necklace if you like, but the main accessory is probably the watch. It must be cool and manly.







, Confidence is key in order to look ""attractive"", as it helps to attract even more attention to your new looks and style. And if you don't have confidence, just fake it... many popular kids do and people believe them.


Walk like a boss. Stand up straight, head up, then stride manly and at same time comfortably. Like you own the place. Also, face people a little as you walk, it shows them you aren't afraid of them.

, Just don't exaggerate.

, Don't be too nice, though. But do communicate with people. Ask a question or two about something interesting to strike up a conversation, then ask their name and introduce yourself.

Know the skort.,

Go a little sporty.,
Play with color and pattern.While there are some asymmetrical skorts that come in playful colors and patterns, the standard Zara skort comes in a neutral color palette—usually black, brown, tan, or white.,
Pair it with denim.",How to Wear a Skort," The traditional skort looks like a skirt from the outside but has a pair of shorts tucked away on the inside. The pieces of material are connected at one or more seams, forming a full, single garment.Most traditional skorts are standard short-length or miniskirt-length, so the lower hem falls out anywhere from the mid-thigh to the top of the knee. You may find a few that fall out at or just below the knee, but you will rarely if ever find one that reaches maxi skirt lengths.
Traditional skorts can either have a flat front and back, or they may be styled to look like “wrap around” skirts. A wrap-around skort will have one large panel that wraps all the way around the legs, ending in a flap toward the front.
Since skorts are meant to be semi-casual, they tend to be made from sturdier materials like denim or heavy cotton. Don't expect to find many skorts made from sleek satin or luxurious chiffon.;
, As a general rule, if you wouldn't buy a traditional skort as a skirt based on appearance, you shouldn't buy it. While most skorts tend to have a fairly casual style about them, you should still wear them with clothes that you would match to a casual skirt rather than clothes you would only wear with a ratty pair of shorts.


For the most part, you can make most top styles work for a traditional skort as long as they are fitted and tasteful. Play around with various tank tops and blouses. A nice, fitted t-shirt may also work depending on the style of skort.
Flats and sandals tend to be your best options if you want to keep your outfit looking casual. Avoid sneakers, though, since these might dress the look down a little too much.
Feel free to accessorize this look as desired. The key is to keep things somewhat simple, though. Avoid jewelry that adds too much “bling” or “sparkle,” since it can look a little too formal for a casual look. Big purses and smaller handbags are both good options, but clutches tend to be a little too formal, as well.

, The main problem most women have when wearing a skort is dressing it “young.” The skort itself is a fairly playful garment. If you match it with other garments that are equally youthful or playful, you run the risk of looking trapped in the past. One of the best ways to prevent this from happening is to pair the skort with trendy, sophisticated pieces.


For your top, look at contemporary styles found almost exclusively in the women's department--scoopnecks, blouses with asymmetrical necklines, or shirts with open backs.
Gravitate toward trendy footwear and accessories. Metallic pumps, gladiator sandals, or wedge heels in bold colors all make good options. Chunky bracelets or necklaces with large gems and medallions can also work well.

, Another way to turn the traditional skort into a piece befitting an adult woman is to pair it with classic wardrobe staples. Classic cuts, styles, and colors tend to have a sophisticated, clean look, which can give your overall style a sense of maturity.


Mature patterns can include pinstripes and subtle floral prints, but solid colors are also a great option. Cut and material often make a bigger difference than color and pattern. Button-down cotton blouses have an undeniably classic appeal, but so do solid piece blouses made from luxurious fabrics, like satin or chiffon.
Stick with classic shoes if you want to keep your outfit looking sophisticated. Black stilettos are a great option, but if you're not fond of heels, a patent leather flat can be just as effective.

, If you do want to get playful with your traditional skort, a good way to do it is to wear trendy patterns or trendy colors. These patterns can either be on the skort itself or on the top you pair with it.


As a general rule, restrict the pattern to one part of your outfit—either the skort, top, or shoes. Do not mix and match your patterns, since doing so will usually clash.
If you're looking for a bold blouse pattern, try on large floral print, large polka dots, or bright stripes. When you're feeling a bit fearsome, you could even slip on leopard or snake print.
For a bold shoe choice, animal print and stripes are usually your best bets. You might also want to consider a shoe in a bold yet solid color.

, There are two factors that could classify a skort as “sporty,” and those would be material and cut.


When material is the key factor, the skorts will have a traditional skirt-style cut but will be made of material typically used for active wear, like spandex.
When cut is the key factor, the skorts can be made from active wear materials like spandex or more versatile materials like cotton, but they only look like a skirt from the front. From the back, the shorts part of the skort can be seen very clearly.

, The general consensus in the fashion world is that sporty skorts should only be worn when you are actually playing sports or doing a similar form of physical activity. These skorts are a little more fashion forward than plain spandex shorts, but they still don't have enough flair to wear around in other contexts.

, Since you'll mostly be wearing this skort when you plan on working up a sweat, the rest of your clothes should be chosen with the same purpose. Even so, you can dress the skort down by choosing more standard, casual pieces of active wear or dress it up by picking out other trendy options.


Tank tops work great with these skorts, especially those with racerback straps. Any clothes you would usually wear when physically active would theoretically work, though, as long as they are fitted and flatter your body type.
Sneakers are the shoe of choice here, but you don't have to restrict yourself to anything dull. Consider adding more flair to your outfit with neon shoes.

, This is a fairly new style of skort, so many people may not be aware of it yet. Like the traditional style, this skort appears to be a skirt from the front, and the shorts are hidden completely inside the garment. Unlike the traditional skort, though, the Zara skort looks like a wrap-around skirt, and the front of it dips up at a jagged angle. As a result, it looks as though a triangular portion of material has been cut out from the front of the garment.


The original version of this skirt was made by Zara, a Spanish clothing brand. Other designers have duplicated this asymmetrical look, but the style itself is still commonly referred to by the Zara label that pioneered it.
Due to the folds and sharp angle of this skort, some have also dubbed it the “origami skort.”

, Since this asymmetrical skort is already on the edgy side of fashion, it works well with other pieces that are just as fresh and unconventional. To prevent the look from getting too out of control, just make sure that the colors and cuts coordinate with each other. If you have a bold pattern on top, go for a Zara skort in a solid color, and vice versa.


For something funky yet casual, wear a simple scoop neck t-shirt with your Zara skort. Opt for funky, edgy accessories, like gladiator sandals, chunky bracelets, and large gemstone rings.
If you want to make things funky yet dressy, consider a metallic satin blouse or tank, paired with tall heels and one notable piece of jewelry.

, As a trendy item, the Zara skort carries an air of sophistication with it. To draw its sophisticated side out, pair the skort with tops and shoes that come in classic cuts, patterns, and styles.


A simple button-down shirt works well, but so does a sleek, elegant blouse made with luxurious materials like chiffon, silk, or satin.
If your top is classic enough, your shoes can either be classic or funky. For a classic option, consider simple black stilettos. For something a little funkier, try a metallic pump or gladiator sandals.
Keep your jewelry looking classic and sophisticated. Think along the lines of simple gold or silver chains. You can mix some gemstones in, as well, but avoid anything that looks too flashy.

, If done right, you can pay homage to the skorts sporty roots by pairing the Zara skort with clothing that looks a little sporty. Avoid “work out” clothes made of spandex or similar materials and opt for clothes that look sporty in cut and style, but not material.


For your top, try wearing a simple cotton tank top, a jersey supporting your favorite sports team, or a moderately oversized hoodie. When wearing an oversized top, consider wearing a tank top underneath it, allowing the strap of the tank to be visible underneath the wide neck of the shirt.
You can dress the look up by wearing single strap stilettos or dress it down further with fun neon sneakers.
Keep your accessories to a minimum for this look. A baseball cap works well, as does simple jewelry—think bangle bracelets and pendant chain necklaces.

, As a result, you can have a lot of fun playing around with different colors and patterns in the rest of your outfit.


Try color blocking. Choose a skort with a bold hue and match it with a top in a solid, complementary color.
You can also play with other color combinations. Slip on a nude colored top or opt for a semi-monochromatic color scheme.
Nearly any pattern can be matched with this sort of skort as long as the cut of the top flatters your body type. Consider nautical stripes, flannel, pinstripes, polka dots, or floral print.

, The Zara skort is trendy and semi-dressy. Denim, on the other hand, is classic and casual. The two may seem to be complete opposites, but the major difference between the two is what makes them work surprisingly well together.


Mix in denim by wearing a denim button-down shirt. You can keep it buttoned up or wear it open and over a simple fitted tank top.
Alternatively, carry a denim handbag or wear denim flats.
Stick with one denim piece per outfit to keep the balance of trendy and classic in check.

Be nice and smile.",How to Be One of the Best Looking Girls in Your Class," Take a shower to wash your body every day. Use a matching shower gel and body lotion, and exfoliate weekly. Brush your teeth and tongue 2-3 times a day with whitening toothpaste, use floss and possibly mouthwash. However, if you have marks on your teeth from braces, go and see the dentist to see what can be done. Use deodorant or anti-perspirant that smells good, don't forget to spray your feet and use perfume on pulse points!;
, It boosts your confidence and you will be toned and fit in no time. You don't have to go to the gym; you could take yoga classes, jog or take dance classes. Try to do two sessions of weights and three of cardio per week.

, For example, greasy hair usually needs clarifying/volumizing products, and dry hair needs more nourishment. Wash your hair at 3-4 times a week. Refrain from cheap products, as they probably won't help your hair. Always comb/brush your hair, as it must look neat and be really clean. You can also change your hairstyle, and do different things with it, like loose curls, poker-straight, up-dos, clips, head bands... Loose, ""bedhead"" layers are in, as well. Long, lush locks with a sweeping side fringe are fashionable and very womanly. Always choose a hair-style that suits your face shape and lifestyle. Use a deep-conditioning/hot oil treatment weekly.

, Feeling good makes you automatically look good. Take a relaxing bath, have a facial, pedicure and manicure weekly. All of these can be done at home or at a salon. If at home, use skin products that match your skin's needs; like an oil-free moisturizer for oily skin.

, Never exaggerate or over-do makeup application, as you'll end up looking trashy. Always moisturise and wash your face before applying. For example, an ordinary school day: tinted foundation/powder, concealer, light powder/cream eye shadow (brown suits most eye colours), a bit of natural-looking blusher, a little brown/black mascara (after curling lashes with a quality lash curler), and clear/lightly tinted lip gloss.

, Visit www.vogue.com, or read OK! occasionally to see styles that are ""in"" at the moment. You don't have to spend hundreds of pounds/dollars to look fashionable though. Get your clothes, don't buy ""outfits"", buy pieces you can mix and match to see what looks great! Buy new clothes that fit you perfectly. Don't forget, the number on the label is just that; a number. You can always cut the label out. As long as you are healthy and fit, they don't matter. However, this doesn't mean you should get stressed out with the latest fashions all the time. Try being a trend-setter, instead of a trend-follower!

, An unfriendly person becomes instantly ugly, even if they're pretty on the outside. Be yourself and treat people well, also study and pay attention in class and watch documentaries, watch the news, and read non-fiction books and newspapers so you can hold intelligent conversation. A pretty person becomes prettier when she is clever and nice!

Look your best.,
Be confident.,
Have a good attitude.,
Dress cute.",How to Be Popular in School While on a Budget,"

Wear the least make-up possible. No more than 4 products at a time is perfect. Eyeliner is usually the best place to add a pop of color, because it's subtle but visible, but don't cake it on or you will look like a raccoon! This will also make your eyes look bigger, and your skin look clearer. Try a little concealer and mascara; it can go a long way.



 


Have good hygiene. Take daily showers and wear deodorant. Shave wherever needed. Use oil blotter sheets, have good breath (brush teeth, use mouthwash and mints, and stop lying to your dentist about flossing. Actually do it.) Then, people won't be grossed out around you. It's a little uncomfortable to sit close to someone who has B.O. or is very severely broken out. If you want to take this up a step and be actively pleasant to sit close to, wear subtle but not overpowering perfume. Get a prescription to keep your skin presentable. Health insurance should cover this, and it works a lot better than some 'over the counter' brands






Have really nice hair. Keep it shiny with at home gloss treatments this is a lot cheaper! Use good smelling shampoo and conditioner, do not wash your hair daily unless you have to because it is not good for your hair. To get the shampoo really worked in, massage your scalp, start from the roots, and focus mostly on the top of your head. Please don't mess with your ends because the shampoo will rinse downward so you don't have to wash. You don't want more split ends! Blow dry when you have to be somewhere (it's faster and guarantees straightness). With your head upside down, after combing with a wide tooth comb (never brush wet hair - it makes it limp and weak). Blow drying can have an effect on your hair, so use a moisturizing shampoo and just leave in your conditioner for a few minutes. Also, be sure to brush, use leave-in conditioner, basics like that. Some popular styles are: messy buns, half ponytails, the very top pulled back and the rest curled, crimps, etc. Skinny headbands are also classic, but wearing your hair down can work wonders (and makes you look really pretty since it works for all face shapes.)






Stay in shape. Being active really helps. Join a sports team, try Pilates (if you can afford it), or just jog. Whatever it takes for *you* to look great. It's better to exercise a lot so you can still eat junk food once in a while than to loaf on the couch all day eating nothing but celery.





;
, Be the one always laughing and make sure you are the one people love to be around when upset and just normally as you should be fun and positive, not the negative person with a bad attitude and a habit to backchat! Lots of people let the fact that they aren't Megan Fox get them down. Don't let that happen to you. Being classy and having money don't have to go hand in hand. In Paris's case, for example, they don't. Instead, think of all the great things about yourself. Are you cute, smart, cool, nice, funny? The world is lucky to have you. Really. To show that you're confident, have good posture (the more you hear it, the less insane it sounds), smile, and don't bully people. If you really feel good about yourself, you don't need to bring other people down (that's why bullies are bullies - they need to feel better than *someone*). Be totally sure of everything you do, from making your bed to filing your nails. Just think of everything you have to offer-the world would really, really, be poorer without you.

, Try to be the one who enlightens moods and makes people laugh, without going to extremes and just simple don't care about the negative! You don't need to be a caricature of Paula Abdul or anything, but be happy whenever possible. Try to find the fun in any situation-it'll make *you* fun! Oh, be nice to anyone you don't hate, and if you totally can't stand someone, don't snap at them unless they started it. If, however, they *did* start it, have a few good comebacks, and just walk away! Don't be the one who's always caught up in drama as people would rather stay away from you and your drama self.

, See, this is where the whole budget thing comes in. Your best bet is the clearance rack or outlets and factory stores. These are tricky to find, but well worth it! If you really can't afford these whatsoever, even on sale, that's perfectly all right, most Americans can't. There's nothing wrong with you or your budget! Just get some cute basics, even if they're from supermarkets, and have fun with them! Get some solid basics first though. You'll want a nice pair of skinny cut jeans that will last. Also a white tee shirt can be dressed up or down. You can always add accessories to your closet, and still look great. You will want to invest in the jeans though. Go to a good store, and at least check out what they have. If you don't have the money, then you can always go back to a different store and buy it for a lower price.

Take a shower every day, preferably in the morning. The shower will wake you up, and there's a chance your body could sweat in the night.
NOTE: If you have brothers or sisters who take showers in the morning, and there is only one shower, take a shower before you go to bed. If it's hot out, don't sleep with the covers, and sleep with the sheets instead!
Wash your hair every other day. Washing it too often can strip natural oils and cause frizziness.
Find shampoos and conditioners that suit your hair's texture. If you have a dry scalp, you may consider using a dandruff shampoo.
Don't use too much of any product. Too much gel or mousse can result in a really bad hair day!;
, Drink a lot of water and find a lotion that suits your skin. There are different types of lotion for different skin types.


If your face is oily, always use moisturizer. It may seem ironic but it's still important. Use one that's meant for someone who has acne.
If your skin is dry, use a thicker cream based moisturizer. It will help your skin stay moisturized longer.

, Washing your face will help wash away dirt and layers of skin that build up over the day.


Try to find a face wash that is appropriate for your skin. You probably want a ""non-comedogenic"" wash, which simply means that it won't clog your pores.
If you're beginning to get pimples, use over the counter acne products. If it's getting worse and you're worried about it, visit your doctor who can prescribe something to help.

, Find a length that compliments the shape of your face and that you're happy with. Your hair makes a big impact on your image.


Ask your hairstylist what would be suitable for you. Choose a hairstyle that is easy to maintain.

Stay away from yellow and neon blue! They will make your teeth look yellow, and not white.

, Wear clothes that properly fit and that you feel good in.


Dress for the weather. If it's summer, wear something that's light and cool. If it's winter, wear something that will keep you warm.

, Certain colors look better on certain skin tones and with certain hair colors.


Wear blues, greens, and browns to bring out your eyes, and pinks to bring out the pink in your cheeks.
Redheads look beautiful in green; however, avoid lime or neon greens. Try to find dark forest greens that make your hair stand out.
If your skin has yellow tones, be careful wearing oranges and yellows.

,


Go for different shoes in different seasons. If you live in a place that gets cold during the winter, you obviously wouldn't wear flip-flops in December.

, A smile is a great accessory! Brush your teeth twice or more every day to get a beautiful white smile.


If you can't brush your teeth after every meal, chew on a piece of sugar-free gum. It'll make your breath smell nice and keep your teeth clean.

, Confidence is attractive, so be proud of who you are.


Throw your shoulders back and your chin up high.
Keep your hair out of your face and smile.

Line your pout with a concealer.",How to Make Thin Lips Appear Fuller1," Dry lips don’t reflect light and can make your lips look smaller and less full. Before you start contouring your lips with makeup, brush off any flakes and moisturize your lips to smooth out your canvas.Brush your lips lightly with a toothbrush in a circular motion. This can remove dry flakes and improve circulation, which gives your lips a small boost and rosy color.
Rub a bit of sugar or brown sugar on your lips. This can remove flakes, add moisture, and boost your circulation.
Consider buying a commercial lip exfoliator, which may have added moisturizers. You can purchase these products at many pharmacies, large retailers, and cosmetics stores.;
, A lip liner can optically change the contours of your lips. It can also give them the appearance of more depth, which in turn makes your pout appear fuller and more luscious.Choose a liner that matches the color lip you want to achieve. The darker the lipstick, the darker your lip liner should be. For example, if you want to do a pretty red lip, consider a dark chocolate liner. For a nude lip, you may want to try a pink, nude or white liner. Remember that you don’t want to choose a liner that is too dark or the first thing people may see is your liner and not your fuller lips.
Make sure your liner is sharpened to get the most accurate lines. You can soften up the lines by gently dabbing them with your finger.Start by lining the cupid’s bow of your lip. Extend the liner slightly above the cupid’s bow to make the shape of your lips larger. After this, line the center of your lower lip using the same technique. Then draw the outer corners of your lips. Again, you can extend the lines slightly above and below your lip line to make them appear fuller. Finally, connect the lines and blend them together with your finger.

, Now you’re ready to add some color to your pout. You can use a lipstick, gloss, or lip pencil to fill the contours between your liner with color.Apply the color using the lipstick tube, a separate applicator, or your fingers.
Focus on filling the corners of your pout with color. Extend the color to the middle of your lips by making short strokes that start at the liner outline and extend up to the center of your lips.

, Once you’ve filled your lips with your color of choice, blend it together so that it appears smooth. You may need to add a bit more color or may want to use a lip brush to smooth out any uneven areas.Consider using a brighter shade of lipstick to blend your base color. This can add highlights and depth to the color, which can make your lips appear fuller.
Start at the center of your mouth and use short blending strokes to even out the color. Avoid getting too close to the outline of your lips you made with the liner. This can erase the depth and fullness you created.

, A bit of highlighter will draw the eyes to the center of your lips, which is the fullest part. It also adds even more fullness and depth to the shape you’ve created with the liner and lip color.Use either a specific lip highlighting cream or try a shimmery powder. Lightly press the highlighter to the center of your bottom lip with either your finger or a lip brush. Blend in the highlighter so that it produces a gently shimmer on your lower lip.
Consider applying a lip gloss if you don’t want to use a highlighter. Dabbing a bit of clear gloss on the middle of your lower lip will have the same effect as a highlighter.Try this contouring trick to even out lips. Apply two different colors in the same shade family. Apply one shade all over your mouth and then a lighter color on the opposite lip that you want to appear fuller.

, Moist lips naturally appear more full. Add a bit of moisture and wetness back to your lips by using a lip balm. Avoid using gloss, which may dry out your lips and be a bit too much with your color.Use most lip balms to get the effect you want. You may also consider using a rose balm, which will moisturize your lips while giving them the slightest hint of extra shine. Rose lip balms are generally a product made out of petroleum jelly and rosewater or rose petals. These ingredients can soothe and moisturize your lips in addition to giving them a little shine.

, After you’ve got the luscious pout you want, seal it and make your lips pop even more by lining the outside with a concealer. Use a thin brush to apply a concealer that matches your skin tone. Not only can this make your lips appear even fuller, but it may also prevent the color from bleeding or fading."

Boost circulation.,
Try a lip plumper.,
Apply a shimmery gloss.,
Avoid dark lipstick.,
Fake a larger canvas.",How to Make Thin Lips Appear Fuller2," A flaky, dry pout won’t reflect light, which can make a small pout appear even smaller. Applying a moisturizing balm or treatment product to your lips daily can keep them hydrated and looking full.Buy a product that contains ingredient such as shea butter, which can moisturize your lips throughout the day. Another good option is a rose lip balm, which is high in moisture and smells good. You can find moisturizing lip products at pharmacies, large retailers, and cosmetics stores.
Reapply the lip balm whenever your lips feel dry. Consider using a heavier balm at night or you may want to try a lip conditioning treatment.

, Having plenty of blood flow to your lips can also make them appear bigger and naturally rosy. Gently rubbing your lips can give you a fuller looking pout quickly and anytime you like.Use a toothbrush or your fingers to gently massage your lips. Make sure to get the entire surface by rubbing in small circles.
Biting your lip gently may have the same effect. Be careful that you don’t bite open your lip if you try this.

, There are certain natural products that can plump up your lips without fillers or surgery. Products containing mint, cinnamon, or camphor can boost your lips—and blood flow to them-- for a few hours.Get a product that contains camphor, mint, or cinnamon. You can find these by reading the labels of products available at cosmetics stores, pharmacies, and large retailers. You can also get specially formulated products for plumping your lips at these retailers.
Be aware that some lip plumping products or balms with mint, camphor, or cinnamon can cause allergic reactions. Avoid any products containing ingredients to which you’re allergic or discontinue use if you experience any discomfort or signs of an allergy such as a rash.

, If you want to keep your look simple and avoid plumpers or fully contouring your lips with makeup, dab on a shimmery gloss in a light color. The shimmer can reflect light and a gloss mimics very hydrated lips, both of which can make your pout appear fuller and more luscious.Go with a gloss in a light pink or peach and that has small shimmery bits of gold in it. If you are able, test the gloss for its plumping effect before your buy it.
Try a nude lipstick if you want to avoid a gloss or product with shimmer. Nude lipstick can have the same effect as a shimmery gloss.

, A light, shimmery color will make your lips look more hydrated and fuller. By contrast, a dark lipstick can flatten the appearance of your mouth. Stay away from dark, matte lipsticks as much as possible to keep your pout looking full and luscious.Be aware that darker colors can be much more difficult to apply than a lighter shade that will naturally plump your pout.
Try contouring if you absolutely want to wear a darker lip. This technique can help you create depth even if you are using a darker color.

, It’s easy to fake a fuller lip without dedicating time to contouring. Using concealer or a lip liner around your lips can create a more luscious pout.Apply a dab of bronzer or a darker neutral powder under your lower lip line to create more volume. Make sure to blend in the powder as much as possible so it isn’t the first thing people notice about your mouth.
Pat some concealer on to your lips just slightly above your natural lip line. This can smooth out your lips for color and make the canvas for the color larger without being too obvious.Line and fill your lips with a nude lip liner. Extend the contours of the liner just above your natural lip line. Once you’ve covered the outside and inside of your lips with the pencil, go over it with a clear gloss to make your lips appear moist and full.

Make or purchase a suitable pouch.,
Fill it with your favorite brands of pads or tampons.,
Include pantie liners.,
Add hygienic wipes or tissues.,
Add an extra pair of underwear.,
Consider including a more fun item to brighten your day if you need it.,
Remember to restock your period pouch daily or at the end of every cycle.",How to Make a Period Pouch," It can be a simple bag with a zipper that you sew up at home or a very small sized makeup bag. It must be able to fit into your purse, schoolbag or sleepover tote, and should be small and discreet enough to not attract much attention.


When determining the size of the pouch, think ahead of how many items you'll need to stock inside of it. This may vary amongst different periods, as some flows are heavier than others.;
, Include a mix of items that cater to different period necessities, such as different sized tampons and a few regular and super pads. In case you may be caught somewhere overnight, add at least one heavy duty overnight pad.

, These items will always come in handy, no matter your situation or flow.

, These come in handy to ensure freshness when you're in a bend.

, There's nothing worse than bleeding through and being without a change of underwear. It may also be a good idea to include a few dollars in case you need to buy new underpants and you're without cash.

, Think about what has the ability to really improve what seems like a bleak situation, such as a few lollipops or scented hand-sanitizer., Keep purchasing and adding more items so when you most need it, your period pouch is there for you!"

Learn to accept yourself for who you are.",How to Look Cute for Boys1," Before someone can like you, you need to like yourself. When you look in the mirror, do you like what you see? If you do, that's great! If you don't, try pointing out things that you do like about yourself. You may have great hair, or maybe pretty eyes. Focus on the beautiful things, and expand on those.



Be Yourself. Never change who you are for someone else. Even if you feel like there's nothing special about you, there is something deep down inside that is beautiful. Let that blossom, and learn to accept who you are!

Clear up your skin.,
Be Clean.,
Take care of your hair.,
Try makeup!",How to Look Cute for Boys2," Acne is in no way pretty. If you have acne, or are prone to breakouts, clearing up your skin can definitely be helpful. Wash your face with a face wash twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. Use a good moisturizer, preferably with SPF in it. Be careful not to use a harsh face wash, because these can irritate and dry out your face. If you have dark marks, invest in a good dark spot corrector. These can take a while to fade, but be patient, in the end, it will work eventually.


Avoid touching your face with your hands, especially if they are not clean. Touching your face with dirty hands leads to pimples.






If you have bangs, try pinning them back. Bangs can trap dirt on your forehead, leading to huge breakouts.





;
, If you smell something stinky, it may be you. Try bathing once or twice a day. Use a nice smelling soap and shampoo, but don't use harsh products that will dry your skin out. Brush your teeth three times a day. Clean teeth, and fresh breath are a great help.


If you are old enough, or are allowed to, shave your legs. Hairy legs can be a big turn off. If you are nervous about shaving your legs, get help. Don't attempt to shave your legs if you don't know how to.







, When you look at someone, you usually look at their hair. Frizzy, dry hair, isn't very pretty. So take good care of your hair. Moisturize daily if you can. Comb your hair gently, being careful not to rip or tug at it.


Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo. Avoid washing your hair everyday, because this will strip it of it's natural oils, leading to dry, frizzy hair. Always condition after shampooing.







, Don't go crazy with the makeup! Keep a cute and fresh look, not cakey or crazy makeup. A little mascara, a kiss of lip-gloss, and a dash of eye shadow, and your set! If you are the daring type, don't be afraid to experiment! Winged eyeliner, and bright red lipstick look beautiful!

Buy a light weight carry on bag.,
Find your essentials.,
Think carefully before you pack.,
Consider whether you need to pack medications.,
Roll your clothes up as tight as you can to prevent wrinkles and save space.,
Make sure you follow the 3-1-1 rule.,
Bring a reasonable amount of entertainment.,
Pack your personal item too, if needed.,
Once your past security, buy a bottle of water.",How to Pack Your Carry On (Teen Girl)," If you can fit everything inside a duffel bag, those are lightweight and work super well, but sometimes your best option is a suitcase if you're going to be gone a little longer. Make sure to choose a light one, preferably weather-proof and with 4 wheels, but everyone prefers different things.


Remember, your bag needs to look and be light. Otherwise, if your bag is too big, the airport staff may make you weigh it or check it- the entire thing you want to avoid. Airport staff do this because big bags will take up more space in the overhead cabin, which uses up everyone's space, as well as being hard to lift up and put back down.;
, These would be your phone, boarding pass, ticket and passport. Put all of those in a separate compartment or bag so they don't get lost., Do you really need all this stuff? Be as simple as possible.  If you are going on a ten day trip, for example, don't pack in ten shirts. Pack around 6-7 shirts. Usually, a t-shirt doesn't start going dirty until the second or third day. Perhaps buy a light dress to wear on your holiday. It won't take up as much room, and lightweight dresses are really cute.

Pack a minimal number of shoes. The weight limit for carry-on suitcases is normally extremely low, and shoes use up a lot of that weight allowance, as well as space in your bag.
Wear your heaviest clothes on the plane, so that all your light clothes will fit in your bag.

, Airplanes can make you feel like you're coming down with the cold, which, if you're on an airplane, you most likely are. If you do, bring some Airborne with you. They come in tablet forms or little packets of the powder. Just drop it in some water then drink it, it will make you feel better.


If you tend to get motion sickness, bring anti-diarrhea and anti-nausea pills.

, You can also stuff socks into your shoes to save some room. Tuck your underwear in between the gaps of all your clothes. If your clothes are all rolled and folded tidily, you can easily put your underwear in between the gaps. This will also make it easier later when unpacking., Only bring liquids and gels under 3 oz., put them all in a 1 quart bag, and 1 bag per person. Bring a little bottle of lotion and a little thing of moisturizer (your skin will surely get dry from all the recycled air) and hand sanitizer (planes aren't exactly the cleanest things on earth).


If you wear makeup: put it all in the 1 quart bag. Only bring a bit though, and you still have to follow the 3 oz. rule. Try not to bring too much.

, Don't bring too many books or tons of heavy supplies. Consider a music player or your phone, and a book or e-reader.

, Most airlines allow a bag to go in the overhead bin, as well as a bag to store under the seat in front of you that you can use the whole flight. This smaller bag is called a personal item and is usually a purse or backpack. So make sure to fill this with all the heavy stuff, since they almost never make you weigh your personal item because it is not put in the overhead. If you want to bring along a book or your iPod on the plane to entertain you, go right ahead! Just make sure to put it in your personal item, since that's the only thing you can use well in flight!, They won't let you bring a bottle of it with you through security, but items that you buy past security are considered safe. Water will keep you hydrated.

Help your friend see the errors of his/her unfashionable ways.,
Show your friend how improving his/her fashion will be beneficial.,
Use your fashion sense to demonstrate how enhancing his/her image is easy.,
Evaluate the hairstyle.,
Determine if special grooming is necessary.",How to Help a Fashion‐Challenged Person," If your friend is having trouble securing work or may not be taken seriously by the opposite sex show him/her why fashion may be a big reason.


Hidden camera. There’s nothing quite like seeing what you look like on camera to hit home your point. Set up a “nanny cam” or a flip camera in your home and invite your friend over. Most likely, he/she will show up in the typical garb, which can shine the light on areas that may need extra attention.
Testimony from friends and relatives. Talk to friends and relatives about how they feel about your friend’s clothing. However, only discuss the topic with friends that you know your buddy can trust. You don’t want this fun intervention to turn into an instance where your friend feels as if you are talking about him/her on the sly.
Research what the experts say. For example, if your friend is having a difficult time landing a job as an accountant but insists on continuing to wear dreadlocks from college, gather research about what kind of look account firms go for in applicants.;
, Explain to your friend that you don’t want him/her to completely change their style, but refine and polish it in order to achieve goals. Ask your friend if his/her current style is working out and if meeting the right men or women, for example is working well. Most likely the answer will be no.


At work. Tell your friend he/she should dress for the job he/she wants, not the job he/she has. Find examples of professionals working in your friend’s dream job to demonstrate the types of looks that would be appropriate.
In the dating world. Does your friend seem to attract the wrong people during the initial meeting? If your friend is wearing a style that continuously attracts the same type of thug, go to the bar and people watch. Look for the type of person your friend would be attracted to and see how that person pairs off. What does the girl or guy look like and how are they dressed?
As an overall confidence booster. If you don’t think you look good, you certainly won’t feel good. Explain to your friend that he/she will conjure up more confidence knowing that when he/she leaves the house in the morning, others will positively note the look.

, In some cases your friend is more afraid about putting time and money into fashion and has the “I don’t really care” attitude because its easier. However, if you show your pal that fashion doesn’t have to be back breaking, you may win him/her over.


Show him/her how to shop for a bargain. If your friend has never learned how to properly shop for a bargain, invite him/her to go on a shopping excursion and impart your wisdom about the right shops to hit and insight on the best days to find deals.
Find clothing that will flatter his/her shape. Try on a variety of outfits until you find a “formula” that will enhance his/her body. You aren’t looking for revealing clothing, but something that will provide a pleasing appearance where your friend really “wears the clothes” instead of the “clothes wearing your friend.”
Select outfits that enhance skin tone and hair. Not everyone looks stunning in every color so try on a shirts in a variety of shades until you find one that compliments both hair and skin tone. Try to inject that color or colors into every outfit through accessories or within the clothing.
Put together different “looks.” Find a variety of “looks” that compliments your friend’s style and fits into his/her lifestyle. Consider work, fitness and social outfits. Don’t forget about accessories and shoes--equally as important as the clothing.

, Is your buddy still rooted in the 1980’s or insists that a mullet looks awesome? Part of being fashionable in 2012 means that you need the right hair.


Go through magazines and select hair styles he/she likes. Find his/her favorite celebrity and choose one or two styles. Suggest that your friend find a celebrity or hair model that has similar texture hair and possibly a person who seems to be within the same age group to land the most appropriate style.
Test drive different hairstyles online or at a wig store. While seeing the style in a magazine is one thing, test driving the style is something else. Consider what your friend would look like in the style by either trying on different wigs or visiting one of the many online free hairstyling sites that allow you to match different styles with your photo.
Visit a professional stylist to create a new hair masterpiece. The best way to get a solid cut is to visit a salon that staffs trained professionals. While the initial haircut and possibly color may cost a little more money, visit a professional for that first style and then (if necessary) go to a lower end salon and have the stylist simply follow the lines set forth by the original cut.

, Part of having a fashionable look means being well groomed. Even men need a little plucking, waxing and buffing every now and again.


Nails, brows and unwanted hair. Part of your new look is to present a polished and refined exterior so examine the brows, nails and body to see if you need anything waxed, polished or buffed. Even men could use some shaping if they are donning a uni-brow or to remove excess hair around the neck or shoulders area.
Make up and skin. A solid skincare routine will help your buddy’s confidence and provide him/her with a fresher, more youthful appearance. If necessary consult with a dermatologist to tackle any aggressive acne or skin issues. Also, for women visit a professional make-up artist to identify a make-up line that will compliment her age and lifestyle. Ask the artist to show your friend how to apply the make up in a way that will work well with her lifestyle--especially if she is a mom or professional-on-the-go.

Accessorize.,
Keep your face natural.",How to Look Good with a Dress Code at School," Most dress codes define a few school required colors that you can't shift outside. However, there are ways around this, such as getting a different hue of the required color, to stand out from everyone else's. You can sometimes wear differently colored socks or a colorful hair ribbon, to add a color that isn't usually permitted.;
, Have your shirt fitted or buy a fitted one to make it unique to you. Depending on the shirt you have to wear, getting creative with designs and styles will complement any dress code. Most teen clothing stores have great shirts that can be great for school and a great price. Mix and match.

, If you are allowed or required to wear pants or jeans, find pants that will go well with your figure and shirt. Make sure it is appropriate for school, because one reason schools have dress codes in the first place is to monitor the appropriateness of it. If they do not mind, get creative with colors and styles. Colored pants are very fashionable, and are excellent to experiment with.

, If you are required to wear skirts, change their length. If you find your skirts to be too long, it may be okay to roll it up a bit. A little bit above the knee may not be too noticeable. If a teacher does notice, you can always roll it down.


Skirt styles can vary considerably if the code is only concerned with length and color. Consider A-line, flowing maxis, pleats, layered skirts, etc., to set yourself apart with a stylish skirt.
Ensure that you have gym skirts or shorts when needed. A flowing maxi won't impress your sports teacher one bit.

, You're more likely to get away with variations on the theme in a dress code if you present a very neat and tidy look that shows style, care and flair.

, Stick to the dress code more on shoes in general. Have a few pretty flats, a pair of cute sneakers for gym class, and shoes like winter and rain-boots. Some schools prefer white socks, but if your school has no preference, mix it up with bright colors.

, Hair doesn't seriously affect the dress code, so making it look creative and fashionable can really add a great touch to your outfit. Wear your hair in a hairstyle that will go well with any clothes. Try wearing braids, a bun, a messy or simple ponytail, or allow it to stay down. Or, add a headband or a ribbon to accessorize your hair.


You should stick to the school colors to really contrast with the dress code, or black or white (only wear black if you have light hair).

, Many schools have a policy against jewelry or just during physical education, but if not, get fancy with necklaces, bracelets or earrings.


Don't wear anything valuable. Turning yourself into a target for robbing isn't smart.

, Use subtle foundation in the right shade. Don't wear anything else, apart from mascara if you wear glasses. Don't wear any nail polish except clear, which lots of schools also have a policy about, but keeping your nails nice and clean will make you look great.


Teachers are less likely to notice or care if the makeup isn't obvious.

Take a Shower.,
Wash your hair.,

Pick an outfit.,
Pick some shoes.,
Accessorize.,
Do your nails if you like.,
Equip your Handbag.,
Don't overdo it on the scent.",How to Look Your Best for an Outing With Someone You Like (Teen Girls)," Make sure to shampoo and repeat, condition, body wash, and face cleanse. Make sure to remove all the make-up you had on before to reapply it later. For silkier hair, brush/ comb your hair before the shower, and leave the conditioner in for 5-10 minutes or just use a leave-in conditioner if you have one.;
, Towel Dry for a while, then air dry. If you want to straighten or curl your hair with an iron/ blow-out then make sure you partially dried your hair and it is still damp when you start. Go from bottom to top, while holding the parts you're not straightening/curling with a clip. Add tangle-spray to make your hair easy to deal with, and at the end you can add a little hairspray. Decide if you want your hair up or down. Most girls prefer down, which shows off the hair, but up shows off the face and makes you look taller with bigger eyes and skinnier face.

, Don't exaggerate, most boys hate that. For eyes, which are most important, mascara and eyeliner/eye pencil work best. You can play a little with the colors, but black looks most classic. The whole point of make-up is to make you look better and hide the things you don't like, so if you want more attention on your lips don't over-exaggerate on your eyes and so on. Don't put an inch of foundation on your face, and make sure you put the make-up on after everything, and fifteen minutes before you leave the door so it has time to dry.

, Plan before everything what you're going to wear. Things you need to worry about (in order) are:


Whether your outfit is appropriate for the place and occasion you're going to. (Don't exaggerate or under-go, and dress for the weather.)
If it flatters your body (Too small or too big on you, enhances the butt, cleavage too big, color makes you look sick...)
If it's you and you feel good in it.
If it's comfortable.
If you think it's pretty and you like it..

, Walk around the house if you're not sure if they're comfortable or aren't used to them yet. Make sure they match the outfit, and that they're not too big or too small. If you're going with heels, practice walking in them so you don't trip. Ask a friend for a second opinion if you're unsure.

, Of course this depends what you're wearing and where you're going, but usually just 1-3 accessories is more than enough. Bracelets, brooches, pins, necklaces, earrings, piercings... Make sure you match it too the outfit, and that it doesn't look like you went to buy it all in one dollar.

, This is something you can go crazy with. It doesn't have to match the outfit, but you could match it. If you can, go to a nail salon before, but if you're doing this at home make sure you do it right after the shower and don't try to multitask or move until 10 minutes later.

, Inside should be a cellphone, iPod (iPhone), lip gloss, all the make-up you used before you left the house just in case, gum, tissues, Purell and deodorant. Don't overdo it with things you bring though, and make sure the bag matches the outfit. Bring tampons/pads if you need, but hide them well.

, Boys hate when you wear too much perfume, but a little on the wrists and neck is fine. Try a VS perfume. Roll on also works quite well. Go for something more orange or vanilla scented. Apply deodorant and put it in your bag. Brush and floss your teeth, and mouthwash right before you leave. Wash your hands and feet carefully in the shower. ==

Sleep well to reduce bags and dark circles under your eyes.

, Apply polish if you want, but remember to put on a base coat first to protect your natural nails. Try to invest on a good base coat, it may be expensive, but it's worth it. Do some fun nail art. It will give your nails personalities. Cute polish is a really good nail guru, and her designs are really pretty yet so easy.

, Just apply concealer, loose powder, mascara and some lip gloss. Look for tutorials on YouTube.

, This will help you so much in school. Get a new backpack if your old one seems... bad. Buy some book covers for your books, this will make studying more fun. Get enough supplies for school. A pencil, a blue and red pen, eraser, ruler and sticky notes are some basic must-haves.

, You'll never know when you'll need them. They will be a life-saver when it comes to homework, assignments and tests. Highlight some of the important words or phrases/sentences. This will help you a lot when you study. If you have a question, just ask the teacher. They're here to help you with all of your problems.

, Always hand in your work in time if you don't want to get detention or low grades.

, Here's a small tip. If you're doing a Math test, make sure to write down all of your work outs. Who knows, maybe you'll get extra marks or marks on the work out even when you get the final answer wrong.

, You don't want to sit in a small corner all by yourself every single day right? Don't be afraid to go and make some friends. You'll be surprised at how nice those people that you used to think they're really mean are.

To calculate how much water you need each day, divide your body weight in pounds in half: that’s how much you should drink in ounces.


A 150-pound woman would need between 75 and 150 ounces of water each day, depending on her living climate and activity level. If she were active and lived in a hot climate, she would need closer to 150 ounces each day.;
, Avoid eating too much sugar, salt or processed foods. Your diet should include the following:Protein: Fish, white meat, beans, nuts, and eggs are healthy examples.
Healthy fats: Nuts (almonds are very healthy), vegetable oils (extra virgin olive oil is a popular choice), and fatty vegetables like avocados are good examples.
Whole, unprocessed carbs: These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes.
Vitamins and minerals: These are available as supplements, and can be taken if you know that your diet is not providing all the you need.

, Drink when you’re thirsty, and eat when you’re hungry. It may take a while to learn to read your body’s signals if you’ve previously ignored them, but once you do, you’ll find it easier to stick to a healthy diet and maybe even lose some weight.


If you eat or drink something that gives you a headache or makes you feel unwell, keep note of it and try to avoid it in the future, especially if you feel unwell regularly after eating or drinking the item.
Pay attention to what foods and drinks make you feel well. Having a clean diet with plenty of water and nutrients should help you feel healthier and happier. When you’re healthier and happier, you will also feel more beautiful.

, Aim for at least 30 minutes of activity 3 to 5 days a week — more if you want to lose weight.The most effective exercises to do if you’re short on time are those that exercise multiple muscle groups. Swimming, dancing, or even vigorous cleaning exercise multiple muscle groups.
Going for a brisk 20-minute walk two times a day is another effective way to keep fit and healthy.
Yoga is a wonderful exercise for relieving stress, and building and toning your muscles. Just be sure to combine it with cardio activities such as walking, running, or swimming., Wash and moisturize your face, and brush your teeth twice a day. Shower at least every second day, and wash your hair whenever it begins to feel greasy (this could be every second day to once a week, depending on hair type).


If you have breakouts on your face and back, you may need to wash your hair more often as the oils from your hair can transfer to your face, neck, and back, and cause breakouts.
To keep your teeth healthy and strong, be sure to go to the dentist every 6 months.
Having good hygiene will keep you feeling refreshed and more attractive on a daily basis. Try to take care of yourself every day, even if you’re feeling down.

, Regularly writing in a journal can ease anxiety, stress, and depression. It can also help you work through problems and improve your self-confidence. Try to write for 20 minutes each day.Write in your journal even if you have nothing you want to say. You can even just start by saying you’re not sure what to say, and see where the journal entry goes from there. Often something will come up — maybe even something you weren’t expecting.

, Meditating helps you be in the moment and get more in touch with your feelings. It has also been scientifically proven to change the structure of your brain and make you smarter and happier.There are a lot of different ways to meditate.A popular one is to sit in a comfortable position with your eyes closed, and try to remove all thoughts from your mind.
When you’re meditating and a thought comes into your mind, imagine it dissipating, or you can name the thought and mentally swipe it out of your mind. The goal is to focus on the moment you’re in, and not be distracted by thoughts.
You don’t have to start with long meditations. Even just 1 to 2 minutes is a fine place to start. Ideally you would work up to at least 10 to 15 minutes of meditation each day. If this isn’t possible, just do what you can!

, Most of us have those voices inside that see the bad in things, and that tell us why we aren’t good enough. You can counter those voices by practising gratitude and countering the negative voices with positive ones.Being positive can be a difficult habit to adopt, so be patient with yourself as you learn to observe your negative thoughts and counter them with positive ones.
A physical trick for feeling more positive is to stand with a good posture: stand straight with your shoulders back and your chin held high, then stretch out your arms as wide as they’ll go. Allow yourself to feel powerful and positive while you do this, and the feelings will linger., Studies have shown that the happier you look, the more attractive you are to other people.In addition, research has proven that even when you don’t feel happy, smiling can boost your mood.If you’re feeling down, try smiling for up to 30 seconds to give yourself a boost.

, Building self confidence is easier said than done, but it’s worth working on. With good self-esteem you will be healthier and happier, which will automatically make you more attractive.


One way to boost your self esteem is to make lists of your strengths, achievements, and things you like about yourself. It may be really difficult at first. Maybe you’ll only have one item on each list, and even that will have taken you hours to come up with, but the lists will grow as your self-esteem does.Counter your negative self talk. This is related to being positive. Catch yourself when you think negative things about yourself, and counter those thoughts with positive ones. For example, when you think “I’m fat” or “I’m ugly”, counter those thoughts with “I have a great butt” or “I have nice eyes”., When you lack sleep your mind will not operate at its full capacity, and you’ll be more likely to struggle with eating healthy, exercising, and staying positive and confident.


Adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night, and teens need between 8.5 and 9.5 hours., Whether it’s cutting it into a different style or dyeing it another color, changing your hair can dramatically affect your overall appearance. Think about what hairstyles and colors might best suit you.


Ask yourself, what do you want your hair to say about you? Are you outgoing and love taking risks? Maybe you’ll want short, colorful hair. Are you more down to earth and a bit of a hippie? Natural tones and long, layered hair might be the way to go.
Do an online search or look through some hairstyle magazines to see which hairstyles stand out to you. (You can purchase hairstyle magazines at most drugstores and bookshops.)

, An important thing to consider when changing your hairstyle is your face shape. There are several types of face shape. One way to figure out yours is to look in the mirror and outline your face with lipstick or an eye pencil.Oval faces are balanced, and shaped like ovals (a little wider in the middle).
Square faces are equally wide at the brows, cheekbones, and jaw.
Triangular faces have more width at the bottom of the face, with a strong jawline.
Heart-shaped faces (aka inverted triangle faces) feature delicate chins and wider cheekbones.
Circle faces are shaped like circles, meaning that they are fairly round.
Diamond faces are angular and have cheekbones that are wider than the brows and jaws.
Oblong faces are consistently wide from the forehead to the jaw, which makes them look longer.

, To make your hair look as good as possible, choose a style based on your face shape.Oval faces go well with most haircuts, although styes that accentuate length could make an oval face look long.
Square faces are best with hair that is longer than the jawline. In particular, avoid haircuts that stop right at the jawline, as these can make a square face look even more square. Also avoid cuts with strong, angular lines such as blunt bangs or bobs. Side-swept bangs, waves, and layers that frame the face are good choices.
Triangular faces do well with short hairstyles that balance the larger jawline by adding width to the top of the head. If you do go for long hair, ensure that it’s longer than your jawline otherwise your face may look too full at the bottom.
Heart-shaped faces look great with chin-length layers (bobs are good!). Avoid short haircuts and thick bangs as these can make your face look top heavy. Tight ponytails and otherwise slicked-back hair can emphasis your small chin, so avoid these too.
Circular faces go nicely with asymmetrical cuts and layered cuts, which help balance the face’s width. Chin-length cuts and blunt bangs can make the face look wider, and so can parting your hair in the middle. Side parts and side-swept bangs will look nice though!
Diamond faces go nicely with hair that is full at the sides but not at the top. In other words, avoid high hair! Bangs and layers that frame the face will look nice. Avoid middle parts though.
Oblong faces can look long, so it’s all about breaking up the length of the face. Avoid overly long hairstyles. Bobs, layers, and blunt bangs will go well with this face shape.

, Dyeing your hair is a great way to add some drama to your appearance. Before dyeing your hair, consider which colors will look best with your skin tone and eye color.


Your skin tone and eye color may go with most colors of hair, but they may not go with every shade of that color. For example, warm skin tones go well with warm red shades like strawberry, but pink or blue skin tones go better with cooler, brighter reds.
Choosing a hair color close to your skin tone and eye color will give you a more natural look. As an example, think of how a “beach bum” looks with sandy hair, tanned skin, and pale blue eyes.
The stronger your skin tone and eye color contrast with your hair, the more dramatic you’ll look. For example, pale skin and green eyes with rich, vibrant auburn hair will be quite a striking combination.
If you’re unsure of what your skin tone is, take a few online quizzes to see what hair color suggestions they come up with., Wash your hair as often as needed using shampoo and conditioner that match your hair type (e.g. colored, normal, oily etc.). This may be every other day to once a week depending on the quality of your hair. The drier it is, the less it needs to be washed.


If your hair is dry and damaged, do a weekly deep conditioning treatment on it. A n easy at-home treatment is to blend together olive oil with two egg yolks, an avocado, mayonnaise, and hair conditioner, and leave it on your hair for up to several hours (even overnight is okay).If you have dandruff or other hair issues, avoid home-made products. Instead, use products specifically made to help with your condition. If the hair issue is severe, see a doctor or a dermatologist., Going for a natural look means enhancing what you already have. Having natural-looking makeup doesn’t mean wearing little makeup. You can still wear foundation, blush or bronzer, mascara, eyeshadow, and lip color even with a natural look.


You can use makeup to give yourself smoother, more even-looking skin (foundation and concealer); longer lashes (mascara); higher cheekbones (blush, bronzer or contouring kits); and fuller lips (lip liner and lipstick).
As an example, it can take a lot of makeup to give your face that dewy look that’s so popular.
If you’re uncomfortable wearing makeup but would like to improve the appearance of your skin, try using a tinted moisturizer or a sheer powder. These can help improve the overall appearance of your skin without feeling too heavy or oily.

, You can use different colors of eyeliner and eyeshadow to make your eyes really stand out:If you have blue eyes, aim for light natural tones like coral and champagne. The dark, smokey look may overpower your eyes, so experiment with it at home before wearing it out.
Grey or blue-grey eyes look nice with sooty and smokey shades of grey, blue, and silver.
Green eyes look great with muted purples and shimmery browns.
Hazel or brownish-green eyes look nice with metallics and pastels that bring out the flecks of color in the eyes. Dusty pink, soft copper, and gold shadows would look wonderful with hazel eyes.
Brown eyes go well with most colors and styles of eye makeup. Neutral shades of salmon and bronzy gold work well. For a smokey eye you might even add a bit of black shadow in your eye crease.
A popular style of eyeshadow is to do a smokey eye, which involves mixing two or three shades on your eyelids to give them a graded look, often from dark to light as the colors move up the eyelid towards the eyebrows.

, Lipstick is a great way to play up your lips and add interest to your look. Red is one of the most popular colors. It can be worn by everyone. The secret is just to find the right shade for your skin tone.

, Apply lip liner to your lips before applying lipstick to help it stay on longer. You can also use lip liner to change the shape of your lips, making them look more full or even a bit thinner, if that’s what you want.

, Wearing dramatic eye makeup with a dramatic lip color is something that stylists generally advise against as it can be overpowering. If you wear a smokey eye, for example, go with a more natural lip.


If you wear red lipstick, keep the rest of your makeup relatively subtle. A classic look is to wear a cat’s eye with red lipstick.
Similar rules apply to balancing hair colors and makeup. For example, having fire-engine-red hair can limit which colors you wear on your lips.

, Contouring involves using dark and light shades of skin-toned makeup to change the appearance of your face. For example, with contour makeup you can make your nose look smaller and your cheekbones look prominent.


Contouring takes a bit of time to learn, but if you really dislike your natural features, it’s worth giving it a try.

, Makeup can irritate your skin and cause breakouts. Washing your face well at the end of the day and removing all traces of makeup will help prevent this from happening.


To help avoid breakouts, choose non-comedogenic (i.e. non-pore-clogging) makeup. It will say the words “won’t clog pores” or “non-comedogenic” on the packaging. Even with this type of makeup, you might still experience breakouts.
If you’re wearing heavy eye makeup you may want to use eye makeup remover or coconut oil to ensure that you get it completely off your eyes each night.

, Look online to consider what styles you like the best. Base your decisions on what styles appeal to you, and what you feel most confident in. Consider who you are as a person, and ask how you can show that off through your personal style.


For example, if you’re more outgoing and like punk music, you might take your inspiration from retro punk photos, whereas if you’re more natural and a bit of a hippie, you might look at old photos of people from the ‘60s and ‘70s for inspiration.
Make your clothes an extension of who you are. This means you should feel comfortable and great in your clothes, and not like you’re trying to be someone else.

, Knowing your body type will help you dress in a way that accentuates your best features, and hides the things you’re not too happy about. Here’s one way to determine your body shape through measurements:Use a measuring tape to measure your shoulders, bust, waist, and hips. You may need to get someone to help you do this.
Inverted triangle: If your shoulders or bust are larger than your hips, this is your body type. Your shoulders or bust should be over 5% larger than your hips.Rectangle: This is your body type if your shoulders, bust, and hips are roughly the same size, and you have no defined waistline. Your shoulders, bust, and hips should be within 5% of each other, and your waist should be less than 25% smaller than your shoulders or bust.Triangle: If your hips are wider than your shoulders, this is your body type. Your hips should be over 5% larger than your shoulder or bust measurements.Hourglass: This is your body type if your shoulders and hips are roughly the same size, and you have a defined waistline. Your shoulder and hip measurements should be within 5% of each other, and your waist should be at least 25% smaller than your shoulder, hip, and bust., Now that you know your body type, you can choose the clothes that will make it look its best:


Inverted triangle: Keep your top half relatively clean and simple, and free of any detailing that might add bulk to it. Leave the bulky stuff to your lower half to give it more volume and help balance it with your top half. An example might be a clean v-neck top with a wide belt and a pair of wide-legged, high-waisted trousers.Rectangle: The goal with this body type is to define your waist so that you have more of an hourglass shape. To do this, wear bottoms with embellishments that create gentle curves, and fitted tops that give shape to the waist. Avoid boxy clothes, or clothes with noticeable waistbands.Triangle (aka pear): The goal is to balance your wider lower half (hips and legs) by wearing clothes and accessories that add volume to your upper half and make your shoulders look broader. Avoid adding any bulk to your lower half by wearing bottoms with simple, clean lines and no embellishments.Hourglass: Wear clothes that follow your body line. Fitted clothes are generally a good choice as these are sure to accentuate your naturally curvy figure. Avoid wearing baggy clothes that hide your small waist, otherwise you may look more bulky., Beyond your body shape, you’ll also want to consider your height. In particular, think about whether you have a longer torso or longer legs, as this will affect how you dress.


If you have longer legs, you may want to wear hip-hugging pants with longer shirts, or dresses with dropped waistlines to give your body more balance.
If you have shorter legs, you’ll want to wear skirts and pants with high waistlines, and cropped or tucked-in tops to make your legs look longer.

, No matter what you decide to wear, make sure that your clothes fit you well. Clothes that are too baggy or too small will never look good on you, and can also make you feel less confident.

Act shy by being quiet, especially around your crush. It helps if you act a little embarrassed when she talks to you.If you make eye contact with your crush, smile shyly and look away quickly. This is really cute!
If you have long bangs, hide behind your hair when you talk to girls. If your hair is short, you can cover your smile with your hand for a similar effect.;
, A cute guy isn’t insecure; therefore, they don’t feel the need to make others feel bad. Try to be nice to everyone you meet. Make a special effort to be polite to your crush’s friends. If her friends like you, they’ll say nice things about you to her!


Be especially nice to your crush in public. Try to think of ways you can “single her out” from her friends. For example, if you know she likes cookies, bring her a cookie at lunch. If you make her feel special in front of others, she’ll appreciate you more.
Don’t be creepy. Being nice in public can be overdone and makes you look weird. For example, bringing her a plate of cookies every day to lunch would be overdoing it. Limit yourself to small, occasional kind gestures.

, No matter how funny you think it is, time to cut out the comedic burping and farting. Even if girls laugh at crude behavior, they DO NOT find it adorable. However, don’t sweat the occasional accident – girls know you’re only human.

, If you put in all of the effort mentioned above and your crush still doesn’t seem interested, it’s time to move on. There are plenty of intelligent, beautiful women who appreciate a cute boy. Instead of wasting time on someone who isn’t interested, go find someone that is!

, If you’re not sure what kind of haircut looks cute, get tips from some of your lady friends or do a search on the internet. If you have a favorite celebrity or athlete, consider getting a haircut similar to theirs. If you still can’t think of anything, get a haircut similar to one of the Jonas brothers – they’re famously cute!


If you’re willing to get your hair cut by an apprentice, you may get a free high-end haircut. Do an internet search for ""salon apprentice"" or ""free high-end haircut"" along with the name of the city where you live, or the biggest city close to where you live. The haircut may take a long time, but you'll end up with the best haircut of your life for free!
Shave your beard. This step is optional – some men look really good with beards! However, most “cute boys” are clean shaven.

, Start by going to the gym. Exercise builds confidence and generally makes you happier. You don’t have to become the Hulk – in fact, cute guys aren’t overly buff. Think of the Jonas brothers: muscular, but slender.


Eat healthy food. Just like going to the gym, eating healthily will make your body look better. Drink less sodas and energy drinks and eat less junk food. Instead, eat veggies, fruits, and proteins such as meat or tofu. Bonus side effect: eating healthily is proven to help clear up bad acne!, Talk to one of your female friends (or stylish male friends!) Ask them to be brutally honest with you and help clear out the unattractive clothing from your wardrobe. Don’t get your feelings hurt if they throw away some of your favorite clothing!


If you can afford it, buy a few new clothes. Take this new wardrobe consultant along with you to pick them out.
If you have a favorite “cute” celebrity or athlete, try to model your wardrobe after theirs. For example, if you really like Nick Jonas, ask yourself if he would wear what you wear. If not, you may need to go shopping!

, It’s a good idea to practice in the mirror if you aren’t sure whether your smile is charming or not. Your smile needs to reach all the way up to your eyes to look genuine. Sometimes it can help to squint your eyes slightly when you smile to create this effect.Kevin Jonas has a good example of a cute smile – charming, not too many teeth showing, and boyish.

, Even if you don’t think you smell bad, you should shower every day. Use soap to wash every part of your body, even your feet, and make sure to clean your hair with shampoo. “Cute guys” smell good!Wear deodorant. Showering alone isn’t enough. If you want to smell clean all day, you need to wear deodorant. Deodorant can be found at most grocery stores, drug stores, and some department stores.
Take care of your nails. Many boys don’t know how important this step is. You don’t have to go get a manicure, just make sure your nails are trimmed and clean. If you end up holding her hand, you don’t want her thinking about how gross your nails are!

, If you have perfect skin, congratulations! However, most of us don’t. The best way to get great skin is to visit a dermatologist. If this isn’t an option, try searching the internet for reviews on skin-care products to find what you need. Always use a moisturizer after you clean your skin.Don’t be afraid to use “girly facewash.” Just because a product is marketed to women doesn’t mean that it won’t do wonders for your skin!
There are many internet forums for advice on skincare on websites such as Reddit. These forums can be a great place to ask questions and get product advice., If you end up getting a kiss from your crush, you don’t want her to be distracted by bad breath! Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily. Use mouthwash if you’re concerned about your breath.Really bad breath can be a sign of gingivitis, a gum disease that can become serious if untreated. If you’re unsure on how to take care of your teeth, visit your dentist for a cleaning and advice., After all the effort you put in to look and smell clean, it would be a shame to ruin it all by wearing stinky clothing from your dirty clothes hamper. Make sure you wear a clean shirt and socks every day, even if that means doing more laundry than you’re used to.

,


If you have acne that won't go away with over-the-counter products, make an appointment to see a doctor or a dermatologist. Even if it's pricey, having nice skin that will make you more confident is worth good money.

,


Gently exfoliate once or twice a week, depending on your skin type.
Cleanse your face morning and night with products suitable for your type of skin.
Moisturize. Moisturizing is very important and depends on your skin type: oily skin requires a light moisturizer and dry skin requires a rich moisturizer.

, If you have just a few small spots, look for a good concealer, or perhaps try a tinted moisturizer. If you have oily skin, then a matte powder could work, and if your skin tone is uneven, again, try a tinted moisturizer.

, You can use bronzer but stick with a natural light-colored blush to give your face a flush of colour. To make your lash line look defined try applying a black eyeliner in your tight liner (upper waterline). An eyeliner (gel eyeliners or felt tip style liquid liners are nice) applied close to your lash line will also look very nice. Finish off by curling your eyelashes and applying mascara and a natural pink lip gloss, lipstick, or just a simple lip balm.

, If you have frizzy, dry, curly hair, try to use a deep conditioner at least once a week to moisturize your hair. Also try to find hair products suitable to your hair, like serums and mousses. For shampoo and conditioner, find one that hydrates and moisturizes(one specifically made for curly/frizzy hair) and finish off with some serum (like frizz-ease) or some curl crème.


A good tip is to put your hair in a plait instead of sleeping on it while it is in a ponytail or just loose because those can create friction on your pillow and cause frizz.
Use a wide toothed comb instead of a brush and avoid using hairbands with metal parts in them.
Rinsing your hair in cold water helps to make it look shiny and reduces the fading of your hair color if it is dyed.
If your hair is dry, do not wash it everyday because that strips your hair of its natural oils which makes it even dryer. Hot oil treatments and hair masks can also be used occasionally. On the other hand, if your hair is oily, find shampoo and conditioner for oily hair and try using dry shampoo to absorb the oil. Nice hairstyles are braids, messy buns, pony tails, and twists. If you feel like you can't do much with your hair, get loads of nice hair things like headbands to accessorize your hair.

, Make sure your clothes are always clean and make sure they have been ironed and aren't crinkly. A good pair of jeans should be in everybody's wardrobe, other key pieces include: a high-waisted skirt, fitted blazer, jacket, pair of boots and little black dresses. These are the type of clothes that you can wear with anything for a casual and dressy look and you can always add a necklace or bracelet to accessorize. Converse trainers are also a comfy, cool pair of shoes which look good with jeans.

, You don't necessarily have to wear make-up to feel and look good. Having nice eyebrows is key as they frame your face. If you want you can go to a beautician to have them waxed or threaded or you can pluck any stray hairs yourself. Clean teeth and fresh breath are very important; brush your teeth twice a day and use mouthwash and floss. Carry gum and mints around with you during the day. Wear deodorant or anti-antiperspirant to help fight sweat and keep you smelling nice. If you do feel you sweat too much though, see your doctor, because they might be able to help you. Find a nice light body spray or perfume which isn't too overpowering; vanilla, floral, or fruity scents tend to smell nice. Also most people shave or wax their legs and underarms. Having clean well manicured finger nails and toe nails is also nice, simply cut, file and paint them. A pale pink or clear coat looks natural and lovely.

Be beautiful inside and out!",How to Look Like a Victoria's Secret Model," It’s obvious that no-one (even the genetically gifted Angels) can look like a Victoria’s Secret model without hard work and intense exercise. These girls aren’t just skinny - they’re healthy, fit and toned. If you want to be like them you will have to put in the time and effort. It may be tough but the end results will be worth it.


During most of the year, Victoria’s Secret models will exercise between three and five times per week, for one to two hours per session. They usually try to vary their workout sessions by alternating between cardio, muscle toning and strengthening exercises.
However, running up to the VS Fashion Show, the Angels up their game in order to look their absolute best. For the two weeks before the show, they will usually work out six times a week, two hours per day, under the supervision of a personal trainer.;
, If you want to look like a Victoria Secret model, cardio is a must. Cardio gives your body an all-over workout, helping you to shed any extra pounds and increase your fitness levels.


Choose a cardio exercise based on your own personal preference - if you find a type of exercise that you enjoy, you’ll be much more inclined to keep it up.
Some good options include running (outside or on the treadmill), cycling (spinning classes are fantastic!) and swimming - basically anything that gets your heart rate up! Before the show they do incline walking to work on their butts!

, It’s important to remember that losing weight isn’t enough - you’ll also need to get that body looking toned and firm! The best way to do this (as the Angels know) is through body sculpting exercises.


The Angels particularly love Ballet Beautiful - a fitness class inspired by ballet moves which helps to create strong, sleek muscles, improve posture and increase flexibility. Lily Aldridge, in particular, is a fan: “It’s my go-to.”
High-intensity kickboxing is another favorite, as it provides a cardio workout while also toning the legs and butt. Candice Swanepoel swears by it. Jump-rope is another much preferred form of workout.
The girls are also fans of yoga and pilates, which help to lengthen and strengthen the muscles. Although strength is important - bulky muscles are a no-no. You want your body to look as lean and feminine as possible.

, When your day job involves prancing around in skimpy underwear, having lean legs, a firm butt and a tight tummy is essential. So if you want to look like a Victoria’s Secret model, you’ll have to work on these features.


For your legs, lunges are ideal for working the inner and outer thighs. Try doing them with a 5 to 10 lb weight in each hand to increase the intensity. For your calves, try doing calf pulses (where you rise up onto your toes from a standing position. See more leg toning exercises here.
For your butt, squats and deadlifts are the way to go - not only will they get you a firm, rounded booty, they will also work your legs and core. Just remember - you want to look lean rather than bulky, so focus on doing more repetitions with smaller weights, rather than the other way around. For more butt toning exercises see here.
For a toned tummy, crunches are your best friend. Also try reverse crunches and side crunches to work all of your abdominal muscles. Planks are also fantastic for building core strength. For more stomach toning exercises see here.

, When working out, it’s good to have a specific goal in mind. And what better goal to work towards than the VS Angel ideal measurements?


Most Angels have a body measurement of 32-22-32 - this means a 32” bust, a 22” waist and 34” hips. This means that Victoria Secret models have a classic hourglass figure (which is when the bust and hip measurements are at least ten inches wider than the waist.
Through your exercise you can strive to achieve body measurements as close to these as possible. However it is important to be realistic - most women will be not be able to reach these measurements exactly, as a lot depends on genetics and your natural body shape.
Don’t let this get you down though! You can still be beautiful and Angel-like even without these measurements - just do your best to be in the best shape possible for you, but remember all VS angels are above 5' 9"" in height, and that's with flat feet.

, It’s important to realize that most Angels don’t ‘’diet’’, per se, but they do eat very healthily and try to eat fresh, organic, clean foods as much as possible. Therefore, sugary cereals and cream cheese bagels are out the window when it comes to breakfast and eat the white of an egg on some wholegrain toast.


Many of the Angels have proclaimed their love for healthy smoothies and juices for breakfast - as they are healthy, filling and provide tons of energy to kick off the day.
For a fruity start, try blending 1 cup of ice with ½ cup of frozen berries (like strawberries, raspberries or blueberries). ½ cup of plain yogurt (lowfat), 1 small banana, 1 tablespoon of honey and ½ cup of rolled-oats.
For an uber-healthy green juice filled with vitamins and nutrients, push 2 green apples, 4 celery stalks, 1 cucumber, 6 kale leaves, ½ a lemon and a 1” piece of fresh ginger through a juicer. These are their favourites, apparently one of these a day will make you feel great!
If you require something a little more filling in the mornings, combine your juice with a nutrition bar, or prepare a small, egg-white omelette or some oatmeal and have some yoghurt.

, Lunch and dinner are more or less the same, generally - lean meat and steamed veggies or salad.


When steaming vegetables make sure that you don’t overcook them - in fact the closer to raw you cook them, the better! Some of the Angel’s favorite veggies include artichoke, asparagus, broccoli and kale, which they like to season with salt, spices and a little olive oil (according to their nutritionist, Dr. Charles Passler).
In terms of protein, stick to things like chicken, turkey and fish, which you can flavor with spices, herbs or lemon juice before steaming or grilling.
Try to stay away from fattier red meats and from carb-heavy foods like pasta and bread. The Angels like to “eat clean” which means avoiding any foods that are processed in any way and only eating foods which are natural and chemical-free.
That also means staying away from greasy foods like French fries and from sugary candy and desserts. Of course, it’s important to treat yourself to a small salty or chocolatey treat every once in a while. It's better than going overboard all at once.

, As mentioned before, Victoria’s Secret models do really “diet”, and they’re just very careful about the type of foods they put in their bodies.


So there’s no need to starve yourself in order to look like an Angel - in fact, their nutritionist encourages them to eat every 2 to 3 hours!
Eating a small snack every 2 to 3 hours helps to keep the metabolism running smoothly and prevents blood sugar from dipping too low.
It also helps to stem any cravings you might have for foods that are on “the naughty list!”
Recommended snacks include half of a nutrition bar, a piece of fruit or a handful of almonds and dark chocolate once a week to reduce temptations.

, Although a diet rich in healthy juices and plenty of fresh fruit and veg will provide you with plenty of vitamins and nutrients, it’s a good idea to take some additional dietary supplements in order to get Angel-worthy hair, skin and nails.


Consider taking a cure-all vitamin supplement such as PHYTO Phytophanere, which helps hair, skin and nails to grow faster and stronger, and works to significantly reduce skin blemishes and minimize pores.
Alternatively, you could you a water booster, like Dr. Brandt Anti-Oxident Water Booster. This is a kind of vitamin-rich syrup which you add to water. It keeps your skin looking clear and healthy, while also giving you an added energy boost!
The Angel’s nutritionist also recommends taking a supplement to get the gastrointestinal system working (to prevent bloating and aid weight loss) and a supplement to promote muscle function. However, it’s probably a good idea to speak to your doctor before you start taking either of these.
Take advice from the Angels themselves! Miranda Kerr drinks four teaspoons of coconut oil a day to keep her skin and hair looking glowing and healthy.

, You’re probably already aware that it’s really, really important to drink lots of water, but if you want to look like a VS model, you’ll need to take that advice very seriously!


The Angels drink about 2 quarts of water per day - which is the same as four pints! To compete with that, you’ll probably need to have a water bottle attached to your hand for the entire day!
Water is so important because it flushes toxins from your system, increases blood flow and leaves your skin looking fresh and glowing! Don't forget to wash, cleanse, tone and moisturise your skin!
You can also increase your water intake by drinking herbal and green teas (which are full of anti-oxidants) and by eating fruit and veg with a high water content, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelon, beets and lettuce.

, To look like a VS Angel, you need to learn how to do your make up like a VS angel. The Angels don’t tend to go overboard on their make-up, they prefer more of a healthy, glowing look with some added sparkle and shimmer!


Try to go for a mineral or powder foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly - you really don’t want to look like you’re caked in make-up! Apply a little matching concealer under the eyes or to cover any blemishes, if necessary. Then use a pinky-bronze colored blush to add a healthy glow to your cheeks.
Apply eyeshadow in neutral colored creams and browns. Then, depending on your skin tone, use a black or brown eyeliner to line your upper lid only. Use a matching mascara to add volume and definition to your lashes.
The Angels don’t usually wear bold lipsticks, they prefer to go for soft pink and nude pouts. Try using a balmy lipstick that’s just a shade or two lighter or darker than your natural lip color. Stay away from glosses or anything that’s too shiny or shimmering. Just look at MAC lipsticks for a lovely nude shade.

, Having fabulous hair is essential for any VS Angel. Make sure yours is in tip top condition by getting regular trims, using a weekly deep conditioning treatment and by avoiding excessive heat from styling tools like flat irons, curling tongs and hair dryers. The better you treat your hair, the faster it will grow - and as you know, long, healthy hair is a VS model’s trademark.


When it’s time to get all-dolled up, the Angels favor loose, tousled-looking curls. To achieve this make sure your hair is freshly washed and conditioned, and use a nourishing serum or oil (such as argan oil) to add shine. Blow dry your hair using a round bristled brush to add lots of volume.
When your hair is dry, spritz it with some heat protection spray and begin making large, loose curls using your flat iron or curling tongs (for more specific instructions see here and here). When you’re done, spritz your hair with some loose hold hairspray and you’re ready for the runway!

, As you may have noticed, all of the Angel’s have beautiful, sun-kissed glows. Therefore, if you want to look like a VS model you’ll have to get your tan on!


However, as the Angels know, having healthy skin is far more important than having a tan. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that you wear sunscreen if you plan on lying out by the pool. Otherwise, you could be exposing your skin to burns and sunspots - not to mention contributing to wrinkles, premature aging and skin cancer!
If getting a natural tan feels like too much effort, you’re super pale, or you just want to avoid sun exposure - fret not! You can get a natural-looking tan from a bottle. Just make sure to exfoliate well before you apply any self-tanning products. For more info on using a self-tanner, see here.

, Having perfect, straight, white teeth is another Angel must-have! Practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth 2 to 3 times a day, flossing regularly and avoiding sugary food and drinks.


You should also make an effort to see your dentist a couple of times a year. He can give your teeth a proper cleaning, getting rid of any stains or built-up plaque that are impossible to remove at home. This will also leave your teeth looking whiter!
If necessary, you can also ask your dentist about whitening treatments like laser or bleaching. These can be pricey, but are worth it if you really want a dazzlingly white smile! The same goes for braces - if your teeth are a little crooked, ask your dentist about your options for straightening them.

, The VS models are classy ladies, and even though they spend a lot of time in their underwear, they still manage to look glamorous and elegant - never trashy.


Try to emulate this in your everyday life by wearing polished, well-tailored clothes which highlight your feminine side. Think dark bootcut jeans, with crisp, button down shirts, or A-line dresses and skirts which cinch in at the waist. Wear understated jewelry and opt for low heels or pretty flats.
The most important thing is to wear clothes that fit you. Don’t wear too-small clothes thinking that they’ll make you look skinnier - they’ll actually have the opposite effect. Always try on clothes before buying and bring a trusted friend with you who can give you an honest opinion.
Even in their downtime, the Angel’s look well-put-together. Wear matching gym clothes (like the oh-so-comfortable yet stylish VS tracksuits) and always have your hair looking neat, even if it’s just tied back in a pony.
Of course, no Angel would be complete without her VS lingerie! Don’t be afraid of sexy lingerie, girls - it’s designed to make you feel beautiful, even underneath jeans and a t-shirt! Again, it’s important to wear the right size, as too-small lingerie can create bulges and lumps in all the wrong places, while too-big lingerie won’t give you the support you need.

, Not only are they some of the most beautiful people on the planet, the VS Angels are also well-known for their friendliness, kindness and overall great personalities! This is something you can easily adopt in your everyday life. Just by smiling and being kind, you will radiate beauty - just like an Angel!

Use a thick black eyeliner and draw a thin line around your upper eyelid, and a small thin line around the lower.
Curl your eyelashes mostly at the very edge of the eye and less on the beginning.
However, note that sometimes, Kristen Stewart gets sick of wearing makeup and just goes for a bit of eye shadow and mascara. You don't have to overdo it.
Other times, Kristen Stewart wears white eyeliner and silver eyeshadow or peach eyeshadow and silver eyeliner. Also make sure to do your eyebrows a little thinner and darker Kristen has very thin and dark eyebrows. Go for a matte light brown color on the eyes and a nude color in the crease that's mostly what she wears on her eyes and Nude lips. ;
, Kristen Stewart almost always wears subtle lipstick and does not wear eye liner or draw too much attention to her naturally cute lips. Her lipstick is most often slightly pink or shimmery with an orange tint.


Use a naturally dark pinkish color on your lips, but don't use very dark colors.
Apply lipstick lighter on the sides and darker on the middle.
Sometimes, though, she does like to bring out the brighter pink lipstick for special occasions.

, Her hair is a dark brown with a bit of a chestnut tint. If you're committed to looking like her, you can even dye your hair to match hers. Her hair is long, thick, and layered, and she cultivates the perfect ""messy but flawless"" look. That means that not every strand has to be in place, but you have to look like you put an effort into your hair.


Kristen has layered hair, and her bangs reach below her ears and she wears them to the side. This gives her hair a more unique look.
She tends to wear her hair a bit wavy though sometimes she wears it straight. On occasion, though, she does curl her hair. Her hair is only about to her ribcage not too long.
Her long hair is one of her best features. She loves showing it off and having it fall over her shoulders. Don't hide your locks if you want to get that Twilight look.
Sometimes, Kristen Stewart does wear her hair up, in a bun or a more elaborate updo, exposing her cute earring-free ears.

, A bit of blush for some color and some foundation to keep your face looking smooth will do the trick. Kristen's look is simple, and she doesn't look like she spent hours doing her makeup -- that's part of her beauty. If you really want to have her skin tone, then you can try to stay out of the sun to get that pale, wintery look.

, Kristen Stewart loves wearing flannel, whether she wears long-sleeved shirts or short sleeved button down shirts. She wears it buttoned up, or buttoned down over a white t-shirt. Sometimes, she even ties a knot in the bottom of her flannel.

, K-Stew loves wearing short black leather jackets and bulky black hoodies. Preferably zip-up for both. Wear them with skinny jeans.

, Kristin Stewart likes to wear simple t-shirts, typically darker colored, with fun and unique logos, from rainbows to wolves in tuxedos. She also loves wearing a simple white t-shirt, sometimes with a black bra.


Her shirts are typically a bit on the loose fitted side. Sometimes she tightens them up with knots (see below).

, For years, Kristen Stewart has been tying knots on the sides of her t-shirts. You should try the same, exposing a little bit of your skin, or knotting shirts that are longer.

, Kristin Stewart is also known for her pants, both casual and more dressy. Here are some pants that she is known for wearing:


Tight skinny jeans
Rolled up skinny jeans
Black leather pants
Tight pants with elaborate designs
Jeans with suspenders
Cropped black jeans

, Kristen Stewart loves rocking trucker hats and is rarely seen without one, these days. Pick an oversized hat with a fun logo, a wide brim, and rock it all day long, not caring if it makes your hair extra messy -- that's all part of the fun of being K-Stew., Kristin Stewart loves wearing black sunglasses. She wears them on her face, or sometimes she tucks them into the top of her t-shirt. Here are the types of sunglasses that she has worn before:


Lacoste Karl Lagerfeld KL603S-004 (thick black frames)
Lacoste 101 Aviator Reissue (thinner black frames)
Leisure Society Harvard 47 (white frames with gray lenses)
Paul Smith Churchill (thick black frames on top and no frames on the bottom)
Oliver Peoples Gregory Peck (tan frames with green lenses)

, Though K-Stew isn't huge on accessories, she does wear a few simple accessories that tie her look together. Here are some accessories that you can try:


Thin long gold or silver necklaces
Chunky black rings and gold rings.
Silver bracelets
Black nail polish
Avoid earrings and expose your bare ears instead

, Kristin Stewart loves rocking converse and casual shoes. She has even been seen with rolled-up skinny jeans, high white socks, and a pair of black sneakers. However, she can wear fancier shoes if the occasion calls for it. Get these shoes and looks to rock the K-Stew fashion:


Black hiking boots with black skinny jeans
Black sneakers
Classic black and white converse
Black Vans mesh, checkerboard, and slip-on sneakers
Saucony bullet
Black canvas TOMS
Nike Tenkay low-tops, Dunk High skinnys
Black high heels with tight pants

, Even though Kristen Stewart is known for her casual glam look, she also does have to go to those pesky award shows every once in a while. This girl does know how to dress up, and she loves to look a bit sexy and to show off her figure. Whatever dress she wears, it's guaranteed that she will look striking and that you won't see a picture of it under ""Who Wore it Best?"" because no one else will be wearing her unique outfit. Here are some fancy dresses Kristen has worn in the past:


A very low cut red dress that shows off her curves
A see-through number that shows a light blue bra and light blue shorts underneath
A long strapless white gown
A strapless long-sleeved black lace dress

, Kristen Stewart is famous for scowling or looking like she just doesn't want to be somewhere, but that's part of her charm. If she doesn't like where she is or who she's with, she's not afraid to show it. She keeps it real. That's part of her look and part of her charm.

, If you're having a good time with your friends, then laugh your heart out. Kristen Stewart isn't afraid to smile or crack up and have a great time with her friends even if she doesn't look as ""cool"" as she does when she's frowning. Just be yourself. If you're having a good time, show it. But if you're not, don't fake it.

, Just like every human on this planet, Kristen Stewart has made some mistakes. But she's okay with that. She's even issued some public apologies about the things she's not proud of. But most of all, she says she doesn't regret anything she's done in this life, because every mistake teaches us how to grow stronger. Don't think that looking like Kristen Stewart means you have to look or feel perfect all the time.

, Wear revealing clothes if you want to. Put on a dress that you know no one in school would ever wear, let alone know how to find. Wear sneakers to an event where everyone else is dressed up. Most of all, don't look around to see what other people are doing, because you're okay with what you want to do. With this attitude, your Kristen Stewart look will be complete.

Evaluate the event.,
Dress appropriately.,
Flatter your shape and wear your best colors.,
Wear stylish, yet comfortable, attire on a first date.,
Employ good grooming.,
Remember less is more.",How to Dress Up1," Depending on the event, the dress code will vary whether it is stated explicitly or not. Are you going to a wedding, cocktail party, dinner party, funeral, job interview, night club, the theater, first date, luncheon/ brunch, or a formal gala? Honor the dress code and let the occasion dictate the formality of your wardrobe., Having good clothing etiquette will allow you to look great and feel comfortable. Don’t make the mistake of wearing the wrong outfit for the occasion, like wearing a ball gown to a cocktail party or revealing clothes in a conservative culture. You need to know your colors, too. For example, it’s not appropriate to wear white to a wedding or light-colored clothes to a funeral.There is also a difference between daytime clothes and evening clothes. For the day, it’s better to wear light colors, natural-looking makeup, minimal jewelry, and low to medium heels. At night, you can go more formal and choose darker colors, heavier makeup, high heels, and glitzier accessories., Understand your body type and choose clothes with proportions that play up your best assets. Wear a particular color that looks great with your skin or hair. Dressing in clothes that look fantastic specifically on you can put you on your “A” game., Often, what looks good is not comfortable and what’s comfortable is not stylish. The key is to spend time choosing the right outfit that meets both these criteria. If you wait until the last minute, you’re apt to throw anything on and then regret wearing those itchy pants or unbearably tight shoes! Remember you not only want to look good to the other person but you want to feel confident, too. The way to do that is to wear an outfit that shows your personality but that you don’t have to think about once you put it on.Keep it casual for a daytime date, and dress it up in the evening.
Avoid wearing anything that’s political or offensive.

, Dressing up is not just about picking the right outfit. Also take into consideration your hygiene, hair, skin, and makeup. Bathe yourself well; create a flattering hairdo, and carefully apply some makeup. You don’t need to go over the top -- groom according to the formality of the occasion.

, To create an elegant look, pick one feature that you want to accentuate, and keep the rest of your look simple. With your makeup, play up your eyes or lips but not both. If you start with a little black dress, try adding a statement accessory like a fancy clutch or an eye-catching necklace. The goal is to not overwhelm the look but to have each element complement the other."

Read the wedding invitation carefully.,
Follow the traditional rules when it comes to color.,
Base your accessories on the formality of the occasion.,
Glam it up if the invitation says “White Tie.” Considered the most formal (think charity balls, royal events and the Academy Awards), you’re limited as to what you should or should not wear.,
Wear formal attire if the invitation says “Black Tie.” Considered the next most formal style of wedding, you can wear either a floor-length evening gown or a formal-style cocktail dress.,
Dress to impress but also for the elements if the invitation says “Beach Formal.” This invite suggests an elegant wedding on the beach so still dress up.,
Find a happy-medium between casual and formal if the invitation says “Dressy Casual” or “Semi-formal.” For an evening ceremony, good choices are a long, dressy skirt with a stylish blouse or a cocktail dress (just above or at the knee), preferably made in a rich fabric like silk, satin or chiffon with beading.",How to Dress Up2," It’s your key to dressing appropriately on this special day. Weddings, at their heart, are serious occasions and often take place in a house of worship. If there’s any time to follow a dress code, this is it! Your attire should be appropriate, conservative and respectful. If the invite does not state a specific style of dress, then follow the “Dressy Casual” or “Semi-formal” step below, or ask someone in the wedding party; they usually know months in advance.Along with the invitation, base your attire on the season, venue and weather. Time is also important. Weddings in the evening are usually more formal than daytime ceremonies.
If you don’t know the couple (perhaps you’re going as the date of a friend or family member of the betrothed), you may want to call the venue and see what dress is appropriate. Consider packing a few accessories to either dress up or dress down your outfit.

, Avoid wearing white, off-white or the same color as the bridesmaids. Even if the bride isn’t wearing white, still avoid this color. It’s okay, though, to wear a patterned outfit with white mixed in. Tradition also states that guests should not wear black. However, it’s no longer considered off-limits unless specifically stated on the invitation.


Don’t wear black, however, if it’s a summer, outdoor wedding held during the day. You could look out of place, not to mention the heat factor., Keep the chunky necklaces, cocktail rings and earrings for an evening ceremony and less dramatic pieces for a daytime wedding. For your bag, a clutch purse is a terrific choice for most weddings. If you want your hands to be free, though, a purse with an elegant chain strap looks great, too.

, For this ultra-chic occasion, you’re expected to wear a formal, full-length ball gown with either white gloves or the same color as your gown. Match your gown with glamorous makeup, your finest jewelry, and an upswept, elegant hairstyle, if possible. Shoes should match your gown.Gloves are optional.

, An A-line cocktail dress in either metallic or with rich embellishments is a good choice., But keep outside factors in mind. A tea-length (3 to 4 inches above the ankle) or knee-length, stylish sundress; a dressy skirt and blouse; or a dress with flat sandals with grip is appropriate. Hair and makeup can be everyday and natural.


As a general rule, bathing attire should not be worn, even under your outfit unless the invite specifically states.

, For a daytime ceremony, a classy sundress is perfect. Save dark colors for an evening wedding and lighter colors/fabrics for a daytime ceremony.


Assume business casual if the invitation says “Casual.” Usually, casual means just about anything goes. However, unless it states on the invite, tank tops, shorts, and jeans are probably not appropriate.

If it’s during the summer, black tuxedo trousers with a white dinner jacket are also fine.There will always be a few guests who misinterpret the invitation to simply mean “formal” and will dress in whatever they feel is dressy. A gracious host will understand. In technical terms, though, a tuxedo is the best choice for black tie events.
If the invite says “Black Tie Optional, the safest choice is still a tuxedo. The hosts worded it this way because they don’t want to exclude those who can’t afford one. So if you genuinely can’t, then a dark suit and tie is just fine., But consider outside factors. A summer suit paired with a linen shirt (no tie required), khakis or linen pants, and sandals are just right for this kind of wedding.


As a general rule, bathing attire should not be worn, even under an ensemble unless the invite specifically states.

, Wear darker, more formal colors for an evening wedding. Opt for lighter fabrics and colors for a daytime fete.

, However, tank tops, shorts, and jeans are probably not appropriate unless the invite specifically states. Dress pants paired with a polo or button-down shirt are good selections.

For outdoor or more casual events, polo shirts are a good choice.
Pack a few blazers for the inevitable air-conditioning.

It looks great when resting your arm on the board table! Combine smart trousers or a pencil skirt with a well-fitting jacket. Wear low-heeled, neutral-colored shoes. Comfortable heels save your back, and a light-colored shoe easily matches other colors in your wardrobe.

, Stay within the business casual realm style of dress, but add unique touches that make you who you are. Wear interesting but stylish accessories. Instead of long-sleeved tops, go with ¾-sleeves.

She often pairs t-shirts with skinny jeans or pants and a leather or denim jacket, then classes it up with a fancy pair of sunglasses and a choker., Calder also likes to keep it simple in the sweater and shirt department. She may dress it up with a skirt or jacket,but she will also just throw on a sweater over jeans or a simple button-up shirt with jeans. She often chooses neutral or more muted colors for sweaters and shirts., Calder usually doesn't get too crazy with her jewelry. For instance, she may stick to a watch and a simple bracelet for a casual outfit.However, she also likes to add chokers to some outfits or other types of simple necklaces, usually in black or silver.Sometimes, the shirt or sweater she chooses becomes the accessory. That is, she'll pick shirts with lace-up ties or with a lacy collar, which acts as its own accessory., Calder has many styles she likes in jackets. For instance, she's at home in a short, black leather jacket with silver accessories,but she's equally as comfortable in a more flowing black thigh-length blazer.She'll also rock a short, distressed denim jacketand even a post-gym metallic zip-up sweater., One thing that Calder is particularly known for is her sunglasses, often Ray Bans. However, you don't need to shell out that much dough to have a pair like hers. You can find many affordable knockoffs. Calder wears a variety of colors, from brown and black to pink., In winter, Calder will dress up her outfits with scarves. For instance, she may choose a big, chunky gray scarf to go with an all-black outfit of a thigh-length dress, thigh-length blazer, and ankle-high boots. She manages to stay warm and still look stylish., While Calder often wears pants, she usually sticks to skinny pants or jeans. She also sometimes goes in for skinny capris. Whatever pants she's wearing, though, they are often not baggy or loose. Pick something that hugs your curves.Sometimes, she does go for something a little looser, such as silk or dress pants with vertical stripes.She also sometimes chooses cut-off shorts with a tattered edge., Calder wears skirts on occasion, though not as often as she wears pants, dresses, or jumpsuits. Try a solid-color knee-length skirt, such a red skirt, paired with a light gray sweater and black leather jacket.Another option is a mid-thigh length wrapped skirt in white., For casual outfits, Calder often picks solid color sneakers or canvas tie shoes to complete the look. She sometimes wears Converse shows or other similar styles. However, skip the socks or wear ones that can't be seen, as Calder almost never has socks that show.Try sneakers in solid, neutral colors like black or white.

, When Calder isn't in sneakers, she often chooses a fancy boot to dress up her outfit. Black is a popular color for her in boots. Choose one with a filigree buckle, or pick one that has a fancy design on the front in silver. Skip bright colors, as Calder usually opts for more neutral footwear.Calder goes for both ankle boots and much taller boots, so pick a height you like.

, One look that Calder picks on occasion is a bright one-piece jumpsuit. This type of outfit creates a casually dressed-up look, especially if it's in a classic floral print. She often chooses ones that are fairly short on the bottom.Calder also likes lacy jumpsuits in dark colors, such as a black jumpsuit with a lacy collar., Calder also sometimes picks light and twirly dresses in floral prints.

She also likes this style in other neutral colors, such as black or gray, so don't be afraid to mix it up a little., For a more formal look, Calder will pick a dress that has more length. She still likes black and whites, as well as floral prints, even in long dresses. For instance, you could choose a black and white floral print in a mid-calf dressor a fancier black floral filigree dress for a fancier event., Calder has a style that is all her own, and she tends to keep it more modest. That's not to say there's anything wrong with having a sexier look that shows more skin. However, many of Calder's looks don't show a lot of cleavage, with a few notable exceptions., Calder often keeps her look simple and clean. She's not afraid to wear a pair of skinny jeans with a somewhat loose and bulky sweater. Of course, sometimes she gets more wild, but her every day look can be fairly simple.A good pair of skinny jeans can go a long way to creating a look. They can be a little rugged. Calder isn't afraid of a few ripped knees or shredded thighs in her jeans. Pair it with a simple sweater or even one with a logo or goofy saying., That is, while Calder will pick feminine, floral prints, she often chooses to stick to neutrals, like an all-black outfit, broken up only by a neutral accessory, like a dark grey piece of fur trim or a gray scarf. Just be sure that if you pick all black, that they are all truly black. You don't want faded black paired with a piece of clothing that is truly black., While she often chooses plain colors, you can also add a few wild prints if you are drawn to them. Calder's main advice is to make sure you don't do all prints. That is, adding something more basic can help tone down the print and provide a calmness to an otherwise busy look., While Calder doesn't exclusively wear London brands, she does try to focus on them. Even if you can't buy from these brands, check out what's trendy for London brands, and you'll have a good idea of what Calder likes., While Calder does buy and wear some high-end brands, she also likes to mix it up with less costly brands. Plus, she's not afraid to browse a thrift store or vintage shop to pick up items for her wardrobe. So while you can buy high-end items, don't feel like it's a necessity if you want to dress like Calder., One way to keep up with what Calder is wearing is to follow her fashion blog, The Trend Pear.You can also follow her on Instagram (eleanorj92). While she doesn't have an official Tumblr account, many accounts have been dedicated to her style that post recent pictures of her in new outfits.

, With all the hard exercising you will need to do, it will not be very successful without a proper diet. Cut back on sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. Practice portion control. Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables. Balance the amount of carbs with protein. Carbs are not bad by the way, just be sure not to eat too many or too little.

Instead of focusing on covering up flaws in your skin with makeup, try targeting them with a good skin care routine.,

Exercise!,
Be nice!",How to Be Naturally Beautiful in High School," Find out what skin type you have, and look up reviews on different products for your type of skin. If you have dry skin, invest in a good moisturizer. If you have oily skin, get yourself some blotting sheets you can keep in your purse or school bag. Make sure to moisturize your entire body with a nice lotion after you take a shower, as well.;
, One rule to keep you from wearing too much makeup is this: limit yourself to 3 products. If you're going to wear some eyeshadow, maybe skip out on the blush and the lipgloss. If you're wearing blush, just wear some light mascara. If you're going to wear foundation, make sure it matches PERFECTLY. If you're wearing daytime eyeshadow, keep it as natural as possible. Warm shades of browns, tans, peaches and shimmery whites are very pretty on most skin tones. If you have light skin and hair, try a brown mascara instead of black. If you lead a very active (a.k.a. sweaty) lifestyle, try a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation.

, Resist the urge to straighten it or curl it everyday! Use a shampoo and conditioner you like, and wash it every other day. If you must straighten it, only do so once a week at most and use a heat protection spray. Shake it up with your hairstyles, try to have your hair up at least 3 times a week.

, Always use a good chapstick. If you have braces, it is especially important that you brush your teeth often. Keep breath mints or breath strips on hand at all times, and try not to chew gum. Chewing gum actually causes your mouth to produce more saliva, enhancing bad breath. And chewing gum isn't really attractive, either!

, You don't have to wear overpowering perfume to smell good. Always wash yourself with a natural smelling body wash and always wear deodorant. If you're going to wear perfume, spray it once in front of you and walk into it. A smell that is barely there is the sexiest kind.

, Instead of trying to fit into a specific size, buy what makes YOU look best. Try not to wear all dark colors, and mix up the type of clothes you wear. If you wear skinny jeans all the time, try a pair of flare jeans or a skirt. If you wear hoodies or zip up sweatshirts all the time, try a cardigan or scarf to keep you warm. Remember this important tip: brands aren't everything. Who cares if it cost you $4 or $140 if it makes you look like a million bucks?

, Now, you may be thinking, ""Hey! This is about looking natural, not eating!"". But reader, eating well can make you look better! Try to eat fruits and vegetables as often as possible, and stay away from the junk food. Keep an apple in your bag in case you crave something sweet or some pretzels for when you want salty. Never ever ever starve yourself or go on extreme diets. This is not healthy. Eat small meals throughout the day to keep you energized and to keep you from over eating later.

, Try taking your dog for a walk instead of watching tv. Do fun things like yoga or pilates. Try to keep yourself toned. Do some sit ups at night, and maybe go running every now and then. Try fun cardio, like swimming or Zumba. If you want to, try out for a school sport that you like. It's a lot of work, but it's totally worth it.

, One of the most beautiful things about a girl is her smile. Be pleasant to everyone, and never judge or hate someone. Try to see things from all angle. Keep yourself out of drama and fights whenever possible. Laugh at your mistakes, and try not to be a perfectionist. And smile some more!

Find out why you'd like to do this.,

Develop a sense of style.,
Find where you'd like to get your clothes.,
Accessorize.,
Be true to yourself.,
Be kind and friendly.",How to Dress Darkly," If you want attention, want cooler friends, or just want to stand out, this is clearly not for you. Common reasons why people join this culture is because of a fascination with the dark, love of Gothic art and literature, or a taste for the music. Join for reasons like these. If you do this, you're going to be a lot happier with other people of the group and you'll feel good about yourself, too.;
, It may sound a little boring, but if you are not educated on the Gothic and Dark culture, you're going to look like a poser. Learn about art, movies, books, and other things that interest you. If there's a 'normal' type of something, typically there's a Gothic version. Art movements like Manga and macabre are growing in popularity among the Gothic community. Movies with directors such as Tim Burton are much loved by Gothics. Gothic bookworms are fans of literature genres such as fantasy, poetry, and, of course, Gothic.

, Being Goth is most definitely not based on wearing all black. If you're a girl, many types of clothing exist. Tomboy goths wear things like Tripp brand pants and band tees. If you're into Victorian, tiny top hats and cute laced arm-warmers can be found at stores like Claire's and Hot Topic, eBay, or in online Gothic boutiques. If you're looking for something more feminine, poofy, elegant dresses in black or red are quite popular, and black lace jackets, tops, and veils go with almost anything. If you'd like to be a little less 'out-there', black jeans and band shirts are always an option. For guys, many options are available. A full suit, complete with 'waistcoat', is not an uncommon look, but many goth males tend to be a little less dressed-up. Tripp pants, combat boots, skinny jeans, chains and band tees are among the most popular fashion staples.

, There are three options available: store bought or ordered, resale, or home made. Each way has pros and cons. Buying your clothing from a store is easy, quick, and better if you have a certain size in mind. However, many towns and communities have no stores available for Gothic clothing. If this is an issue, many Gothic retailers exist on the web for you to browse. Another option is resale. Resale shops like Plato's closet can have lots of clothing that can either be directly Gothic or modified easily to look darker. Online, eBay can be a fun, direct way to get a piece of Gothic clothing for a fair price. A third option would be to create your own, go to a craft fair, or buy local, handmade clothing. Many shops in large cities are dedicated to the owner's own creations. Making clothing yourself takes time and effort, but the end result is a unique, one-of-a-kind piece.

, Once you have your clothing, find jewelry, scarves, shoes, belts, chains, and whatever else you determine looks good with your new clothing. Don't overdo, especially if you're male. Too much 'goth bling' can end up making you look pretty ridiculous.

, The only real requirement is liking at least some Gothic clothing. Don't force yourself into a certain subculture just because you think it will help you be accepted. Also, people are probably not going to like your becoming Goth, so don't feel hurt when you are put down for being different. It's part of becoming a true Goth and, it gets better over time. Once you're sure it's the way you want to be for the rest of your life, don't back down from who you are and try to 'conform'. It will only end up making you feel quite uncomfortable, and, for the most part, downright bad. If you're having trouble with your parents, try to fix your behavior outside of dress. For example, if you're not getting good grades on purpose, begin trying your hardest in school. A common misconception about Goths is that they are always bad in school, but that is most certainly not the case. The idea behind it is that your thinking and philosophy are different from the mainstream world. This should be a very good thing, and not a weapon, or something rebellious.

, Another false pretense is that all goths are antisocial. This is certainly not the case. You're certainly not required to be a social butterfly. But if you're friendly and nice to people, the Gothic community as a whole will gain a better reputation.

Build a classy wardrobe.,
Keep your jewelry simple.,
Invest in the perfect black dress.,
Stock up on tights.,
Wear great shoes.","How to Dress, Act, and Look Perfect (Girls)1"," A key way of always looking feminine and chic is by wearing classic pieces that can help you create the perfect outfit. Here are a few essential wardrobe pieces for you to consider adding to your closet:


Have several pairs of jeans in a variety of styles to flawlessly bring you through the week. Be sure to have a great fitting pair of straight-leg and flare jeans to mix-up your style.
Invest in basic T-shirts, cozy sweaters, simple cardigans, and several blouses that you can wear for any occasion. These are simple pieces that can be mixed-and-matched to create many different outfits.
Be careful with with most fashion trends. It may be better to resist the urge to buy something that is ""in"" style for the moment because you probably won't be wearing that piece come next year.;
, A good rule to remember is to remove one piece of jewelry before you leave the house. This will keep you from look tacky and distracting from the rest of your outfit. Stick with diamond stud earrings, simple silver or gold chains with pendants, and delicate tennis bracelets.


Statement jewelry is a great way to dress up a basic outfit. Just be sure that if you do wear a larger necklace, big earnings, or bold bracelet, that it is the only piece of jewelry you wear.

, All girls know that wearing the ""little black dress"" is as close to flawless as a girl can get. However, not just any black dress will do, you have to find one that is special. Keep these tips in mind as you are picking out your perfect black dress:


Look for a dress that hits you around the knee, and one that has unique embellishments. The longer cut will allow you to wear it to any occasion for years to come, and the embellishments will set it a part. Detailing around the sleeve or waist are typically fabulous looks for everyone., While you can not realistically achieve perfection, wearing tights with dresses and skirts can help your legs look near perfect. They help legs look slimmer, and they help mask any veins or blemishes that may be on your legs. During the winter time, opt for a thicker knit tight that will keep your legs warm., Every girl trying to achieve perfection should have classic shoes for every season. When looking for shoes, try to find simple styles and colors that you can wear with any outfit. Here is some footwear you should consider for your closet:


Find several pairs of ballet flats that are comfy to wear. You should have a black and nude pair, along with a couple pairs in fun colors.
For the fall and winter, have a black and brown pair of boots.

Shop for the right clothes to make you look good.,
Buy fun colors.,
Buy ""staple"" items.,
Buy fun, trendy pieces.,
Put together an outfit.,
Do your hair and make-up everyday.,
Remember confidence.",How to Dress Yourself and Look Good (for Girls)," When you are shopping for clothes make sure that you are conscious of how the colors and cuts are going to look on you. A shirt might be cute on the hanger but if it has a thick fabric it may make your waist look wider than it is.



Buy the right sizes. You may find a pair of jeans that are only $20, but if they don't fit right, you'll never wear them. Don't waste money on buying something just because its cheap. Only buy clothes that are not too long, loose, short, small or big for you. That means always try on clothes before you buy it.







Get clothes tailored at the dry cleaners. Fit is so crucial for dressing well. A jacket or a pair of jeans can be the best investment, but if the item is too wide or drags on the floor, it won't be. Going to a tailor to get those things to fit just right will make you look more fashionable than having the newest ""it"" fashion item.;
, Black and neutrals don't draw attention while bright colors and pales do. If you feel like your legs are thicker than you want, don't buy bright red jeans, no matter how fabulous they are. If you love how tiny your arms look, invest in a bright blue, long sleeve top. Remember: The best color in the whole world is the one that looks good on you


Look to magazines like Vogue, Elle, InStyle, etc. These will debut what is the color scheme of that season. Try incorporating that color in a little to stay fashion forward. Don't buy a yellow dress, for example, because you can only wear that so much. Instead try to buy yellow ballet flats or a yellow belt that you can wear way more often.

, 50% of your closet should be solid colored, staple pieces. A pair of good jeans will go a long way, a watch can last forever, and a black dress is an instant classic. Investing on these items will pay of in the long run. While a red dress is fun and festive, you are unlikely to wear it a lot. So instead of looking at the price tag at face value think of it like this: cost/times worn. A dress that you wear 2 times might only cost $50, but a pair of $150 jeans that you wear once a week for three years will actually cost you less in the long run.


Staples include things like a little black dress, good fitting jeans, nude heels, a beige coat, black blazer, solid white tees, ballet flats, brown boots, a tailored pencil skirt, etc.

, These are things like red jeans, use them to add some spark to your wardrobe. If you find that the color and the fit of the jeans work for you, buy them. Having trendy pieces will make a bold fashion statement and let you have fun with fashion. But then again, trends are just that. TRENDS. Something might be in style, but if it doesn't work for your body type, its best to not waste the money.


Try buying cheaper trendy pieces like cool necklaces, a funky shirt, etc. that you won't feel bad for having spent money on when it goes out of fashion.







, Keeping color and fit in mind, star with the basics and build. Once you have that, begin to build with accessories. As Coco Chanel once said ""Get yourself fully dressed and then, before walking out the front door, pause by the mirror and remove one item."" Remember simplicity is best. A cute belt, cocktail ring, or pearl necklace may be all you need to pull your look together.



Put on the basics. If you are going for a bold bottom like coral jeans, chances are that you are going to want to play down the rest of your outfit with something like a flattering white tee.







Add dimension to your outfit. Throw on a blazer or a cardigan. Stick to neutrals to balance the bold bottoms, so something like a navy blazer or beige cardigan.







Find the right accessories. For a bolder look, add chunky gold jewelry. For a preppier look, add a cute headband and some pearl earrings.







Put on your shoes. Add heels for some height, boots for a more casual look, ballet flats for a feminine look.







, The first thing someone notices about you is your face and hair. If you take care of these things, and put effort into getting ready in the morning, the most casual outfit will look completely chic. Once again, you want to work on the what-flatters-you-best theory. So skip the neon pink eye shadows you saw in Vogue this month and switch to a light purple that brings the color out of your green eyes.

, It's the most important thing a woman can have. Keep a smile on your face; and always keep your chin up and look straight forward when you are walking.

Practice respect to everyone in your life.,
Avoid self-criticism.,
Develop strong values to live by.,
Be mature.,
Appreciate your education.,
Display confidence.,
Practice humility.","How to Dress, Act, and Look Perfect (Girls)3"," You should always show a great attitude towards your family, teachers, friends, and everyone you meet. Even if you disagree with someone's views or behaviors, you can show respect by refraining from judgement or ill treatment. Accepting different viewpoints shows your maturity. You should present yourself to everyone in a dignified and elegant way that will help you receive the respect from others that you give to them. Here are some methods you can practice:Always say ""please"" and ""thank you"".
Never talk negatively about someone to others.
Treat others how you want to be treated.

, It is important to remember that nobody is perfect, and there will be times that you make mistakes, have regret, and find yourself in an ""oops"" moment. Making mistakes is part of being human. Instead of being overly critical of yourself, or bashing yourself to others, reflect on your mistakes, learn from them, and move on. Being critical of yourself should not be a part of your daily routine. If you say bad things about yourself to others, than you open the door for others to say bad things as well.

, Values are the guidelines that keep you grounded and prevent you from making poor decisions. They also feed into your reputation and are one way that other people develop an opinion about your character. They take a lifetime to build, but they can be damaged in a brief moment of poor decision making.


Listen to your parents, grandparents, or any person who is older and wiser than you when they offer up advice and insight on life. They can teach you how to avoid bad situations and make the best choices for your life.
Each time you are presented with peer pressure, or find yourself in a difficult decision making moment, remember your values. Do not allow yourself to be tempted with bad decisions that you will be sure to regret later.

, When trying to get as close to perfect as possible, a major component is acting responsible and being able to handle any situation that comes your way. This does not mean that you can't let go, and have fun, but you should also not make a fool out of yourself. Here are some tips to help you practice maturity:Do not complain or whine if something does not go your way. Remember that life is not always fair, and you have to roll with the punches.
Know what your responsibility are at home, at school, and to your friends and family. Mature people recognize their responsibilities and do their best to live up to them. This means helping out at home, being kind to your friends, and trying your best at school.

, Having intelligence is a part of being well-rounded. Focus in class, practice good study habits, set up a schedule for homework, and try to take a genuine interest in all of the knowledge your are lucky enough to learn.


Give your best self to school everyday even when the going gets tough. Although you can't achieve absolute perfection, you can certainly try with iron will and a smile.
Remember to be grateful to have the opportunity to learn. It may be difficult to learn that one subject, or be draining constantly studying, but knowledge is power, and it will take you far in life.

, A girl that is as close to perfect as someone can get is a girl that holds great confidence. Other people will see your high self-esteem and think that you must have your life altogether. Here are some great tips to help you act confidently:


Hold your shoulders back and your head held high. Your body language says a lot about you, and having strong body language communicates that you are capable and in-charge.Smile and laugh as much as you can. Smiling is a great way to show you are comfortable in your own skin and glad to be alive, and laughing will spread joy to all those around you. People will be envious of your sense of humor.Be optimistic by always looking at the bright side of all situations.

, Even if you are as close to perfect as a person can be, bragging is not attractive. It is okay to feel proud of your accomplishments, but try not to flaunt your successes in everyone's face. This can come across as rude, tacky, and disrespectful. Feel free to accept praise, and do not hide the things you work hard for, but do so with gratitude and appreciation.


For example, if you score the most points during a basketball game, it is okay to feel good about it, and accept compliments from other people. However, do not go around telling everyone about that you won the game for the team. This would be an example of bragging.
Give compliments to others instead of competing with them. When you notice someone's success or hard work, let that person know with a sincere compliment. This will display your good character, and it will show that you're not intimidated by the success of others.

If you're reading this article, then you probably have Internet access, visit http://www.teenvogue.com/, the ultimate magazine and website for stylish teens.,
If you don't have Internet access, go to Walmart, Target, a drugstore, etc.,
Shop!,
Search for things that scream ""you"".,
Instead of a traditional backpack, try a shoulder bag with a long strap, or one of those alternatives to plastic bags, which can be found at H&M, Forever 21, Target, etc.,
For cute everyday makeup, try Almay eyeshadow, the ones that can play up your eye color.,
Now that your clothes are ready, time for the act that isn't actually an act.,
Reunite with your old friends, but don't be afraid to meet new people.,
Keep your life secret.","How to Be Fashionable, Mysterious, and Make Friends Like You This School Year"," If anything looks immature, outdated or just plain ugly, give it to the Goodwill. The cute stuff can go back in your closet/dresser/whatever.;
, Sign up for the 30-day Back To School Makeover. It will really help you figure out what to wear, how to get enough sleep, how to take care of your skin, etc.

, and pick up Teen Vogue magazine. Read it! Don't simply look at the pictures. You want to be that girl who knows about the latest gossip, fashion, etc. and isn't afraid to let everyone know she does. Also, Seventeen magazine is a good choice, and so is their website.

, After throwing out some of those terrible clothes, you need to go on a stylish shopping spree. Save up money so you can buy clothes without feeling super restrained.


If you have a more money to spend than the average person, go to some of the more expensive stores.

, If it's trendy, but you know it's not your style, don't buy it. Black is a great color to start off with. For a classy, but casual look, pair black skinny jeans with a patterned tank top underneath a classic short sleeved white button down, and either cute flip-flops or ballet flats. if you're more of a sporty girl, wear low-top Converse in plain black and white. A big boho-style bag is ideal for any situation, school, shopping, nightlife... make sure it'll match several outfits in your closet. You don't want to get a big fuzzy neon green bag with a bamboo handle, cause honestly, what's going to match that? for jewelry, try long wooden, plastic, or pearl necklaces that can be wrapped around at least twice. Be creative! your jewelry can be as funky or as low key as you want. It's a big way to express yourself. Shops that have cute (and affordable) clothes are ones such as H&M, Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters.

, if you must have a backpack, don't get anything immature, like Hannah Montana or Sesame Street. A good choice would be to opt for a plain black Jansport. Even better, buy a plain black backpack and decorate it with iron ons, fabric markers and cool fabrics and stick ons. Forever 21 has very cute backpacks.

, It really enhances your eye color. For mascara, a good one would be LashBlast by Covergirl (drugstores), or Diorshow by Dior (Sephora or select Macys). These both lengthen and volumize your lashes with very little to no clumps. For blush, maybe a loose mineral powder, especially L'oreal. This can be around $15, which is a bit pricey, but its worth it. For basic face powder or concealer, Revlon, Covergirl, and Loreal are great. Make sure it matches your skin, and blend the face powder with clean hands, not a brush, unless its loose powder. now for the lips, many people usually leave theirs bare, but if you want, opt for a nude lip color or a clear gloss. Any brand is fine, just make sure it works for you. some people just put Vaseline on them and it looks great. If you need help with how to put on the makeup, magazines and online makeup tutorials can be a great help.

, Be yourself, but don't let just anyone know exactly who you are. Leave some mystery. Read books. Smile like you have a secret. Don't talk too much. But be a nice person. Be polite to your teachers, classmates, and adults. Being rude to someone usually won't make someone want to be friends with you. If someone is mean/rude to you, simply kill them with kindness or smile coolly, acting like that they are simply an annoying bug and not someone who is actually hurting your feelings.

, Make friends with everyone, but be completely exclusive with a very small group of people, from 1 (your best friend or boyfriend) to about four friends. You are not supposed to be the Paris Hilton popular. You're supposed to be the Kate Moss popular. Gently influence your friends, perhaps by showing then your Teen Vogue/Vogue/Nylon magazines, giving them makeovers, talking to them about clothing and trends you like. Don't be pushy though. you want to keep your friends! Don't pressure your friends to be anything they don't want to be.

, Let your friends in on your life but, if anyone, only your very best friend should know the ""Life of (your name) - Special Edition"". Unless someone specifically asks, don't blab about your life to everyone and everything with ears. If someone does ask, tell them a little snippet. They will be eager to know more, but if you don't say anything else on the subject, you'll seem mysterious.

Have manners.,
Opt to learn.,
Expand your vocabulary.,
Learn how to hold a good conversation.,
Be kind.",How to Be a Classy School Girl1,"  Try not to swear or do anything unhygienic in public.  Always say please and thank you, and greet your elders.  Don't get to obnoxious when around strangers, just say a simple and polite ""Hi.""  When eating dinner with others, make sure to keep clean and not make a huge mess after you're finished.  Stay somewhat reserved and conservative.;
,  Reading is very classy and helps you expand your vocabulary and learn more stuff.  Make it a goal to read at least 2 books a month.  Always strive to get good grades in school.  Listen to the teacher, take short but effective notes, ask questions (this does not make you seem unintelligent), and always do your homework.

,  Slang words and curse words are not polite nor classy.  You don't have to use extremely complicated words for every sentence, but it's good to know some classic language that most don't use nowadays.  You can do this by reading and listening to people who have a wide vocabulary talk.

,  Don't talk about partying, drugs, smoking, or anything rebellious.  Talk about casual stuff like homework, what you're doing next week, what books you've been reading/what music you've been listening to, etc.  Be a good listener and make eye contact.  Try to listen more than you talk.

,  Classy people are intelligent and elegant, but they aren't unapproachable or arrogant. Learn when to stand up for yourself or others and be assertive, but never be bossy or rude. Avoid people who say bad things about you and avoid disloyal friends.  Always offer honest compliments and smile, and offer to do favours with nothing in return.

Ask yourself: ""what types of clothes do I wear most often?,
Go through your closet at least once a year.,
Donate, sell, give away, or store your rejects.

,
Know what works for your height, figure, and coloring.

,
Find your correct bra size..,
If there isn't a store in your area, you can measure yourself.

,
Remember those questions you asked yourself when cleaning out your closet?,
Shop in a variety of places.,

Don't hold on to items that are uncomfortable.,
Remember: every store is an opportunity!",How to Dress Sophisticated when You Are a Teenager,"""; ""what items of clothing do I need to keep for special occasions?""; ""what kind of impression do I want to make?"".;
, Toss anything that doesn't fit, has irreparable damage, or just isn't your style. Keep in mind those three questions while you are doing this.

,,, There is a lot of incorrect information out there, especially at mainstream US stores like Victoria's Secret. The only way to ensure that the salesperson is telling you the truth is to shop at a store that carries 28-50 AA-K.

,, When you first start shopping for new things, try small upgrades of the things you normally feel most comfortable wearing. For example, if you favor hoodies, try cardigans instead. As time goes by, continue adding pieces to fit the impression you hope to make.

, Instead of shopping only at the mall, try local boutiques; consignment stores such as Plato's Closet; discount stores such as TJ Maxx and Marshall's; outlet malls; and online auctions like eBay.

, Swap clothes with a friend, use your older sibling's hand-me-downs, or ask your female relatives if they kept their high school clothes.

, If you can't make something work for you, either via tailoring or handy tricks, like Stretch New Shoes or Fix Painful Shoes.

, Try to keep an open mind when shopping, as you never know what you might find.

Be confident - confidence is the sexiest thing you can have.",How to Dress Sexy for the Summer (for Teen Girls)," Look for your closet and remind your self what you have from last year. Make a list of what you need to buy, then go shopping and purchase it all. Make sure to try things in to ensure they fit perfectly. Some items that are gorgeous for summer include:


Crop tops. Don't think you have to have a flat stomach to wear these: they look great on everyone. Popular styles include tight lace, and cropped t-shirts.
Denim shorts. A couple of pairs of denim shorts will be useful, because you can wear them most days. Don't be afraid of different colours and prints.
Summer dresses. It's good to have at least one cute cute day dress, and one sexier one for evening parties.
Skirts. Little skirts are so cute for day or night. Try skater, mini, wrap and denims;
, Summer is one of the only times you can show off your amazing body in a swim suit. Bikinis are probably the most popular style, and for good reason, but tankinis and one-pieces can also look super hot. Look for cutouts, lace-effects and bold colours, as these are in fashion right now.

, You may think you have to show a lot of skin to be sexy, but you don't have to. Wear what makes you look amazing and feel confident.

, Summer isn't a time to hide away in dark colours. Try turquoise, coral, pink or mint. Don't shu away from spots, stripes, florals or chevrons too. These will ensure that all eyes are on you.

, Summer clothes look best with sunkissed skin, so try some fake tan or glow-enhancing lotion. Remember to wear sunscreen though, because damaged, burnt skin is anything but sexy.

, When putting together an outfit, it's all about balance. If your wearing tight, short shorts, balance it out with a looser cropped t-shirt. If your wearing a super-revealing crop top, match it with a longer length skirt. Just pick one or two features to show off, ie. legs or stomach or breasts.

, There are lots of YouTube tutorials with different looks you can try out.

, Shoes and accessories can make or break your outfit.


Essential summer shoes are: Sneakers for day time, flat sandals or flip flops for the beach and some sexy high heeled sandals for evening.
Accessories you should purchase include: a statement necklace, a floppy hat, bracelets and anklets and, of course, sunglasses. You could also try out some temporary tattoos, but make sure to choose classy designs, such as metallics.
Don't pile on the accessories. Just wear no more than two or three things with each outfit.

, A lot of people feel uncomfortable showing skin in summer, but don't worry, no one is judging how you look. Walk with good posture and strut your stuff. If you act confident, people will believe that you are.

Know what kind of show it is: General Admission?,
Pick Your Bottoms:: Normally, you should wear jeans or capris.,
Pick Your Top:: This is important as well.,
Accessories: Keeping accessories to a minimum is the smart way to go, but if you are going to wear some, here's how to go about it...


Don't wear anything too chunky or heavy, it'll get uncomfortable and will stick to your sweaty body.,
Shoes!",How to Dress Smart and Look Good at a Rock Concert (Girls)," Are there seats? Is it a festival? Inside or Outside?


General Admission means you will be standing the whole time. There are rarely ever seats at GA shows. So, know that you should wear comfortable shoes. Flip-flops, sandals, open toed shoes, or heels are a huge 'To Don't'. Sneakers are your best shot.
If there are seats, you have the option of wearing something a little less casual, but still, keep it sensible.
If it's a festival, obviously there are no seats. Warped Tour and Bamboozle are perfect examples. You'll be out all day, for hours in the heat and sun. Comfort is key here.
Inside or Outside? If it's inside, it will be stuffy and hot, whether or not there's air conditioning. If it's outside, it depends on your area and the season. Watch the weather channel and decide from there.;
, Pick a pair that your comfortable in. Not too big or too small and be sure to wear a belt. There is a possibility that you could get something spilled on them, or they might even get a rip, so don't wear the $200 pair you just bought that day from Armani Exchange.


If you're going to a show with seats a skirt could be alright, but it's not recommended. If you do wear a skirt in a GA show, you should wear shorts or solid colored under them in case you decided to mosh or go crowd surfing. Only wear a skirt (or dress) if you're absolutely sure it won't fly up easily.
If it's an outside show, shorts are also a good option. Again, comfort is key. Don't wear them too short or even too loose. You want to look fashionable, but no one wants to be the girl who gets called a groupie just because of what she's wearing.

, It's going to be the most noticed part of your outfit. It's how you declare who you are at a show. It's important to know the weather if it's an outside show when choosing your outfit. But before choosing, keep one crucial rule in mind...



Do not wear the tee shirt of the band you are going to see! We know you like the band, obviously, because you're at the show. So don't be ""that guy"". The only exception to this rule is wearing the general tour dates shirt for that tour or a homemade shirt for one of the bands with lyrics or a song title on it. Most bands, especially smaller bands, really appreciate a fan taking time out of their day to make something for them and sometimes like to sign the shirts. So, if you're going to do this, make it good! Be creative and take your time, and have a group of friends all make shirts with you to wear to the show.
If it's outside and likely to be cold: Obviously don't wear a tank top. Layering can be cute and helpful if you know how to do it. Also a cute t-shirt under a sweatshirt. Or a sweater. But don't dress too warm because once you get there, you will have to keep it on the whole time (unless you want it to get stolen, then go ahead and take it off).
If it's going to be warm: Wear a t-shirt. The t-shirt could be from a different band than you're seeing, from a movie, or have some sort of quote on it. Halters are bad news if it's GA because there are tons of boys who will think about 'accidentally' pulling the top down. Just prevent the issue before it starts. Tanks could be alright, as long as they're not going to tear or fall off easily. Wear sturdy clothes.
If it's inside: Again, a t-shirt. Don't wear anything too heavy because it gets hot quick in the room and you don't want to get over-heated and pass out. Tank tops are okay, but again, stay away from halters.
Simple Rules for picking your shirt: Choose something that you enjoy wearing, something comfortable, but also something that you won't mind getting a little dirty in. Your clothes will get sweaty. And if you're a mosher or don't mind getting unnaturally close to people to get a good view, someone will spill something on you. It could also get ripped and/or stretched if you plan on moshing or crowd surfing.

,
Don't wear anything worth more than about $10. It can get stolen, broken, or lost.
No scarves, unless it's outside and cold then, of course you need something to keep you warm. Otherwise, it will get hot and itchy and in your way.
If you do wear rings, keep them simple and without anything dangling off or anything large.
If you want to wear a necklace, wear either a choker or something that will stay in place. Nothing extremely long, layered, or thick. Not only can it get broken or stolen, it could smack someone in the face (or you) and cause an injury. Also, don't wear anything expensive (i.e. real stones or something that was a gift).
Purses generally are going to be a hassle. Of course, if you're a girl you're going to need certain items(i.e. feminine products, make-up, deodorant). Unless you absolutely must have a bag with you, bring your phone, money, and lip balm in a pocket. If you have to bring one, it's recommended to have something which will function as an across-the-body bag with a long strap and something that is relatively substantial. Make sure it's something that you won't mind possibly getting something spilled on or scraped.

,: Shoes are obviously important. You want to keep your feet protected and comfortable for hours.


Never, ever wear heels. They are not comfortable and they are not functional, in fact, they are a bit of a safety hazard. The only time it's even remotely okay to wear heels is if your 100% sure you're going to be seated the whole time. Even then, you don't want to spend the whole night with blisters on your feet and in pain.
Flip-flops are another bad idea. They can fall off and the only protection that's provided is that you're not standing directly on the floor. Your feet will get stepped on, regardless of your shoes, so give yourself a little protection. Also, it's just peace of mind to know that your shoes aren't going to fall off during the show, especially if it's GA.
Sneakers are your guaranteed choice. Your feet will be protected, the shoes will not fall off, and you'll look great while you're at the show. Great brands to choose from (the ones that most likely the bands will be wearing as well) are Vans, Converse, Nikes, Supras, and others.
Boots are also a choice, but not so much recommended. They can get uncomfortable after a while and can injure people if the shoes heavy soled.

Buy skirts that go at least as far as your knees.,
Make sure that your pants are not low rise.,
Make sure your shorts reach close to your knees and are not showing your upper thigh or butt.,
Your T-shirts should cover your whole shoulder.,
When buying anything from shoes, to purses, to clothes, make sure the colours complement your skin and eyes.,
Try little or no makeup.",How to Dress Modestly (for Girls)," Make sure that when you bend down as far as you can go that you cannot see your upper thighs or your underwear.;
, Be sure you are buying a higher rise. They should be just below your bellybutton. If they are low-rise, they might reveal your underwear when you bend over.

, Like the pants, make sure your shorts are high rise.

, Lift your arms into the air above your head, as if you were cheering, ""Yay!"" If your shirt feels too tight around the shoulders (and may also reveal a large portion of your stomach), it is too small. The same rule applies to sweaters as well. Be sure your tops are not too loose, but not tight either. Don't outline your figure suggestively, but don't wear extremely baggy clothes.

, In other words, they should make you shine, not give you a flashy appearance. The correct solid, plain colors will make you look beautiful without all the glitter and other jazz.

, If you do wear makeup, make sure it is vague and more natural looking.

Shape your outfit.,
Mix and match styles and colors.,
Wear acid-washed denim.,
Accessorize excessively with bright colors.,
Embellish with quirky details and 80s kitsch.,
Experiment with 80s hair styles.,
Create the 80s makeup look.",How to Dress Retro (for Girls)1," The 80s were defined by a unique blend of different styles that emphasized extravagance and materialism. Over-the-top clothing in bold (often neon) colors was the norm.Women’s fashion leaned toward oversized tops paired with leggings, tight pants, or a miniskirt.


Pull out any and all leggings you might have, in any color. These could be worked in to almost any 80s style outfit you can come up with.
If you have any oversized t-shirts, especially in neon colors, try out one of those. Roll the sleeves halfway up and cut the neck out of it so that it hangs off the shoulder. Wear a brightly colored tank top or sports bra underneath.;
, Mixing bold, bright (usually neon) colors was very stylish in the 80s. Incorporating lace, designer logos and shoulder pads on top of the bright colors was even trendier. Everything in the 80s had to be big and loud, so start putting together outfit ideas that include bright colors, extravagant designs and anything with shoulder pads.


Pair bright, tight-fitting leggings with an oversized t-shirt in a bold, contrasting color. If possible, try to introduce one or two additional colors on top of that. Brightly colored belts, leg warmers and shoes are great ways to accent your loud ensemble.
Try lacy black tights under a bright miniskirt. Or a loose, lacy top in a dark color on top of a bright miniskirt and neon tights. If you can find any way to incorporate lace into the mix, do it.
Raid your parents' closet for anything with shoulder pads. If you can't find anything, create your own shoulder pads by stuffing socks (or anything else you deem appropriate) into the shoulders of your top.

, Acid-washed jeans were huge in the 80s and women opted for a slim-fitting, high-waisted fit. Acid-washed jean jackets were also staples in the 80s, worn by both men and women.


Hit your local thrift shop for anything denim and acid-washed. It’s likely that you’ll find a denim jacket at any thrift shop – even if it’s not acid-washed it would still work great, especially if you cut the sleeves off and wash it so that the shoulders fray a little.
Try acid-washing a pair of jeans that you already have to give them an authentic 80s feel. Women used to acid-wash denim at home all the time in the 80s. All you need is bleach, rubber bands, and your chosen jeans.

, Neon colored sunglasses in large sizes, lots of colored bangles on both arms and huge hoop earrings are great jewelry choices.Look for anything with lace, especially gloves and headbands, to add to your ensemble as additional accessories.


Costume jewelry was also very popular, so add a chunky, brightly colored piece to your outfit. If you have a huge, garish cocktail ring, that is the perfect addition. The gaudier, the better. The 80s celebrated excess!

, For instance, try to track down a brightly colored fanny pack to wear with your outfit. Members only jackets were very popular at the time, as well, and are relatively easy to find at thrift stores. Carry a boombox along with you for an instantly recognizable 80s flair.

, There are several ways to approach 80s hair, but one thing all of the styles have in common is that they are big and hairsprayed. Perms were extremely common and curly hairstyles were very fashionable. Crimped hair was also popular – some stores still carry hair crimpers, if you want to try to look for one.


Curl your hair with a curling iron (or crimp with a hair crimper) and tease it to your desired size and shape. The bigger, the better – of course! Hairspray your hair and then tease it a little more.
Flip your head upside down and tease the underside of your hair to get even more volume. Finish it off with a healthy blast of hairspray.
You could also try out a side ponytail, another popular 80s hairstyle. Curl, tease and hairspray your ponytail and secure it with several scrunchies in different colors.
If you have bangs, tease them as high as you can get them and secure with hairspray.

, Loud, heavy makeup and neon colors were popular makeup styles in the 80s. Lips were usually pale and eye makeup was bright and emphasized dark, thick eyelashes with lots of eyeliner.Apply bright eyeshadow with a heavy hand. Line your top and bottom eyelids with thick black eyeliner, along with your water line. Finish it off with several coats of mascara and a light, frosty shade of lipstick or lip gloss.
You could also try a very dark eyeshadow instead of a bright one. The eyeliner and mascara would be the same, but this time finish it off with a bright red or pink shade of lipstick.
For real life makeup and hairstyle references, look up pictures of icons like Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Molly Ringwald and Siouxsie Sioux.

Shape your outfit.,
Wear jeans with flared, bell bottom, or wide legs.,
Accessorize with simple pieces made of natural materials.,
Try out the glam rock look.,
Go disco.,
Experiment with 1970s hairstyles.,
Create the 70s makeup look.",How to Dress Retro (for Girls)2," The 1970s had several style movements, with the most remembered being a continuation of the 1960s bohemian look, the glittery androgyny of glam rock and the decadent disco fashion. The most popular silhouette of the decade was that of a tight-fitting top and loose-fitting bottom.


To get an easy but instantly recognizable 1970s teen look, wear a tight-fitting concert t-shirt and hip hugger jeans with canvas sneakers or tennis shoes. Teenagers adopted this very casual look in the 70s.
Match a flowing, gauzy top in earthy tones like warm brown, burgundy, rust, mustard, and avocado green with a long skirt in an ethnic print.Add a headband and delicate scarf for an instant 70s hippie look.

, Hip huggers and high-waisted jeans were also popular in the 70s. These styles sometimes come back into current fashion, so it’s entirely possible that you can find a new pair. You can also look for more authentic versions at thrift shops, probably with much cheaper price tags.


Jeans in the 70s often came decorated with embroidery, embellishments, and studs, so keep an eye out for those details.

, Thrift shops will be gold mines for these items. Look for jewelry made of wood, shells, stones, feathers, Indian beads and leather. Mix and match the pieces.Add a big, floppy hat and large sunglasses as final touches.


Moccasin boots and Birkenstocks were the most popular shoes for the bohemian look. You could probably wear any type of brown sandal or clog that you already own and get the same effect, especially if the other elements of your outfit are on point.
Fringe adorned everything – incorporate it in any way that you can.

, Glam rock clothing was flamboyant, brightly colored and made of fabrics like satin, velvet and spandex. Androgynous looks for both sexes were embraced and shiny fabrics in bright colors defined the era.


Go for anything sequined, bedazzled, gemmed, tight-fitting and outrageously accentuated. Glittery items and otherworldly costumes are also ways to look glam.
Accessorize with feather boas, giant sunglasses and anything that featured leather and studs. Leather jackets, ascots, velvet coats and silk scarves are also perfect for the glam look.Wear shiny, glittery, sequined or neon-colored tights with your ensemble.

, Disco fashion was defined by glamour, eccentricity and decadence. Sequins and tight-fitting clothing could be found in every discotheque. Disco fashions were created with ease of movement in mind and included wrap-around skirts, leotards, tube tops, and dancewear-inspired dresses made of form-fitting fabrics like spandex.


Wear a sequined tube top with tight pants or short shorts. Spandex pieces in neon colors and anything that would glitter under dancefloor lights work perfectly. Search in thrift shops and costume shops for more over-the-top styles.
Pair a colorful leotard with a wrap-around skirt from a dancewear shop. Add anything else that is eye-catching and sparkly.
Accessorize with huge, glittery costume jewelry pieces and knee high boots or very high heeled shoes (platforms if you can find them).

, The main hairstyles of the 70s were feathered, shaggy or long with a center part. Try creating the wispy feathered hairstyle and spraying it with golden spray-on hair color (like the ones you see around Halloween) to get the frosted look so popular in the 70s.


If you have layers in your hair, work with those to get the shaggy look. Spray dry shampoo in it to get the right volume and texture, then add a texturizing pomade to define your layers. Keep it a little messy.
For those with long hair, simply part it down the middle and let it hang loose and free. Add a little product to make it shine.

, Shimmer eye shadows were popular in every style and glitter trends in makeup were worn by both men and women. For glam or disco looks you can’t go wrong with brightly colored, highly glossed lips and “cat” eyeliner.Apply eyeshadow that is heavy, frosted, shimmery or glittery. Use plenty of black eyeliner and black mascara. If you want to go all-out, wear long false lashes.
For the bohemian look, wear pale peach or pink lipstick, as they preferred a natural look.
For real life 70s hair and makeup references, look up pictures of icons like Farrah Fawcett, Debbie Harry, Cher, Stevie Nicks, Bebe Buell, Shelley Duvall, David Bowie and Joni Mitchell.

Experiment with 1960s hairstyles.,
Create the 60s makeup look.",How to Dress Retro (for Girls)3," The 60s decade was a time of major social and cultural change, and the trends of the 1960s reflected that. People were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was born.


To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns.
Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did.

, Paisley prints and psychedelic prints are also great choices.You can’t go wrong by pairing those two elements together.


Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow, so don’t shy away from the bolder colors you find. Jeans often featured embroidery and appliqued designs so keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself if you’re crafty.Look for blouses with long and flowy ""bubble"" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too.
Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look.

, Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will also work perfectly.

, You could have fun with fresh flowers, but fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a crown.

, Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items. Stacked silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings are good choices, too.

, There was a wide variety of hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long, natural looking style that the hippies wore.Part it down the middle and allow it to hang loose and free.


If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish.

, The hippies usually went for a natural look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however, especially for special events and festivals. Paint images of daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add some face glitter for a little sparkle.


For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be instantly recognizable.
For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull.

Shape your outfit.,
Wear a dress made of colorful printed fabric.,
Accessorize with faux fur, gloves and large cat-eye shaped sunglasses.Fur was extremely popular in the 1950s so try local resale shops for dresses and coats with faux fur-lined collars.,
Experiment with 1950s hairstyles.,
Create the 50s makeup look.",How to Dress Retro (for Girls)4," Dresses were the most popular clothing items for women in the 1950s.Soft shapes, defined waists, vibrant colors, and bold statements are all highly characteristic of women’s fashion during that decade.A big emphasis was placed on looking glamorous, well-dressed and perfectly groomed every day.

, Make sure the skirt goes falls slightly past your knee. Polka dots, gingham, florals, stripes, plaids and novelty themes (like science and western themes) are all great choices for the printed fabric.


Halter sundresses, full skirts, and Peter Pan collars (flat collars that feature rounded ends that meet in the middle) are variations on the simple dress theme, if you want to try one of those.
Poodle skirts were a fleeting fad at the time, but now are iconic for many people when thinking of 50s fashion. Check your local costume shop for a big fluffy one.
The pencil skirt, a fitted skirt that falls just below the knee, was the other main dress silhouette of the time. These skirts are still popular today. Pair one with a collared, button down dress shirt or a fitted sweater for another iconic 50s look.

, Don a pair of white or cream colored gloves for the ultimate ladylike look of that time. Wear saddle shoes with socks for the poodle style. Otherwise, pair your dress with simple, tasteful heels.

, For short hair, curl it tightly with a curling iron to get the iconic poodle cut look. For longer hair, make a big bouncy ponytail or create the ultra-glamorous (and time consuming) curled and pinned hairstyle.Regardless of the hairstyle you choose, definitely make sure you set it with plenty of hairspray before heading out.

, Wear bright pink, orange or red lipsticks that coordinate with your outfit. Apply minimal eyeshadow and lots of mascara for a glamorous eye look.


Cherry red nail polish was the most fashionable nail color at that time.For real life 50s makeup and hairstyle references, look up pictures of icons like Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Donna Reed, Elizabeth Taylor and Betty Page.

Make your own stuff (D.I.Y.).,
Mix and match.,
Be confident.,
Be unique.",How to Dress Uniquely (Preteen Girls)," Throw out anything torn (unless you like ripped jeans), stained, or that no longer fits nicely. If you don't like it, and want to avoid spending money on new clothes, keep clothes that are outdated, that you might not like, to see if you can incorporate them into a new outfit or repurpose them with sewing tricks. Donate anything you can't use, but make sure it's still in good condition.;
, Examine what you like and make a list. Then decide on a scale of 1 to 10 how much you like it. For example:


Girly: 6; Emo: 3; Hippie: 3; Fancy: 3; Schoolgirl: 4; Punk: 2; Indie: 8; Vintage: 7 - so the girly, indie, vintage look would win out here.

, Pick up things that fit your categories.The higher up it is,the more you need from it. In example above,the person would be mostly indie and vintage clothes, a few girly clothes and a few fancy stuff. Remember that accessories can easily change the style/look of your outfit.

, Maybe you really like emo hair, but dyeing it at your age is not recommended (black hair dye is especially unsafe). Instead you could just get layers. Maybe you really like fancy stuff but you shouldn't spend many dollars on one single dress. Avoid high heels, or showing your bra or underwear, body-con clothes, tattoos, piercings other than ear piercings, mini skirts, short shorts and dyeing your hair.

, If you know how to knit, then you could make a headband. You can patch clothes with them, make a necklace, a bandanna, etc.

, Love those studded black belt, pink tank top, and black skinny jeans? Put them together and add a cute pair of flats for a girly punk look. Just make sure you don't look too tacky. Zebra print with a plaid skirt is a bit too wild.

, You might be wearing the latest clothing, but you'll look awful if you frown, slump, and talk badly about yourself. Instead, relax, have good posture, and smile. Good grammar comes in handy too.

, Making a fashion statement is always cool but you'll look like a poser if you act like everybody else. Be yourself, be unique, be nice, and people will flock to you. Even if they don't, you'll be a strong and confident individual who doesn't need others to confirm your worth.

, For example, if you already have shorts in several washes, and they fit, try not to buy more, since you properly don't need them anymore, and buying more may just waste money because you're still growing and honestly people are not going to pay much attention to how often you wear a certain pair.

, For example, let's say, if a person prefers to buy most denim bottoms at brands like Hollister and American Eagle, or fashion tops (the kind of shirts that go out of style fast) at places like Forever 21, Wet Seal, and Ross, they would write them down.

, For example, jeans last for around 2-3 years during your teenage years, due to changes in height. Search for cheap prices.


Go easy on the amounts. You don't need ten basic items, for example.
Buy your basics first, then add in fun stuff for an awesome wardrobe. A few of each wash/color will be enough (light, medium, dark wash and neutral colors mostly for things like cardigans and camis). Basics: Jeans, shorts, capris, hoodies, jackets, camis, cardigans, shoes, t-shirts, etc.

, You can skip this step if you're already into makeup. Before you do anything with makeup check with your parents and see what you're allowed to wear.


Figuring out what your parents say you can wear will help when your shopping and also you won't waste money on things your parents later tell you that you can't wear. If you're just starting out, only get some basics to get a feel of how to use makeup. The basics are concealer, powder, blush & bronzer, mascara, lipbalm/lipgloss.

, Get an idea of how much you're willing to pay for what, where you buy what, and how often you buy what.

,


Buy mascara at drugstores (Walmart) because you throw them out every month. Do not do this if you're addicted to makeup, though.

, For example, people will not care very much if you buy cheap lipgloss.


You don't need lipstick, or any other lip product at the drugstore, as a teen.

, A few different shades are nice but you will want to buy more of other important things.

, Try buying most everyday used items at drugstore since you use it more often and will have to buy it a lot more. Buy most of these at the drugstore, to save money for more important things and to be able to afford them all:


Lip products
Eyeliner
Mascara
Setting powders (Rimmel and NYC are great)
Everyday blush & bronzer (Elf - Blush & Bronzer duo $3 works well and Nice - Sunny Bronzer $3)
Some eyeshadow
Brow gel (Elf - Brow gel $1 or Maybelline great lash clear mascara)
Brow pencil
Concealer (mac $20)
Foundation ($20-30)
Primers (a must have for young skin)
Special makeup. For example, Urban Decay naked palettes are amazing, but expensive. It is worth it.

Don't use up special makeup on a daily basis because it is expensive.


Accessories: Buy as much as you like, because they make up a good outfit. However, be smart and don't spend a lot on simple things like these. Forever 21 has several accessories priced perfect for almost any budget. Do consider paying more for a good quality purse. Check out Target and K-mart first, though.

, Hollister and similar stores have sales almost every season, which is a good time to stuck up on jeans, shorts, etc. On all things that are harder to buy on a regular basis.

, Your skin is young and delicate, so take care of it.

Add style to your look by choosing one with a fun print or embellishments at the collar.

, If you fall in love with a top or dress that has a deep v-neck or low square neckline, do not despair. A plain camisole or one with feminine lace detailing at the neck can transform that garment into something that will work with your modest wardrobe. Many camisoles have adjustable straps, so you can extend the neckline of the camisole to cover up any cleavage or uncomfortable amounts of skin.

, Think shawls, denim jackets, leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, blazers, military-style jackets, and more. The more variety you have in your outerwear, the more looks you can create. Outerwear is great for layering over pieces with low-cut backs or skinny straps.

, If you want to wear a dress or skirt, but worry that the hemline might be a bit too short, compensate by wearing something beneath it. Skinny jeans and leggings work well for many pieces. Be aware that many leggings may still look immodest, however, since they have a tendency to sculpt your body. To avoid this, only wear leggings with a skirt that covers your rear and most of your thighs. Do not wear super-short mini skirts that reveal everything the moment you sit down.

You do not have to completely hide your curves to still be modest, though. Fitted pieces that lightly conform to your curves will actually make you look clean-cut and well-put-together.

, A-line skirts and pencil skirts are both timeless styles that look nice on most body types. Hemlines that fall at the knee, or thereabouts, are also the most universally flattering.

, Go for classics like boot-cuts or straight-legged pants. These tend to pull away just enough to allow your leg room to breathe, yet they still look flattering on most figures.

, If high necklines are your thing, try mixing in a few mandarin collars with your turtlenecks and crew necks, or look for a V-neck that still sits high on your chest. Do not be afraid of low necklines, since many of these tops can be worn modestly simply by layering a camisole or tank top beneath them.

, You have more options available than the simple t-shirt style short or long sleeve. Look for a few short-sleeve tops with cap or puff sleeves, or long-sleeve tops with kimono, lantern, or bell sleeves. Choosing a fashion-forward sleeve is a good way to stay modest while looking trendy.

, If your dress or skirt obeys most rules of modesty, but you still feel uncomfortable, cover your legs with nylon pantyhose. Plain nude or color styles work best, but you should avoid fishnets or nylons with patterns.

, If you have a knee-length skirt or maxi skirt, consider wearing heels to make your legs look a little longer. Longer legs look attractive, but they do not necessarily look immodest. The right heel will help you look confident and beautiful without looking sultry.

, Scarves are in style, and they come in a variety of colors, patterns, and looks. They also have the added benefit of covering more skin at the base of your neck and top of your chest.

, There is a broad range of fashionable hat styles, ranging from the fedora to the newsboy cap to the bucket hat. Look for one that suits the shape of your face and your personal taste. Buy a few in that style and wear them when you go out for an added, modest boost of style.

, Wear one key piece at a time, or coordinate multiple pieces at once to bring color to your entire ensemble. Let your imagination run free while selecting watches, necklaces, bracelets, rings, and earrings. Stay away from non-traditional pieces, however, like lip rings, eyebrow rings, and tongue rings.

, Nearly any standard purse will be a modest accessory. Look for a medium size in a neutral color for the most versatility, or mix things up by carrying around a large shoulder bag in a bold color.

Take care of everyday upkeep.,
Maintain a healthy mane.,
Make your face look fantastic.,
Wear what looks good on you.,
Tone up.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Look Drop Dead Gorgeous," Scheduling time for hygiene makes sure you get it done, and (even better) helps you see yourself as a priority. Here are some basic guidelines:


Wash your face twice daily. Even if you're super exhausted at night, try to at least take off your makeup and use a moisturizer.
Brush your teeth at least twice per day. Don't brush more than that because the enamel on your teeth will start to wear. Try to floss every night, as well.
Shower once a day, at least. That doesn't mean you have to wash your hair once a day (and sometimes you shouldn't — keep reading for more on that), but your body should be cleaned daily.
Take care of your nails. Nails should be trimmed at least once a week; if you want, you can even try a Manicure or Pedicure.
Remove unwanted body hair regularly. Plucking eyebrows, shaving legs and armpits, and getting rid of other stray hairs doesn't have to be part of your beauty routine. If it is, though, try to do it on a consistent schedule.
Make sure you have clean laundry. Fresh clothes will both look better and make you feel more attractive.;
, Get split ends trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks, and touch up any highlights or color around the same time. Here are some other ways to maximize your locks:



Choose a hairstyle that suits your face shape. How you wear your hair can highlight different parts of your face, so choose a style that brings out what you like. For instance, if you have sharp cheekbones and a wide jaw, wearing your hair pulled back will make these more prominent, whereas flowing layers will make a round face seem longer. You can try braiding the side of your braid for a half shaved look, do a messy ponytail, fishtail braid or curl it. Heat may damage it so try using the headband method.
Don't wash your hair every day. Unless you have baby-fine hair that's thin and gets weighed down easily, consider washing your hair every other day instead. On the between day, use a boar-bristle brush to move the tiny bit of oil through your hair — it will make it look shiny and bouncy.
Avoid over-styling your hair. One or two days a week, give your hair a break from blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners. The heat can damage your hair and make it look brittle.

, Even if your hair and your clothes are just OK, how you take care of your face can push you from ""pretty"" to ""drop-dead gorgeous."" Here's how to make the most of your features, with or without wearing makeup:



Get glowing skin. In addition to washing and moisturizing twice a day, avoid breakouts by keeping your hands away from your face and sleeping on clean pillowcases. Spot-treat pimples using salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Or, for a quick overnight fix, crush a few uncoated aspirin tablets (the plain white ones), mix with a few drops of water, and leave the paste on any zits while you sleep.

Shape your brows. Start by only plucking a few hairs, then see how it looks and remove more from there if necessary. For less painful plucking, avoid doing it during the week before your period. Or, you can hold ice cubes on your skin for a minute before you start tweezing.
Wear makeup that suits your face. Check out some of the tutorials in How to Apply Makeup, or visit a department store for a consultation. (Most makeup counters will put makeup on you and teach you techniques for free, but it doesn't hurt to ask.)
Follow the eyes-or-lips rule. If you wear makeup, focus the drama on either your eyes or your lips — not both. If you have a great pucker and wear red lipstick to make it look amazing, skip the heavy eyeliner and eyeshadow, and do one coat of mascara. If you want to highlight your eyes, go easy on the lips with a light stain or chapstick. Blusher works well too but not over the top!

Be yourself Don't try to be someone you're not. A boy or girl should like you for who you are not about what you look like. Just maintain good hygiene and you're good to go.

, What suits another drop-dead gorgeous girl might not look great on you, and vice versa. The good news: figuring out what probably looks good on you is easier than you think. Try these tips:


Decide whether you should wear warm or cool tones. Wearing the right color can make your skin glow, while the wrong one can make it look washed out or splotchy. The best way to do this is looking at the inside of your wrist under bright light — do your veins look blue or green under your skin? If it's green, wear warms; if it's blue, you'll probably look better in cools.

Warm colors include bright yellows, yellow-based reds and greens, browns, gold, cream and anything with a yellow or orange tint to it.
Cold colors are made up of ""jewel tones"" such as deep purples, blues, and greens, black, white, and ""cool"" pastels with blue tones.


Take a glance at what is in your closet. Chances are, you already gravitate toward colors that look good on you — and it's OK to stick to those.
Make sure your clothes fit. They should cover you adequately without being baggy, and be fitted without squeezing too tightly. If a lot of your clothes are bigger than you'd like, take them to a seamstress or tailor to be altered — individual pieces shouldn't cost much. (You can usually find one at your local dry cleaner's.)

, Exercising regularly will not only make your physique look better, it'll also boost your confidence and your endorphins. Try to set aside time to exercise for at least 30 minutes, three or four times per week, or get involved in an athletic sport. If you need a jumpstart, try these articles:

Oftentimes different events will call for “semi-formal dress” but the actual expectations may differ depending on the type of event, time of day, and so on.


If the event is in the daytime, you should expect to dress slightly less formally and in lighter colors than for evening events. Girls can wear skirts and a dress shirt for day events while guys can wear a light suit jacket paired with suit pants, khakis, or cotton twill pants.
If the event takes place in the evening, “semi-formal” generally means more formal. One helpful rule to stick by is “the later the event, the darker and dressier.”Therefore, guys should wear darker colors, such as a dark suit and tie. Girls should wear a cocktail dress, slacks and a dressy blouse, or a little black dress.If in doubt, ask the organizers of the event.;
, The location of an event can help you dress appropriately since, again, the definition of “semi-formal” actually changes quite a bit depending on these variables.


If you’ve been invited to a garden party in the middle of the afternoon, you don’t want to sweat through your clothes, so you can likely wear lighter fabrics and slightly more revealing clothing (such as knee high skirts or dresses for girls). However, if you’ll be indoors for a more conservative event, such as a bar mitzvah in a synagogue, you’ll want to cover up more and also perhaps have a couple layers to adjust to the temperature as needed.
Another possible consideration is where the event will be held in terms of region or even country. The concept of semi-formal is different not only for each event but also for different groups of people. For example, a semi-formal event at a beach in Southern California will likely include sundresses and flipflops while expectations may be different at an event on the East Coast. If you are going to an event in a different country or a foreign cultural event, be sure to ask ahead of time for more guidance on what to wear.

, There are some key ways to avoid the mistake of drastically under- or overdressing. Knowing some of the basic ways in which these three categories differ from each other will help you dress appropriately for every occasion.


Semi-formal dress tends to be more comfortable and flexible than formal dress. However, many people (girls and guys alike!) think that means anything goes when there are some key rules. For example, for girls, a golden rule of wearing a semi-formal dress is that it can go to the knee or lower but it should not touch the ground. A floor length dress would be considered formal and you would probably be considered overdressed for the occasion. Of course, you don’t want to wear simply any dress based on length so go for dresses that are made of fancier fabrics, such as silk, satin, or velvet.For guys the expectation of semi-formal dress is a bit more straightforward: wear clothes that are just slightly less formal than a tuxedo. Dress slacks, jackets, blazers, and suits are all good starting points. The colors, thickness of fabric, and level of accessorizing is up to individual taste as well as the event details (location, time, etc).

, Many people feel as if they need to go shopping but you most likely already have clothes that can work as semi-formal. Because these articles of clothing likely won’t be what you wear on a day to day basis, be sure to dig in the back of your closet or even go through boxes of old clothes, if you have them. What you find may surprise you!


If you are a girl, the phrase “semi-formal” is more flexibleso you can include nice button down shirts and skirts as possible options (particularly for a daytime event).
For boys, look for long sleeve button downs, nice pants, and suits.

, Once you have looked through your clothes, pick one main piece to base your outfit around. For boys this will be relatively simple as all you need are some conservative clothes in good condition. For girls, the main piece will generally be a dress or a fancy shirt and skirt.


For boys, a potential danger in dressing semi-formal is going overboard and looking too formal for the occasion.Avoid tuxedos and go for a matching suit instead.

, This step applies more to girl than boys, although boys can accessorize with a nice pair of socks or a watch if desired. For girls, semi-formal accessories can include dainty jewelry and a nice pair of stockings (with no runs in them!).


For girls, go for tasteful jewelry that isn’t too big or loud. Opt for small earrings or a simple chain necklace that complements rather than competes with your outfit., Shoes are crucial in bringing an outfit together so don’t forget to put some thought into which shoes you’ll wear for your semi-formal event. This is not the time for sneakers or sandals. Instead, both genders should wear closed toed shoes that are in good condition.


For boys, a nice pair of loafers or boat shoes should do the trick. If you don’t have any dress shoes, you can compensate with a pair of nondescript dark canvas shoes.
For girls, go for kitten heels or ballet flats. High heels are not only bad for your bodybut are often considered a bit too formal, especially for teens.

, This step applies more for girls than boys although boys should be sure to brush their hair and practice good hygiene. For girls, there are many options of different hairstyles and makeup but an upside of semi-formal events is that nothing too time consuming or dramatic is necessary.


For girls, makeup is not a requirement, especially if you don’t already wear makeup. However, if you do choose to do your makeup, less is more in this situation. A little mascara and lip gloss can go a long way. Avoid copious amounts of eye makeup and bright lipsticks as these can make you look more ready to go to a nightclub than a semi-formal event.
In terms of hairstyles for girls, go for a simple but elegant look. Pinning back a few strands with some nice hair clips or sweeping your hair into a classic bun area both great options.

, After you have completed your look, ask yourself a few questions to see if the outfit is appropriate. A semi-formal look should be tasteful and classy. Semi-formal outfits should be less dressy than what you would wear to prom, but more formal than what you would wear to school.


Some questions you could ask yourself are, “Would a parent approve?” and “Would you wear this to church?” If the answer is no, you may be wearing something too casual or revealing and may want to go back and try on another outfit.

, As a teen, you will likely start going to more semi-formal and formal events so it’s best to start figuring out some key articles of clothing that will help round out that part of your wardrobe. Most children are allowed to wear just about anything, but as you get older, having more than just casual clothing will be necessary for jobs, parties, and other important functions.


If you’re a boy, start looking into some clothing articles that you may not already have, such as ties, leather shoes, and nice belts. Ask an older male relative or friend for guidance. Your parents may also be willing to buy you some of these items.
If you are a girl, consider whether you have some of these basics: sensible, low heeled shoes, blazers, or cocktail dresses. A little black dress is also a great option that’s appropriate for many semi-formal events.

, There are many stores that sell semi-formal attire for relatively cheap, such as Gap and Forever21. Feel free to ask the store employees for help and some stores may even have specific sections for semi-formal attire.


Knowing what you’re missing from your wardrobe ahead of time will help you while you’re shopping as you’ll have a specific goal instead of wandering around aimlessly.
Always browse the sale section as you never know what you’ll find.

, These stores are often cheaper than malls and you can often find great, unique pieces at a low cost. Sometimes you can even find interesting items such as slacks and suspenders which are now worn less often but can really add a fashionable edge to your semi-formal wardrobe.


Just be sure to buy clothes that are still in good condition and aren’t worn out or misshapen.

Avoid forcing your cuteness.",How to Look Cute," Wearing cute clothes is the key to being cute. You don't have to change everything in your wardrobe to be cute -- instead, just work on acquiring a few cute items that tie all of your clothes together in a cute way. Here are some ways to wear cute clothes:


Wear skirts and dresses instead of pants or shorts when you can. Cardigans, knit sweaters and vests, boot-cut jeans, and t-shirts with cute patterns like hearts or polka-dots, are cute forms of clothing.
Don't wear anything that feels too tight or uncomfortable. Part of being cute is feeling comfortable in your own skin.
Wear light and positive colors. Wear pastels like purple, pink, or a shade of blue. Anything soft and pretty will make you look cute. Avoid dark colors like black, brown, or dark blue.
Try wearing something with a floral pattern. Floral patterns are the essence of cute.;
, Your shoes should complement your cute clothes, to complete the cute look from head to toe. Wear shoes that are stylish and trendy. Couple with brightly-colored or patterned socks or tights. Follow these shoe tips to make your feet look cute:


Wear clogs, moccasins, or close-toed shoes with a round toe.
Wear flat sandals and pair them with cute pastel-colored nail polish.
Wear furry boots.
Wear pastel or white-colored sneakers with pastel shoelaces.
Wear a classy wedge heel or kitten heels; they're both cute.

, Cute accessories can help ties your cute outfit together. You don't have to be weighted down by accessories -- just pick a few accessories that really make your outfit stand out. Here are a few accessories that will make you look incredibly cute:


Wear a cute chunky pink ring.
Wear subtle gold or silver necklaces.
Wear silver dangling earrings.
Wear bangles.
Use a small purse that hangs over your shoulder or that has a floral pattern.

, Wash your face and have good hygiene. To look cute, don't go too heavy on the makeup -- the right makeup will go a long way. Here's what you should wear:


Wear just a tiny bit of blush.
Wear soft pink lipstick or lip gloss.
Wear light eyeshadow in pastel shades like light blue, purple, or even light pink.
Just a light layer of mascara and eyeliner will do for the eyes.
Aim to look natural. You can wear a bit of makeup, but you'll only be cute if you look like yourself.

, Have your hair frame your face. Your hair should look soft and natural, and be free of any heavy styling products. Here are some things to try:


Let your hair dry naturally and fall to your shoulders.
Fix your hair in a cute, comfortable style. Some nice styles are, ponytails, braids, buns or even just down with a clip or a headband. Or, wear your hair in two loose pigtails that fall in front of your shoulders. Or, put your hair in a low messy bun, with a few strands hanging over your eyes.
Consider getting bangs if you don't have them. Bangs are cute.
Put colorful clips, baubles, or pastel-colored headbands in your hair.
Curl your hair in little ringlets.

, Wash your hair and body regularly, at least daily. Use nice-smelling shampoo and conditioner and body wash. Use scents like strawberry, vanilla, coconut, lemon, mint and lavender. They help relax the mind and you'll smell delicious!

, Your body language will tie your whole look together, and someone will be able to tell that you're cute just from the way you smile or the way you're sitting. Here are some ways to express cuteness through your body language:


Play with a strand of your hair.
Fiddle with your bracelet or necklace.
If you're sitting, keep your feet together and your hands in your lap.
If you're standing up, shift your weight from foot to foot.
Break eye contact from time to time. Though you should keep eye contact to maintain a conversation and show you care, you should look at the floor or at your hands once in a while to show that you're humble.
Cover your mouth when you laugh. This is cute. Cover it when you sneeze; this is polite and prevents spreading germs.
If you're a touchy-feely person, give the person you're talking to the occasional light touch on the shoulder or knee.

, This adds to the whole cute aura. Here's how to speak so as to appear cute:


Talk softly. This will make everything you say sound more important because people will have to lean in to hear you.
Laugh often. Laughing and giggling while you talk is cute. Don't overdo it.
Listen patiently and speak when it's your turn. Butting in before a person has finished speaking is not cute.

, Being humble or demure is a major part of being cute. You can be humble while being sweet, friendly, and bubbly at the same time. You can still be fun and social while being demure, as long as you're not loud or overbearing. Here's how to act demurely:


When you engage in conversation, act very innocent. Don't tell dirty jokes, engage in racy conversations, curse, or be vulgar.
Learn to blush from time to time. If you're genuinely embarrassed by a topic, it will be very cute if you blush.
Don't dominate. You can still be a part of a conversation without fighting to be the center of attention. Being pushy, rude, or bossy to be the star of every show is not cute.

, None of this should be forced. Let it come naturally. If you look happy and sincerely provide compliments to other people, they will think of you as nice and may classify you as ""cute"".

Dress well.,
Develop your style.,
Cleanse daily and be presentable at all times.,
Get a facial.,
Give yourself a manicure.,
Use make-up.,
Use perfume.,
Style your hair.,
Be confident.,
Have a good attitude.,
Be social.,
Display a nice smile often.",How to Look Beautiful in a Guy's Eyes," There is nothing more unsatisfying then seeing a chubby girl squeezed into a pair of too skinny pants and a shirt that shows belly. It just isn't attractive. Start by finding styles for your certain frame or shape. Every woman is beautiful, but every woman can also dress horribly wrong!;
, Whenever you wear a low-cut shirt, make sure it does not look trashy, as this may send the wrong message to guys. You can show off your collarbone, but going below the rib-bone is too much. Show off your personality in your clothes and accessories, this will give guys a clear look into how you are as a person.


Try a new look occasionally. Be sure it fits well, and that you like wearing it.

, If you feel good about yourself and your looks, that will often be a strong attraction. Try something refreshing, such as a lavender bubble bath or a body cleanser. Use deodorant.


Shave regularly, especially your legs and armpit hair.

, A facial will make your skin glow and stand out. You don't want your face to be full of pimples and dry skin.

, Fix up your nails with some strikingly colorful designs of your own creation. Guys like girls who take care of themselves, especially if they are a bit out of the ordinary.

, Don't go over the edge with make-up, guys can't take it! Try experimenting at home to get a good, natural look that enchants the best of your facial features. And think according to where you are going, and what time of the day it is. Darker make-up is used at night, and at clubs. Lighter make-up is used at day, and in the mall or at school/work. Also, find out what colors work best for you.


Try something new. Maybe start wearing red lipstick. Studies show that men are more drawn to women's lips than any other feature on their face.If your not in the mood for lipstick, try lip balm. Lip gloss works too.

, If he is drawn to you with a lovely scent, then he will actually start to see your inner beauty. Don't wear too much, though. Your crush doesn't want to smell you all the way across the room. Just when he's next to you.

, Curl your hair, braids, or maybe get it cut in a new way to make the most of your facial features. Keep your hair nice and clean. Trim your hair every now, to avoid having split ends.


Don't over style your hair. Heat damages your hair, so don't straighten it or curl it every day.

, Queen Latifah, for example. A stunning woman, and large. Have you seen her in the red carpet? She struts down that walkway with her head held high and back firmly straight. She's confident with her size, and so should you. Confidence and security are two things that men find sexy and attractive. A woman or teenager who isn't secure about herself tends to give off that same negative vibe. Basically, if you think you're ugly, guys will think that too. Hold your head high, strut your butt, thin or thick. You are your own person - love yourself and accept you, for who you are.


How do you feel about yourself inside? It all depends on you. Try to feel beautiful, and have self confidence.

, Be out-going, but serene. Keep your cool around guys you like, and be yourself. Don't be fake. Faking yourself attracts the wrong species of guy. Having a sense of humor is good too, but know when to be silent, and when to crack a joke.

, Some guys don't like you for looks, they like you if you talk. Don't be too shy, but don't be too talkative.

, Having a beautiful smile will attract a guy anytime. It also pulls your whole look together. It's nice showing your teeth once in a while.

Eliminate negative self-talk.,
Stay away from overly critical people.,
Spend time with people that make you feel good about yourself.",How to Feel More Attractive1," Do you find yourself being overly critical of every move you make? Replace critical thoughts with ones that reinforce a positive self-image. When you find yourself in the middle of a negative thought, stop the thought in its tracks. Don’t think, for example, that your legs are fat and unattractive. Say to yourself instead, “I appreciate my strong, muscular legs.”Try placing a quarter in a jar every time you think something negative about yourself, and use the money to buy yourself something positive, like a pedicure, new book, or haircut.
Write down negative self talk in a journal. Beside each negative thought write at least one positive thing about yourself.;
, If you want to feel more attractive, then you shouldn’t spend too much time with people who criticize others or themselves. For example, if your work colleague is constantly putting herself down or criticizing your appearance, try to find someone else to have lunch with. Eliminating sources of negativity can help boost your self-esteem., It is important to spend time with people who make you feel smart, attractive, and appreciated. Schedule time to hang out with friends, family members, or colleagues who make you feel good about yourself. If you feel happier and more attractive during or after hanging out with someone, try to make it a regular occurrence!"
"
Try a new hairstyle.,
Wear clothes that make you feel attractive.,
Focus on your best features.,
Dress to reflect your personality.",How to Feel More Attractive2," Taking an afternoon to visit the salon can help you feel confident and attractive. Take a risk and try a new cut, color, or styling technique. While at the salon, ask your stylist for tips on how to recreate the style at home. You will walk away feeling brighter and better than when you walked in., Instead of worrying about what others think you should be wearing, focus on outfits that make you feel good about yourself. Try to strike a balance between comfort and style. Go for clothes that make you think, “I look good in this!” Donate or sell clothing that doesn’t make you feel attractive., Everyone has good features, and focusing on yours can help build confidence and make you feel more attractive. If you have pretty eyes, for example, play them up with some tasteful eye makeup. When you’re feeling unattractive, remind yourself of how muscular your calves are or how sparkling your skin looks., Sporting an outfit that reflects your personality will help you feel more attractive than wearing something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Let your wardrobe speak to your style, desires, and even your hobbies. If you are artistic, for example, don’t shy away from pairing the bold scarf you purchased on your last trip to Paris with a more refined work-appropriate dress or suit."
"
Work on your posture.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Schedule time for yourself.",How to Feel More Attractive3," Having good posture can help you feel more attractive and boost your confidence levels. Be aware of your posture and correct it when necessary. For example, make sure you stand up straight. When you walk, keep your head up and your shoulders back.Imagine a string is holding up your body and align your spine along the imaginary string.
Make sure you sit up straight, whether you are watching television, surfing the web, or working.

, Regular exercise can help you feel more attractive, improve your mood, increase your energy levels, and boost your self-esteem. Try exercising at least 3-4 times each week. If you don’t currently exercise, start small. Try to get a 30-minute walk in twice a week, and then build up to a more regular exercise schedule., Loading up on healthy foods can help boost your self-esteem, promote weight loss, and improve your overall health. Make fruits and vegetables the stars of the show, and round out your meals with lean sources of protein like fish and poultry and whole grains.Load up on nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, salmon, and antioxidant-rich fruits like blueberries and cherries.
Avoid consuming too much sugar or too many processed foods.

, It’s easy to get caught up in everyone else’s schedules, and take little time to do the things that make you feel attractive. Make me time a priority and use some of this time to invest energy in your appearance and mental health. For example, try getting a massage, taking a long bath, or going out on a hike. No matter how you choose to spend your me time, make sure you’re doing something that is important to you."
"
Clean up so you can dress up.,
For hanging clothes, either put these two sets of clothes on two different racks, or use some sort of barrier or something that will divide the clothes and be seen easily.,
Look at the clothes you can wear to school and determine what you like about them and what you would like even better.,
Figure out what the most consistent/important thing about your style is, so you can find appropriate clothes that have that quality.,
Get the goods!,
Try em' on, then try em' out.",How to Look Cute and Modest at the Same Time," Go through your wardrobe and separate clothes that are school-appropriate from clothes that you could not wear to school. Separate absolutely everything that, by itself, would not be appropriate.;
, (You could even use different-colored hangers!)


For clothes in drawers, simply have piles for school on one side and piles for outside school on the other side, etc.






If your clothes are spread across your floor, make an attempt to find them all and either hang/fold them accordingly, or at least separate them into piles so that you will remember what is wearable.






Some important things you should remember in being school-appropriate are size, fit, coverage, condition, rips/torn seams/edges, implications, (up to date and at least faintly stylish) and possibility of disrespect, threatening, etc. By this time, you may feel the need to throw out some clothes that you can't wear anywhere/fit into anymore, or just really don't like! That will clear up some closet space for current and new clothes that you will like and will fit you. (You can also go through jewelry, shoes, makeup, etc. and clear some stuff out, about the same way) All that will make it impressively easy to work on your style!







, Pay special attention to clothes you are lacking (e.g. if winter is approaching and you need some scarves, gloves, sweaters, an/or turtlenecks, it is probably time to put those at the top of your 'to buy' list), so that you will have plenty of fashionable clothes for every season!

, If that would be chains and pointy things, consider an alternative, like a really cool (but slightly dark and secluded?) belt or design on your clothes that follows school/other guidelines. Confusing amounts of jewelry, layers, fluff, etc., see-through clothes, awkwardly inappropriate quotes, designs, or implications are a no-go too. Those also probably won't express your style as much as becoming reasons to put you in a small, dark corner (Just kidding!) or basically, limit other people's respect for you. So for example, if you like flowers look for fun floral patterns that don't all look the same size/outdated and look for some on shirts, or maybe sew some onto your pants! If you like bright colors, use layers to show off your colorful personality, or find ensembles that don't overwhelm (like lime green and blue for example!) but still show off several colors.

, Once you figure that out, many of you may want to go shopping, which is a good thing if you need to, esp. right before school starts! There are good buys and good-byes for every type of clothing.


Shorts:






Very cute with little beads, sequins, or other colorful designs on them, esp. on pockets. These can come with a cute belt too! Fringe, patches, and jewels can be cute too.






If you can't find any cute shorts that are long enough for school, even after checking a few stores, you can always look for Bermuda shorts (shorts that come about to the knee but not below) and now is a good time since those are well liked right now.






Go to the boys section and grab some shorts! Long, loose, and possessing plenty of pockets these are a dream come true, and when paired with a tighter (non-baggy) top can be quite cute!






If none of those work out, see Capris.






Skirts: Be very careful that you don't buy skirts that do one of the following:






Let anything show when you bend over, move a lot, etc.






Are higher than where the tip of your middle finger is when your shoulders are relaxed (this is important, but more of a guideline of you have really long arms).






Are really tight






Blow up when the wind blows, especially if you won't have a free hand to keep it down (if so, shorts of some sort should be worn underneath, or it should be/be made into a skirt.)






Provoke a lot of boys! Bad for school, no matter how much you love attention from them. However, there can be many cute shapes, lengths, and designs on these, like pastels or black and white, along with lots of different fabrics too! The possibilities are endless.






Are really plain, and are really long with a straight-lined bottom edge. Unless your parents make you, you don't need to dress like an Amish person!






Capris: Pretty much always cute, ties or other additions at the bottom are fun, and rolling is a good option.






Pants: skinny jeans are in, jeans in general are good, but stay away from the extreme mom jeans and go towards somewhat low-rise pants that don't get smaller at the bottom. Bell-bottoms that don't stick out a whole lot are especially nice. And these come with belts and other things too! (See shorts) make sure these go at least below your ankle, and longer is best with boots/high shoes.






Shirts: T-shirts with little phrases in the middle are fun, long is currently in, with a lot of 'tattoo-like' designs all over them. You can be that casual and still cute as long as the shirt isn't really tight OR really loose. Also, you can get very fancy with different types of layers, sleeves, bottom lines and necklines. T-shirts are hot on high, round necklines, and fancier shirts (that would be school appropriate) showcase the v-shaped neckline and include but are not limited to (not cut after purchase, but pre-cut and sewn) cut sleeves up the shoulder, three-quarter sleeves, button-ups, and more!






Hats: If allowed at school, brim caps, jockey caps, baseball caps, beanies/beanie caps, visor hats, newsboy caps, etc. are ‘hot’.






Shoes: There are a lot of shoes out there… so choose wisely. Go for comfort, good looks, and sensibility. Heels are good but pumps usually aren’t… sneakers are good but not if you draw on them too much… and flip-flops are cute in different styles, some sporty, some sparkly. Look for shoes that go with more than one outfit to keep on a shelf.







, Try different outfits on together to see what you can combine. If you have too many shirts, and two are similar but go with only one set of bottoms, take one out, and keep one if you like. Make sure every top has a bottom that matches, and vice versa. Once you found the clothes you like, check out a few accessories that go with more than one outfit. Then you are pretty much set!

Wash your face daily.,
Brighten and even out your skin tone with foundation or a tinted moisturizer.,
Give your cheeks a glow with some blush or bronzer.,
Get enough sleep.,
Use hydrating face masks weekly.",How to Look Attractive and Natural (Girls)1," Some people prefer washing once in the morning when they wake up, and once more before they go to bed. Wet your face with lukewarm water and apply your face wash with your fingertips. There are hundreds of face washes to choose from, targeting different skin issues like oil, acne, dryness, and more. Experiment to find a face wash that works best for your skin. Rinse your face with warm water and gently pat dry with a towel.If you have sensitive skin prone to drying, you might want to limit your face washing to once a day.
If you struggle with dry skin, apply a facial moisturizer after washing.;
, The goal, of course, is to make your skin look flawless while still looking very natural. Use only a tiny bit of product in areas prone to discoloration or blotchiness— typically around your mouth and nose. Put a bit on your fingertip, dot it in the desired area, and gently massage it into skin in a circular motion.The secret to applying makeup for a natural “no makeup” appearance is to use a very light, gentle hand and to blend thoroughly.

, When you choose a product, the key is to consider your natural skin tone. For example, people with darker complexions may be able to use bronzer to brighten their cheeks, while very fair people may want to opt for a lighter pink or peach blush. Work with the natural undertones of your skin. Think of the color your cheeks turn when you’re embarrassed and embrace it! Very lightly pat the product onto your cheeks and blend thoroughly.


If your skin is very rosy naturally, you may opt to skip this step. Instead, remove redness from the other parts of your face, using foundation or concealer, leaving the cheeks bare.

, You can always tell when someone has pulled an all-nighter, because they literally wear their fatigue on their face. When you aren’t getting enough sleep, the pH of your skin can go berserk. This, in turn, affects moisture levels, which can cause acne, redness, and dryness. Lack of sleep can also cause blood vessels to dilate, which is the culprit behind the dark circles you get under your eyes.Adults age 18 to 64 require 7 to 9 hours of sleep nightly, while teenagers 14 to 17 years old require 8 to 10 hours., With healthy, glowing skin, you might as well throw your makeup out! There is nothing as naturally attractive as a great complexion. A great face mask will hydrate dry skin, remove excess oil, and brighten your skin. You can find face masks that target all different skin concerns at your local pharmacy, or you can even make one at home. Apply it once or twice a week, and your skin will thank you.Ingredients like coconut oil, honey, oatmeal, banana, egg whites, and avocado can all benefit your skin. Look online to find endless recipes for DIY face masks."

Apply cold compresses to the eyes to reduce bags and dark circles.,
Use a lightening concealer to cover dark circles around the eyes.,
Curl your eyelashes and apply mascara to open up the eyes fully.",How to Look Attractive and Natural (Girls)2," These are not a good look. Grab a clean washcloth and run it under cold water. Press it to the delicate skin under your eye and hold it there. Do this for a couple of minutes, applying light pressure, to reduce the bags.If you are regularly waking up with bags under your eyes, make sure you are getting enough sleep.

, Look for a product that is light-reflective to really brighten up your skin. Just like with your foundation, the key is to use a small amount and to lightly blend it out with your fingertip or a small brush. Apply the concealer along the bottom of your eye, focusing on the inner and outer corners.After you’ve applied your under eye concealer, try lining your bottom waterline with white eyeliner to make your eyes appear even bigger and brighter., Carefully use the eyelash curler first. Position your eyelashes between the clamps of the curler, holding your curler as close to your lash line (and your eyelid) as possible without accidentally pinching any skin. Press and hold down for 10 seconds to achieve a beautiful curl.After your eyelashes are curled, it's time for mascara. Choose a color that doesn’t overpower your face. If you have dark hair, a black mascara will probably work best. Blondes and lighter brunettes should stick with a brown mascara. Keep your lashes from looking clumpy by making sure the product is evenly distributed along the mascara wand.Start at the base of your lashes and work the wand to the ends, gently wiggling it as you go. This will also help to avoid clumping, and keep your eyelashes from looking weighed down with product.
For the natural look you desire, one coat of mascara should do the trick.
If you have thick lashes, you can skip this step all together.

Whiten your smile.,
Moisturize your lips.,
Enhance your lip color with a tinted lip balm or a natural shade of lipstick.",How to Look Attractive and Natural (Girls)3," Nothing is more attractive than a big, pearly white smile. There are various techniques you can use to do this, so you can experiment to find one that works best for you. You can find whitening toothpastes, whitening gels, whitening trays, and whitening pens all at your local drugstore. These options require multiple uses to see effects. You can also have your teeth bleached professionally at the dentist’s office for more immediate results.

, People are often quick to wash, exfoliate, and moisturize their face, but completely neglect their lips! Exfoliate your lips to remove dead skin cells, using a lip exfoliator from a store or a paste of sugar and honey. You can use your fingertips or a clean toothbrush. After you’ve successfully removed dead skin from your lips, apply a lip balm to moisturize them. Plain old Vaseline works wonders as well., Tinted lip balm with give you just a little bit of color, while also keeping your pout moisturized. If you opt for a lipstick, make sure to choose a shade that is extremely close to your natural color. A trick to finding your natural shade is to find a lipstick the same color as the inside of your fingertip. Apply lipstick lightly, blending it in with your fingertips. Make sure to keep your lipstick or lip balm with you throughout the day for reapplication."

Keep your hair healthy by limiting your washes.,
Enhance natural waves with a curling iron, or smooth naturally straight hair with a flat iron.,
Add volume and shine with hair products.,
Leave your hair completely natural.",How to Look Attractive and Natural (Girls)4," Don't shampoo more than 2 or 3 times a week. Shampoo can strip your hair of its natural and essential oils, leaving it looking frazzled, dry, and lifeless. Instead of washing it daily, use a dry shampoo to keep it looking clean without the damage that shampoo can cause. This will also reduce your need for blow drying, another practice that can dry out and damage your tresses., Again, the trick is to enhance what you’ve been given by nature. If you have loose waves, use a curling iron or wand to just go over the waves and give them a little extra bounce. If you hair hangs straight, give it some added sleekness by running a flat iron through it. Not only do hot tools help to close the hair cuticle and reduce frizz, but it will make your style last longer throughout the day. Just make sure to spray a heat protecting product on your hair before using these tools., If you go to your local drugstore, you will find dozens upon dozens of products to choose from. If your hair seems flat and lifeless, try spritzing it with a volumizing or texturizing spray. If your hair is prone to frizz, smooth it out with a serum or shine spray. Whatever you are looking for, you’ll be able to find. These products will you keep your mane looking healthy and gorgeous, without looking like you spent all morning coating it with products., Hot tools and hair products can make your hair look great, but leaving your hair unstyled can help it grow healthy, thick, and strong. Don't forget to get routine trims to reduce split ends and keep it looking fresh and healthy. If you really want to embrace the natural look, rock it! Your hair will benefit from reduced heat damage and will never be weighed down with product. It will look effortless and, even better, it actually is effortless.

, Clothes are very fun to mix and match and do all sorts of things. First you need to go to the mall or a department store. Before you look at expensive stores go to a store like Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, Old Navy and any other store that has great sales. Always look what's on sale!

People who are incredibly negative about themselves (their looks, their personality, etc.) translate that negativity to other people. You have to figure out how to accept and release your negative thoughts.Pay attention to thought patterns. Notice the kinds of labels and thoughts you put on yourself. Do you, when something doesn't quite work out, think ""I'm worthless?"" Do you tell yourself that you're stupid, or you're fat, your undesirable? None of these things are true unless you make them true (except for being fat, but that doesn't have to be unattractive unless you make it so).
When you notice that you're having a negative thought, replace it with a positive or a neutral thought. In the beginning it might be easier to use neutral thoughts. So for example, if you think ""God, I'm ugly,"" stop yourself and say something like ""I'm having a thought that I'm ugly, but that isn't true. My body serves me wonderfully, keeps me healthy, and lets me do all kinds of awesome things.""
Avoid having negative people in your life as much as possible. Negative people, the ones who tell you that you need to look different, that you're too fat, or too hairy (and they're only telling you because their concerned about you), need to get out of your life. Their negativity is only going to feed your own and frankly, who needs that kind of constant stress?;
, People are drawn to confidence, because it's an incredibly attractive quality. It shows that you believe that you matter and that you deserve to take up space in this world. If you believe that's true then other people are going to, as well.


Avoid judging yourself as much as possible. This doesn't mean that you give yourself a free pass to be rude to people or mean, but it does mean that you stop micromanaging your every movement. For example: instead of saying ""I'm so stupid"" you might say something like ""I'm having a bit of trouble with directions.""
Avoid judging other people. What you say and think about other people correlates to how you think about yourself. Work on thinking positively or neutrally about other people.Don’t compare yourself to others. This is one of the useless things you can do, because someone is always going to be more attractive, more confident, etc. than you. You can constantly strive to be better than you are, but only in comparison with yourself.

, Good traits are just as attractive as physical appearance. It turns out that, while people do notice physical attractiveness first, they tend to rate people as more attractive if they have attractive qualities like kindness, real listening skills, and so on.Practice being kind. Do things for other people without expecting anything from them like helping your mom clean her house one day, or offering to drive your friend to the airport early in the morning.
Be respectful towards other people. You don't have to be a pushover to be respectful. It just means that you give people a fair hearing, you consider multiple points of view, and you don't jump to conclusions about people.
Really listen to other people. People are attracted to those who take an interest in them. When you're in conversation with someone, give them your whole attention. Make eye contact, avoid checking your phone, and ask pertinent questions.

, Being healthy (or as healthy as possible) is an important part of being attractive. Even if you have an illness of some sort you can still practice healthy habits.


Have a healthy diet. Go for lots of good fruits and vegetables (some top ones are blueberries, kale, red peppers), plenty of good carbohydrates (brown rice, sprouted grains, quinoa), protein (like salmon or eggs).
Get plenty of sleep. Not only does enough sleep help your physical appearance (skin, weight, and so on), it's important for your overall health. Try to get at least eight hours of sleep each night, with as many hours before midnight as possible. Turn off all electronics at least half an hour before bedtime.
Get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. Pick an exercise routine that you enjoy (you don't have to go to the gym). Go for a 30 minute walk each day, go for a run, practice yoga, pop in some music and dance for 30 minutes.

, Skin types usually fall into five categories: normal, oily, dry, sensitive, or a combination of these, also called ""combination.""


Oily skin typically appears greasy only a few hours after washing. Treat oily skin by washing both morning and night with a gentle cleanser. Stripping the skin of oil entirely only causes your body to produce more oil.Dry skin tends to be flaky. Treat dry skin by washing with warm, not hot water, and by moisturizing skin while it's still slightly wet. Dermatologists think that this helps lock the moisture in.Sensitive skin is often tight or itchy and tends to react allergically to certain chemicals. If you have sensitive skin, get products that have no fragrance or alcohol; always wear sunscreen when going out (SPF 30 or higher); and wash your face gently using your hands.Normal skin has the right balance of moisture, oil, and durability., Your face is probably the first thing people will notice about you, so you want to make sure that you're caring for it properly. Make sure that you're using a skincare regime that is simple; you can wind up over-treating your skin, making things worse.


Typically you want to wash your face twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to remove dirt and excess oils. If your skin is sensitive or dry, you may want to do it only once, or make sure you have cleansers and moisturizers that are made for your skin type.It's best to pick your cleanser based on your skin type, how often you wear make-up, and how often you tend to work out. So, as an example, if you have oily skin, you'd want to pick a cleanser that had a low pH level, because that would clean the oil on your skin more effectively.

, Exercise not only helps mental and physical health, but it can also help to improve your skin. It reduces stress, which can have a negative impact on your skin, and the increase in your blood flow leads to a healthy glow. Make sure that you're wearing sunscreen if you're going to be exercising outside during the peak sunlight hours., More than five portions of fruits and vegetables each day can help improve skin. What you eat has a big effect on your skin and how healthy and vibrant it looks. The more fruits and vegetables (especially fruits like blueberries, or veggies like leafy greens) the better your skin is going to look.Probiotics also help improve your skin, so eat plenty of sugar-free yogurt. Yogurt helps to regulate your digestive tract by providing millions of beneficial bacteria. The better your digestive tract is working, the fewer problems it's likely to have.

, People with whiter, healthier teeth tend to be rated as more attractive than people who have yellower and less healthy teeth. That may be because white teeth signals that you take care of yourself, an important quality in finding a potential mate.Make sure you're brushing your teeth at least twice a day. You also want to floss them at least once a day, a step which many neglect, but which is very important for maintaining dental health.
You can whiten your teeth safely and effectively using over-the-counter treatments, or you can have a professional whiten your teeth. This doesn't contribute to the health of your teeth, but it can look nice. Make sure that you are still getting your teeth checked out by a dentist at least once a year to check for cavities. If you have sensitive teeth, or inflamed gums, avoid whitening your teeth until after they've healed..

, Whether you're a guy or girl, and no matter what type of hair you have, healthy hair is the most attractive hair. You know your hair best, so you'll know how often you should wash it without drying it out or leaving it too oily. Make sure that you're only washing the scalp of your hair. Washing the ends dries them out.Fine hair tends to need washing about one a day to about once every three days. You'll have to experiment to see what works best for you. Shampooing every day might cause your hair to dry out more quickly and to start producing oil, so consider changing your shampoo or seeing how long your hair can support going without washing.
Greasy hair needs to be shampooed about every day. Additionally, it might help to change your shampoo, because that can often be the cause of greasy hair (even if it says it's specifically for greasy hair).
Curly or coarse hair needs less washing than the other types. At most, you should shampoo curly or coarse hair a couple times a week, three at most. More than that will dry your hair and scalp out and lead to more frizz.

, Girls tend to have more options than guys for hair, but this also means that guys tend to be able to get away with the same hairstyle. However, for both genders it's a great idea to try out different cuts and styles to see what works best for you.Hairstyles for men:


Straight hair of any thickness: short sides, fade down shorter onto nape of your neck and sideburns, at least an inch and a half on the top; wavy to curly hair: keep the sides at a medium length; top to side ratio should be 2:1 and blended; for fine straight hair, let it grow to your shoulders, top of collar.

Wavy or curly hair: grow out your hair until there's about two inches on the sides and three on the top, ask your barber to add some texture.Hairstyles for women:


Straight hair: side part with the rest of your hair down; or a pony-tail with volume at the crown with a little hair spray; or french braid on either side of your head that you secure in the back, while leaving the rest down.

Wavy hair: a messy updo with soft face-framing tendrils; or pull up the sides of your head and secure them in the back, letting the ends curl; or try an no-fuss low, side bun.

Curly hair: a short cut; or let it loose with a little product and a severe side-part to create volume on top; or gather a small section at the top of your hairline and pull back, leaving the sides and back down; or grab small sections of your hair and pin them up in the back.



, You want to get a few items that are individual and that you can build an outfit around. This is important for both men and women, because it helps draw out your individuality (which in turn demonstrates your confidence in yourself).


Jewelry, clothing, shoes can all be important pieces. For example, you might favor chunky, bulky jewelry so you tend to wear more neutral clothes to show it off, or you might favor waistcoats in fun colors and so you build your wardrobe around that.
Bags are also a great statement piece. You can easily switch them up, depending on the outfit you want to wear. They can be subtle, or exciting and they're also useful.

, Part of attracting people to you is being noticeable. You want to stand out from the crowd. To do this you should look for clothing that is unique, that other people don't have.


Consignment shops are fantastic places to get fun and cool clothing for cheaper. You can get designer clothes for less if you go to consignment shops located in the high-class part of town.
Antique stores and vintage shops are great places to locate vintage clothing (which happens to be very in right now). A lot of older clothes are very durable, so they tend to have a longer life-span than current clothes.
Artist bazaars often have clothes and accessories that are one-of-a-kind. By supporting your local artists you're making the statement that you are involved in your community, and you have unusual and interesting accessories and clothes. You can also find interesting and unusual clothes online from websites like Etsy and eBay. Make sure you're clear on what your clothing size is so that you don't get the wrong size.

, You want to wear clothing that you feel comfortable, confident, and attractive in. This means that you'll have to do some experimenting to figure out what works best for you.


Have your “uniform.” This is the few outfits that you base your style on. You can rotate through these, changing them up a little, and adding accessories and such to them. For example: you might favor jeans and a t-shirt as your ""uniform."" You can vary this up by wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt, or a nice button down over a t-shirt, or a sweater when it gets cold.
Using neutral bases to ground the more exciting and out-there pieces. Neutral bases are clothes that come in black, or grey, or natural colors like brown or cream. These help balance and ground your brighter and more colorful clothes.
Wear red. For both genders, red attracts. It signifies power and confidence. So wear that red dress, or red lipstick, that red scarf, or shirt and see who it attracts to you., One of the keys to looking good is having clothing that fits you properly. Too tight and you'll look uncomfortable, too loose and you'll look sloppy.


Even your jeans should fit you properly. They should conform to your body without squeezing too tightly, or sagging below your waist. If they're too long, make sure to hem them so that they don't drag on the ground.
If you're female, make sure that your bras are fitting you properly. You want support without feeling squeezed and without having the straps leave lines on your skin.

, People of both genders notice footwear, even if they don't realize they do. Wearing the right shoes can definitely attract people to you, especially if your footwear complements your outfit.


For women, flats are wonderfully versatile. They can dress up or dress down depending on what you need. They can be as attractive as high heels without the pain of walking in them.
Boots can class up an outfit and they can be perfect for autumn or winter. High heels can also class up an outfit, but you need to practice walking in them. There's nothing attractive about somebody tottering down the street.
For guys you want to make sure that your shoes fit you properly and go with your outfit (no brown with black, please). If you're going on a date, make sure that your shoes look good.

, Make-up can be a lot of fun and it can be an added benefit to your already lovely face. Using make-up correctly you can attract all kinds of people. Experiment to figure out what works for you.


If you're having a bad skin day, you can use make-up to cover up the blemishes. Make sure that the cover-up matches your skin tone, otherwise it will simply draw attention to what you're trying to hide!
Help contour your face how you want it. You can use bronzer to bring out your cheekbones and blush to contour your face and add length or width, depending on what you want. Apply your blush in a horizontal line to widen or across temples and jaw to lengthen it.

, Eyes are the ""window to the soul,"" right? Enhancing your eyes is a great way to draw people in. You can do a simple ""natural"" look, or try out the smokey eye (which is always in fashion and great paired with red lipstick).


For the smokey eye look, sweep nude eyeshadow over your entire eyelid. Apply a shimmering eyeshadow from base to brow of eyelid (whatever color you'd like). Like your top and bottom lash lines with dark eyeliner, in a brown or black shade. Use a Q-tip to smudge the liner. Sweep a darker eyeshadow over your eyelid and into the crease. Blend that color upward and outward. Place the highlighting tone (a lighter color) under your brow bone and in tear duct. Line your inner lash line with eyeliner to intensify the effect. Now use two or three coats of mascara on your lashes and curl them upward.
For the natural look add a little definition to your eyes with eyeliner, in a subtle and natural shade (like brown). Brush on a little light colored eyeshadow, such as champagne or light brown. Open up your lashes with a little mascara (a coat or two). Test out different mascaras until you find one that doesn't make your lashes all clumpy and goopy.

, Make-up should be a fun accessory, so get a little creative with it. Show your wild side. Cool, interesting make-up can attract people just as much as subtle, almost un-seeable make-up.


Go fifties with some cat’s eye make-up, or try out some other era's make-up techniques (a little ancient Egyptian, anyone?).
Go crazy with fun colors! Use bright colors to enhance your eye color and make it pop. For example, use a silvery or turquoise shade to bring out blue eyes; or dark emerald green to bring out the bring in hazel eyes.

, You can't expect people to look up to you and adore you if you don't love yourself. Treat yourself like a goddess and always give yourself the best. People may think you are self centered but if you want to be the It girl, that's got to happen.

, Make sure that you are unpredictable yet in a very subtle way. This will attract a lot of attention from everyone and make people want to know you better.

, This is absolutely crucial. You need to dress in a very stylish way - just like a model off vogue magazine or the Chanel runway. Try to wear as much designer brands as you can, such as Tod's, Tory Burch, Chloe, Max Mara, Michael Kors, DKNY, Max Azria, L.L.Bean, Ralph Lauren, Miss Me, True Religion and J Crew. Save the designers such as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci for when you're a little older, because this may lead to people thinking that your clothes are knock offs. If you can't afford these brands, try going to high end high street shops and find clothes that are reasonably priced but look very couture. If you still can't afford these brands, go to places that have nice clothing that is in style and your style. Go to places like Forever 21 and Zara.

, Tiffany and Co, Links of London, Wright and Teague, Pandora; anything that suits you! Remember, diamonds are a girls best friend! Try choosing finer jewelry rather than cheap $20 necklaces from Forever 21 or £10 necklaces from Topshop. As for bags, the best brands are Fendi, Ferragamo, Michael Kors, Yves Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton. However, try to be as subtle as possible. Ensure that you grow a fairly large Fine Jewelry Collection and get a nice display case for it to protect it from any damage. Keep away from *shudder* Cubic Zirconia!! If your not all for the big purses, get a purse that is still a good brand but down size them, get one that is smaller than the totes or the big fancy purses.

, For most days, wear it natural but if it's a special event, wear something very elaborate and stunning. Make sure you get the best make up brands such as Chanel, Bobbi Brown, MAC, YSL and Dior because, after all, the It Girl deserves the best of the best. If you are awful at doing make up, hire a professional make up artist instead. If you can't afford a professional, practice doing your make up and look up good tutorials on YouTube so you can get really good at it.

, Hang around everyone one and make plans with them. Make sure that everyone knows who your are and you know who everyone is. You don't need to start picking members for your clique just yet though...

, You can read them but that's as far as it goes -do not, DO NOT create a blog! Some sour people may make fun of you with this...

,, However, don't be too easy and throw yourself at them. Make them run after you, begging for a little more of you. Whatever happens, just make sure you are NOT the slut! Those are the kind of people you keep well away from.

, If you don't already, work harder! You have to feel good about your intellect. Just don't go overboard. Getting good grades is definitely key because people know you know your stuff, teachers and other students appreciate it when a student knows what she needs to know and more.

, It's ok to be a little rough at times! It puts people in their place! Do not let mean bullies make you feel bad.

, This must consist of 2-4 other girls, excluding yourself.

Make sure that all of the people in your clique are pretty, intelligent and are faithful and nice to one another. These are your ""best friends forever"" whom you rule the school together with.

, You need lots of skirts. Two essentials are a black pencil skirt and a white mini or pencil skirt. You can wear printed or bright colored jeans any day, as long as they're not normal blue jeans, but never ever wear track pants on a day other than Friday. You also shouldn't wear athletic shorts except for Fridays, Gym class, and sports.

Be comfortable (you don't want to be picking at your bra!),
Don't look too competitive.,
Have fun!,
If you are actively playing a sport its inevitable that you will sweat.,
Have self-esteem.,
Be subtle.,
Try very hard and stay focused.,
Show off your flexibility.,
Wear some very natural cosmetics.,
Be cute.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Be Sexy While Playing Sports (Girls)," so don't wear tight, tight bras and make sure you have comfortable underwear on. Make sure that you wear clothes that fit you right, are breathable, and that you feel confident and sexy in. You won't be able to look sexy, enjoy yourself, or even play well, if you don't feel good in what you are wearing. Avoid extremely tight shoes as well (they can make you run/walk weirdly) Sneakers are cool, and, strangely, appropriate for playing sports. Huh. Imagine that.;
, You can win and you can lose just try your hardest and be a good sport about it. Being clumsy and weak on purpose will not make you sexy it will just make you seem ditsy. Try your hardest and have fun! Smile! Look happy and mess up your hair a bit. If you have your hair in a ponytail/bun don't make it too tight (it looks a little weird). High ponytails are very attractive, feminine and youthful. A loose, high bun can look good. Hair clipped or tied up into a loose twist or bun looks cute too, as do a few errant strands from your bangs. Of course, it's always good to keep your hair out of the way for sports, but regardless...

, You will naturally attract people if you enjoy (and look like you're enjoying) what you're doing.

, So don't be too concerned about it. That will dash your confidence and that's not sexy. Besides, a little sweat can even be pretty sexy! You aren't going to be sexy if you reek though, so take some precautions like wearing deodorant, showering before a game and putting on a little perfume (not too much). It really works, because if you're not dirty, you will not smell as bad because there is less dirt. Light fruity scents are sometimes not so nice, and lighter maybe earthier scents are better. A light sprinkle of lavender baby powder, or honey/vanilla scented powder on shoes and the upper body such as tummy, and chest and neck is a good precaution. However, never break out a large spray bottle of Burberry London or Lolita Lempicka and bathe in it pre game. Spraying the air in front of you and waiting 10 seconds and then walking through it with a light perfume is best. If you have a light, fresh perfume, you can use one or two sprays directly on your skin. Experiment a little with it first, so you know how potent it is, both before and after you heat up during the game.

, if you feel frumpy, then it will show. if you feel gross and stinky, then that's what people will see you as. The thing is that it's all about attitude. If you think sexy, then it will all work out.

, Instead of wearing tight tops with teeny tennis skorts, wear a looser shirt that still shows off a little, or wear a tight top and looser bottoms. Take note: subtle sexiness is sexier than blunt sexiness.

, If you look determined and focused, you look like you don't have a care in the world and everyone is watching you. if you do your best, everyone will notice it afterward, and that you looked good doing it. If you don't like the sport and are not trying very hard people will not notice you as much. Even if it isn't your favorite sport or you're not very good at it, try. Guys like girls who try new things, give it their all, and don't give up.

, Many guys think that flexibility is sexy, if not just feminine. (This may be due to the stereotype that strength is masculine and flexibility is feminine.) During any break in the game, do a stretch that shows off your most flexible joints, apparently out of boredom or staying limber. If you're a gymnast, dancer, skater, or all-star cheerleader, you'll have lots of chances to show off your skills and flexibility. Don't bend over and touch your toes (this destroys ham-strings.), instead, playfully do a split or back walkover, or simply show off your hyper-extended elbows and knees and bend your fingers backward. Be playful overall... When you are off the field, cheer for your team and wander along the field playfully.

, Clear lip gloss and a red lip stain/ red lip balm is very pretty, and a light powder to even out your skin tone is also nice if you have some inconsistencies. Be careful with the powder, as it might end up coming off as you sweat, which is decidedly awkward. As a rule, wear minimal makeup. Curled eyelashes, some brown/clear mascara and a touch of lip gloss is natural and adds a very youthful and ""I'm naturally pretty"" look.

, Don't overdo it, but it depends on which sport you're playing. When you make a point or score, occasionally wink at him but after that don't look at him for a while. It will leave them drooling!

, Have some fun, be yourself and enjoy!

Don’t bare it all.,
Create balanced looks.,
Be creative with color.,
Define your waistline.,
Groom yourself.,
Maintain good posture.,
Mind your manners.,
Don’t create drama.,
Flirt with confidence.",How to Be Sexy but Classy," While it’s important to be confident in your body, leaving something to the imagination can go a long way. Showing only one section of your body at a time is sexy and classy.For example, if you want to highlight your chest, cover up your legs and midriff. Of if you’re proud of your belly, and want to show it off, wear an outfit that highlights your midriff, but doesn’t also expose your hips or chest.
This rule applies to both men and women, as too much chest or leg on either sex can kill the class.;
, This means putting together outfits that focus on one sexy area.For women, this could mean revealing your legs in a flirty mini skirt or a pair of shorts, and wearing a top that has longer sleeves or a blouse that isn’t cut too low. You can then pair this look with a fitted jacket and a loose coat.
A little black dress, with a statement necklace or a simple pair of earrings, is a timeless, classy look.
For men, a balanced look could mean wearing a collared shirt that is slightly unbuttoned at the top, with an undershirt and form fitting pants. Or, a pair of long shorts and a simple t-shirt.
Men should avoid exposing their chest hair as this is neither sexy nor classy.

, A great way to display confidence and sophistication is to come up with appealing color combinations in your outfits.Pick colors based on your skin tone. Jewel tones like purple and dark green look great on cool skin tones. Metallics and neon look great on warm skin tones. And bold, bright colors look great on neutral skin tones.

, Defining your waistline is a great way to show off your figure, without showing any skin.Women can do this with a thin belt over a dress or a top that tucks in at the waist. If you decide to wear a flowy top, pair it with a form fitting bottom like a skirt or a pair of black leggings.
Men can do this by tucking in their shirt into their jeans or pants and wearing a subtle leather belt.

, Nothing is more classy and sexy than someone who puts in the effort to maintain their appearance.Women should shave their legs if they’re going to be wearing skirts and shorts. As well, a manicure, whether done at home or at a nail salon, will show you care about your appearance and have good hygiene.
Men should keep their beards trimmed and clean looking. A nice spritz of cologne will add a touch of class to even the most casual outfit.

, Being sexy but classy is about more than just the clothes you wear. It’s about how you walk and present yourself to others. So avoid slouching or sitting down in a heap. This doesn’t present a very confident, classy demeanor. Focus on maintaining good posture so you can seem attractive and sophisticated.Do this by practicing good posture when you are seated. Keep your feet flat on the floor. Avoid crossing your legs. Keep your ankles in front of your knees. Roll your shoulders down and relax them. There should be a small gap between the back of your knees and the front of your seat.You should also practice good posture when you are standing. Stand straight and tall with your shoulders pulled back. Keep your legs shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Bear your weight mostly on the balls of your feet. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides and keep your head level with your shoulders., Displaying good manners shows others you have a sense of class. There are two types of manners, greeting manners and dining manners.Greeting manners are a way to show others how polite and considerate you can be. Do not talk during a movie or show. Say “excuse me” if you bump into someone and “bless you” if someone sneezes. Avoid interrupting someone when they are speaking.
During a conversation, it’s also good manners to introduce yourself to someone by name, and answer any questions with positivity and a smile. End the conversation by telling the person it was lovely to meet them, and if possible, say goodbye to them by name.
Dining manners are also sure signs of a class act. Always say “please”, “thank you”, “bless you”, and “excuse me”. Only start eating once the host as sat down at the table and keep your mouth closed when you chew. Keep your elbows off the table and don’t blow your nose or burp during dinner. Compliment the cook if you are a guest., This means not airing out your issues in public or creating a conflict with others. Avoid acting on impulse. Think before you act and focus on deflecting or discouraging drama between you and others.In the moment, try to downplay any drama and move on. This will show that you are able to handle any conflicts with grace. React later, in private, and discuss the issue directly with the person. Causing a scene will only lead to an an awkward situation. Show how classy you can be by leaving the drama at home.

, Don't be afraid project self confidence when you're flirting in person and over text.But don't be too forward or in your face. Try to strike a balance between friendly and easy going.Look the person in the eye, give them a smile, and say ""Hi"" or ""How's it going?""Start the conversation with a compliment, like ""Oh, I love your cologne"" or ""I really like your sunglasses.""
Once you find out their name in the conversation, use it often. It will make the other person feel acknowledged and singled out by you in a classy but sexy way.
Avoid talking too much about yourself. Show genuine interest in the other person and ask them follow up questions to keep the conversation going.
End the conversation with a bit of mystery. The saying, ""leave them wanting more"" rings true for flirting. Cut the chat short by saying ""This has been fun, but I have to head out."" Or, ""Sorry to cut this short, but look at the time. I have to be going.""
Always say ""goodbye"" or ""I hope to see you again soon"" so the conversation ends on a classy note.

Stay clean.,
Get social with guys.,
Wear nice clothes.,
Highlight your best features.,
Guys like attention.,
Smile at the guys who are nice to you.,
If you wear and like putting on makeup: moisturizer, concealer, foundation, blush, eyeshadow, mascara, and lip gloss/balm is all you need.,
Don't be mean or make fun of others.,
Have nice hair.,
Don't be rude, or play hard-to-get.,
Remember that all girls have a chance in their life to be attractive.",How to Be the Cute and Hot Teen (Girls)," Keep your face clean, shower or bathe daily, brush and floss your teeth twice daily, shave, and use deodorant. Remember to stay as hygienic as can be, because bad breath is a huge turn-off.;
, You have to talk and befriend them in order for them to really notice you. You can flirt or reflect what the guys at your school like. For example, if they like card games, play with them! If they like to work out at the gym, go with them and laugh a bit. Ask for their phone numbers once you get to know them and invite them over to create good relationships.

, It's no secret that stylish and cute clothes can get you far out into the girl world. Basically, you can wear whatever you like. Skinny jeans, belts, flowing tops, jean skirts, shorts, tanks, layering tops, flirty skirts, and hoodies are some ideas. Don't wear skanky clothes, though (everyone will just roll their eyes). Wear clothes within the dress code of your school. Some stores that sell great items for any girl's style include Forever 21, Abercrombie, Hollister, A'GACI, American Eagle and Target. Also, wear really cute shoes like cute boots, Uggs, T-strap sandals, canvas shoes, and flats.

, We all have something that is seen as ""attractive"". Try asking your friends what they think is your most attractive feature. You can use light makeup or bright clothes to help bring out what you've got. If you seem to know what you have, others will see too.

, Show them that you can be one of their friends! When you hang out with the guys, they might push you around a little. Let them do this. If they poke you, don't turn around and get all rude; just twitch a little and laugh a bit. This will make them comfortable around you and will make you look like a fun and harmless girl-friend.

, When a gorgeous girl flashes a smile, it totally melts guys' hearts. One positive glance can make a difference in how they think of you.

, Keep it natural. When choosing makeup, ask your friends what light colors look best on you. If you want to look even more put together, keep lip gloss in your bag at school. Put some on when you're in the bathroom, and you'll look fresh throughout the day.

, It's a real turn-off for guys. Guys feel most attracted to the loving, friendly, caring girls in comparison.

, Aim to get your hair cut every two months so you can keep your hair looking beautiful with no split ends. You should also use a good shampoo and conditioner (TresSemme, Herbal Essences, and Aussie have great inexpensive hair products) to keep your hair clean. If you want, use hairspray, straighten, curl, add waves, dye, or put highlights in your hair (just be sure not to go over the top). Put your hair up in a ponytail, a braid or bun when it's greasy, it'll look amazing.

, That's stupid. Also, don't act you're too good for everyone. All of these make you unattractive to guys.

, Some girls back in elementary school, some in middle/high school, and all after school (where you'll be in the real world). The best thing you can do, is to not be envious of others, accept yourself, and be yourself.

Emma, Cleo, and Bella all have great tans.,
For Emma's look:


You need long, straight hair with bangs past your chin.,
For Cleo's look:


Seasons 1 & 2: You need short, wavy hair with bangs for this look.,
For Rikki's look:


Short, wavy hair with bangs is what you need.,
For Bella's look:


Bella has very layered hair with possible overgrown bangs that reach a bit below her chin.",How to Dress Like the Girls from H20," Rikki has more of a pale complexion. Try sunbathing, self-tanning, applying bronzer, getting a spray tan at your salon, or use a tanning bed.;
, Emma also has quite thin hair. Using a hair straightener is recommended if you have curly or wavy hair. If growing long hair proves too hard, you can consider hair extensions. Emma's tresses are medium blonde so you may also dye it if you wish.
Wear clothes in shades of blue, white and yellow. Jean skirts and layered T-shirts are also a must.
Keep the jewelry minimal and do not overly accessorize.
As far as makeup, try some beige foundation and a little shimmer bronzer along the cheekbones, chin, temples, and bridge of the nose for Emma's glow. Highlighter should be applied underneath the eyes and brow bones. Sweep a little light-pink blush on the apples of the cheeks as well. Not much eye makeup is needed for this look, other than mascara and white eyeliner on your waterline to draw attention to the eyes.

, If you have straight hair, you can leave your hair in wet braids overnight, hairspray them and take them out in the morning to make them wavy. Cleo's hair is brown so try using an appropriate hair dye too.
This look is excessively girly so shades of pink, purple, magenta and peach are your colors. Go for short sweatshirts, collared shirts, elegant blouses and classic, feminine dresses.
A lot of accessories are required but make sure you don't overdo it. A scarf and a few bracelets are a safe option if you're unsure.
Apply a beige foundation and some illuminator to give you a sun-kissed complexion, like Cleo. Use some contour underneath the cheekbones for an illusion of depth, as Cleo has very pronounced cheekbones. Also contour along the sides of the nose for a slender nose. Apply white eyeliner on your waterline, and brown eyeliner along your lower lashline and in the outer corners of the eyes. A few coats of black mascara is also a must. Plump your lips some with some highlighter on the cupid's bow for an illusion of fuller lips and a nude lipstick.
Season 3: For Cleo's Season 3 look, she has long, straight, yet sometimes wavy hair. You can easily achieve her slightly wavy hair with some overnight heatless braids and scrunching your hair with any sea salt or texturizing spray. You'll also need layers that frame your face nicely, and have your hairdresser texturize and thin out your hair a bit if you want lots of layers like Cleo for dimension. Cleo also has a V-shaped cut that ends at a point in the back. Long layers are also key for this look, as Cleo's hair blends beautifully. Cleo also has a brunette hair and a few scattered blonde highlights. She parts her hair down the middle as well. If you don't want to grow out your hair, just opt for extensions.
Wear slightly girly apparel. Cleo isn't as girly in Season 3 as she was in the previous two seasons. Try some neutral colors mixed with a few feminine pieces.
Apply a beige foundation and some illuminator to give you a sun-kissed complexion, like Cleo. Use some contour underneath the cheekbones for an illusion of depth, as Cleo has very pronounced cheekbones. Also contour along the sides of the nose for a slender nose. Apply white eyeliner on your waterline, and brown eyeliner along your lower lashline and in the outer corners of the eyes. A few coats of black mascara is also a must. Plump your lips some with some highlighter on the cupid's bow for an illusion of fuller lips and a nude lipstick. Cleo's makeup look for all three seasons are the same.

, Dyeing it light blonde will also make the look more authentic. Making pigtails is a good option, as Rikki favors them.
Rikki's look is slightly punk so shades of red, black and tan should be primarily worn. Occasionally, you may also try blue or white. Skirts and dresses should be avoided at all costs.
Accessories must be limited to a watch or a woven bracelet. Think practical and grungy. For footwear, sneakers are your best bet.

, You can tell she has overgrown bangs when she wears her hair in a ponytail with a slight bump on top to add a little extra to the regular ponytail. Bring in a picture to your hairdresser to get the cut you're wanting. Bella's hair is golden blonde, with some brunette at the roots. Her hair is considered long. Bella also parts her hair down the middle. Her wavy hair is easy to achieve. After getting out of the shower, towel-dry your hair a bit so your hair isn't dripping wet. French braid hair in this way: Split your hair into two sections. Then split each section into two sections (split into two sections around the edge of your ear). French braid each of the four sections. Sleep on them. When you wake up, carefully undo the braids, flip your hair over, and use a sea salt or texturizing spray and scrunch for Bella's hair. You may choose to S-wave a few strands of hair that may have not turned out very well.
Bella wears colorful, cheery colors to match her personality. Colors such as white, green, blue, and yellow resemble Bella's color choices. She rarely wears girly colors such as pink, purple, or even red. Crop-tops, rompers, sundresses, strapless tops with detailing are great for Bella's look.
Bella doesn't accessorize much, except for a few bracelets.
Apply a beige foundation and some bronzer for a tan complexion. Bella has what is known as a ""baby face,"" meaning she has very plump features. Full lips, pronounced cheekbones, big eyes, and beautiful features. Contour underneath your cheekbones, apply a rosy blush on the apples of your cheeks, and highlighter underneath the eyes. White eyeliner on your waterline to bring out your eyes, neutral eyeshadow, and mascara is a must. Her full lips are her best feature. Shape your lips with a pink nude lipliner; go slightly over the border edge of the lip for the illusion of fuller lips. Fill in the lips with the lipliner and pat on some nude lipstick. Apply some highlighter along the cupid's bow. Finish off the lips with clear lipgloss in the center of the bottom lips.

, These shirts can either be short-sleeved or long-sleeved. For a more casual look, wear a t-shirt.


Roll the sleeves of your button-down at your elbows.

, These kinds of hats come in black, brown, tan, and white.


If you don't want to wear a hat, try a bandana that matches the color of their button-up shirt. Keep the tied part on the side of your head, and tie it like a bow.

, Traditionally, cowboy boots are made of leather, but are also available in faux-leather and exotic skins like alligator, snake, and buffalo. These boots also come in a variety of toe styles: round toe, square toe, or pointed toe.


If you plan on wearing your boots in muddy or wet conditions, consider getting a pair with rubber soles.

Think about wearing layers, not individual pieces.,
Aim for neutral colors.,
Get a few nice t-shirts.,
Invest in some jackets, sweaters, and overlayers.,
Try out some button-up shirts.",How to Dress Casual Chic1," Layering is a key tip in pulling off street-style. Carefully chosen basics are powerful fashion staples because you can combine them in many different ways. A nice t-shirt or tank top may not be much on its own, but throw on a nice blazer or cardigan and you'll be getting somewhere. Remember: casual chic is about being relaxed but still stylish, and layering allows you to feel comfortable but still mix and match unique styles.


1-2 nice, light jackets can allow you to wear your t-shirts out to many occasions and still look good.;
, Blacks, grays, whites, and tans are your friends here – they can be easily mixed and matched with other colors and accessories. Casual chic isn't so much about making an eye-popping statement as it is about looking relaxed and comfortable with your style. Using muted or neutral colors as your base opens you up for bigger splashes of color down the road.

, While you don't want to wear your old lacrosse warm-up shirt, a few nice graphic tees are essential to casual chic. Make sure they don't have any stains, that they fit you well, and that they haven't become discolored with age. Tees can be easily mixed and matched with other pieces, and the logos or designs can be tailored to fit your interests.

, Not only does this allow you to look casual chic all year, it gives you the chance to personalize and ""upgrade"" your tees and tanks quickly and easily.


A sweater, usually bigger or baggier is better.
A denim shirt/jacket
A flannel shirt
A form-fitting blazer in white or gray.
2-3 cardigans in various colors.

, Button ups are great because they look dressed-up, but can still be worn completely casually. Try to find one that fits your well and open up the top 1-2 buttons. You can leave it untucked with a nice pair of jeans and touch it up with an accessory or two for effortless casual chic.

"
"
Invest in a good, well-fitting pair of jeans.,
Find 2-3 skirts that you love.,
Think about leggings.,
Try out distressed pants.,
Wear shorts in nice weather.",How to Dress Casual Chic2," Jeans are at the top of the list when it comes to essential casual chic clothing. A good pair of jeans is comfortable and hugs your hips and backside, but searching for the perfect pair isn't always easy. Everyone is a different body shape, so when you're trying on jeans from different companies, you should consider trying on a pair a size up and a size down from the one you normally where.


Once you've got your pair of nice denim jeans, look into dark-wash or black jeans. You can use these to slightly ""dress up"" your casual chic.

, Pair them with leggings or simply wear them alone for a simple and comfortable look. As with tops, you should aim for mostly neutral colors, though a few popping patterns can be paired wonderfully with a neutral top and/or a nice baggy sweater.

, Both comfortable and versatile, leggings go great with a long, flowing shirt or even a shorter dress. Having the leggings not only makes the outfit more comfortable, it downplays some of the ""showy"" aspects of the dress to make it seem more casual.

, Light wear and tear will definitely get across the idea of casual, opening you up to wear a nice top to bring in the ""chic."" A lot of casual chic is about mixing and matching ""classy"" clothes with a more laid-back, comfortable piece, and distressed pants and shorts (like white/beige cutoffs) are a great place to start

, Jean shorts, cutoffs, and even the occasional pair of nice running shorts can all look good when the weather is getting toasty. Again, aim for pieces that are easy to mix and match: beige, white, tan, denim, and black all pair well with a variety of tops.

Aim to wear more flats.,
Make the outfit pop with 1-2 accessories.,
Get a little bling in your life.,
Care for your hair.,
Wear the right style of makeup.",How to Dress Casual Chic3," You can still wear heels for casual chic, but flats are a more comfortable option that can still boast a lot of style. Some shoes to try include:


A pair of black-heeled pumps.
A pair of beige ankle booties
A pair of strappy sandals in a color of your choice
A pair of brown leather or suede boots.
A pair of nice sneakers or Converse high-tops.

, Casual chic enables you to combine the most comfortable clothes from your wardrobe and do a little mix-and-match with accessories. The best accessories include simple everyday items such as sunglasses, hats, scarves, belts, and purses/bags/totes. Some suggestions include:


1-2 scarfs in semi neutrals, i.e. blue,burgundy.
A oversized black leather handbag
A cream envelope clutch
A pair of golden framed mirrored aviator sunglasses, or a pair of regular large black sunglasses.

, You can also take jewelry, even basic rings, bracelets, and necklaces, and use them to give subtle accents to your outfit. Casual chic doesn't need to look expensive, so don't worry about getting a $350 necklace to look good.

, The beauty of casual chic is that you don't have to put hours of work into a hairstyle. Take care of your hair with daily conditioner and regular washing – this should be enough. Try putting your hair in a sleek ponytail, half up, in a loose bun – or just leave it down. You can keep it straight, curly, or wavy, but make sure that it isn't frizzy.

, If you are going to look casual, your makeup needs to be casual as well. Use tinted moisturizer or light coverage foundation to make your skin look dewy/glowing. Apply light foundation, a little bit of powder (if you need it), bronzer, white shimmer (to put in the corner of your eyes and to highlight the brow bone), and a touch of mascara.


Again, you don't need to go overboard. Simply touch up your facial skin and elongate your eyelashes a bit to look casual but put-together.

Think about what makes you find clothing cute.,
Think about color.,
Don't neglect the shoes.,
Wear clothes that fit well.,
Find places to buy cute clothes.,
Don't neglect the possible free sources of clothing.",How to Develop a Cute Clothing Style As a Teen," This can range incredibly between different individuals. Write a list of the things that tickle your fancy. This might include:


Ruffles and lace
Short lengths
Long lengths
Round necks, V-necks, low necks, etc.
Short sleeves, long sleeves, 3/4 sleeves
Cute sayings on clothes
Animal/nature/plant/environmental motifs
Buttons/zips/tags/sequins/rhinestones/embroidered motifs, etc.
Rips and tears
A distinct style such as Harajuku, Emo, Goth, tomboy, etc.
Copying a book or movie character's clothing style;
, What colors do you consider to be cute? Pastels are often associated with ""cute"" because they are associated with small things such as babies, Japanese styles such as Hello Kitty, animals, etc. It is also possible for very bright colors to be ""cute"", especially when accompanied by patterns such as polka dots, zigzag stripes, etc.

, Shoes can be cute. Think ""Mary Jane's""; they were once the typical shoe worn by girls in well-to-do schools, and they crossed over into mainstream. These can be great ""cute"" shoes that go with everything from jeans to dresses. Other cute shoes include ballet slippers, jeweled sandals, dainty boots, and metallic colored shoes.

, If you want to be known as ""cute as a button"", your clothes should be well tailored and fit well. This means not squeezing into anything that is too tight for you and not wearing baggy, over sized garments that cover up the real you. Don't go by the size label; that's a really unhelpful way to dress. Instead, start learning how to assess an item of clothing by look and try it on. If it looks good on you, don't worry about the size on it; every brand sizes differently and some simply look better a size up or down. Only the uncaring have a wardrobe that has one size label on all clothes.

, While you can shop in the major clothing places (High Street, Main Street, department stores, outlet stores, etc.), this won't necessarily find you all the items that you want. It pays to look around and to be picky. You might find a pastel pink t-shirt in one store, a bubble skirt in another store, and a brilliant pair of ballet slippers in the thrift store. Be open to all possibilities:


Department stores
Outlet stores
Chain stores
Thrift stores
Local markets
Designer stores
Online auctions and shops
Yard sales/garage sales

, Check out your parents' closet, your siblings, drawers and your cousins' hand-me-downs. Swap with friends or hold clothes trading parties with friends and friends-of-friends. There are lots of great possibilities!

"
"
Clean out the clothes in your existing closet.,
Go shopping with a good friend you trust and whose style you like.,
Go to a shop with reasonable prices: while thrift stores are not necessary (but actually a very good source of extremely cheap yet stylish clothing), don't go to an expensive store where only two clothes can be purchased.

,
If name brands are important to you, it's okay to buy a pair of jeans or a sweater from an expensive store but it may not be a smart move to spend all your money in stores where you won't get as much bang for your buck.

,
Buy about two or three pairs of shorts, three pairs of jeans, two pairs of pants and two pairs of leggings.,
Buy good tops.,
Choose good shoes.,
Don't forget accessories.,
Organize everything in your closet.,
Organize one shelf, or part of it, for accessories.,
Fold towels into one rack.

",How to Create a Varied School Wardrobe (Teenage Girls)," What do you like? Which items do you definitely need? What will you hand down to younger children? If possible, sell the clothing you don't need for extra money for new clothes, but don't rely on it. Second-hand clothing is usually not worth a lot.;
, Be prepared to spend a lot. You will need on average about ten outfits and more will accumulate over time.

,,, These can be fit for any season. If you will be buying skirts, set aside extra money for this.

, Are your pants, jeans, shorts, etc. a special color? Are tops being sold with them? Look for tops you like, as jeans go with everything. For the skirts and pants, look for tops of matching color (not necessarily exactly the same color). Two or three sweaters will be needed for cold weather (unless you live in the south). Generally, one formal top, three shirts, three t-shirts, and perhaps some loose dress tops would do. Dress tops can be worn on jeans or leggings. This provides a lot of variation.

, Do you want sandals, or sneakers? Generally, one pair of sandals, one pair of sneakers, and one pair of formal shoes/boots will do. Snow boots are not an absolute must in all snowy circumstances.

, They're a cheap and easy way to vary your outfits. These include rubber bands, hair bands, small purses and jewelry. Buy two to three pairs of earrings and necklaces. One small set of rubber bands should suffice. Hair bands can also be made out of spare pieces of material (your Mum can help you with that).

, Fold clothing into categories: one pile for shorts/short skirts, one for skirts, one pile for t-shirts and shirts, one for dress shirts, one for pants, one pile for jeans and another for leggings. It will help to stay organized. If you take off any piece of clothing, fold it and put it into its right pile unless it needs to be laundered.

, Lay out lip gloss, rubber bands, mascara, jewelry, etc. here where you can find it. Put this into plain visibility, and if there are gaps in your closet shelf, place a strong piece of cardboard over it.

Find a secure area.,
Take off your shoes and socks.,
Wrap a towel around your waist.,
Remove your underwear.,
Remove your bra.",How to Change Into Your Bathing Suit if You Aren't in a Stall (Girls)1," Find a car, tree, or bush to conceal at least half of your body while you change into your bathing suit. Change on the side of the car, tree, or bush that is facing away from the beach or the public area.


You can also ask a friend to hold up their towel while you change into your bathing suit. Have them hold their towel horizontally and as close to you as possible. This way their towel will be similar to a stall wall.;
, First take off your shoes and socks. This way you can avoid getting your underwear or bathing suit bottoms caught on your shoes.

, While you are standing up, begin to wrap the towel around your waist. Fasten the towel around your waist by tucking the top outermost corner in between your skin and the towel. You should wrap the towel tightly around your waist, but not so tight that it makes it hard to maneuver.If you have a hair clip, you can also clip your towel instead of tucking it.


For best results, you should use an adult sized towel where your whole body is able to fit inside the area of the towel, including your feet., While the towel is wrapped around your waist, first remove your pants, shorts, or skirt. Then reach under the towel, pull down your underwear, and step out of it.


If you are wearing a dress, simply wrap the towel around your waist, and pull the dress up over the towel. Then remove your underwear.

, If you are wearing a bra, reach under your shirt and unhook your bra in the back. Then pull your arms out of your shirtsleeves and slip your bra off your shoulders. Put your arms back through your shirtsleeves so you can complete the rest of the process.

Make sure the towel around your waist is secure and covering you while you do this. Then, gingerly, pull your bathing suit bottoms up to your waist.

, Again, pull your arms through your shirtsleeves. Secure the bathing suit underneath your shirt as you normally would. For example, if your suit top clips, then clip it underneath your shirt first, and pull it up. If it ties, then tie the strings around your torso first. Then twist the tied strings around toward your back so the front of the bathing suit is on your torso, and pull up. Pull your arms back through your shirtsleeves and finish securing the bathing suit top, i.e., tie the strings around your neck, or make any adjustments before taking off your shirt.


Alternatively, you can put your bathing suit top on over your shirt. Secure your top as you normally would over your shirt. Then pull your arms through your shirtsleeves and carefully take off your shirt so that your bathing suit top does not move and expose you.

, While your shirt is still on and the towel is around your waist, adjust the bathing suit to make sure all the pieces are in the correct position. Once everything is positioned correctly, you can remove the towel around your waist and take off your shirt.

, Underneath your towel, your one-piece should be bunched up at your waist. From underneath the towel, pull the top part of the suit up your torso to the bottom of your bust.

, Pull your arms through your shirtsleeves. One at a time, slip your arms through the bathing suit straps and pull them over your shoulders. Then put your arms back through your shirtsleeves.

, While your shirt is still on and the towel is around your waist, adjust your one-piece to make sure the parts are in the correct position. Once everything is positioned correctly, remove your towel from around your waist and take off your shirt.

Buy a denim jacket.,
Wear nautical pieces.",How to Dress Like a Popular Person1," Staying ahead of the curve is very important when trying to dress like a popular person. Every season, trends change and new styles come into the spotlight. Stay current by looking through fashion magazines and watching style shows on TV.;
, Bottoms featuring high rise waists are very popular right now. Find a pair of high waist shorts that you love. They will be the staple for multiple summer outfits for you. Pair them with a loose crop top or flowy tee-shirt and wedges to make your legs appear longer., Summer nights chill down must faster than expected. Having a cool denim jacket with your is a great way to look like a popular kid. Stick with a basic jacket—over the top embellishments or distressed looks will draw attention to you, but not necessarily in the way you want it to., Nautical looks are big every summer. Sailor stripes, cutout tops, and easy, flowing dresses are great basic pieces to create this nautical feel. Navy blue and white help create this look and you can top it with a fun sun hat."
"
Layer correctly.,
Buy some good looking boots.,
Purchase texting-friendly gloves.",How to Dress Like a Popular Person2," Dressing like a popular person involves wearing the right layers. Especially during winter, you need to wear layers that are all good quality. If you end up in a room with the heat set too high, you don’t want to take off your layers to reveal an old, dated, ripped tank top. Make sure you layer with up-to-date pieces so that you’re ready for any temperature.

, UGG boots have been popular for years. They are a casual way to dress like a popular person. If you’re looking to dress less casually, invest in some great leather boots. Black is always a great bet for a staple piece. You can wear them with dresses, skirts, tights, or jeans., Gloves aren’t typically a piece of clothing that we spend a lot of time thinking about. However, they are a very functional and an incredibly necessary piece of clothing that you need if you live in the north. When dressing like a popular person, you need to act like a popular person. This likely means you’ll spend a lot of time texting and on social media. Therefore, you should invest in some of these gloves to keep you updated."
"
Show your personality.,
Make it a conversational piece.,
Wear a smile.",How to Dress Like a Popular Person3," Having these staples is great, but in order to stand out and really look like a popular person, you need to add something extra to your outfits. Throwing in a pop of unexpected color or adding a great purse to your outfit are an easy way to do this. Get ideas of how to personalize your outfits by looking around at the popular kids and seeing how they do it, and then make it your own., When putting your personality into your outfit, try to do so with a piece that people can ask you about. An interesting piece of jewelry, or a fun scarf are good conversational pieces. Anything that will create questions from people will work. Be prepared to have a conversation about it; don’t simply thank them and move on. Act as approachable as you look.

, Being popular means you have friends. The easiest way to do that—regardless of the clothes you’re wearing—is by wearing a big smile. This makes people feel comfortable around you and makes them want to be your friend.

Flaunt your new style.",How to Become a Fashionable Teenager," True, you probably won't be able to buy that fabulous Marc Jacob dress, but it helps to have some inspiration.;
, If you want something targeted for your age group, try Teen Vogue or Seventeen. Again, these are awesome sources for inspiration (and fashion gossip!).

, This works can be used in place of magazine subscriptions, or as another source of information. Blogs have many different purposes - Style Bubble is a popular ""everything"" blog, and blogs like Streetpeeper focus on street style. Some more blogs are: Cheap chica (low budget), The Coveteur (like closet tours).

, You don't need to shop at stores like Abercrombie and Hollister to be fashionable (actually, these stores are often frowned upon in the fashion industry.) In fact, you'll have better luck at thrift stores! This decade in fashion takes vintage and adds a twist to it. Try places like Goodwill or Salvation Army for excellent vintage clothing/re-wearable clothing. If you don't want to shop vintage try department stores like Macy's or Nordstrom. They have a wide selection of clothing, so you are bound to find what you are looking for. Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters are more ""mainstream"", but you can still find some great things!

, Don't try to match things. The fashion industry is not about matching. Look at silhouettes from designs you like and emulate them. Or even better, create your own designs! This way, people will notice what you're wearing, and it will become a trend.

Maintain your health as best you can.,
Build your confidence.,

Educate yourself about perceptions of what is pretty.",How to Be Pretty," Helping your skin look healthy and radiant can boost your confidence, which makes you feel pretty. If you suffer from severe acne - especially if it is hereditary - see a dermatologist. If you have sensitive skin, eczema, dermatitis or any other skin problems, it doesn't have to stop you from being pretty. Talk to your doctor or nurse and look after your skin the way they advise. There are many ways to care for your skin:Twice a day, use a simple face wash to remove oils, sweat, dirt, makeup, and other impurities. Use one that will help your skin type (ex: oily, dry, sensitive, etc.). It should clear away grime without stripping your skin of the healthy oils that are naturally present. You can cleanse and tone if you like. Try cleansing lotion, finding cleansers and any other product you enjoy using. Use a moisturizer suitable for your skin, preferably one that has a Sun Protection Factor or SPF. This will protect your skin against the sun's harmful rays, as well as help to prevent skin cancer.

Moisturize your body, particularly your hands. This will prevent your skin from becoming dried out, especially during the drier times of the year. It will also help it appear radiant and healthy.;
, Brushing your teeth twice a day will contribute positively to your appearance and general health.


Avoid immediately brushing your teeth after a meal. Wait at least ten minutes before doing so. Frequent brushing can damage your tooth enamel, apparently, which can result in pain during eating.

Keep your breath fresh. Although mouthwash lasts for a short period of time, it will help your breath smell better. However, be careful about the brand you purchase, as some allegedly contain carcinogens (ex: Listerine). A safer way to maintain good breath is to brush your tongue.

Use dental floss. Clean the areas of your teeth that the toothbrush cannot reach. Floss between your teeth and at the gumline. This discourages plaque from building up in your teeth, and it also keeps your breath fresh.
Use teeth whitening strips sparingly, as the chemicals are detrimental to your mouth.
Avoid cavities and tooth decay. Sugary and acidic foods can damage your teeth. Whilst a couple of fillings shouldn't stop you feeling pretty, a mouth full of rotten teeth is hard to be confident about.
Get professional dental check-ups regularly.

, Keep your hair healthy, it should appear shiny and soft. When people look at you, your hair may be one of the first aspects that their eyes focus on. Short, long, straight, curly, natural, waved, plaited etc. - it doesn't matter. Nearly everyone has the occasional bad hair day. Your hair should make pretty your way. Don't neglect it, but don't spend any more time doing your hair than you like to.


Wash your hair as often as needed. There are types of hair that require different treatments.

For curly hair, wash it every three or four days. Daily shampooing will apparently damage your curls.
For oily hair, less frequent washes are recommended, as they strip the natural oils from your hair.


Change your hair. If you prefer to make minor changes to your pretty hair, there are different methods available:

Use products after showering to change the shape of your natural hair. An example is a leave-in conditioner.
Style your hair with heat. Before doing so, apply a heat protectant to avoid damaging your hair.
For more volume, spritz your hair with dry shampoo before combing it down.


Take as many trips to the salon as you like! Haircuts and coloring should be done by a professional for the best results, especially if you have wild hair. Choose cuts and colors that complement your skin tone and facial shape.

Receive free advice. During your time in the salon, ask professionals for tips on the best hair products (ex: shampoo and conditioner).
Trim your hair every six to eight weeks. Since this task may not require a professional, you can do this at home. You could also ask a family member or friend for help.


Wear a hat, beanie, fancy clips, shiny rubber bands or even simple bobby pins. As long you think it is pretty on you. Do remember, not to use hijabs, niqabs, or any other religious, traditional or cultural elements purely as a fashion statement. Using religion for fashion is wrong and offensive. As an ending note on your beautiful hair, hair doesn't define pretty. Your heart does!

, Makeup can be used to enhance pretty features and hide anything you feel less pretty about. If you feel pretty covering your face in makeup completely, it's okay to do that, but, most people think it's pretty when you show your features off to their best advantage. Makeup is not necessary to be pretty, experiment with it to highlight your best features. You can also learn to make natural makeup at home, using video tutorials from YouTube.


Apply a natural look.

Eyeliner is one of the best options for a natural look, as it adds definition to your eyes. For a neutral look, choose a natural, subtle shade, such as brown or a color close to your skin tone. For a bolder look, add a thin line of black eyeliner.
Eyeshadow can brighten your eyes. Apply a light and natural shade. Champagne or brown colors are the best for a natural appearance.
Mascara opens your eyes, as well as adding emphasis to your lashes.

Clear lip gloss enhances your lips without dragging it down with bold colors.


Use a bronzer. Contour your face from the temples, to under the cheekbones, and to the chin (think of the number three when applying). This can appear to slim your face down and be flattering. If you have a wide forehead or a large nose, run the brush down the center of your face to diminish the size. To avoid appearing fake, refrain from applying too much bronzer.

Use blush. There are many places to use this upon, from the apples of your cheeks to your cheekbones. Blush can help widen (apply in a horizontal line) or lengthen (apply also to temples and jaw) your face.
Highlight. There are many types of makeup you can use to draw attention to (ex: white eyeshadow or light powder) certain parts of your face. Some places include the forehead, cupid's bow, brow bones, and cheekbones. You can also put some on your eyes or nose if you think they're cute.

, The clothes you wear should boost your confidence, as well as complement your body type and skin tone. Avoid following fashion trends that you dislike, as they fade quickly. Instead, opt for a unique style that will show people who you truly are.


Wearing correctly fitting clothes. By wearing the right clothes that fit you in the right places, you will feel more confident about your appearance. You can wear loose, flowing garments or tailored, fitted ones, both are pretty. If you like your trousers on the long side, that's fine, and if you prefer a shorter dress, that's good too. Just make sure you wear things that fit the way you want them to. It's hard to look pretty when your trousers are digging into your waist or your bra is leaving indentations on your skin.
Focus on the basics for your wardrobe. You shouldn't spend a fortune on a pretty party dress or outfit you'll rarely get to wear. Make sure the things you have to wear day to day make you feel as pretty as possible. Lots of people feel pretty letting their appearance be the focus, not their clothes. If you have pretty red, black or striking platinum blonde hair, you might feel pretty in neutral colours like white, tan and beige. If you feel pretty in pink flowered dresses, wear those and really make a statement. Whatever you wear, you cannot be sure everyone will think you like pretty so be sure you think you're pretty in what you wear.

, Unclean clothes and dirty bodies can smell unpleasant. If you want to smell sweet, be clean. You can embrace your natural odour if you think it's pretty, or, choose your favorite scents to help boost your confidence. Scented body lotions are an option, body sprays, scented soaps, perfumes, scented oils, the choices are great. Find something you like the smell of and use it if it makes you feel pretty. Some women like refreshing smells while others prefer fruity or floral ones. Despite your preferences, be sure to keep them to a minimum to avoid overwhelming people with the smell.


Include a subtle hint of the scent. Spritz your wrist, elbows, and neck. Avoid rubbing your wrists together, as this can change the smell of some scented products.
Do not spray scented products on your hair brush then brush your hair, this can apparently damage your hair.

, Whether you're in peak physical condition or have an illness or condition, you can look after your body. Being healthy as possible is a great way to be pretty and help your body at the same time. A lot of it has to do with confidence and with healthiness both in your body and in your mind. It's easier to be confident when you're high on endorphins from exercise and when your mind is in a good place from getting enough sleep.



Exercise. Get out for a run, take a walk, swim, do chair aerobics. Find a way to exercise your body that suits you. Take dance lessons if you like, ballet is especially good because it works all the muscles in the body, especially the abdominal muscles. Ballet won't make you pretty by itself of course and isn't prettier than soccer, tap dancing, tennis or any other activity. There are tons of different ways to exercise that are fun! Exercise releases chemicals that enhance your mood and make your body healthier, which in turn will make you more confident about yourself and pretty.Drink water. Staying hydrated helps keep your skin radiant and clear, it can help with weight-loss and exercise and will make your brain feel brighter and happier. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day. If you don't like how bland water is, squeeze a little lemon or lime into it, to make it more interesting.
Get enough sleep. When you don't get enough sleep it shows not only in the bags under your eyes, but also makes your skin worse and your overall physical (and mental) health worse. For adults 8 hours of sleep each night is average; teens need a bit more sleep. Don't stay up too late at night. When you feel your body starting to get tired, go to bed. Practice good sleep hygiene habits.

Eat a healthy balanced diet suitable for you. Eating properly can help keep your body healthy, but it can also make sure that your skin stays healthy. For a healthy diet you should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables (at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day). Try eating foods with essential fatty acids in them like salmon, walnuts, and flax seed, nuts as well almonds, cashew nuts and whole foods that are hard to chew on, as well as low-fat dairy products, which have vitamin A and acidophilus. Avoid junk food and highly processed foods., Being pretty often has more to do with how you present yourself and less to do with what you look like. Of course, it can help boost your confidence in yourself if you like what you see in the mirror, but remember to look at yourself on the inside, too.


Have good posture. Sitting or standing straight will make you look more confident; slouching looks blah... like you don't care.
Don't judge yourself. In so many cases, you act as your own worst enemy, saying things to yourself that you would never say to anyone else. Building your confidence means being okay with who you are and not trying to make yourself perfect (either in looks or actions).
Don't judge others. The things you think about other people reflect on how you think about yourself and what kind of person you are. When you find yourself engaging in negative thoughts and words towards other people, turn it around so that you find something positive about them instead (maybe you don't like what someone's wearing, instead of saying ""Wow, she looks hideous"" think something like ""Wow, she's so confident in herself).Don't compare yourself to other people. This is the most futile exercise you can possibly do because there is always going to be someone who is smarter, prettier, and more talented than you. This will only cause you to feel worse about yourself.
Fake it until you make it. Faking confidence tricks your brain into actually thinking you're confident, so the more you practice being confident, the more confident you'll feel. Start small (like wearing bright red lipstick, or higher heels) and, as you get more confident, incorporate bigger acts of confidence.
Practice confident body language. Even standing in a power pose for 5 minutes every day can help make you more confident. Stand up straight when you walk, or sit and take up space. Don't cross your arms across your chest (typically a defensive gesture)., There's nothing like a good photo to help boost your self-esteem and make you feel better about yourself. You can use this photo when you're feeling down on your looks to remind you that yes, you are attractive and awesome.


Selfies are great because you are in control of the image and how you are presented. Taking a selfie can be a great confidence booster.

, Show others you think you are pretty. Attractiveness doesn't just come from how you look, it comes from how you act and how other people perceive you. It's confidence, certainly, but it's also kindness, being a good listener, and being respectful to other people.


While people are often initially attracted to outwards appearances (how physically pretty you are) they stick around based on your inward prettiness. Studies have found that people often re-evaluate someone's attractiveness based on good personality traits.Do nice and helpful things for people without expecting anything in return. Drive a friend to the doctor, look after your sister's baby for free, bring cookies to your teacher after a difficult week. You'll show that you are a good person inside and you'll make people think well of you, which will increase your attractiveness.
However, don't forget to take time off for yourself. You don't have to live your life for everyone else. Pamper yourself, too, or take some time to just watch a movie.

, Don't turn compliments into a joke when someone offers you one. Remember, you are as awesome and as attractive as people say and you deserve to have compliments. Accepting a compliment does not mean that you are arrogant or ""stuck-up.""


For example: if someone says ""Wow, your hair is looking really gorgeous today"" instead of saying something like ""No it's not! I'm having a really bad hair day"" (because even if you think so, no one else does) say ""Thank you. I really appreciate that.""
Of course, you are under no obligation to accept a compliment that makes you uncomfortable. It's your right to decide where the line is and when it's being crossed.

, Thinking negatively will take away your confidence and make you feel and look less pretty (it really is all about confidence). For instance, if you start thinking you're ugly, your brain will begin to accept that as true, even when it isn't. Fortunately, stopping yourself from thinking negatively is something that you can do and that you have total control over.


Learn to label negative thoughts. For example, if you think ""My face is hideous"" stop and say to yourself ""I'm having a thought that my face is hideous."" Don't beat yourself up over the thought, just acknowledge it.
Once you've acknowledged the thought, you have to let it go. Your thoughts don't define you and they certainly aren't you. They are simply patterns that your brain has fallen into.
When you've let go of that negative thought, replace it with a positive one. Instead of thinking ""My face is hideous,"" think ""I have really pretty eyes"" or ""my eyebrows are awesome"" or you could even take it a step farther and tell yourself ""I am not defined by my physical appearance.""

, The most important thing you need to remember is beauty standards (what is ""pretty"" for example) are completely subjective and depend on what society views as attractive. This means that beauty is constantly changing and that girls are being forced to live up to beauty standards that are basically impossible.


If you're comparing yourself to models in magazines or actresses in movies and on TV, then stop! Those women who look ""perfect"" don't actually look like that in real life. Remember they have tons of hair stylists, wardrobe artists, make-up artists, special lighting and, of course, PhotoShop.Remember also that you are in no way obligated to live up to other people's perceptions of prettiness. In the end, only you get to decide what is pretty for you.

How can you improve your hygiene?",How to Completely Change Your Look for School," If you have been to this school for many years, it will be more difficult to change your style, because everybody knows that you don't dress well or they didn't even notice you. It will be harder, but the kids at your school will be so shocked they will say: ""Who's that new girl?"";
, You can donate them to charity or you can sell them at a market or yard sale! Don't worry if you have too little clothes unless you cannot afford to replace them. Talk to your mother explaining that those clothes don't fit you anymore, that the school begins in a few weeks and you want a new style. She'll understand and may give you some money.

, Look in fashion magazines to look for trends or ideas on how to wear something. Look around your school and notice what others wear, and how you'd feel about wearing them. Go online and look up makeup tutorials, etc.

, Don't buy two t-shirts that look alike or remind you of the other; choose items unique from one another (maybe one hoodie in a pattern and one plain?) and try to focus on a single style. Diversity is good, but not if you show up one day dressed in one style, and the next in some completely different style. Try to find a single style that matches your personality.

Wear thicker fabrics, if possible.,
Avoid wearing thongs with short skirts.",How to Buy and Wear Thong Underwear Without Your Parents Knowing," You aren’t limited to the mall. Department stores and discount stores all have thongs in their underwear sections. Pick a location that is convenient for you and where you are least likely to run into people you know or people who know your parents.;
, Some thongs have more coverage than others. Do you want lace? Do you want a g-string style or a fuller coverage style? Deciding beforehand will help you when you go shopping because there are numerous thong styles to choose from., Don't use a debit card or a check, which creates a paper trail of your purchases. Paying for your underwear in cash keeps it under your parents' radar. Be sure to throw away your receipt before you get home so you don't risk anyone finding an itemized list of what you bought.

, If it is normal for you to go to the mall or department store by yourself, then go alone. This leaves no witnesses and you do not have to worry about someone telling your parents what you bought. In the interest of safety, do be sure to tell your parents where you are going so they are not suspicious about where you are.

, If you are not old enough to go to the mall by yourself or feel too intimidated, then go shopping with a close friend. Choose a friend who won't slip up and mention your shopping trip and purchases to your parents.


If there is no way for you to get to a mall or department store to make your purchase away from adult supervision, then you are going to have to get creative.
You might mention that you need to go to the restroom and then quickly head to buy the underwear.

, Don’t only shop for underwear. Buy a couple decoy items so it doesn’t seem suspicious that you planned a shopping trip and then came home with nothing. If you don’t have the money for extra items, you can claim that you weren’t able to find anything you wanted.

, Put your new underwear in the bottom of your purse or shopping bag, under enough things to go undetected. If you think your parents might go through your shopping bag, you can stash the thong in your pants pocket or an interior pocket of a purse or backpack.

, Your parents might see it in your underwear drawer accidentally while they are doing your laundry. Other options might be to keep it under your mattress or behind books on a bookshelf. Get creative to keep your parents from finding it.

, Even if they seem trustworthy, in a moment of anger or forgetfulness, they might tell your parents about it. Keep it to yourself.

, The ruse is up if you go through all the hard work to secretly buy a thong and then your parents find it in the laundry. Wash and dry your own underwear according to the instructions on the tag.


If it would be out of character for you to start doing your own laundry, then handwash your thong with soap and water and let it air dry somewhere discreet in your room.

, It’s easy to forget your laundry or leave it out in the open in your room. To keep it hidden make sure each time you wash your thong that you immediately return it to its hiding place.


Set an alarm reminder on your phone, tablet, or computer to remind you if you think there’s a chance you’ll forget.

, Avoid low-rise jeans that show your underwear when you bend over. Choose jeans, shorts, and skirts with a higher waist. One-piece clothing like maxi dresses or rompers are great concealing choices, as well.

, Avoid fabrics that show the stitching detail of your underwear. For maximum protection against visible underwear, choose a thong in a color that most closely matches your own skin color.

, If you want to wear colorful, decorative underwear, then make sure you wear a thick fabric like denim that will conceal everything. Avoid wearing thongs that you want hidden with thin, tight bottoms like yoga pants.

, To avoid an embarrassing clothing mishap, only wear thongs with longer skirts. Miniskirts don’t provide very much coverage and are better paired with full coverage underwear styles like boyshorts or hiphuggers. See this article for tips on how to Wear Thong Underwear.

Dress in the way that makes you most comfortable and don't worry about it.


Sometimes girls get harassed (followed, solicited, grabbed, remarked on, threatened) by boys or men. This is not caused by outfits, but by guys who refuse to control themselves and overstep the bounds of human decency. You deserve an environment free of harassment, so if this happens, tell a responsible adult. No matter what your outfit is, other people's awful behavior is not your fault. Harassment is serious and deserves to be treated as such.

, Get at least 8 hours of beauty sleep each night (9 or 10 is even better), fill at least 1/3 of your plate with fruits and veggies, and stay active. Try joining sports teams, going on a walk with your sister each evening, or going to the beach with friends. A healthy girl is a beautiful girl.

, Posture matters not just because you look great, but because it'll help avoid backaches and other issues. When you walk, hold your head high, walk with a purpose, and let the world see that you're awesome. Practice a confident walk at home, and you'll start to really feel it, even if you don't consider yourself a confident person.


If you're disabled, that's okay. If you can't make eye contact, try looking at their nose, mouth, necklace, eyebrows... whatever is comfortable to you. If you use a wheelchair or walk differently (crutches, toe-walking, etc.), just use the best posture you can and practice your confident grin. Disabled girls are also capable of looking awesome.

The key here is to dress cool but casual and comfy.",How to Choose a Good Outfit for Going Shopping With Your Mom or Friends," Choose block colours or basic stripes. If you're trying on a new skirt you want to able to see how it would look with different things and not just see how badly it clashes with your patterned top.;
, Some shops are hot and come are cold so you want to be able to make yourself comfortable. Layers also allow for more ease trying things on. Not sure if the jacket would fit over a jumper? If you only have a coat, you will have to guess. However, if you've a light jumper on, you can try it out.

, Can you remove them modestly? Tight clothes and too many zips and buttons will just catch on things and delay you.

, You'll want somewhere to put your receipts, money and phone.

, No clothes can look good over bad underwear. You'll feel good and feel interested in buying clothes that flatter you instead of wanting to bolt from the mirrors right now.

, Either bring the item or wear it and the agonizing over whether it was that shade of blue or the other is prevented. It will also keep you on track and remind you of what you had budgeted for.

, Don't just wear something that is ""in"". You will be more confident if you look good in what you wear. Remember, you're just going to the mall so you want to be comfortable.

, If you don't, flared jeans can look just as good.

, This is popular to wear with skinny jeans but can look good with any jeans. Make sure you can easily take on and off your shoes, if you're going to be trying on clothes.

, These look cute on almost anyone! Also shirts with saying on them are super cool but make sure they look good with the rest of your outfit.

, A purse and cute earrings are nice just don't use too many or you will look tacky. Make sure your purse is big enough to hold your money and anything else you want to take.

, And don't wear anything that takes a long time to get on or off, you don't want to be messing round in the changing rooms for hours.

Learn to be confident.,
Cultivate an attitude of cheer and appreciation.,
Build strong relationships with others.,
Try volunteer work.,
Work hard in school.,
Realize it's okay to be a little different.,
Don't worry too much about what others think of you.",How to Be an Attractive Girl2," Confidence will attract boys (or girls) and make people value what you have to say. Practice walking confidently and ""power posing"" at home. Make a list of your strongest traits. Surround yourself with pictures of awesome women like you.


Throw out the beauty magazines. These feed insecurity, and you don't need that in your life.
Recognize that your opinions and feelings are just as important as anyone else's. It's good to be nice, but it's not good to constantly defer to others and never express your wants.

, The feeling of gratitude plays a large role in happiness, so keep a journal of the things you're grateful for. Every night, write down 2 things you are thankful for today (e.g. ""I'm thankful for my sister helping me with my homework"" or ""I'm thankful for the sunny weather""). Practice thanking people when they do nice things for you or your community.

, Hang out with your friends, be there for them when they need you, and practice good listening skills. Staying well-connected will improve your mental health, making you all the more confident and beautiful. Consider your friends, family members, and mentors.


If you want to make friends, try doing clubs or volunteer opportunities where you can meet people like you. Or, reach out to a classmate or acquaintance.
Don't be afraid to reach out when you need something! Remember, people like to be helpful, and being vulnerable allows them to show their true colors and be a great friend to you too.

, Volunteering is a great way to give to the community and let your kindness shine. Try joining to help a cause you believe in, like feminism, antipoverty groups, disability rights, environmentalism, et cetera. This will help you feel like a productive citizen, and you can meet other nice people like yourself!

, Intelligence and hard work are very attractive traits. Whether you're nerdy or not, education is an important aspect of your future, and potential significant others will be attracted to a girl who has the knowledge to provide for herself.


Remember that girls can be great at STEM subject areas. There are many incredible women scientists, mathematicians, etc. who are left out of the history books. (Search the internet for ""women in _____"" and see for yourself!) There are tons of jobs in these fields, so you would be super attractive to employers.
It's okay if you're low on natural ability. Hard work is more important than inborn intelligence in the long run. Do your best, try hard, and you'll be great!

, Everyone stands out in some little way—whether it's the size of their nose or their obvious disability accent. People tend not to care as much as you might think. (They may be too busy with their own troubles!) Don't let mean people make you feel ugly. Your big nose is elegant, your skin color is majestic, your curves are endearing, your body is powerful, your laugh is infectious, and you are worth getting to know.

, Attractiveness is subjective, and nobody has the same definition. Focus most on your own health and happiness, let beauty come naturally, and don't worry if you happen to bump into naysayers along the way. Be the best you can be, and let the rest fall into place.

Invest in good quality clothing.,
Get the hair.,
Get involved.,
Do preppy things with your family.,
Be confident.",How to Be a Suburban Prep," Despite what some articles say, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and American Eagle do offer good preppy clothing, but stay away from anything over-ripped or low cut. A good starter wardrobe would consist of:


4-6 pairs of jeans (1-2 pairs skinny, 2-4 pairs straight for special occasions). Get these at Hollister, A & F, or American Eagle, but if you're smaller, try Abercrombie kids. Try to avoid pairs that are distressed and brightly colored , please.
3-4 polos. Every prep has to have polos. You can find good ones at J. Crew, Ralph Lauren, the Gap, and A & F. Again, try Abercrombie kids if you're smaller, but another option would be Ralph Lauren Kids or Gap Kids. Don't get them too low cut.
5-6 logo tees. Get at least one with the name of a preppy place, such as Martha's Vineyard or Harvard. You can get logo tees basically anywhere, but try Ralph Lauren or Guess if you're looking for good ones. Both of these brands offer kid's lines.
3-4 pairs of flip-flops. Go for one pair of leather flip-flops at either A & F or Hollister, (smaller sizes try Abercrombie kids) then opt for some white and navy Havaianas. If you can't find Havaianas in your area, get the white and navy flip-flops at Old Navy. The quality is just about the same.
1 pair soccer sandals. Get Adidas slides if possible, but if you can't, VS Pink is OK. Almost every suburban girl has them.
1 pair loafers. Try Sperry Top-siders or Uggs. If these are a bit high-priced, Target has good options for about 20 or 30 dollars.
1 canvas tote bag. Get one from Lands' End, Vera Bradley, or L.L.Bean. These are nice and durable, and they have the preppy look to them.
A sweater. Get one at Lands' End or Ralph Lauren. Both have kids' sizes.
4-5 pairs of shorts. Go to A & F, Hollister, or American Eagle for these. Don't go too short though! PacSun is also good for plaid shorts. Abercrombie kids offers kids sizes.
A nice sundress. Get one from Lilly Pulitzer if possible. The designs are perfectly preppy and pretty too.
A North Face jacket. This is a preppy essential--EVERY cute suburban girl has one. Get one at a North Face store or the North Face website (thenorthface.com) They can be on the expensive side, but sometimes you can find them at sporting goods stores for much cheaper!
Delicate jewelry. Try SilverJewelryClub.com, their prices are good and the jewelry is gorgeous. If you can afford it, go to Tiffany.;
, See the Style Preppy Hair article for help with that.

, Play a sport (or two or three!) and join some clubs at school. Many preps opt to join student government. Try that for starters and if you like it move on from there.

, Is your family going to an art gallery opening or a social event at a country club? If the answer is yes, go and be seen. Do things with your whole family every once in a while, like eat out or see a play. Preppy activities include: social events, art galleries, eating out, operas, ballets, museums, basically anything that is high-class or middle-class. Don't opt for being cheap. It is not an option.

, All preps are confident. Even if you don't have a huge house, fancy cars, and nice things, be confident. If you're really shy, work on your confidence in a mirror. It's sure to help.

Know where you stand now.,
Do not become preppy because you want to be popular, anyone can be popular!,
HAIR; Get it cut!,
Straighten your hair!,
Curly/wavy hair is really great as well, if you want to stay natural and not let your hair fry.,
Now, you can do a lot with your hair!,
Just remember the golden rule of preppy hair: Pretty, Polished, and Clean.,
Start thinking differently.,
Go shopping.,
Take advantage of schools sports.,
Be nice - to everyone!,
Start wearing mascara and foundation if you haven't already.,
Basically, change your attitude.",How to Become a High School Prep," If you're not even close to being a prep right now (i.e. you're labeled as ""emo"", ""scene"", ""dork/nerd/geek"", or even a total loser with no friends, it will take a while for people to accept you as a prep and not your ""old self"".;
, A reason you might want to become popular is to look better, have more friends, or even if you don't like your current label. If you're changing schools, becoming preppy overnight is a great idea, sure! But if you're seeing the same kids in high school next year, gradually change. If you're already in high school, it's probably best to wait until college.

, Ask the hair stylist for a cute cut with not too many layers. Most preps like their hair to their shoulders. If you like longer hair, get it around two inches past, but don't leave your hair extremely long.

, Use anti-frizz cream, or a shampoo that reduces frizz/static. Then, using a flat iron, straighten your hair, when it is completely dry. It helps to flip your hair upside down & straighten it that way afterwards. Apply a little anti-frizz cream, not TOO much, because then your hair will look oily!

, Just make sure it is not frizzy.

, It's better if you leave it down, but if you feel a bit bored, you could also try a low ponytail or a side braid. DO NOT put your hair in pig tails, two braids or super-high ponytails, because they can make you look childish... not so preppy.

, Think simplicity.

, Not everything goes. If you wear dorky things, you won't become a prep. You must start shopping differently.

, Preps wear simple clothes, like polo shirts, classic jeans(ripped/styled jeans are a major no-no), classic shoes(boat shoes, flats, flip flops, boots, canvas shoes, etc; just remember, simple, classic, cute) tees, sweatshirts, and tank tops(loose ones; preps don't overly show off cleavage!). For summer, get a cute solid bathing suit from anywhere just make sure it's gonna last for awhile. Plaid shorts(Madras and Seersuckers are good ideas as well) and classic tops. Also, jewelry is elegant- wear pearls(true preps wear heirlooms), charm bracelets, cuffs, silver/gold.

, This is where you will meet most of your new friends! Be nice to everyone on the team, and invite some to hang out with you. Take them shopping, and have them help you pick out clothes. Or, hold a slumber party for a few of them ( if they're already friends ). Or have them hang at your house. Sports to consider ; lacrosse, field hockey, swim team, soccer,& softball are just a few. Cheerleading is okay but not always preppy, if your cheer squad is known for being promiscuous, which is totally not preppy.

, I know EVERYONE says this, but don't ditch your old friends. Even if you don't like them anymore. They will spread gossip, which will make you even more hated if you aren't already. Gradually stop hanging out with them. Still be nice to them, even if they aren't. Be a very open, friendly person. Preps don't have a limit on being friends with preps only. If someone has nowhere to sit in lunch, invite them to your table. It will not only make you look like a better person, but this person will also be a little happier.

, Don't overdo it on makeup, though. Look natural and clean.

, Be a friendly person, and smile a lot (but not 24/7...weird!). Don't have a fake laugh, or a rude attitude. Don't talk about your new friends behind your back.

Let's start with the hair.,
Next, the make-up.,
Necklaces: Pearls are very preppy.,
Now we come to the shirts.,
Your bottoms are great.,
Now we come to shoes.,
Outerwear is so much fun.,
Accessories: Necklaces have been dealt with.,
For dresses, simple is the key when being preppy.",How to Get a Preppy Chic Style," There's nothing wrong with a side ponytail for a prep. They're cute and hip, and they look unique. High ponytails are also very chic. Leave your hair down, but make sure to combine it with a nice hair accessory, like a cute flower pin pulling some bangs out of the way. Never have hair all in your face, you don't look clean-cut and you won't look preppy.;
, The first thing to know when you're a prep and you want to use make-up is: don't overdo it. A nice gloss is good, with some mascara and thin eyeliner. Use acne lotion in the case of pimples, it will help with your overall preppy face look.

, Also, when wearing a turtleneck shirt, put on a long necklace. This makes the proportions on your upper body equal. With a polo, chokers are better, because the attention is drawn up to the chest area and it would be too much to have a necklace just below the collar.

, Polos are beautiful and very chic. But to make them even more preppy chic, combine in with a nice hoodie or a velour sweatshirt. Make sure it's not too matchy-matchy, though. Printed shirts are nice too, but don't wear a t-shirt that says rude things like $)@# YOU! Are you in the mood for just a normal touristy t-shirt? Put it underneath a pretty cardigan or a low-necked shirt. They can act just like camis or tank tops. The short-sleeve, long-sleeve look can be hip, too. Try combining a floral short-sleeve shirt with a neutral color (e.g. black, white, brown). Know what else is nice? Long sweaters. Royal purple, maroon, green. Any color is nice.

, Minis can work, jeans can work, shorts can work. Make sure to combine them with a matching shirt, though. Completely mismatched is a little too funky. Plaid skirts are great. Combine them with leggings and you're a chic, right there. Bermudas: wonderful. Combine them with any type of preppy and hip shirt and you're good to go. Capris are pretty much the same as Bermudas. Jeans can go anywhere. Skinny jeans are amazing. They're preppy. They're cute. They're funky. They're anywhere you want them to be. Combine them with you're hip shirt and you'll love your look. Stay away from jeans with too much design. A simple derriere embellishment and some pocket embroidery is good. Flair jeans and bootcut jeans are also really nice. Tights and stockings work well with skirts.

, Get low-rise sneakers and wear ankle socks with them. When you get boots, feel free to express. Fur-lined and pom-poms are very chic. Try to wear your sneakers with skinny jeans, to show off the skinny style. When wearing boots, stuff bootcut jeans into them. It's very chic. Boots come in many colors. Tan, Black, Gray, White, Red. Any of these can work. Flats are very preppy, and can be worn with any bottoms. They're also very hip, but get a bow or a toe design to spice it up a bit.

, Double-breasted coats are great, and so are wool coats. Big-buttoned coats are very preppy and very cool. Shorter coats are very in right now, so try that! Down coats, or goose feather coats, are very fashionable.

, But bracelets: wear one chunky bracelet, or simpler, but still big, bracelets. When wearing tiny bracelets, wear many, ten to fifteen, depending on the size. Scarves are very stylish. When wearing neutral colors, spice it up with a funky pink or green scarf. Sunglasses come in many styles, but the most hip are the ones with oversized lenses. You can get ones with rhinestones on the edges or cheetah print on the rims.

, Of course, your dress can have funky straps, that's great. A suggestion for a too-plain dress. But a belt around your waist. When dressing fancy, don't wear leggings, wear tights or stockings. Know what's appropriate for day and for evening.

Talk like a prep.,
Be reasonable, polite and thoughtful.,
Be a good friend.,
Respect your parents, and other elders.,
Get a good education.,
Be moderately sporty.,
Live your preppy lifestyle as a realistic, knowing prep -- not a pretender that cons people.",How to Be a Preppy Teenage Girl1," Be pleasant and keep a sincere, interested smile on your face whether listening or speaking (not a pasted on grin). Preppy girls don't cuss; develop your college-bound level of vocabulary. Be taken rather seriously but not way too seriously, still know how to have serious fun. Practice good etiquette, being mannerly: be very mild-mannered and good natured.;
, Be kind and helpful to others around you by doing simple things such as: helping an elderly neighbor with yard work, asking someone how their day was, and any other simple act of kindness. It is amazing how much a simple act of kindness can affect a person -- and change your own outlook...

, Always be talking to a friend. Switch the friends you are talking to so one friend does not get annoyed with you. Get a boyfriend. If you are not allowed to have a boyfriend don't worry about it, because it is not essential to being preppy. Preppy people are supposed to seem innocent, so do not ever throw a fit in public. Don't spread rumors about others. Spreading rumors about others can hurt their feelings and that is not what preps do. Socialize and build friendships. Have sleepovers often. Don't forget to bring a blanket or sleeping bag if you are going to someone else's house. Chances are that if you host sleepovers and invite your friends, then they will invite you when they have sleepovers.

, Family is important. Don't give your parents attitude because they did not get you the new brand name jacket then stomp off to your room, no prep really does things like that (its just a stereotype). Offer to tutor or babysit younger children. You should be doing this for free not for money, but if they offer money just kindly take it and say thank you. Have the best birthday parties you can afford to give and invite friends and family. If all you can afford is a cake and some games to play then that is okay, the important part is that you made it the best you could.

, Good grades in school are essential. This means if you get bad grades you should study more and ask your teachers for extra credit. If you already have good grades then just do everything you can to keep them up. You may consider getting a tutor for yourself if your parents are at work when you get home.

, Play sports like volleyball and cheerleading. Although many preppy girls play volleyball and participate in cheerleading you can still do other sports such as cross-country or basketball (gymnastics is a great choice as well) or horseback riding. Tennis, golf or sailing (or rowing) with the styles of skirts, shorts and shoes that go with them are all possibilities, if appropriate.

, Make your own version of ""it's the good life"", serious fun, thoroughly living your life in all its aspects.

Be friends with other Sloanes.",How to Be a Sloane Girl (Preppy British Girl)," The 'Sloane Ranger' originated in Chelsea, London so I would advise you to commute there, check out the local boutiques and get a sense of the atmosphere. If you live too far away, you can simply do some research over the Internet, and see some photos or read some articles on Sloanes.;
, To dress like a Sloane you are going to need a fair amount of money, so I suggest starting a savings account or putting your money in a money box. Saving your money will allow you to prioritize what you need, and teaches restraint so start saving!

, Once you've saved up some money, Hit the high-street and spend those pounds. Teenage Sloanes usually shop at Jack Wills, Hollister, Abercrombie and Fitch,Lacoste, UGG Australia & Hunter. You also want to buy a pashmina scarf, no Sloane is ever seen without one! These stores are rather pricey, but the quality is good and you'll have to spend a little extra to achieve that Sloane look.

, During the day, a typical Sloane girl would be seen in a Jack Wills hoodie, paired with some skinny jeans from Abercrombie and Fitch and a pair of Uggs. Gilets from Jack Wills are also a must for the winter months and a pashmina. A big leather bag is also ideal to carry your stuff.

, A Sloane girl usually sports a messy bun with a 'comb over' style fringe to add volume. Hair should be kept poker straight or use some mousse and a 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron to add some beachy waves. Makeup should also be as neutral as possible using warm tones on the eyes and a powder to control shine on the T zone area. Lips should always be kept a light nude pink colour and maybe a berry colour in the night. NO eyeliner should be used unless it's brown, Sloane girls are known to keep their faces looking as natural as possible.

, Sloanes are not known to smell so don't. Shower once a day and wash your hair every other day. Use deodorant, and body spray during the day to stay fresh, and spritz some perfume. I would recommend Miss Dior Cherie or Chanel Chance for the night, and Lacoste touch of pink for the day time, as it is a light preppy scent that is appropriate for school.

, Try to be as cultured as possible, go to art exhibits read about different cultures and nations, and if possible TRAVEL. Learning another language is also vital such as French. A Sloane is always known to be smart so study, and get good grades in exams.

, Just because you're a Sloane doesn't mean you have to brag about your clothing. Remain humble and answer to compliments with a healthy ' Thank you'. This will not only give you a good image, but will give you a good reputation amongst other Sloanes.

, Go out! go to parties and socialize. If someone doesn't particularly like you, be the bigger person and don't make a scene or start a fight as that is not lady-like, but stay out of their way it's there loss! Be kind, use humour when appropriate and flirt! who knows you might just get a Sloane boyfriend.

Develop some good manners.,
Be clean.,
Nice hair makes you seem preppy, girly, and feminine all at once.,
You need to keep your accessorize simply, neatly, and fashionably.,
Learn to dress preppy.,
Adopt the sports.,
Begin girly hobbies.","How to Be Preppy, Girly, and Feminine"," Good manners are a necessity to being feminine, and it's just good to have them. Feminine girls act properly in all situations. They know how to speak, act, write, eat, and be at all times. And they do it all with poise and grace. Here are some simple things you can do.


Saying Thank you, Excuse Me, I'm Sorry, and Please is basic etiquette. Don't blow up when someone does not display manners, simply ignore them and carry-on.
Stand tall, shoulders back and chin up. When you sit, learn to keep your legs together.
Love the dictionary! 'Don't type Or write Lykee This' on the internet, you should know how to type, write and speak correctly.
Learn Table Manners. If you don't have time you can search it at Google. For the basic and most common table etiquette, you should keep your elbows off of the table, don't slouch, keep your mouth closed while chewing, don't smack and don't talk with your mouth full.;
, Being hygienic is an absolute must if you want to be preppy, girly, and feminine. It helps with your preppy appearance and girly behaviour, as well as with your femininity. So, learn the basics here.


Use whitening toothpaste like Crest and Colgate, and a good toothbrush. Yellow teeth are not feminine on anyone.
If you wear braces, don't let it stop you! You can get clear braces, braces behind your teeth or you can flaunt them by wearing lady-like colors such as pale pink or pale purple.
Clean your tongue, a clean tongue avoids bad breath. Tongue Cleaners are easy to find at drugstores and supermarkets.
Use mouthwash after brushing your teeth, Listerine and Act are both top brands that get the job done.
Baking soda and mashed strawberry will both whiten teeth overtime, but use them sparingly as they can wear tooth enamel off.
Take a shower. You need to wash your body everyday with a sweet smelling soap or shower gel.
Stay moisturized. Use a nice smelling lotion after your evening shower to smell fresh and sweet and be soft all day long.
Wash your hair every other day with a matching shampoo and conditioner made for your hair. Use conditioner everyday.
Brush your hair everyday and night to keep it smooth and stylish. You should never have unkempt hair.
Use deodorant and perfume. Wear a vanilla or floral scented perfume and a sweet smelling deodorant.

, So, take care of each and every one of your hairs.


Curling irons and flattening irons are quick go-to's for bad hair days, but they are very damaging to your hair. Use heat protector, so your hair maintains a healthy shiny look.
Use natural ingredients. Such as Avocado and Olive Oil for super smooth hair, Tea tree oil for dandruff, and many more.
Change your hairstyle to something sophisticated. There are many different preppy hairstyles. The side bun, straight hair, loose barrel rolls, side braid, the fishtail braid, or a high-fashion ponytail.

, No need for 20 bracelets, necklaces, or piercings.


Learn to Accessorize simply. Always wear a pair of earrings, a necklace, and sometimes a bracelet.
Pearls, gold sterling silver, and diamonds scream girly. Faux or legitimate, as long as they look real, you're fine.

, Wearing certain brands, styles, and outfit combinations create the preppy look. So, learn the secrets of success in preppy dressing.


Shirts should be polo shirts, oxford shirts, tunics, dresses, solid colored shirts, and T shirts all either in pastel or bright colors and solid or with a simple pattern like floral, polka dots, or stripes. They should be made of soft material like silk, cotton, or spandex.
Pants should be skinny jeans, khakis, slacks, Bermuda shorts, proper length skirts, dockers, and dresses in colors like navy blue, khaki, brown, and black. They should be solid colored or skirts with minimal patterns. Also, materials should be denim, corduroy, cotton, or polyester.
Shoes need to be Sperry's topsiders, oxford shoes, tennis shoes, ballet flats, canvas shoes, and riding boots. They should be made of leather or a tweed, soft material. Colors should be black, navy blue, beige, white, and really any color.
Brands need to be specific. Clothes from Gap, Ralph Lauren, USPA, Beverley Hills Polo Club, Lacoste, Vineyard Vines, Izod, and Sperry's are recommended. But, as long as the clothing article suits the style and is preppy, it should work.

, Sports like polo, golf, tennis, volleyball, softball, ballet, gymnastics, cheerleading, and track are preppy, feminine, and girly. Participate in at least two sports.


Practice every single living breathing second you can. You need to be an expert to make the team.
Develop a healthy workout and exercise regimen to keep in shape.
Don't become overweight, obese, or morbidly obese, as this leads to health problems and problems with playing sports.
Eat a very healthy diet.

, Girly hobbies come across as feminine, girly, and innocent. Do one of each of these activities:


Musical: Instrument, song writing, singing, dancing.
Fashion: Jewelry making, sewing, designing fashions
Artistic: Drawing, painting, sketching, sculpting
Fun: Collecting, creating, making, designing, building

Examples of preppy attire include simple, graceful styles, sweaters, skirts that never go out of style and dresses with a timeless, classic look that is moderate and trim. Preppy clothes have smart lines, and feature upscale, fitted tailoring. Selected clothes at department stores may seem just as high in quality as Abercrombie&Fitch, Hollister, American Eagle, Gap, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. Also, look at Old Navy and Target (and check some thrift stores which may have lots of quality at low prices), etc.

, Always keep a cute handbag with you that includes all of you essentials. Essentials may include: cellphone, comb, make-up, pads, etc. Wear jewelry, cute headbands, or just colorful bobby pins. People really do pay attention to your accessories.

, Cut, file, and paint your fingernails. French Tips are an excellent idea for a nice preppy look. Don't bite your nails; it is nasty and can ruin your nails if it is done for a prolonged time.

, Cute preppy hairstyles include things like: French braids, beach waves, or just a simple ponytail with two strands of braided hair pinned back with a bobby pin. Trim your hair every couple of weeks. It is best if you go see a stylist to trim your hair rather than cutting it yourself, but it is your choice.


Deep condition your hair at least once a week, rather than your quick shampoo and conditioner. Soft hair is a must for preppy girls, ask your hair stylist what kind of deep conditioning you should use for your hair.

, Wash your face at least twice a day. Talk to your dermatologist to find out what kinds of products would be best for you. Don't let acne get a start; go to an expert on teen facial care or a doctor immediately, if it becomes problematic!


Don't forget to moisturize every day. Moisturizing will help prevent your face from getting dry.

, Preppy girls like going to a spa to get a facial, but it is okay, if you can't afford it. Instead, you can just make one yourself and apply it yourself. The spa day can take place at your house, at a friends house, or even at an actual spa (if you can afford it).
~ Get your eyebrows waxed. It is better if you get your eyebrows at an actual spa, but if you have a friend that works at a spa then you could ask them to help you wax your eyebrows by yourself (which is not recommended).

, Exfoliate peach fuzz on your entire body at least twice a week. Exfoliating your body will get rid of dry skin and rough skin leaving your body smooth. Also, remember to apply lotion after exfoliating. Carefully shave your legs with cream or gel, including armpits as needed. Shaving is another way to make your skin soft (see tips).

, Use the back end of your toothbrush to gently scrub your tongue, roof of your mouth, and cheeks.


A mixture of baking soda and peroxide can whiten your teeth. Get your teeth whitened on occasion. Even if you do the whitening at home an occasional teeth whitening will really bring attention to your smile (see warnings).

, Choose a scent that you will enjoy and isn't too harsh.

, Minimum foundation and lightly powdered look is okay to use, but only if it is needed.


Use concealer to blend out pimples. Remember that using concealer only covers pimples but does not removes them. Also, concealer can irritate a pimple and cause it to enlarge or become more red when the concealer is removed (see tips).

Plan, whether it is to go to a university or to jump straight into work you need to make a plan.",How to Be a Preppy Teenage Girl3," Know what you will do with your future life. If what you want to do in your future is work at a fast food restaurant you may or may not go to college.

, No fried eggs or sausage - that might make you feel queasy! Eat some fruit and then whole-grain cereal or toast with jam. Scrambled eggs could work, just don't use too much fat (butter, oil...) when making them.

, Even if it's a magazine, it'll keep you busy. Catch up on some school reading assignments too, if you don't get nauseous or carsick.

, Go for a restroom break and buy some more food if you need it. If though they might be tempting, don't get any sweets or greasy foods. Instead, get a bottle of water and' maybe some hard, sucky candy to keep your mouth sweet.

, Say ""Please"" and ""Thank You"". Be kind to everyone in your family, even if your siblings are particularly irritating.

, Preps are neat freaks and super clean! Make sure the entire car is organized before you arrive.

, Don't be selfish and strut out of the car like a model, that's not what being preppy is.

North Face jacket

Toms (canvas shoes)







Uggs (boots)






Topsiders (from Sperry's only)
Hair bows in pastel and school colors
White or light pink canvas shoes
Skinny jeans (dark-wash or light-wash, never black)
Straight iron and curling iron (If your school allows it, keep in locker so you have a chance to look presentable at next class)
Ballet flats in black and bright colors
Sunglasses (If your school allows them... wear at top of head)

2 inch (5.1 cm) heels (also if your school allows them)






Jeggings in dark or light-wash
Polo Shirts in bright and pastel colors(in brand mentioned above)
Cute and Pretty Tank Tops (for layering under Polos or with each other)
Any shirt in above brand
Cute and flirty underwear (just for a boost of confidence)

,
Keep your face flawless.,
Perfect the make up.,
Make your hair perfect.,
Give yourself a manicure.",How to Be Preppy (in Middle School)1," What do the preps at your school wear? Do they shop at Hollister, Abercrombie and Fitch, Aeropostale, PINK by Victoria's Secret, or American Eagle? Or do they wear polos from Ralph Lauren? Wear what they wear.;
, from good jewelers like Tiffany's. If not, Claire's, or even (to save money) your grandma's jewelry. But never wear anything plastic. Hoop earrings, pink studs, statement rings, silver necklace, silver and gold bangles, and maybe even a charm bracelet are good to keep in your jewelry box.

, like ones from Juicy Couture, Guess or Coach. If you do not have a lot of money, buy Belvah. These bags are cheap and very cute.

,, Preps keep their faces clean with no acne, chapped lips (Which you can fix by putting on chapstick), or sunburn. Make sure you are using the right facial cleaners for your skin type. Get into a daily routine of cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing. You don't need to tone your skin until you are 13 or older. Give yourself a facial once a week and 2-3 days before any big events or special occasions(it brings out the oils on your face).

, Just a little mascara, blush and lip gloss, not much of anything else. Light pink or white eye-shadow with light pink lipstick works too. If you don't want to buy new eye-shadow, use a crush blush and use a little on your eyes for a pretty pink eye that matches your cheeks. You may also try some sparkly eye-shadow and some eyeliner, but only a very thin line. Curl your eyelashes if possible. It will make your eyes look bigger. Use concealer and foundation if you have bags or pimples. Always wear lip gloss, all the time. Remember- Your face should be classy and neat. Not trashed out like the ladies in those mascara commercials.

, Make sure that your hair is always styled. Usually keep it straight, but giving it bouncy curls once every other week is absolutely adorable. Always do something to it, whether that be a twist, bun, ponytail, pigtails, braids, french braids, fishtail braids, high ponytails, half-ups, or really anything at all that is nice, smooth and neat. Put your hair in a side-parted low ponytail if you are unsure of what to do with your hair that day. Only put your hair in a pony if it is straight or has curls in only the ponytail itself. Keep it soft by washing it every other day and using conditioner daily. Get a hair cut with long layers. Make it breast length. If you are doing this to come back to school a new person, get side bangs if you have none, or grow out your bangs if you already do.

, Make sure that your nails are always clean, well-groomed, and colored. Make them french-tipped, pale pink, hot pink, bubblegum pink, or white.

Look presentable at all times.,
Be a blast to hang out with.,
Get wonderful grades.,
Keep your image clean.,
Play a preppy sport.",How to Be Preppy (in Middle School)2," The best way to be preppy is to be happy with your life and yourself. You are under NO obligation to look a certain way, wear a certain brand or go out with certain people. Staying true to yourself will help you to make friends who like you for you, not for your clothes or popularity. You have the right to express your gender and sexuality in whichever way you wish, and you do not have to be in any way 'refined' or 'feminine', vice versa, don't let yourself form negative connotations with these words. If being 'refined' and 'feminine' make you happy, be happy., Be nice! Some middle schools' preps are mean, and that's not the real preppy attitude. Preps should be nice and not snobby.


Be bubbly, flirty, outgoing, sporty, feminine and energetic.






Don't be shy. Say hi to the new girl, flirt with a football player, etc. Be sure to do things in a nice way, though.







, Never leave the house without your makeup done, no matter what. Also, always keep your hair nice.

, But always be normal, not weird, gross or strange. Make sure you are one of the nicest gals around. Also, it helps if the other girls are jealous of your perfection, so stay perfect.

, Always have straight A's. For a true prep, a B is never acceptable. Use proper grammar and punctuation. Prepare for the SAT, even in middle school. Aim to get into an Ivy League college, home of the preps. Or Stanford.

, Do volunteer work, stay away from bad things, and be true to yourself. Try to embrace any religion. It will help your behavior. But, never preach onto other people. Never threaten anybody.

, Do a sport like horseback riding, croquet, cricket, swimming, lacrosse, dance, cheerleading, badminton, or tennis. If your school doesn't offer any of these, do volleyball, softball, or track and field.

You've got the look and prepped up that attitude; now you're going to be accepted into a group.,
Act like you're every prep's best friend.,
After making good friends with the other preppies.",How to Be Preppy (in Middle School)3," Start in the cafeteria. Say to one preppy, ""I like your shoes!"" She'll say thank you. If she compliments about you back, say thank you and then sit by her and her prep friends. Do school projects with them so other preps see that you, too, are a prep.

, Get their phone numbers and text them at least once a day.

, Invite them over, host a sleepover (Include makeovers as one of the activities), or... go SHOPPING!!! What prep doesn't love shopping? The possibilities are endless- Just make sure when you spend time with your new friends you don't do or act weird, gross or random (Like crossing your eyes, talking about health issues, etc).

Wear preppy clothes.,
Accessorize.,
Have well cared for hair.,
Keep the makeup very light.",How to Be a Popular Preppy Girl1," One important thing about looking preppy is the look. Wear the latest styles, but try to add your own twist. Here are some basic suggestions:


Shirts: Wear good quality shirts, in preppy colors. You can also wear brightly colored shirts, but try to team these with a pastel.
Pants: Own about two pairs of dark wash skinny jeans and jean shorts (depending on the weather). Have at least one pair of khakis and a few patterned pants in stripes, plaid, etc.
Shoes: Own a pair of brown riding style boots, Toms, Uggs, loafers, topsiders, canvas shoes, flats, or fuzzy boots - any of these shoes will be great. Have one pair of good quality tennis shoes too.;
, Accessories are the fun part and they can be very stylish. Try pearl earrings in your ears, which can look quite preppy. Always carry around a purse with you. Wear a watch, colorful or showy––a FitBit wouldn't go astray these days. Have a classy piece of jewelry other than the pearls, such as a charm bracelet or necklace. Some preppy charms for a charm bracelet are a tiara and a tennis racket. Get studs, a silver necklace, and small hoop earrings.


Don't forget the hair. Have pretty hair bows in pink, green, and/or navy blue, use these to tie your hair up in a high ponytail or pigtails. It is also cool to get bows in your school/team colors.

, Shampoo and conditioner every day, and blow dry after, if that is your thing. Do a high ponytail with an adorable hair bow added to it. You can also put your hair in a bun, put it in pigtails, or in a French braid. The perfect haircut has long layers, side bangs, and is straight. Wear your hair in curls on special occasions.

, Some sheer gloss is really all you need. If you have bad skin, use facial cleaning products. Don't cake on the foundation but do apply mascara and blush. A thin line of eyeliner looks classy.

"
"
Have confidence and assume power.,
Have a preppy personality.,
Get involved and find a hobby.,
Care about your studies.,
Stay in good condition.,
Have a fun room to take friends home to.",How to Be a Popular Preppy Girl2," To be a popular girl, you can't be overwhelmed with all the girls asking you questions. You must be able to to answer quickly and snappily, clearly and well. Give off an aura of being in control and always sound like an authority on the relevant subject.

, Be classy, pleasant and smile frequently. Have a bubbly, peppy and outgoing persona. Avoid using words that everyone else overuses––have an excellent grasp of the finer words in the English language.

, You have to have at least one preppy activity. Choose from horseback riding, polo, tennis, squash, track and field or lacrosse. You can also do ballet, jazz, lyrical, tap, cheerleading, basketball, softball, soccer, or volleyball. As long as you do one preppy activity, you can do one non preppy activity.


Join lots of school clubs.
Run for school president or for other officers.

, Get good grades and make good choices. Try to get A's, or a B+ average at the least. The studies come before any extracurriculars.


Speak a language. Consider taking French at school and learning Italian, German, or Spanish in your free time. Learning any other language is good too. Latin helps as well. Take Chinese and ace it.

, Exercise daily. Preppy girls are never unfit. Eat healthily. Drink herbal tea and have plenty of water.

, Decorate the room as you'd like it to be but ensure that it is up-to-date and hip, as well as a cool place to hang out in.

"
"
Wear respectable brand name clothes.,
Especially Rugby shirts, chinos in light colors and shirts make you look preppy.

,
Shop for clothes that come in classic colors, although this is by no means a definitive list: pink, sky blue, navy blue, lime green, Nantucket red, or yellow.,
Develop a comfortable but clean look.,
Wear leather moccasins, and boat shoes (top-siders) or leather flip flops in the summer.,
Pick a scent and stick to it.,
Consider that if you wear glasses, try wearing cool-looking glasses or consider contacts.,
Keep simple hair.,
Be fresh and neat.,
Look healthy.,
Participate in some kind of sport.,
Join the choir, preferably the madrigals or orchestra if you are musical.,
Act friendly and outgoing... a little shy is OK, but be nice.,
Study hard and remember to keep your grades up, preferably 3.0 GPA at minimum and above, because preps are also known as being smart and hard working on top of their looks and lifestyle.,
Read etiquette books.",How to Be a Preppy Guy," A sampling of such brands might include Polo, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Lacoste, J. Crew, Hickey Freeman, Paul & Shark, Peter Millar, J. Press, Southern Tide, and Vineyard Vines. Hollister, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, and A.E are not the conventional preppy but some of their designs are classic.;
,, Looking at some clothing from the brands above will probably give you a good idea. Buy clothes that have colors that match well and look good on you. For example, a redhead will look better with green than pink or lavender unless he has blue eyes.

, Find classic looking belts, preferably tan/light brown. Make sure the belt is leather if it is a dress belt, and canvas with leather tips if it is for casual occasions. Make sure it is not covered in little tacky bits or studs etc.

, Wearing a pair of top-siders without socks is classic preppy.

, Don't use different scents of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, aftershave, deodorant and cologne. Buy a matching set. Don't put too much on.

, Dark rimmed glasses are geeky or scene/emo/punk, etc. Try getting rim-less glasses and clean them everyday to look sophisticated. Lately though, Buddy Holly styled glasses have been making a comeback on the runway. If you wear nothing but preppy clothes, then this would completely work well with a nice cardigan or sweater. Also, many preppies in history (such as Barry Goldwater) have worn nerdy glasses, & the subculture often overlaps with preppies, so any glasses could work.

, A common preppy hairstyle is the shaggy look or the fluffy look, or hair just parted on the side and short. Lately, many preppy guys are going away from the long hair styles and back to traditional shorter hairstyles. Think the 1940s and 1950s crop top and crew cut. No unnatural hair colors or shaved hair. If it is shaved, have it shaved modestly. Keep your hair looking natural! Hair gel is all right if it is done modestly, but don't overdo it.

, Have clean, trimmed fingernails. File and buff your nails to make them healthy - don't bite them. Keep your lips moisturized. Chapped, cracked lips are unsightly. Shave and comb your hair as often as you need to. Don't wear wrinkled or stained clothes. Stay away from ripped jeans; this is for wannabe preppy and ripped jeans are 1990s and 2000s fashions. Brush twice or thrice and floss your teeth once or twice a day. Whiten your teeth if necessary. Be well groomed. Avoid tattoos and getting pierced.

, Get toned and take in some sun color, just don't overdo it. Don't burn your skin, use sunscreen. Don't use tanning beds either. Drink lots of water, take vitamins and eat lean protein. Take excellent care of your skin (use lotion), teeth, hair and nails.

, Crew, Cross Country, horseback riding, lacrosse, track, polo, rugby, football, golf, sailing, skiing, squash and tennis are classic examples of preppy sports. If it is in the Olympics, it is preppy. Even if you don't do a sport, you should stay fit as possible. For high school sports, try sports such as tennis, Cross Country, golf, swimming, soccer, track etc. Lift weights for toning and staying lean but don't develop huge bodybuilder muscles.

, Don't start your own band. If you do play a band instrument, make sure you are in symphonic band, jazz band, or solo and ensemble contests. Don't obsess on marching or pep band. A community band is better than high school band.

, Smile. Stand up straight. Avoid getting people angry. Forget talking about money - it can put people off.

, They get into good preppy colleges because they try to work hard. Use good grammar. Many preps end up getting into Ivy League or Private Universities because of their grades, sports and high SAT scores. Keep up with what is going on in the world and financial markets. If you don't understand investing money basics - read books and learn.

, Don't laugh! Good manners is not just for girls or older men. It shows people you have had a good upbringing. Use basic politeness such as please, thank you and excuse me. Be considerate and hold doors for people. Don't wear a hat indoors. Keep your cell phone in check and put it on vibrate when you go to a public place. Never use slang or talk back or roll your eyes.

, Eat well and take care of your body. Take up a school sport such as tennis, track, golf, dance, lacrosse, polo (any type of English riding), rowing, swim, soccer, or whatever else your school offers. You're body DOES NOT have to be perfect; being preppy shows more in how you act and treat others around you, but participating in preppy sports never hurts.

, If you can't attend a private school, at least try to take advanced placement (A.P) or accelerated courses in almost everything you can. If your school offers electives, choose preparatory vocational training classes (such as culinary, architecture, or agricultural science) rather than an ""easy A"" class. Taking student council or a physical education class is also good. Try to focus your high school career on getting good grades and participating in clubs, sports, and organizations. It's okay to have fun sometimes, but it's important to realize that school is IMPORTANT. Use your school's resources (pre-ACT/SAT classes, tutoring, library, etc.) and try your best to earn scholarships! Take a foreign language if your school offers it. Many universities require 2-3 years of a foreign language for admission, and you will look very educated. Preps take education very seriously, and can always hold up a conversation about any topic; be very well rounded.

, This is definitely the most important aspect of being preppy. Real preps are always polite and kind. Preps are never rude, mean, or unpleasant. They are never bullies, and should always be able to make others feel good about themselves. Preps do little to no cursing. They treat adults with respect, and follow their rules. They surround themselves with positive, kind people, much like themselves. They are people you can go to with a problem, and they will help.

, Never wear excessively revealing clothing! Stay away from extreme fads as well! Good brand to buy from are Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Banana Republic, Vineyard Vines J. Press, Lilly Pulitzer, or any other place that sells good quality clothes. Wear a lot of polos, rugby shirts, blouses, cardigans, cable knit sweaters, khakis, bermuda shorts, quality denim,and tea dresses.

, What is important is to dress for the occasion--do not let these labels slip into your everyday wear.

, Wearing those brands is not preppy, and everyone knows it. You can find really cute outfits for low prices at n op-shop. No-one knows how many previous owners your clothes have had unless you tell them. Being preppy is practically the opposite of mainstream (that's right, hipsters are not the opposite of mainstream). They cost less than the real thing, but that's because they are not the real thing. If you are low on cash, check out discount stores; they will almost always have the real thing for a fraction of the cost!

, Monogrammed bags from L.L Bean are also a plus.

, Wear conservative ballet flats, top siders, loafers (penny are the best!), dock siders, conservative wedges, and nice sandals, to name a few.

, No unnatural colors or weird hair cuts are not preppy at all. Your hair should always be clean, shiny, and well groomed.

, A ponytail with a ribbon tied at the base is very classic. Try family heirlooms, such as your mother's silver bracelet or your grandmothers diamond necklace. A simple charm bracelet (preferably gold in color) or sparkly headband should do the trick. Try to look simplistic, never gaudy.

, For foundation, get something with SPF protection from Lancome or Clinique. Use primer and a moisturizer. Eyeliner, blush, and mascara should be used lightly. Makeup does not have to be from expensive department stores; if makeup from the drug store works well for you and makes you look good; use it! It's all about making you look your best and making you feel good; makeup is not about brands.

, Women such as Meryl Streep, Princess Diana of Wales, Audrey Hepburn, and Jackie Kennedy. Women with class and grace are the kind you should be looking up to!

Leave the person wanting more.,
Wear clothes that flatter your body.,
Go for softer lipsticks.,

Wear red.,
Keep your hair clean and shiny.",How to Be Seductive," The best way to introduce seductive techniques into a situation is eye contact. To start trying to be seductive, lock eyes with the person you're trying to attract. Hold their gaze to get their attention.If the person walks over to begin a conversation, maintain eye contact as you talk. People are attracted to those who pay attention to them. Holding someone's gaze can help them feel special, making you come off as seductive.
Do not hold eye contact for more than a few seconds if someone is not in conversation with you. You do not want to look like you're staring.;
, Certain facial expressions are read as more seductive than others. When trying to attract someone, subtlety is key in your facial expression. Instead of beaming at the other person, add a small, sly smile. Holding a person's gaze while offering a close-mouthed smile will come off as highly seductive., Posture can convey interest, which is a seductive quality. Closing your body off by crossing your arms or looking away can convey a lack of interest. Instead, work on maintaining an open posture to show the person you're interested in them.Face the person when they're talking.
Keep your arms away from your chest. Do not put anything, like a purse or bag, on your lap.
Lean slightly forward. This conveys a genuine interest in the other person, which can be a seductive quality.

, If the person seems open to your flirtation, introduce light touch. Touch can trigger sexual interest. Do not overdo it. Stick to light, subtle touches.For example, gently brush the person's arm or wrist during a conversation.
If seated, try brushing the person's knees under the table.

, Pay attention to the tone you're using when talking. Speak in a soft and pleasant voice. Avoid raising your voice or talking too loud. This can come as angry, and can dampen someone's interest in you., People are interested in those who are interested in them. In general, people are most easily seduced by people equipped to make them feel good and special. If you want to be seductive, make a habit of complimenting others and making them feel good about themselves.Take genuine interest in what other people do. Ask questions like, ""That sounds interesting? What's it like teaching?""
Pay people compliments that make them feel unique and special. For example, say something like, ""It sounds like you work really hard. I bet you put in more effort than most into teaching.""
As you're complimenting someone, couple this with seductive body language. This will help you come off as irresistible.

, People are attracted to people willing to forge a connection with them. When trying to be seductive, listen to what the other person says. In turn, share things about yourself as well. Simply exchanging information with someone can make you more attractive to them.When someone else is talking, give non-verbal cues to show you are listening. Nod, smile, and laugh when appropriate. Occasionally, reiterate what the other person has said to make sure you understood it.
In turn, answer any questions the other person may have about you. Be willing to talk about your own job, friends, life, and family. Do not dominate the conversation, but create a sense of intimacy by openly sharing.

, A good smile and laugh, on occasion, can make you come off as seductive in conversation. Remember to maintain a close-mouthed somewhat mysterious grin much of the time. However, if a joke is made, offer a big smile and a giggle. People will feel flattered by someone who laughs at their jokes., A little bit of mystery is seductive. When first meeting someone, be the one to put an end to phone conversations, dates, and other get-togethers. If you say goodbye first, the person will be left wanting a little more.However, avoid playing games. Only leave if it makes sense to do so. For example, if it's getting late on a date, it's okay to duck out. Do not leave a date halfway through simply to look seductive. This is more likely to alienate the person.

, There is no one outfit that is universally seductive. It will take some experimentation for you to find a seductive outfit that works for you. Try on a variety of clothing until you find something that flatters your body. Different cuts of shirts, suits, dresses, and jeans will work for different people.You want something that shows off your best qualities. For example, if you have very muscular arms, go for a short sleeve t-shirt or button-down.

, If you wear lipstick, dramatic lipstick may be a draw back when it comes to seduction. Lipstick can be attractive, but keep it subtle. Opt for a soft pink shade over something bright or vibrant., Smelling nice can be tremendously seductive. Pick out some pleasant scents of perfume and cologne. Before going out, dab them on your wrists or behind your ears. A nice, fresh scent can be very seductive.Be sure to avoid anything overpowering. Stick to subtle scents, like vanilla, over dramatic floral scents. Some people may be bothered by strong smells.

, People tend to be attracted to the color red. If you want to be seductive, opt to add some red to your outfit. Wear a red dress or a suit with a red undershirt. Try a flattering red blouse, t-shirt, or button down shirt. Even a pair of red pants can help you be seductive.Remember, while red is great in clothing, bright reds for lipstick can be overwhelming.

, There is no one single hairstyle that is seductive. However, making an effort with your looks is attractive. However you style your hair, keep it clean and shiny. Wash your hair before going out and use a small amount of product, like mousse or gel, to give it an extra gleam.Sweet-smelling shampoos can also help give you a seductive scent.

Respect yourself.",How to Be Sexy," The trick here is knowing how much is too much. A flash of skin can tease and trigger desire, but in order to keep yourself in a guy's mind, you need to leave something to the imagination.Aim for balance. If you decide to show off your legs, keep your chest and back covered. If you show off your back, keep your legs and chest covered. If you go for a little cleavage, keep your back and legs in check.
Choose your best feature to flaunt in order to make the strongest impression possible.;
, Your wrists are one feature you can always expose for subtle yet lasting sexiness.


The effect is more biological than anything else. The glands in your wrists emit pheromones, and these pheromones trigger feelings of attraction without the other party even realizing it., A red dress, skirt, or top can spark desire in a man on sight.


Some studies suggest that women wearing red are 56 percent more likely to be hit on or asked out than women wearing blue or white.Red mimics the red flush that skin takes on during moments of passion.

, Oddly enough, your lips are the one feature that may not benefit as much from the color red as you would think. Neutrals and soft pinks tend to have a more dramatic effect than fire engine red.


Women with pale skin look best in light rose shades, according to some.
Women with medium-tone skin should consider pinks with brown undertones.
Women with darker skin tend to look good in wine-colored pinks.

, Admit it: you love the feeling of soft silk, suede, or cashmere on your skin. As it turns out, the texture of these materials beg to be touched by guys glancing your way, too.Silk can be especially alluring since it has culturally sexy connotations, but textured material in general makes a better choice than everyday fabrics like cotton or linen.

, High heels are culturally construed as sexy footwear. You don't need to break your ankles wearing heels you can hardly walk in, but a shoe with a little bit of a heel will look sexier than one with none.


There is some legitimate reason behind this principle, as well. High heels change the way a woman stands and walks. Slouching is much easier with sneakers than it is with strappy stilettos.
High heels can also make legs look longer and slimmer.

, Perfume can have a draw a guy in close, but if you splash too much on, you will only end up pushing him away. The idea is to where enough perfume to catch someone's attention and draw them in closer for a better sniff.


Pure perfumes should be dotted or sprayed on the wrists or behind the ears once a day.
An eau de toilette should be sprayed in front of you and walked through before you head out for the night.
In general, opt for perfumes that smell like exotic flowers, vanilla, amber, spices, etc.

, Wash your hair the morning or night before you plan to go out and apply a deep conditioner for extra shine.


A good way to increase the glossiness of your hair is to condition first and shampoo afterward, thereby stripping away excess residue.
Rough-dry your hair by raking your fingers through it. This increases the amount of volume and lift your hair has.
Dry your hair completely by finishing up with three minutes of heat. If your hair is left wet, it will lose volume and end up becoming limp.
You could also spray a shine spray on your locks before you head out for extra glossiness.

, The eyes are responsible for conveying a large portion of nonverbal communication. In order to look sexy in someone else's eyes, you have to use your own to draw that person in, first.


If you are a little on the shy side, cast a quick glance toward someone to convey your interest. Keep casting glances his way every now and then until he takes the bait.
If you feel a little bolder, let your eyes lock with his and linger for a little while before you pull them away. As you turn away, offer an inviting smile.

, A smile suggests that the person wearing it is friendly and approachable. Someone who is more approachable is also more likely to seem interested, thereby making the person on the other end more interested, as well.


A wide, open mouth smile looks confident and friendly, but a shy, closed mouth smile can look demure and sexy in its own way.

, Blinking, nodding, and shaking your head are a few simple things you can do to make yourself seem more animated. Letting your hands naturally wave about can have the same effect.


A more animated women generally appears sexier than one who seems stiff and inhibited.

, During conversation, lightly brush your hand on the guy's forearm. This indicates that you are fully engaged in the conversation and breaks the first physical boundary between the two of you.


If you do not feel comfortable enough to touch the guy in question, briefly touch your own neck or collarbone. This draws attention to these exposed yet intimate flashes of skin.

, Good posture makes your figure look better. Even a gal with perfect proportions can look frumpy is she does nothing but slouch.


Good posture also conveys confidence, which can be a very sexy quality.

, Instead of hiding in the bathroom as you touch up your lipstick or gloss, whip out your compact mirror and do it in front of the guys in the room.


This action draws attention to your lips. The lips and the eyes are usually considered to be the most sultry features of the face.

,


Slow down the speed at which you speak and pause in between sentences.
When walking by yourself, slowly strut instead of dashing from place to place.

, Even if you don't plan on turning any heads today, you should still take the time to keep up on your daily hygiene routine. If your skin, hair, and teeth are properly cared for on a regular basis, they will be in a healthier, more beautiful state the next time you do want to head out.


Bathe regularly. You should shower at least every other day and consider bathing every day during hot, humid months. Make sure to moisturize your skin with lotions or cream after getting out of the shower.
Only wash your hair every other day. Washing your hair every day can dry it out, causing it to become dry, frizzy, and easily broken.
Brush your teeth two to three times every day. At minimum, you should brush your teeth in the morning, after waking up, and at night, immediately before going to bed.

, Eat right and exercise. You may not be blessed with a model's physique, but a balanced diet and regular exercise can do wonders for your appearance.


A balanced diet can make your skin, hair, and overall demeanor glow.
Regular exercise keeps off excess fat and also tones your body.

, Some foods contain compounds that boost your hormones, making you feel sexier on the inside. When your own sex drive spikes, you are more likely to look and act sexy in front of others without thinking about it.Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, which causes the body to release endorphins. Dark chocolate is especially good.
Coffee stimulates the portion of your brain responsible for regulating arousal.
Saffron is a spice known to improve sex drive and performance.
Watermelon has a high level of citrulline, an amino acid that lets the body produce arginine, which increases sex drive.

, Even if you don't plan to show your underwear off, wearing something sexy beneath your clothes can make you feel more confident and more seductive. This boost of confidence will allow you to be naturally sexy without having to think about.


Consider something in black or animal print.
Also take the material into consideration. Lace and silk are both good options.

, Confidence is key. In order to seem sexy to others, you need to believe in your own sexiness, first.


Avoid fishing for compliments or putting yourself down, as these are both marks of insecurity.
On the other hand, you should not gloat or come across as being arrogant about your looks or your strengths.

, Passion, overall, is a sexy attribute to have. You should be passionate about your interests and passionate about the person you've set your sights on.


No matter what your passions are, you should treat them—and talk about them—with vigor. Just don't get carried away. You can have a passion for music, medicine, or underwater basket weaving, but the moment someone's attention starts to fade as you talk about it, you should take it as an indication that you've talked about it enough.

, This inspires self-confidence and boosts self-esteem, both of which are key ingredients of sexiness.


If you can afford something a little special, buy yourself a trip to a day spa, a massage chair, a foot bath/massage device, a great new outfit, or a pedicure kit.
If you don't have the extra cash, take the time to indulge in a bubble bath or paint your nails.

, Never degrade yourself by thinking that your self-worth and sexiness is determined only by others.


Respect your body. Don't let others touch you without permission or harass you.
Respect your mind and your heart. If someone tries to degrade, in any way, walk away. That person is not worth your time.
Wear dresses that show off your sexy side. Wear loose sexy clothing that show of bits of your arms, back, and neck.

Choose the right colors.,

Use your eyes.",How to Be Perfectly Innocent," Never use inappropriate language (swear words, rude words). Avoid rude topics, like discussing bodily functions. You should also replace words in your vocabulary with their innocent alternatives (God with gosh, Hell with h-e-double-hockey-sticks, damn with darn, etc).;
, Never smoke, drink, hang out at night, or take in inappropriate media (tv shows or books with adult themes, like violence or sex). Save yourself, sexually, for marriage and act appropriately around members of the opposite gender. If you struggle with these things, get an adult or friend to act as a chaperone.

, Innocent people don't like to fight with others, so never get into a fight if you can help it. If you do have a problem with someone, get help from an adult or a superior, like a parent, teacher, or boss. Certainly avoid using serious insults with someone. Using childish, harmless insults can make you look more innocent, however (think stinky-pants, butt-face, etc).

, Innocent people are usually very kind and sweet, so do your best to act that way. Ask people about their day and things that you know are important to them. Compliment people frequently and honestly. Help out with anything you can. And importantly: always be polite!

, A good work ethic is also associated with innocent people, so make school, work, or charities your priority. Try to aim for being the best, getting straight A's or making your boss really happy. Help out your local church or religious institution, or choose another charity to help out, like Girl Scouts or Amnesty International.

, If you are old enough to be interested in relationships with another person, try to be chaste in how you interact with them. When you flirt, be subtle and shy. Compliment them politely. Never try to be sexy. Let them do the romancing. Just realize that this makes getting their attention a lot harder!

, When people say something bad or do something bad, react with surprise. Innocent people don't realize that people do bad things, so you should be more surprised than angry. You can even seem a little upset. Averting your eyes or covering your ears can also add some innocence to your attitude.


Having a strong opinion on complex issues, however, is not very innocent! Avoid lecturing!

, Little kids are truly innocent. Spend time with them and interact with them to see how they act. Try to be more like them. You can babysit or volunteer for your church's daycare. If you have young family members, you can try to spend more time with them too. If you're good academically, you can volunteer as a tutor at a local elementary school.

, Try not to think about adult subjects. If you start to think about someone physically, refocus onto something else. If you start to think mean or violent thoughts, refocus onto something else.


There are lots of ways to refocus, but you can try saying prayers or reciting verse inside your head. You can also start singing your favorite Disney song inside your head. If you need to, simply leave the area you are in or the activity you are doing to help your brain refocus.

, Enjoy the things that innocent people enjoy. Children's media and activities are a great place to start. You can watch kid's TV shows like My Little Pony, movies like VeggieTales or Disney films, or activities like board games or crafts.

, You tend to pick up the behaviors of the people around you, so surround yourself with good people. Ditch rude, inappropriate friends and keep friends who are also innocent or are at least good and polite.

, These seem as the most common personality traits of innocent people, so try to stay optimistic and positive. Don't whine or complain when things don't go your way, and when you see other people having a tough time, try to help them see the bright side. Let Charlie Chaplin's ""Smile"" be your theme song!

, Dress in a way that is appropriate for someone of an ""innocent"" age. Wear clothing that is conservative and looks nice. Knees and shoulders should be covered and necklines should not be too low. You can also choose younger hairstyles, like two braids for girls, or slicked-back hair for boys.

, Try to get that ""Sunday best"" look, or a look that is appropriate for church or visiting with your grandparents. Boys can wear pressed pants and a polo, while girls can wear knee-length dresses or skirts and a blouse. Mary Janes (the shoe) for girls or any formal shoe for boys can also drive home the innocent look.

, You want to avoid the ""in fashion"" colors, jewel tones, and ""sexy"" colors like red and black. Instead, choose colors that are common in children's clothes, like pastels and some bright colors like yellow, pink, and blue. Very clean, white clothing can also look very innocent.

, Makeup can quickly make you look very adult or sexy, so women should avoid it. If you do need to wear makeup, go for the ""natural"" look, with just a little pink lipstick, basic foundation, and minimal eye makeup (maybe light mascara and little more).

, Strong scents create a very adult appearance, so avoid cologne and perfume. If you do need to have some kind of scent, try to mimic the smell of laundry or baby (talc) powder. Girls may be able to get away with a light, floral smell.

, To help get that fresh-from-church look, make sure your hair is very carefully kept. Get regular haircuts and keep your hair in a tidy hairstyle, such as braids or slicked back. Avoid popular hairstyles.

, You can get an innocent look by being careful about how you use your eyes. As they say, eyes are the window into the soul. Look away when you see or hear something inappropriate. Look up at people through your eyelashes. You should also look away when people you don't know make eye contact with you, or when someone you like looks at you.

Take good care of your skin.,
Keep your body well-groomed.,
If you have the time and energy to go above and beyond the basic grooming, put some polish to your features to look even more beautiful!",How to Be Pretty As a Teen1," Many say that your skin is a reflection of what's going on inside your body, so it makes perfect sense that you should take care of it.


Wash your face twice a day, daily. Use a gentle face wash for sensitive skin to rid your face of excess oil, dirt, and other unwanted debris that might otherwise clog your pores and make your skin dull.
Use a product for skin that contains salicylic acid, if you do not have sensitive skin, to clear up acne and blackheads. There are excellent products that you may even find in drug stores that are affordable and effective.
Protect your skin from dryness, especially if you live in a cold, dry, or otherwise harsh environment.; or if you use a salicylic acid treatment. You will want to find a moisturizer that does not irritate your skin
Use sunscreen daily, even in the winter. Tanning and sunburn may look different on the outside, but below the skin, it means the same thing: intense sun damage. By not protecting your skin from harmful sunlight UV rays, you have a higher risk of skin cancer. Some sunburns can even cause scarring and hyperpigmentation.;
,


Tweeze your eyebrows and cut them so they are not too long. Be careful, though; you do not want to make your brows too thin. If you do have thin brows, try filling them in with a pencil or powder that matches your natural brow color. You can even try a brow gel, which is meant to keep the hairs in place.
Shave unwanted hair if this is your preference. Use a new razor to prevent cuts and razor bumps. Shave your underarms, legs or anywhere else with unwanted hair (Don't be embarrassed, we all have it!)
Cut your hair as often as you feel necessary. While the idea that cutting your hair makes it grow longer, thicker, or faster is definitely still a myth, cutting the tips of your hair can get rid of split ends.
Shower every day, morning or night, and wash your hair at least every other day. While washing your hair daily may strip it of its oils, going more than two days without washing it is enabling it to collect dirt, dander, oil, and other unwanted grime. Use a cotton swab to clean your ears and prevent wax build-up, blow your nose, and use another cotton swab to clean your belly button.
Trim your fingernails and toenails. Make sure you clean underneath them with a brush, and use clippers to keep them from over-growing or chipping.

,


Polish your fingernails, even with a simple, clear polish. If you paint your nails with an obvious color, make sure you re-paint them or remove the polish when it chips and cracks.
Use conditioner on your hair and rinse with cold water, to close the follicle and prevent frizz once it dries.
Wear deodorant to prevent body odor, and use a spritz of perfume in the crease of your elbow, the crease of your knee, in your hair, and in the crook of your neck in order to not over-do it. Be careful not to over-power people; it is not fun to choke on someone's perfume or cologne.
Wash your clothes and avoid wearing clothes with holes and stains.
Brush your hair daily, and style it if you choose. If you use a flatiron or a curling iron on your hair, use heat protectant. If you have frizzy hair, try a smoothing serum to keep it smooth and silky.

, Spice up vegetables with popcorn seasoning; they make a variety of flavors that taste amazing! Try eating grains such as rice or whole-grain pasta, and avoid starchy, greasy, processed foods.

Your life is a precious miracle, your individuality is special. While fashion fads, preferences for certain body shapes or parts and styling requirements come and go, one thing never changes, and that is that you matter. You can always work on attitude and appearance but never forget that your very essence is something to always be proud of.


Realize that you deserve to have a healthy, happy and well educated life. You are also responsible for ensuring that this happens.;
, Confidence is a skill that can be learned and practiced. The more you put it into practice, the more it will become second nature. If you grow up in a gregarious society, such as the United States, it's an expectation, so you'll have plenty of role models to imitate.

, Smiling shows that you're happy and comfortable in your own skin. Smiles suggest that you're approachable, friendly and nice to talk to.

, Don't just give the impression of being nice, then fail to deliver. To be seen as beautiful, it's important to exude a beautiful attitude toward everyone. That means showing other people kindness, consideration, thoughtfulness and compassion. Each of these will add up to your beautiful aura.

, Make the most of your natural talents by working hard to hone them. Learn as many skills as you can so that you can be self-sufficient, capable and most importantly of all, competent. You owe it to yourself to be a fully-rounded person who can do things for herself.

, It's one of the first things people look at with respect to appearance.


Get a haircut that matches your face shape.
Aim to keep your hair as natural as possible. Don't spray a lot of hairspray, it damages hair and the stiffness it creates is uncomfortable for you and it looks fake.
Soften your hair if needed. There are plenty of treatments available to help you with this.
Try different hairstyles through the week. Switch it up to keep everyone wondering what's next.
Talk to your hairstylist first if you're planning on changing color or doing anything drastic.

, Wash it daily. If you have acne, consider using an acne treatment or see a dermatologist for advice.


Don't wear a lot of makeup. A little mascara or foundation and lip gloss is fine here and there, but it is best just to look more natural. Plus, makeup isn't the best for your face. If you do tend to wear a lot, make sure you wash it all off every night.

, If wished, add clear gloss or a pretty nail color.

, Bathe or shower daily, use deodorant or anti-perspirant and wash with soap. You can use body spray if wished but it's not necessary.


Change your sanitary ware frequently during your period––pads and tampons do not breathe well and are the principal sources of foul odors, not you. The more frequently they are changed, the better.

, Fashion is what you say it is, including following the fads of the day, if that's your thing. The most important element of style is that the clothes fit your body shape well, they're comfortable and you feel good in them

, Frequent movement is important to keep your amazing body healthy and in good shape. If you sit a lot during the day, be sure to take breaks and move around so that you stay flexible and well toned. Do a sport or physical activity regularly, to keep fit and strong.

, Avoid eating too much fast food. Learn to make salads, cook basic healthy food and make your own snacks. Eat small amounts and keep to regular mealtimes that fit into your schedule.

, This is important for your well-being, as you get to do something interesting, bond with like-minded people and have fun at the same time. There are many possibilities and, provided you have the time, you can do more than just one activity. Examples include sport, hobby clubs, dance, volunteering, caring for animals, modeling clubs, debating, athletics, drama, and so forth.

Maintain a variety of interests.",How to Be Cool and Popular," It’s not very cool to dress or act a certain way just to make other people happy or to make them think you’re cool. In fact, it’s exactly the opposite. Don’t wear preppy polos or strappy sandals or whatever everyone else is wearing just because someone made fun of your unique style; don’t act chill or disaffected just because someone accused you of being “hyper.” If you have your own thing going for you, then it’s cool to stick to it, and let the haters hate.


Though “stop caring about what people think” may sound impossible, you can definitely do it if you make a point of casting aside the comments that were made about you and going on about your day. People who have nothing but negativity to spread aren’t worth your time.
If people are spreading rumors about you or just saying bad things about you, don’t fight back by starting rumors of your own. Instead, take the high road and ignore these haters, showing that you’ve got better things to do with your time than to care about what they’re saying about you. That is definitely cool.;
, One important characteristic of a cool and popular person is that he or she generally has a great time no matter where he or she goes. Though you don’t need to laugh like a maniac in the middle of an organic chemistry test, you should make an effort to have a good time no matter what you’re doing. Whether you’re waiting in the cafeteria line, chatting with your friends at your locker, or working in a group activity in school, you should give off a positive energy and act like you’re enjoying yourself. People will be attracted to your optimistic nature and will want to spend time around you.


To make this easier, you should try to spend as much of your time doing the things you love as you can. Of course no one will see you having a great time if you’re stuck in detention or are on your way to band practice when you can’t stand it.
Work on developing a positive energy that makes you see the bright side of things, and makes you quick to laugh instead of worry.
Focus on being in the present moment instead of being concerned about how you come off.

, Another way to get people to notice you is to do the things you love. This can mean taking dance lessons, singing with your friends, sketching, or even making your own clothes. It doesn’t matter what you do; what does matter is that you’re passionate about it. That passion will attract people and will make them think you’re a person who is interesting and worth knowing. Doing something you love will also lead you to get to know more people who share your passion.


You can also get noticed by teaching people to master the thing you’re good at. You can offer to give people drawing lessons, tennis tips, or even tell people how to be the best at tetherball. If you’re willing to teach other people and help them improve, then you will definitely come off as cool.

, People who are truly cool and popular have an understated confidence in who they are and what they’re about. If you’re cool and popular, then you don’t have to brag or show off, but you should project a positive energy and a happiness when you talk about who you are and what plans you have for your future. Stand up tall, smile, and speak with authority, acting like you’re not trying to put on a front or like you’re down on yourself. Showing how confident you are can go a long way in making you truly cool and popular.


Talk about something you’re looking forward to over the weekend or an awesome show or movie that you saw. Make it clear that you’re happy with what you’ve been doing and that you want to share your ideas with people. Now that’s confidence.
Compliment other people as often as you can while being genuine. People who are confident aren’t jealous and see the good in people and are happy to point it out.
Introduce yourself to someone you don’t know and strike up a conversation with that person. Now that takes confidence.

, There’s no one way to dress if you want to be cool and popular. Of course, there are some stores where “cool” people may like to shop, such as Urban Outfitters or Abercrombie, but that doesn’t mean that going there will make you cool and popular. It’s far more important for you to wear something that fits well, looks clean, and shows off your individuality than to give in to a certain style of fashion. If you like graphic tees, Converse, or dangling earrings, just own the look instead of questioning it or asking other people what they think about it.


Don’t worry about having a perfectly-matching, immaculately-coordinated look. Wearing clothes that are offbeat or unique can be much more interesting if you can pull it off.
The most important thing is that your clothes fit you well. Wearing clothes that are too baggy can make you look sloppy and wearing clothes that are too tight can make you look more provocative than you intended.
Just remember to shower and groom yourself daily. It will be hard to pull off any look if you look sloppy or haven’t showered in a few days.

, You may think that it’s cool to act like you’re too good for school or like you have better places to be, but in fact, acting like you’re “too cool for school” will just make you look like someone who is kind of boring, or who doesn’t have anything he’s passionate about. While you don’t have to suck up to your teachers or go on and on about how much you love gym class, you should act like you’re actually alert and happy to be where you are, so that people want to be around you. Complaining, sleeping in class, or just talking about how you have better things to do won’t really win anyone over.


It’s actually much more cool to care about the parts of school that you really love, and to make a name for yourself in them, whether you’re a history buff or president of the Student Council. If you don’t care about anything except cutting class, people won’t know who you are.

, Cool and popular people aren’t actually mean to everyone except the other people they determine to be “cool.” Instead, they make a point of talking to everyone around because they’re friendly, outgoing, and like to get to know people. Besides, your life won’t be very fun or engaging if you’re determined to ignore almost every person you know because you deem them to be not cool enough for you. Instead, make a point of saying hi, striking up a conversation, or just generally being kind to everyone around you unless they give you a reason to act otherwise.


The definition of popular is “well-liked.” If you want to be well-liked, then you need to know a lot of different people so that they can like you. If you only talk to 10 people, then, while they may like you fine, you wouldn’t be well-liked by all.
If you put people down or are just mean to people who you think are unworthy, then you’ll come off as insecure.

, You may think that people who are cool and popular only tend to talk to the other five cool and popular people in their grade, but that’s far from the truth. In fact, people who are actually cool and popular are comfortable talking to people they don’t know because they’re confident in who they are and are always looking for ways to make their life even more fun and exciting. Whether there’s a new girl in town or you want to get to know a guy in your math class, making the effort to talk to new people will go a long way in making you cool and popular.


Just say hi and introduce yourself when the time is right. Most people will be happy to talk to someone new, especially if they don’t know anybody.
If a new person seems shy or quiet, don’t mistake this as rudeness. It can take longer for some people to open up than others.

, Another way to be cool and popular is to show a genuine interest in people. You can do this by asking them simple questions like what their favorite classes are or what their plans are for the summer. Demonstrate a real interest in getting to know them, their interests, and their everyday thoughts and they will be impressed by how caring and kind you are. Though you shouldn’t interview people and not reveal anything about yourself, you should work to maintain a balance between getting to know people and talking about yourself.


The fact of the matter is, most people love to talk about themselves, even if they need to be prodded a little. If you get them talking about their favorite subject, then they will like you, and you will therefore become more popular.
Of course, you shouldn’t just ask people questions to make them like you. You should work on genuinely caring about getting to know people.

, People who are truly cool and popular don’t need to brag about themselves because they’re already happy and confident in who they are and know that other people can tell without them having to say so. You can talk about the things you love to do without mentioning how great you are at French, skiing, or winning debates. There’s nothing people hate more than a show-off, and talking about how great you are will only make people think the opposite. Besides, self-promotion is not cool. Modesty is.


If you’re really good at something, then other people will find out, whether they see it for themselves, hear it from your friends, or read about the goal you kicked in the school paper. Trust that your successes will come through and that you don’t need to broadcast them.
Instead of talking about how good you are at something, take the time to compliment other people, whether they are on your debate team or your football team.

, If you want to be cool and popular, you should be outgoing and fun to talk to, but you also shouldn’t completely dominate conversations. The truth is, people care a lot more if you’re interested in them than if you’re interesting, so you should focus more on making them feel like interesting people and letting them talk instead of rambling on and on as an attempt to look cool. Of course, you shouldn’t speak in one-word sentences, either, but you should make sure that other people feel comfortable talking to you if you want them to like you and to think you’re cool.


Whenever you’re having a conversation with someone, try not to do more than 50% of the talking. Nobody likes to stand there and hear a person go on and on.
If you’re in a group setting, try not to dominate the conversation. Let at least three people speak before you tell another story or make another long comment. Though you shouldn’t monitor yourself every second of the conversation, you should be aware of not taking over.

, Another way to be cool and popular is to actually connect with people by finding common bonds. You don’t have to have everything in common, but you should find a way to talk about things you and the person you’re talking to cares about, from your love for Drake to your mutual affection for the Oakland A’s. When you come up to talk to a person you know, try to think of something you both care about, from a teacher you like to poke fun at to an after-school activity you do together. If you focus on these points of interest, people will feel like they have more to say to you.


Get to know your audience when you talk to people. The brainy girl from your English class may want to talk to you about books or films, while the sporty guy on your baseball team may want to talk about the Mets game instead.
Learn to read body language. If the person you’re talking to is shifting on his feet, checking his phone, or responding in one-word answers, then he or she may want to change the topic to something that you both care about.

, It’s one thing to be a socialite who knows everyone by name, and another to actually get to know people. While it’s great to know a lot of people and to be friendly to them, it’s also nice to actually take the time to know what goes on inside their heads. Though you can’t get to know everyone, take the time to really listen to people when they do talk to you, whether they’re telling you about their weekend plans, their worries about their grades, or about what they’re wearing to the school dance. People who are cool and popular actually care about people, and stand out because they can make anyone feel special.


When someone is trying to tell you something, nothing else should matter. Put away your phone, stop looking around, and look into their eyes as they tell you what they have to say.
Avoid interrupting or giving your opinion until the person is done talking.
Focus on listening to the person on his or her own terms, instead of comparing the situation or experiences to something that happened to you. If you find yourself saying, “That sounds just like my break up…” then you’re not really listening.

, If you really want to be cool and popular, then you shouldn’t have to put people down just to make yourself look awesome. In fact, being mean to people, especially people who don’t have a lot of friends and who are looked down upon, is one of the lowest, most pathetic things you can do. If you want people to truly respect you and to feel like you’re a kind person, then you can’t go around demeaning people. It won’t make you look good or cool at all, but like a person who is so insecure that he needs to bring other people down to feel better. That is decidedly not cool.


If you hang out with people who regularly put other people down, then it may be time to find some new friends. First, though, talk to your friends to see if they are willing to change the behavior.

, One way to be cool and popular is to join a sports team, if you are so inclined. Of course, if you have two left feet and completely hate sports, then there’s no need to torture yourself. But if you’re interested in sports or have been pretty good at baseball, soccer, or tennis in the past, then joining a sports team can help you make new connections, gain leadership abilities, and work well with others. All of these skills will help you become more cool and popular.


Joining a sports team will also let you meet a lot of cool people who you might not get to meet in your classes. It’ll help you expand your social network, and people who are truly cool and popular have a wide social circle.

, Another way to expand your social network and to be cool and popular is to meet people through clubs. You can join the Student Council, the school paper, the school yearbook, or a variety of other clubs that let you explore your interests. You’ll get to meet a variety of new people and will be able to bond over a shared interest. Talking about something you actually love? Now that’s definitely cool.


You may also meet a different type of person in some of your clubs than you would while being part of a sports team. Being friends with a variety of people helps you learn how to talk to almost anyone and can help you become more well-known.

, You may not think there’s anything cool about getting involved in a tutoring program at your local library or volunteering at a soup kitchen every other Sunday. However, being active in your community, whether you’re campaigning for a local politician whose cause you believe in or you’re cleaning up a local park, will help you get to know a variety of people of a variety of different ages. You’ll be building your character while learning to interact with a wider swath of people — and that is definitely cool.


If you’re involved in your community, you may even gain experience talking to older people, which is a valuable skill that can help you become more mature and knowledgeable. These people may have a thing or two to teach you about what it really means to be cool.

, If you want to be cool and popular, then you should try to expand your area of interests. While it’s great to be the football captain, you would be exposing yourself to a lot of similarly-minded people if you follow that route. If you really want to be cool and popular, then you can join the football team, but also make time for yearbook or volunteering. Of course, you don’t want to put too much on your plate, but you also don’t want to spend your life only associating with one type of person, either.


Maintaining a variety of interests can help you meet a number of interesting people. Once you befriend them, you should also work on expanding your social circle and hanging out with those people at non-club or sports related activities.
Joining a club, a sports team, or a community network can also help you find your talents and develop them. Having a talent is very cool indeed.

Choose cleansers that are advertised as “gentle,” “pH-balanced,” or “fragrance-free.” These cleansers won’t damage or dry out your skin.Next, use an oil-free lotion to moisturize your skin.


If necessary, use a pair of tweezers to shape your eyebrows before putting on makeup.
If you have problems with acne, use an oil-free acne cleanser to wash your face.;
, Use natural tones and a light hand when applying makeup. First, apply a layer of tinted moisturizer to even out your skin tone. Next, enhance your features by applying a natural tone of blush to the apples of your cheeks, lining your lashes with brown mascara, and using a clear lipgloss.Some people prefer to use BB Cream instead of tinted moisturizer. BB Cream has a slightly heavier coverage that smooths out any blemishes or wrinkles.If you have a lot of blemishes and need a heavy coverage, use foundation instead of tinted moisturizer.

, You can either touch up your daytime makeup or apply makeup to a fresh face. After applying your foundation or tinted moisturizer, buff the apples of your cheeks with a natural tone of blush. Next, add some dramatic eye makeup and bold lipstick to finish the look.For example:


Add interest to your existing eyeshadow by darkening your creases with a black or dark brown. Blend the color onto your lids.
Choose a bright red lipstick to enhance your lips.
Use liquid eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, and mascara to create a cat eye look.


, First, separate your hair into sections using clips or hair ties. Blow dry each section separately, using a large hairbrush to pull the wet hair away from your head.If you’re worried about heat damage, apply a heat-protecting leave-in conditioner to your hair before drying it., If you’re in-between washings or if your hair looks slightly oily, dry shampoo can be used to give your hair a fresh lift. First, shake the can of dry shampoo to incorporate the ingredients. Next, hold the can a few inches away from your scalp and spray the shampoo along your hairline. Separate your hair into several large sections and continue spraying your scalp.After applying the dry shampoo, rub it into your hair using your fingertips and brush your hair again.
Dry shampoo can also come in a powder form. However, powdered dry shampoo is more difficult to apply and can leave a powdery residue in your hair.

, Daytime hairstyles will usually be more relaxed than evening updos. Choose a style for your hair that makes you feel comfortable and cute. For example, if you’re feeling lazy and relaxed, use a hair band to style your hair into an adorable top knot bun. Other examples of cute hair styles:



Apply pomade to the ends of short hair to add texture.
Tie your hair into a low knot to create a cute, effortless low bun.
Style your hair into an elegant side braid.

Pull your hair into a high, sleek pony tail., Whether you’re going out with friends or going on a date, your evening hairstyle needs to add drama to your look. If you have long hair, you can style it into a beautiful updo or brush it out. Brush shorter hairstyles away from the face and spray them with hairspray to create a clean, sleek look.



Curl long or medium hair using a curling iron, a brush, and hair spray.

Straighten your hair with a straightening iron and a wide-toothed comb to create a sleek hairstyle.
Short hair can be curled with a small curling wand to create ringlets.

, Find out which colors look good on you by figuring out your skin’s undertones. First, look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If these veins appear blue, your skin has cool undertones. If these veins appear green, your skin has warm undertones.Cool undertones look best with silvers, blues, cool greens, greys, and other wintery colors.
Warm undertones look best with golds, rich greens, reds, and other earthy colors.

, Wear clothing that makes your body shape look it’s best. For example, if you have a pear body shape, wear shirts that accentuate the upper part of your body with patterns or frills. These shirts will balance out your figure and make you appear more curvaceous.


If you have an hourglass figure, wear clothing that accentuates the small part of your waist.
If you have an inverted triangle body type, wear clothing that gives volume to your hips. This clothing includes layered skirts and large belts.
If you have a rectangular or “ruler” body shape, wear short skirts and dresses that show off your legs., If you feel attractive in your clothing, you will feel and look more confident.For example, if you like the way a particular skirt looks on you, wear it often. Alternatively, if you have a pair of pants that you feel weird in, don’t wear them. You’ll look as uncomfortable as you feel.


Avoid clothing that is physically uncomfortable. The discomfort will only grow as the day goes on.

, Accessories can make old, worn out outfits feel fresh and new again. Accessories are any part of your outfit that isn’t clothing. Jewelry, scarves, handbags, and belts are all examples of accessories. When building your outfit, choose accessories that accentuate your clothing.For example:


Highlight the golden tones in a green dress by wearing a large gold bracelet.
Wear a chunky red necklace with a black and white shirt to create a bright contrast.
Enhance the simplicity of a shift dress by wearing several large rings.

, Bathe or shower every day using mild soap, warm water, and a loofa or washcloth.People with very short hair, very oily hair, or who sweat a lot should wash their hair daily.Otherwise, wash your hair two or three times a week to keep your hair healthy.


If you wash your hair too often, you’ll strip away helpful oils that make your hair shiny and soft.
If you have long hair, use a conditioner after shampooing to hydrate the ends of your hair.

, There is no specific age at which you should start wearing deodorant. However, if you’re concerned about your body odor and you want to smell fresh, consider applying deodorant after you shower. Read the directions on the back of the deodorant to see how it should be applied.


You can buy a stick of deodorant that is rubbed against your underarms or spray-on deodorant.

, Brush your teeth at least twice a day to keep your teeth healthy and your breath fresh. Use a clean toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth. Additionally, floss once a day to help prevent gum disease.Avoid eating sugary foods to prevent cavities from forming on your teeth.
If you have any concerns about your teeth, visit your dentist.

, A part of looking fresh is having clean, well-groomed nails. First, wash your hands after using the bathroom, touching something dirty, or petting an animal. Use a small nail brush and soap to clean dirt out from under your nails. Alternatively, use a toothpick or small wooden wand to remove dirt from under your nails.


Keep your nails trimmed to avoid snagging them on your clothing or scratching yourself.

Paint your nails to add a pop of color to your look. Additionally, nail polish can hide any stubborn stains on your nails.

Start by making basic healthy decisions in your everyday life, and take it from there. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can demonstrate maturity and responsibility, which are attractive traits to a potential mate.Studies show that 12% body fat in men, and 20% body fat in women is a good goal to strive for. In men, a 12% body fat ratio increases testosterone levels and boosts immune system.Women have more body fat than men, and at a 20% ratio, a women's curves are more defined.
Eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to become more vibrant while you diet. Fruits and vegetables are loaded with antioxidants and plant-based pigments, which give skin a healthy glow.;
, No matter how groomed you are, or how much make-up you wear, studies have shown that sleep deprived people look less healthy, more tired, and overall less attractive.


Aim to get 8 hours of sleep each night to fight off red eyes, and other symptoms of sleep deprivation.

, Showers solve most problems. Brush and floss your teeth regularly. Comb your hair. Get regular haircuts. Keep your nails clean. Smell nice. Scent is a strong influencer on attractiveness. Personal hygiene is very important.

, Health is a huge contributor to overall attractiveness. You will automatically look more attractive if you look both emotionally and physically healthy.In addition to your diet and exercise, meditation is a powerful tool to relax your mind, lower stress hormones, improve you mood, and clear your skin.


Whether it's meditation (focus on your breath), mindfulness (focus on the now), or just paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, these practices will lead you to embody a sense of calm and ease.
It's a slight shift with a big impact. Train yourself to be here now and watch how others respond to your aura of grace.

, Open body language can be more attractive than any outfit. You can use your body language to convey availability and attractiveness.


Don’t cross your arms, don’t check your phone in front of your chest, and don’t hug your purse or hold your glass of wine at your canter. Each of these can convey a closed off, unavailable person.

, Generally, when we can’t see someone’s hands, we have difficulty in trusting them. Research shows that a person’s most attractive trait is their availability.When you are socializing, show people that you want to connect with them by keeping your posture open and available.


Don’t put your hands in your pockets, under the table, or in your coat. People may be less likely to open up to you if they can't see your hands.

, It's incredible how important, yet simple this one is. When we smile, we automatically become more approachable, more interesting, and friendlier. Smiling is a huge tool in attractiveness.Smile at people you see, most of them will smile back.

, Good eye contact can communicate more than words. Through eye contact you can express that you are engaged, listening, and in the present. You can show that you care about the individual you are looking at.


Avoid looking down or shifting your gaze. This can show that you are uninterested.
Sometimes too much eye contact can come off as creepy or weird. Practice holding eye contact for a second longer than you normally would and focus on something, like the color of the persons eyes. This kind of eye contact is more personable.

, Wear clothes that fit you well and flatter your figure. Studies have shown that wearing red can increase your attractiveness to a potential mate.Ladies, put on a red dress or wear a little red lipstick.
Men who grow a light beard are considered more attractive to some. If you grow facial hair, be sure to keep it well groomed., Keep your head up and your eyes forward. By walking with a confident stance, you will begin to feel more comfortable within yourself.This is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to become more attractive. Simply stand a little taller.

, Encourage others to talk about themselves. Shine the spotlight on them. Give them your full attention and appreciation by focusing only on them. When we let people talk about themselves, it triggers pleasure responses in their brain.Put your stuff away. Don't check your phone. Don't glance at your monitor. Don't focus on anything else, even for a moment.

, Ask them about positive things in their life. When they reply, ask them how they are feeling about life in general. Since you’ve already gotten a positive answer to the first question, you are more likely to get a positive answer to the second one, leading to a positive overall experience with you.


Become memorable and attractive through the way you let them express themselves to you.

, The words you use can have a huge impact on how you come across to others.Avoid being negative as much as possible. Prioritize positive words over negative ones. We all associate happy, enthusiastic, and fulfilled people with attractiveness. Say things like:


""I believe in you."" These four short words can have a huge impact on how people feel both about themselves and about you.
""How can I help?"" Offering assistance doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to help some, but often we cannot accomplish things alone. Saying this will show someone you are an ally.
""Here's what's happening."" No one wants to be left out. If you make an effort to include everyone, they will associate a positive connection with you. Share the information you have to become more likable. You can also use this phrase to demonstrate decisiveness in a positive way.
""I'll find out.""
""You're welcome."" Somewhere down the road we stopped saying, ""You're welcome"" and started saying ""yep,"" and ""no problem."" Saying the former establishes that you have done a worthwhile favor, whereas the latter shows that what you have done was insignificant. Use the former to show a person how much you care.

, Laugh easily. Playfulness, as a personality trait can bring a bunch of positivity to your life and the lives of others. Not only can playfulness help reduce stress levels, but it will also help you appear more confident and comfortable.


Take care to tease lightly and play close attention to the other people around you. No matter what your intentions, playfulness isn't attractive if you end up hurting someone's feelings.
There is a time and place for playfulness. If you are in a professional environment, where playfulness is generally not encourages, save it for when you leave work. However, you can still exercise kindness and warmth.

, Slowing down your speech can actually make you more interesting to others. This gives them a chance to digest what you are saying. Speaking slower also demonstrates confidences and a relaxed state, while speaking quickly might make you look overly excited, eager, or nervous.


Especially if you are nervous, practice speaking slow. This will help you remain calm, and maintain control.
You are also less likely to stumble over your words if you speak slowly.

Don't try to change your voice.",How to Be Cute and Sweetly Innocent," Rudeness isn't a cute trait and should be destroyed; like that frown on your face! Smiling immediately makes a person seem warmer and more inviting to talk to. Work on smiling in public until it comes naturally! Not a huge, toothy grin, but a quaint curve of the lips.;
, When you accept something from another person (be it an object or even a compliment), say 'Thank you' with a warm smile. When you do the same to another person and they say it to you, return them a 'You're welcome'. These are basic mannerisms, but are important to remember. Good manners are essential. Not only are they cute, but give a good impression too!

, Cussing simply isn't lady-like. If it's become a habit, you can try replacing certain curse words with things like ""Fiddlesticks!"" or ""Bother!"". Not only are they fun and old-timey, but they can be cute too; when used sparingly.

, Innocence means not knowing of impure things. This doesn't mean you can't laugh at a joke or two, nor does it mean that you have to flush your mind of everything you already know. All you have to do is involve yourself less if possible.

, It's polite and makes a person feel special if you've only bumped into them a couple of times. If you honestly can't remember, don't guess! If you say the wrong name, it can be extremely awkward and make the person feel unimportant.

, A selfless attitude tells you a lot about a person. Become willing to share things with friends to make them feel special. Food (especially snacks such as potato chips), clothes and video games are ideal to friends who may be in need or simply ask. Sometimes, people don't understand that loan doesn't mean donation. If a person has kept an item of yours longer than you believe is necessary, politely ask them about it. You have the right to do so.

, This article is not going to go into detail on how to specifically do 'cute' make-up, simply because everyone has their individual preferences, skin tones and budgets. Some people believe they have to cake their face with make-up to look good, but that simply isn't true. Some 'nude' lip gloss (which blends with your actual skin) can make for a very cute look; simply because it's natural - which is what should be achieved. For a fresh look, try applying pink blush to the apples of your cheeks!

, If you're an adolescent, you should wear antiperspirant deodorant for obvious reasons. But if you choose not to, perfume or a sweetly scented body spray make for the perfect replacement. Fruity fragrances work well for an odor that isn't too strong and they fit the cuteness theme!

, The first thing that comes to many peoples' minds when it comes to cute ways to hold up hair is in pigtails, which can suit some people, but it can make you seem like you're trying too hard. A ponytail accessorized with a ribbon tied around it, side ponytail, messy bun and plaits are traditionally cute ways to tie up hair! Headbands, scrunchies and barrettes are especially good. Anything with bows or chibi cartoon characters is perfect.

, Making your voice high-pitched and squeaky to mimic little kids or anime characters is obvious and gets annoying quickly. No matter how you sound, your voice is fine the way it is. This also applies to height. Short people aren't the only cute ones; many tall girls are adorable!

You'll feel so much better about yourself, and sexier! Listen in class! It might be hard to not listen to all the whispering in the room about the latest gossip, but you need to get good grades. School is just the beginning of your life, you will regret not having gone to college or getting good grades later on in life.

, Get a good sleeping routine, there should be just 2 nights a week you stay up a few more hours, which is Friday and Saturday! You need at least 8 hours of sleep to be a sexy teen girl. So if you have to wake up at 5:00, go to sleep at 8:45. Have a sleeping routine, like you read 15 minutes before going to sleep. An example: turn all your lights off, shut the door, lay in bed and watch TV for 30 minutes. Then read or listen to quiet music until you fall asleep.

, Do your hair, makeup, and get a nice, cute outfit on! Maybe even take a quick shower if all you're going to do is blow dry your hair and throw it in a bun.

, Put some concealer over your spots, and under your eyes, and then some setting powder. Then a little bit of a neutral eyeshadow over your lid, and a little mascara, and a little bit of eyeliner. Don't put too much on!! Make it look natural. Make-up is not supposed to cover your face. If you're going to a party or something, make a sexy smoky eye, just some lip gloss and mascara.

, Get 10 of your favorite different hairstyles. Don't make them extremely hard to do! It'll just make you more noticeable if you have your hair different every day. Here are some hairstyles: scrunched hair in a high, messy bun, straight hair, down, a braid in your hair, a preppy high side ponytail, a straight messy bun with a headband, a low-carefree bun, curl it, a headband, a side ponytail, straighten your hair and put it in a high ponytail, put your bangs down, leave your hair down and clip your bangs back. You can do any of those hairstyles, or even more! Be creative with your hair, and make it cute, and different every time, the same old hairstyle will make people bored with you! If you have short hair, put a cute clip or a headband in to make it sexy!

, This will make you seem instantly sexy because people think you have other things to do than just sit around and make yourself look good all day. People will respect you for it, because they know you will not give up doing it for anybody. Maybe join volleyball or cheer-leading, or paint, or draw. Have fun with whatever you do!

, Don't be a flirt, just flirt with those you find attractive. Always smile at them. Avoid flirting with people you don't find attractive, or they will consider you fake.

, Put funny facebook statuses, Don't get into drama, be happy, help people, start a blog if you want. Just have fun!

, Confidence is sexy! Walk through life with your head held high, no matter if you're sad or not. It will help you not attract bullies or haters, and it makes you look good, and feel better about yourself. Be positive, don't say anything negative about other people. If your friends are talking about someone and making fun of them and ask you what you think of her, just smartly say ""I don't talk about people, I don't really even know her so it's not my place to say anything.."" They'll respect you for that, but do not go tell that girl they were talking about her. Keep secrets and be trustworthy!

, Don't be mean to people, but if people are starting nasty rumors about you,and ruining your reputation, you have to know how to have good comebacks, and get them to stop. Go up to one of them, look them in the eye (that's intimidating) and say ""Look, I barely know you. I don't know why you hate me so much, but don't you have anything better to do than sit around talking about me all day?"" and bring a friend with you. If they tell the principal or anything you have someone to back you up. They'll probably just say something like ""I haven't been talking about you"" and just be like ""Hmm, okay?"" and smile, then walk away. Whatever you do, don't be mean back! Be mean in a nice way, which means no yelling, and good comebacks. Be calm, and pretend you don't even care about them! Always seem to be confident during the entire process.

, You can get really popular by just saying ""Hey, I love your shoes! Where did you get them?"" Start a conversation with everyone! Be nice!

Media.","How to Be an ""It"" Girl"," Whether or not you actually have confidence in yourself, act as if you have plenty and it'll automatically show through. Practice this at school and with your friends by smiling naturally and waving to people you know and saying, ""Hi"". Excellent posture - shoulders back, tummy in, and your butt very slightly out - while moving gracefully will also help maintain and boost that confidence in yourself. However, make sure your smiles aren't fake and that you don't look clumsy.;
, Don't be too soft or too loud. It's annoying to ask people to repeat what they said, or to have to cover your ears when you're next to them. If you have trouble talking in class or to others, spend 10-25 minutes in front of a mirror talking to yourself and practicing conversation. Although this method might sound strange, it'll boost your confidence in speaking naturally with others.


Avoid having a baby voice.

, Believe it or not, pretty girls can be nice, and guys always end up basing you on your personality. Treat those who aren't your friends neutrally, but do not be too nice or mean to them. This way, no one will be able to say that you were ever mean to them, and students will start looking up to you as a nice person. When given compliments, accept it gracefully and don't forget to give people genuine compliments as well!


If someone says particularly awkward, such as ""You're hot"", quickly say, ""Thanks"" with a pleasant smile and be on with it. Don't let it slow you down, for the person meant it to be nice - not mean.
Be friendly and look approachable. You want to be the girl people want to be with, so smile and laugh a lot. Laugh funny jokes, but be careful about laughing too much or people will think you're faking it to look good. Show teachers and older authorities respect, and never be too pushy or annoying.
Remind yourself of the old, good rule: If you can't say anything nice, don't say it at all!

, If someone comes up with one about you, shake it off and ignore it. Although it might be hard, it'll be worth it in the end. If someone questions you about it, simply tell him/her in a firm, but polite voice that the rumor isn't true and leave him/her to create his/her own conclusions. Avoid exploding and cursing in public if you have anger issues, for a cursing, bad-tempered girl is not attractive.


If someone insults you, laugh it off. That person is only trying to make you feel bad about yourself and if you feel hurt, you're letting him/her win. If you give the mean person no reaction, he/she will find you boring to insult and won't bother you.
Know how to stand up for yourself without offending or hurting anyone with insults.

, Even if people won't be able to see how obedient and kind you are to your parents, your parents will remember this for years to come. Plus, if you show that you can be responsible daily, they will extend your freedoms and privileges. Spend quality time with your parents, but make sure to have time for yourself and your other wants.

, However, don't speak more than you need to, but make sure you contribute to conversations to keep them going comfortably. End the conversation at an appropriate time while it's still interesting, but avoid stretching it out until it hits the awkward silence. If you leave before the awkward silence hits, the person you converse with will look forward to the next conversation and think of you as a fun person to talk to.


Avoid using chat speak in real life. If you want to say ""LOL"", why not just laugh? Keep the chat speak for texting and emailing.

, Although you may not gossip, your friends certainly will! Familiarize yourself with everything that's going on in school. Having connections and the ability to contact your friends outside of school is wise, whether it's texting, calling, Facebook, emailing, Myspace, Twitter, etc. However, even if you do listen to your friends' gossip, make sure you do not spread the gossip any further, but keep it to yourself.


Give out your phone number to only people you know and trust.
Put your Facebook on the best privacy settings to prevent rumors or gossip from getting through. Don't add people you don't know or that don't go to your school.

If you're not sure if the person goes to your school or not, leave his/her friend request alone and refer to a few friends about it.



, It doesn't necessarily have to be a clique, but make sure it consists of a small group of close friends that you can get together and have good conversations with. Frequently text them and remain in contact with them. However, you can have plenty of other friends too - don't be afraid to branch out!


Branching out can be important. In case one of your friends betrays you or stops being your friend, you'll have your other friends to turn to, even if they're not as close as you were with your old friend.
Stay out of friend drama.
It's recommended you have one best friend that is the very best of all your friends. Make sure you can tell all your secrets to this friend without her blurting them out. She should also be able to trust you and tell you all her secrets as well.
Avoid being nosy, rude, lying, gossiping, and backstabbing your friends. It's very unclassy and it kills the mood.

, Have you ever been in a situation where you're having a great time, when someone comes along and says something that totally puts a damp cloth over everything? It's extremely irritating! Shy away from negative people, but don't be rude to them while avoiding them. Subtly move away or politely excuse yourself an appropriate time if a negative person joins in your conversation with your friends. However, if you can't escape, make a nice comment that subtly hints to the negative person that he/she needs to change.


If you are a negative person, change yourself and look on the bright side of everything, but don't be completely oblivious too. Look at the glass as half-full instead of half-empty or you'll become pessimistic! Know what to feel like and say at the right times without sounding awkward or hurting anyone. Laugh and smile a lot, for it boosts your health and increases your happiness!
If worse comes to worse and you cannot escape the negative person, deal with him/her as nicely and politely as you can until you can make your getaway.
When avoiding negative people, make sure you are doing it subtly and that it isn't obvious.

, Choose your activities and hobbies based on your likes and talents. Don't listen to what others say or care about what they think about you. If you're an artist and artists aren't popular in your school, do not let that prevent you from taking an art class that you really want to participate in. If you shy away from activities or classes that you like but people don't like, you're merely prohibiting yourself from living a happy life and you're letting others' thoughts and opinions take control of you. That is not cool and you'll need to learn to let go of it all.


Learn that people's opinions and thoughts shouldn't affect your likes and dislikes. You are you and you won't be able to please everyone in life.
Do not brag or show off your talent, for this is cocky and self-centered. You may not realize it, but you may be putting others down and making them feel bad about themselves when you do this. Even if you brag to make you feel better about yourself, you may not be helping others' self-esteem.

, If you don't take a sport, at least participate in gym class. However, it's perfectly fine if you're not a good athlete, as not everyone can be a marathon runner, but at least aim to do a decent job and have a good, reachable goal (ex: ""I'll run the mile under eleven minutes this time!""). Good athlete or not, you should get at least thirty minutes of exercise every single day. To get your body moving while having fun, participate in exercising activities with your friends, such as chasing them or playing a sports game together.

, Study hard and strive to get good grades while keeping yourself organized. Although you don't have to be a straight-A student, at least get decent grades to make you, your parents, and your teachers proud. Remember that your future career will depend heavily upon the amount of education you receive when you're younger. If you splurge your time on video games and other fun activities that are free from homework and education, you're basically throwing away your opportunity to live a comfortable life in the future with a good career that keeps you balanced financially. Do all you can to make sure you get a good education now so that you won't have to pay for the time you wasted later in the future.


Keeping a planner - or using one provided by your school - to record special events, due assignments, and tests is highly recommended. Even if it doesn't seem to work, planners will help keep you organized and on top of your work.
Use binders to organize your notes, homework, and tests/quizzes. Some schools might require you to hand in a folder or small binder of your work every quarter or marking period. Keeping your papers organized now will help you be able to find them easily when you need them.

Schools will usually require you to study off of past papers for your finals. Do not throw away your papers once you receive them or you may be in trouble.
If you find that you're missing a paper that you need to study off of, copy a friend's or another student's paper.


Organize your school supplies, papers, and books into one backpack while making sure you don't overstuff your backpack. For example: You could keep unneeded books in your locker instead of bringing them home.
If possible, complete your homework assignments ahead of time. This way, you can get them out of the way and focus on larger projects or other assignments. This also applies for tests - start studying a little bit of the information every day ahead of time. That way, all you'll have to do on the night before the test is review the information instead of cramming!
Don't be afraid to ask your teachers or parents for help if needed. They are there to guide and help you, not humiliate you. If you find that you need additional help, it's recommended that you find a tutor or another student who would be willing to help you.

It isn't recommended that you ask a friend who will distract you to tutor you, for you'll want to have your attention on grades, not on the hot guy in your class.



, Have a good sense of hygiene and take good care of your body. Not only will this boost your health, but it will also give you an attractive appearance that people won't be able to help but notice. You can achieve this by doing the following:


Take a daily shower, even if you want to do nothing but fall into bed and sleep. This will make sure you smell good and also wash the grime and dirt from your body. Use an effective, good-smelling soap to be sure you actually clean yourself.

Get a good-smelling body wash and matching moisturizing body lotion to boost your hygiene and make your shower time more enjoyable.


Have an excellent face-care routine:

Use a cleanser that matches your face type (dry, oily, normal, or combination skin) while making sure it isn't too strong or too weak.
Wash off the cleanser with lukewarm water.
Apply a toner to your face. This will close up and tighten the pores on your face, eliminating the possibilities of dirt clogging up your pores and making your skin feel refreshed.
Follow up with a good moisturizer to keep your skin moist. However, do not avoid moisturizing your pimples, for your pimples will need the moisture in order to heal. Beware of over-moisturizing.


If you have acne, purchase a good concealer and a natural acne-treatment product to remove the acne naturally and smoothly. Avoid ingredients with chemicals, for chemicals are harsh on your skin.

Before trying new products on your face, always rub a little bit on your arm as a test. If the skin on your arm breaks out, starts to get itchy, or forms a rash, you may be allergic to the product.
Never try a bunch of products at once, even if your skin isn't allergic to them. You'll want to slowly ease the products into your daily face routine so that your skin can get used to the new ingredients it is being introduced to. This will also make sure you know which product is causing your skin a bad reaction if you break out.


Wear sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher on your face. For your body, apply sunscreen of SPF 45 or higher. Be sure you use an amount the size of a golf ball to keep your skin completely protected!

Do not tan in the sun, for it will give you more wrinkles when you get older and wrinkles aren't attractive.


Shave your leg hair and invest in a good razor. However, if you're not allowed to shave, keep your legs moisturized and do not be ashamed of them! Everyone is different and just because you can't shave doesn't mean you're less pretty.
Wax facial hair if you're allowed to (eyebrows, mustaches, etc.) or get a pair of tweezers. However, if you've never waxed or plucked facial hairs before, get a professional to do it for you. You could also ask your parents or a friend to help you.

When plucking your eyebrows, shape them by studying the natural arch. Make sure you don't make your eyebrows too thick or thin.
It isn't recommended that you wax your facial hairs on your own without a professional's guidance, for this could go disastrous. However, plucking facial hairs with tweezers is safer.


Keep your nails at an appropriate length. Clean the dirt and grime out of them regularly. Although you don't have to go to the spa to get a manicure and/or pedicure done, you can do this if you want or you could give yourself one at home.

When painting your nails, avoid purchasing bright neon colors, as these shades rarely match outfits. Instead, get something similar to a classic French manicure.



, Massage an effective shampoo that matches your hair type into your scalp before rinsing it out and applying a conditioner. Keep in mind that some conditioners require you to leave it in your hair for a few minutes in order for it to work, while other conditioners might not require that. After the conditioner has settled in, rinse it out with cold water to lock in moisture and shine. Avoid blow drying your hair too often, but try letting your hair air-dry instead, for this is a healthier and more natural choice for your hair. When arranging your hair into flattering hairstyles, be sure the type of hairstyle you choose won’t pull on your scalp or harm your hair in any way. Make sure the hairstyle matches your face type and complements it, and keep in mind that while certain hairstyles might appear flattering on others, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will look as good on you.


Some hairstyles you can try are sexy bedhead curls, amazing waves, half ponytails, buns, scrunched hair, clipped-back bangs, side bangs, fishtail braids, and ponytails.
Main face shapes are: heart, diamond, square, oval, and circle.

Heart-shaped faces have a round face with a pointed chin.
Diamond-shaped faces have a sharp forehead and chin with cheeks that jut out a little.
Square-shaped faces have a boxy face with a neat, square jaw.
Oval-shaped faces have a longer face.
Circle-shaped faces are overall round.


Avoid as much heat on your hair as possible, even if this means you can’t straighten your hair every day. Heat is your hair’s worst enemy. The more you apply heat to your hair, the limper, duller, and less manageable your hair will be.

If you must curl or straighten your hair, look up different methods to achieve your desired hair naturally without using heat.
If you must curl or straighten your hair using heat, put in an effective heat protection that won’t dry out your hair.


Limit your hair washing to only three times per week, for overwashing your hair can be an easy mistake to make.

If you have oily hair, wash it four times a week and try switching your shampoo and/or conditioner brand to a different one so that it eliminates the grime building up on your scalp.



, All body types are beautiful and will look even better with clothes that suit them (For example: short girls wouldn't want to stick to flared jeans while no girl who feels fat would want to wear horizontal stripes!). To be an “it” girl, you’ll want to aim for a girly-casual style. Graphic tees (logo shirts and V-necks with cool designs) without store names, cute tops – florals, plaids, solids that are flowy or inspiring – cardigans, vests, solid tees, shorts, Bermudas, camis with or without lace in solid colors and prints, jeans in dark and medium washes, etc.


For jewelry, purchase long, dangly necklace with unique charms, bangles, and diamond studs.
For shoes, have one pair of UGGs or FUGGs (fake UGGs) in either chestnut, black, sand or the brown color. Also, add in some brand of sneakers (Converse, Keds, or Vans in black are trendy). Perhaps you could even throw in some Sperry’s in linen/oat or chocolate. Also, own plenty of flip-flops and good quality tennis shoes.

, You won’t need a lot of makeup, but purchase some dark brown mascara and pencil eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow in a bronze-gold shade, and blush that goes with your skin type. You could also purchase some lip balm or clear lip gloss to prevent chapped or cracked lips. To apply your makeup:


Using your eyeliner, start the middle of the top eyelid. Make the liner thicker as you get to the end of the eye. Gently trace a line on the outside of your eye to make your eyes appear wider.
Heat up your eyelash curler and clamp it onto both of your eyelashes while slowly counting to five.
Quickly apply your mascara.
Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks. To find the apples of your cheeks, smile.
Apply the eyeshadow to your eyelids.
Apply concealer.
For an extra sparkle, apply a light coat of Vaseline onto your brown bone.
Finish off with lip gloss or lip balm.

, Make it your goal to exercise daily for at least thirty minutes. If you find that you don’t have the time and/or energy to slap in thirty minutes at one go, split the minutes up into three ten-minute sessions. You don’t necessarily have to take sports or a gym class to get in those minutes, but you could also create your own activities that get you moving, such as running in the park with your friends or a variety of mini activities that add up to thirty minutes (ex: jump-roping for five minutes, then running for ten minutes, etc.).

, A trendy ""It"" girl needs to know what's up! She should listen to a radio station of music she likes. Or, if you're really not sure, just listen to a hits radio station so you're in the know of what's at the top of the music charts! Read some magazines like Seventeen, Teen Vogue, and Girl's Life. Don't forget to read some real books! Great authors are Nicholas Sparks, Lisi Harrison, Lauren Myracle, Meg Cabot, and Jay Asher. Find some more authors you like.

Aim for contrast.,
Remember body enhancing tights, they work miracles!

,
If you have chosen a skirt, wear a white, black or navy top with a polo shirt look.,
Stay away from bold colors, and focus on monochrome tones.

,
This is where the color comes in.,
Your shoes need to be comfortable and your jewelry needs to be toned down.

All hair types suit this look.,
Frizzy hair can be tied up with bows.",How to Be a Sexy Library Girl1," For example, the bottom section of your body should contrast the top. If you want to show your legs, your going to have to cover up top.


If you want to show legs, choose a dark skirt with a contrasting pattern. Don't be tempted towards the bare legged looks, unless your sure you can pull it off and don't go completely bare, try black socks, or dark legwarmers. If wearing tights, choose a flesh look or dark and slightly see through. The most common look in this area is a tartan skirt with black tights.
If you want to cover up your legs, opt for tight, smart trousers in black or navy blue. Avoid jeans if possible(If wearing jeans, choose skinny blue).
For thin slender women opt for the tartan skirt. For larger or smaller women, trousers are better.;
,, The top can be loose or tight fitting, but a tight fitting top should be worn with a contrasting cardigan or scarf, whereas a loose top can be worn by itself. If you have chosen trousers or jeans,the same rules can be applied, except you can wear a more dramatic and plunging neckline.

,, Shoes need to stay plain in design, but can be colorful. Red or navy blue is very popular. Shorter women can wear slight heels, but stay away from boots of any type, or sandal type shoes. Taller women may wear heels also, but colored pumps are better. Jewelry is not essential and should be plain. Sliver is preferred to gold. Rule out huge or statement jewelry and no ""bling"". Keep to small delicate necklaces or bracelets. Many girls feel the need to wear glasses to pull this look off, but it makes no difference.

,, Brightly colored or obvious dyes are bad, as the idea is to look natural. Let your hair be as it is normally. Hair can be down or tied up, and clips and bows can be added.

Be yourself!",How to Be a Pretty and Preppy Teen," Although Prep is a lifestyle, clothes are a major part. Try stores like Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, J.Crew, Lilly Pulitzer, The North Face,. Always go for quality over quantity. If These stores are out of your price range, that's okay; try finding polos, oxfords, khakis, Bermuda shorts, cardigans,classic-cut jeans,pea coats and sundresses at other stores. Make sure everything is very clean and well fitting.;
, You have to keep your hair well-kept and frizz-free. Wash it at least once every two days. Most preps have very polished straight hair, some have loose waves. Remember: switch it up, don't always wear your hair the same way, and make creative use of ribbons and headbands.

, Always the perfect accessory, a bag completes the outfit, and if you have more than one, you can wear the one that suits the mood you're in. Good ones include Chanel and Coach. Totes are a must and they can come cheap, Classic ones include Longchamp, Tory Burch and Herve Chapelier which come in fun colors, others can be monogrammed and can be bought at Lands End or Vineyard Vines. For school, try carrying a simple bag or purse. Remember anything covered in labels is not preppy, understated is best.

, Most preps wear Eliza B flip flops, or jack rogers sandals during warmer months. However regular leather shoes will do. Boat shoes, moccasins, and flats are the usual type of footwear. Sometimes tall fur boots over jeans on a cold winter day. If heels are worn they are usually a very small heel in a very classic style.Sperry topsiders are very preppy,too,and can be worn year round.

, A little concealer and tinted moisturizer to cover up imperfections, a hint of blush to give you some color, a little mascara and maybe eyeliner if it looks good on you and ChapStick. It's better if you use just mascara and Lip Gloss. If you are a prep, you should start wearing mascara at a good age. 12 or a little before you are 13 would be a good time to start.

, Use an acne treatment even if you have little to no acne, since they also prevent acne. Or use toothpaste, but only put it directly on the acne otherwise it will dry out your skin and produce more oil! If you are looking for good skin care go to a dermatologist, it's worth it. Eat well and drink 3 glasses of water a day. Ignore everyone that says eight glasses is good- you get most of your water from the food you eat!!! The results will show, trust me. If you have acne, don't be hard on yourself. Do what you can but don't feel badly about your skin. Acne doesn't last forever.

, Some sports that are common for preps are field hockey, tennis, lacrosse, golf, crew, sailing, swimming and diving. Some other alternatives are dance(especially ballet) or cheerleading.

, Always chew slowly and eat ONLY when you're hungry and ALWAYS stop when you're full. Eat whatever you want, but in very small portions. br>
, Study hard and get the best grades you can. Always raise your hand if you know the answer, but don't show off. It's alright if you don't know an answer, simply don't raise your hand.

Have nice hair.",How to Be a Pretty 10 Year Old Girl," Confidence is the key to being beautiful.Your personality show a lot more than your looks my friend! .;
, You are going to change rapidly over the next few years, if you aren't already changing. Adapting your sense of self now will take you further than ever. Be proud of who you are, and how you present yourself. So keeping clean, fresh, and coming off as being a polite person will come in handy. Finally, don't let other people get you down.

, Remember, not everyone has the same ideas about what is stylish and what is modest. You can still be pretty even if you can't afford new clothes. A truly pretty 10 year old girl looks pretty in any outfit.


Your clothes should fit, yet should not hug your body too tightly. This can attract negative attention. Wear leggings with short skirts, cute jeans, shorts, and dresses. Wash your clothing once a week, and make sure that they are stain free. Wear any outfit you like if it makes you feel pretty but remember to think pretty thoughts so how pretty you are shows in your eyes whatever you are wearing.

, Be nice to everyone, even if they aren't so nice back. Help old ladies carry their groceries, pick up something a busy mom dropped. Do small deeds for people and you will be thanked, hopefully. If you see something in your house that is out of place, fix it by yourself and don't make a fuss about it.

, Fussing if your tummy is sticking out or you've got really hairy legs is ridiculous! Start worrying about that when your a teen!, Never feel like you have to. Chances are, you're gorgeous anyway and don't need makeup at this age. If your parents let you, you can wear concealer and lip balm. Don't wear eyeliner or mascara, unless you want to, it can make you look older than 10 - this isn't something you necessarily need right now. Also, do not use a handbag, unless you want to. That will make you seem too mature, in some people's eyes. Do what you wish though. Anyone who judges a ten year old for carrying a purse or handbag has issues. There will be plenty of time for this later.

, You're going through changes (or will be soon) and you need to get in the habit of showering daily, brushing twice a day, etc.



Be a neat girl. Have clean nails and make sure there is no dirt under them. Wear clear nail polish if your mom has an issue with you painting your nails. If it's fine with her, choose your favorite colors and ones that match your outfit/personality.







, Eat decent food more often than junk. That does not mean becoming anorexic or too skinny. Too skinny or too fat is unhealthy. You should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, move enough every day to get your heart rate up, and drink plenty of water (this means drink water whenever you are thirsty)! Follow these steps and your skin will have a healthy, natural glow.

, Study hard and if you need help, ask! Be something and make your family proud. If you do well in a test, or get a good school report, they will be very proud of you. Learn as much as you can about the world around you and try to have interesting things to say. No, you won't use everything you learn in school, but think of school as a way to teach you how to learn. It sounds funny, but this is a very useful skill.

, Don't try to be something you are not. You are unique in your own way, and this makes you just as special as anyone else.

Leave the conditioner in for about a minute, and shampoo twice if you have naturally oily hair. Shave your legs, under arms, and bikini line everyday. Wash your face 2-3 times a day to prevent breakouts, and use acne creams and moisturizers day and night. Make sure to brush your teeth and floss twice a day to have glowing teeth!;

Also, if you choose to be sexually active, let it be with a guy you've dated for several months, and BE SAFE! But do realize, sex is NOT necessary for being sexy!!!

, Hang out at the mall, and get some numbers! But don't forget your girls. Go on double dates, or go to a teen club with your best friend. Go get your nails done, (can't go wrong with french tips!)

, People have their own lives to live and will not always have time the time to cheer you up over little things. On the flip side if you're super happy hyper all the time, that's going to be hard to take too. Feel what you need to feel, but not too extremely unless it's for good reason.

, Nobody likes a baby.

, You probably love the limelight but if you chase it, it'll run away from you.

, Reading books, seeing and participating in theatre will really get your inner drama queen going. It can be a really great output.

, There's many different reasons why you weren't picked for the lead. Just accept it and think of reasons in how you can improve. Take acting, singing and/or dancing lessons if you have to. Don't hold anything against the people who did get a good part.

, Acting is all about learning and you can from each and every part you have.

Never,ever, start doing drugs just because your friends are doing it.",How to Turn Cool After Junior High," This means figuring out what you want to do in life, and how you want to achieve it.;
, Be aware of others around you, don't be self-centered.

, Integrity is the most important rule of social interaction. Figure out your ideals, what you think is actually important, and try to act sincerely on a moral instinct. This has nothing to do with religion or self-righteous political views. It means act sincerely on your conscious.


Do not talk behind anyone's back. It will always come back to haunt you. This is the easiest rule. People will notice you are unwilling to sell anyone out or take pleasure in other people's unhappiness and it will inspire trust, and it is good for your heart and guts to not be a gossip.






Do not insult or tease people. Even if you have spent lots of time yourself being belittled and relish the feeling of picking on someone weaker than you, don't. It is not dignified or kind, it shows no self-restraint or discipline.
Do not, however, be afraid to stand up for yourself when someone does, or says something cruel to you. This might sound antithetical to the advice about empathy and keeping your mouth shut, but part of integrity is self respect and being willing to take a risk to defend yourself and other people against intentionally malicious behavior.
If you just meekly slink away, or laugh it off and a bully thinks you are unwilling to stand up for yourself, they will use you again and again as a target. If someone is disrespectful to you, shut them down and shut them down hard; this is the one situation in which I advocate extreme cruelty. Never physical violence, just the absolute meanest and most specific insult you can wrench from the darkest part of your mind.
You know the people you go to school with. You know they all have weaknesses. Just because we're all growing up doesn't mean it isn't still Lord of the Flies out there. Don't show anger, don't cry, don't get flustered, just give them what they have coming, and it is better if it is funny. They won't target you again. This is like karate though, never to be used as attack, only as defense.

, Phoniness is one of the easiest traps to fall into in an attempt to not be a loser. ""Gee, if I just pretend to be into what those dudes are into, I'll be cool!"" No, you will end up looking like an even bigger loser. Copying the clothes, tastes, or slang of someone always makes you look like a poser.


If you like someone's style, or someone's taste in music, there are subtle to ways to integrate things into your own life, but do not wholesale rip anything off insincerely. It is not fun, and it is obvious, especially if you don't know what you're talking about.






Join a club. If you don't like sports, try dance, yearbook,etc. This will allow you to meet more people.

, Physical activity keeps you from getting depressed and pushed your mind away from morbid self-attention. When you are pushed physically, you don't have time or energy to focus on all your flaws or what someone said about you, or how bad you feel.


If you hate teams, try track. If you hate spectator sports, try ski club. If you don't like school organizations, try skateboarding. It helps you develop focus, courage, and confidence and it helps you have a natural bond and conversation topic with teammates. It is also good for your body, and a healthy body looks good.







, Since we have brought up looks, let's talk about dressing and general physical upkeep. For girls or boys, the Internet makes it much easier to buy clothes, in case they don't have your size, or you simply don't like the clothes in stores. Beware of scams though, always be careful when on the Internet.


Don't be fake. Nobody like that. Just be true to yourself, and other people will too.







, Always talk to someone you trust if you have questions or need help.

, This will ruin your life, and affect your family. Just don't do it.

With intense peer pressure, fitness is pretty high up on the priority list for most rich kids. Those habits follow them into adulthood.Group exercise and spin classes are especially popular among the wealthy.;
, Just like exercising is important, eating healthy keeps the body in good condition. Most rich families stay away from junk food.Wealthy families dine out a lot.Make it a habit to eat out on a regular basis, but still order healthy options from the menu whenever possible. Pick a favorite restaurant and suggest that you like to take your rich parents there.
Lots of rich kids eat fast food. It’s harmful to some of your other goals (like staying in shape), but you don’t have to avoid it completely. Feel free to indulge once in a while., Most wealthy families have boutique medical plans that give them 24-hour access to care. Healthcare is important to the rich, so it should be important to you (or, at least, appear to be)., Good skin is a sign of good health and youth, two things the rich value. Get plenty of sleep and avoid activities that will ruin your skin., Grooming habits are important to the wealthy. Stay clean, get regular haircuts, and maintain good hygiene., Walking with confidence shows you’re comfortable with who you are. Conveying a message like that will minimize the chance that other people will ask you questions out of suspicion. Stand up straight, smile at people, and nix any nervousness before you go places., If you can wear designer clothes, that’s ideal (most rich people will be able to spot your knock-offs). Rich kids start wearing designer clothes as toddlers, so familiarize yourself with designers.A good rule is to buy 1/3 of your current clothing items but spend 3 times as much on each item.If you can’t create a wardrobe of designer clothes, make sure you have a lot of formal items.Wear nice clothes out often. Wear them to the market, to restaurants, to coffee dates. You can dress down, but you still want to appear put-together.

, Most rich families grow up in a nice home that’s professionally decorated with a budget in the millions.You don’t need a million-dollar budget, but you will need to make your home presentable.


Many wealthy people decorate their homes with vintage items from flea markets in foreign cities like Paris.Hit the local flea market to see if you can find something with character.
Learn to create things yourself. A little DIY can go a long way. You can find items that you like on a site like Pinterest and recreate them yourself.Adorn your home with items like scented bath soaps, high thread-count linens, and fine dinnerware. These details will be familiar to your guests; they’ll notice it if they’re missing.Don’t be afraid to put pictures up of your family, but make sure they’re either pictures from vacations, or formal family portraits.
If they ask whom your decorator is, tell them it’s a family friend in Malibu (decorator to the stars) who flew out to help you decorate your place.

, A lot of wealthy people love art. They buy pieces and hang them on the walls of their homes and vacation homes. Rich kids grow up learning that this is a strategy of investment.It’s a good idea to know something about the artists of your pieces, just in case someone asks.
If you don’t want to collect art, you can collect something else. Displaying something you’re interested in (like a collection of books) is classy.

, Carrying cash will come in handy when you need to tip the bellboy or valet. It’s also good to have tangible money accessible at all times.

, As far as they know, you’ve been doing this all your life. At least, you can start now. Learn from them; pick up their habits, go where they go.


If you develop a real, close friendship with any of them, it might be time to come clean. If they like you, your status won’t matter to them.Network. If you aren’t actually rich or come from a rich background, it’s not too late. You might land a nice job by knowing the right people.

, You’re trying to put out a specific persona to your social world, so be conscious of the things you’re posting and saying on all your social media accounts. Make sure what you post, and what you do and say in real life, match up.Facebook tagging is the perfect way to name-drop, and “checking in” is a great way to show you know where rich people hang out.

, Rich parents make their kids volunteer from a young age. Volunteering helps you climb the social ladder and look like a philanthropist. Wealthy people love that.Pretend you volunteered when you were young (if you didn’t), or tell stories of volunteering (if you did).
You can also give this vibe by supporting a charity or trust and going to their formal events.Join a country club. The trick here is to make it look like you’ve been in country clubs all your life., Rich kids have hobbies. Their parents put them in music lessons, send them to summer camp, or dressage school.This will also help you find other people in your new circle who share your interests.

, Rich parents spend a lot of time teaching their kids good manners and habits.Showing selflessness will gain you favor in this crowd.When you’re out, always be polite to the service staff, and tip them well., Different classes have different rhetoric. Wealthy kids grow up, on average, better educated.Reading classic literature might help. Most private schools require the classics as required reading.
Test yourself on advanced vocabulary.
Learn any slang your social circle uses.Be ready to tell people where you got your education. Make sure it’s an Ivy League education. Be vague in your descriptions in case they attended that college. Use phrases like, “ugh I’d rather just forget my college days” or “those years are such a haze for me.”

, It’s assumed that those around you already know that you come from a rich family. By drawing attention to this fact, you’re making yourself look suspicious.If someone asks about your past, tell them you don’t like to talk about it.

, Pay for your friends’ meals once in a while. This shows you aren’t stingy. Being generous is a virtue in the rich community. It shows that your rich family taught you good habits."

Pretend you're on the phone with a celebrity like this:


You: Hey, Miley!,
Act on edge when out and about.,
Make celebrity social media pages.,
Play at being a celebrity for a day.,
Follow your fun celebrity day.,
Throw yourself a banquet feast.,
Aim for the inspirational.",How to Pretend You're a Celebrity," The style is entirely up to you but it must look good and be well presented. Even when you're doing celebrity casual dress-down, keep it neat and stylish.;
, This might be jewelry, a scarf, a hat or your shoes. Whatever it is, make it a focal point that you are known for wearing with flair., If you can afford it, have some good quality clothing and accessory from designer labels. The more obvious that it's designer wear, the better.


Check out consignment stores and thrift stores if you want lower priced designer gear.

, You might be outgoing and exuberant, attracted to talking to people everywhere, like many a celebrity. Or, you might be of the mysterious, ""leave me alone"" style of celebrity, who closely guards everything personal and only answers that which really needs to be answered when asked prying questions.


It's probably best to go with your natural personality style unless you're acting in a play or movie. It will be hard to sustain a different personality style for a long time in public.

, Make it clear to others that you're glad to meet them but that you hold center stage. This requires being charming, interesting and witty. Don't spend too long with any one person––be a social butterfly and get around to greeting many people., Your companion has to pretend that she or he is a celebrity, too.

, When you're on the bus or somewhere in public, talk to your companion:


You: So, did you finish shooting the first few episodes of the show you're going to have on Disney Channel?
Friend: Yeah, did you finish that movie you were shooting with Angelina?
You: Yeah, it was fun acting with her.

,, What's up? Meet me after the concert at that restaurant you were talking about. Nick, Joe and Kevin will be there, too!

, Wear sunglasses and look around furtively when leaving cafes and stores. After all, who knows when the paparazzi will show up?


If you're role playing, have someone play at being a pretend paparazzi! Have them chase you with a camera, while you shield your face and run.







, Post tour updates, upcoming movie releases and other celebrity events you're involved in.

, Make a schedule ahead of time for having a fun celebrity day at home. Be sure to have a friend or two join in.

, Here are some suggestions:


Hot tub and fancy drinks (milkshakes, mocktails, smoothies); wear fluffy housecoats when you get out
Have a tasty brunch
Working out or a dance lesson; if you and a friend have different talents, teach one another something new






Having a make-over and manicure
Doing a voice lesson






Doing an acting, singing or dancing routine and film it on video (best done with friends)
Watch yourself in that movie the same night, with popcorn and friends.







, Have lots of exotic fruits and uniquely carved vegetables in salads. Enjoy flavored water for your drink of choice.

, Make a video with a ""celebrity"" friend that aims to inspire others. You could say completely vapid messages, such as: ""Girls, be comfortable with who you are, don't get boob jobs, your shorts are too short! Be more tan!""

Watch it spread!",How to Start a Trend," There are many different types of trends: fashion trends, slang trends, new dances or social media trends. Some are easier than others to pull off, and all take a great deal of effort to popularize., You’ll want it to have a couple of qualities: mainly originality and simplicity. Creative, simple and accessible trends catch on because many people notice the trend and are able to participate.Make sure your idea is original. While many trends build on current styles and ideas, good trends represent something unique. You’ll need to come up with an idea that is not only unusual, but makes people wish they had thought about it before. The trend needs to be something that truly interests you too, and not just something new for the sake of being new. Make sure it’s original and authentic to who you are as a person.
Keep your trend simple. The more complicated a trend is and the more steps people have to follow, the less they will be interested. Trends like slap bracelets, the Macarena and reaction videos are simple, easy to make, learn or buy, and none of them take a lot of work for normal people to participate in. Try to angle for the same simplicity with your trend.

, You'll want to make sure that your trend is relatable and interesting to those around you. It will only catch on if other people find it interesting, so make sure it makes sense for the setting you spend your time in, whether it's school, an office, or an internet forum.

, A fashion trend will be simple and original, just like any other type of trend. You'll want to build on current fashions to come up with something new and cool, but not too strange or off the wall.

, Contrast is an important part of trends: stripes with solids, sporty with chic, basics with gaudier accessories. Think of ways items that don’t normally go together, or patterns that are normally seen to clash. Each of these could be a potential trend., Many trends of the past few years have been completely original, but others are a twist on old fashions that have gone out of style. Look back through old yearbooks or magazines and see what kind of trends were popular back then, like letterman jackets, saddle shoes or colorful patterns. See if there’s a way to put a new spin on an old fad to bring it back., While most trends are based on clothing or accessories, lots of trends are hair or makeup based. See if there are some unique ways to style or color your hair, or watch some makeup tutorials to do better and bolder eye makeup., While big diamonds, large name brand logos and expensive shoes have certainly been trends in the past, they’re not likely to gain much as wide of popularity as something more affordable. If the measure of success of a trend is the number of people who take part, then cheaper is better! The trend will be accessible and inclusive for almost everyone.

, The most important part of starting a trend is getting it to spread, so you have to be realistic about how likely your trend is to catch on. If it’s simple, original and affordable, it should be viable as a trend. Imagine your friends taking part, or what people would look like if they all wore your trend.

, Fashion trends can cause issues if they're too wild or strange. Many people don't like change, and will find any reason to shut your trend down.


Make sure the trend is appropriate. Schools and offices have dress codes, and sometimes they're very strict. Make sure that your trend conforms to these codes, and also use common sense. Trends that involve lots of bare skin or suggestive clothing items will likely get you in trouble.
Be careful with symbols. If your trend involves any type of religious, political or pop-culture symbols, be aware that you may upset those around you. People may not hold your viewpoint on political or religious issues, and may target you if your trend offends their sensibilities.
Stay conservative to avoid being made fun of. If your trend is too strange, others will make fun of you and the trend won't catch on. Extreme hair cuts, excess accessories or other very original looks may make you a target for bullies.
Go back to the drawing board if necessary. If your fashion trend offends others or attracts bullies, scrap it and start over again. Making the perfect trend is about trial and error, so don't be too upset about failed trends. Start back at the beginning and try again.

, There are many different social media platforms, and all of them have their own trends. Whether you use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Reddit, pick a platform that is most suited to your sense of style, humor and personality., Social media trends, like all other trends, revolve around simplicity and originality. Think about other popular trends on your social network of choice, and how they became popular. Your trend could be a caption on a certain type of photograph, a short .gif clip of a film scene, or a ""hashtag"", or short description of your message.

, The most important part of creating viral content online is making sure that many people relate to it. The more people that relate to and understand your trend, the more people will share it and pass it on. Make sure the subject matter is specific, but don't make the focus too narrow.For example, you could caption a photo with a blurb about how bored you are at high school instead of being bored at your own specific high school. High school students all around the world will relate to the more general photo, but only students at your school would relate to, and share, the photo with a caption about your school.
Start hashtags about well known celebrities or TV shows instead of more obscure ones. While you may love an obscure or lesser known celebrity or show, less people will be able to understand and latch onto your social media post. Comment on well known figures in your post to make sure it gets shared more often.

, A great deal of social media content is humorous. Funny pictures, jokes and .gif images get shared more than other, more serious content, so the funnier you can be, the more chance you'll have of your trend taking off., You'll want your word to sound exciting. Slang exists to make the language more exciting, so pick words that seem cool to you. ""Cool"" may be subjective, of course, but think of other slang words and what makes them roll off of the tongue. Many have lots of consonants, some are related to songs or movies, and most of them are short and easy to pronounce., Many slang words are simple synonyms for ""good"": ""awesome,"" ""rad,"" ""dope,"" ""sick,"" ""wicked,"" etc. Others describe things that are bad: ""bogus,"" ""bummer,"" ""lame,"" ""weak,"" etc. Keep the subject of your word simple, and you'll be able to get more people to use it., While you may think your new slang sounds great, it's possible that it may sound like an offensive word, or sound like an offensive word in another language. Double check with others around you to make sure it doesn't sound aggressive or bad, and search your word on the internet to see if it has other, bad meanings.

, The hardest part of creating a trend is getting is getting it to spread. Luckily, you'll be able to create visibility for your trend by using it yourself. Whether it's a type of social media post, a dance or an outfit, simply using or wearing your trend will expose people to your idea and let them see it often.

, You trend may seem strange at first, especially if you’re mixing fashions that don’t normally go together or using a strange word that no one's heard before. As time goes on, and you use your trend more and more, it will “normalize” in people’s eyes and it won’t seem as strange anymore, letting it catch on., Don’t show off your trend too much. You need to wear or use your trend often, but don't constantly show it off or make a big deal out of. Don’t ask other people to comment on your trend or tell them that they should use it too. Act as you normally would., While your trend may be great on its own, people will tire of it after a while if they see it too often. Change it up a bit to show the variability of your trend, whether it's a fashion item, a word or a social media post. This will show people that your trend is versatile and accessible.


If your trend involves an accessory or a type of jewelry, buy the item in a couple of different colors or patterns. Mixing it up will keep people watching to see what’s next with the trend, and show them that it’s versatile.If your trend is a slang term, use it in all of the contexts you can. If your slang term means ""good,"" use it to describe ""good"" parties, ""good"" ideas and ""good"" weather.

, If you make it too obvious that you’re specifically out to set a trend, people will see through you and the trend won’t catch on. Don’t be ostentatious or show off your trend too much when you start wearing or using it. Just act normal, as if you’re doing things you'd normally do.

, A trend won’t catch on until people decide that it’s a cool thing to do or wear. People have to see others taking part before they become comfortable enough to participate, so this is where your friends come in. Ask them from the beginning if they’d be willing to wear the style. If they say yes, show them what they need to do, and tell them to wear or use it every once in a while to increase visibility of the trend and help it “catch on”.

, If you all use the trend too much, too soon, it may lead to an overload and make it seem as if you’re all trying to hard. In the worst case, it you may all become separated from the rest of your school or workplace if the trend doesn’t take off: you’ll be those people who tried to start a “weird” trend.

, People are going to ask you lots of questions about the trend, especially if it is a little wild. This is a good way to spread your trend and make it more popular.


If it's a fashion trend, people may ask you why you are wearing what you’re wearing. In this case, tell them that you thought it was interesting, or thought it was something a little different. Don’t tell them that you’re out to “set a trend”: this will come off as fake and the trend will be less likely to spread.
Be ready to ask questions about where you bought clothes or accessories. If people like the idea, you’ll want to share how to buy or make what you’re wearing. Be friendly and help them out as much as possible.
If your trend is a social media post, people online may ask you what it means. Tell them about your trend if they ask.
For slang trends, there may be a lot of people who are confused about what you mean. If they ask you what the word means, tell them, but also be sure to use it in contexts that are easily understood.

, If you’ve gotten enough friends on board and your idea is unique enough, chances are you’ll see other people start to do it as well. Keep using your trend and take pride in knowing that you created it.

Get nice stuff (on a budget).,
Act rich.,
Look rich.,
Talk rich.,
Be seen spending a little extra.,
Don’t go overboard.",How to Pretend to Be Rich," No amount of attitude in the world can convince someone you’re rich if you don’t have any nice things. Start by scouring police and government auctions for vehicles, jewelry, and equipment at incredible deals. (Start locally rather than online to cut down on vendor fees – not to mention competition.) Scour outlet clothing stores for name-brand, quality items at slashed prices. Hunt yard and garage sales for the occasional antique, painting, or other quality item that someone so carelessly wants to part with. Go to a discount air-travel website and set up an email alert for a good deal to a vacation destination. Having a few conspicuous items of material wealth will go a long way in convincing people that you’re well-off.;
, There is an (admittedly stereotypical) distinction between “old” wealth and “new” wealth which states that old wealth tends to be more cultured and comfortable with its place in society while new wealth tends to flaunt its success. If you want to come across like old wealth, have class, act very humble about your (fake) money, and don't brag about anything you own. While you’re at it, always have good manners, don't interrupt people, don't chew with your mouth open, and remember to say please and thank you. If you want to come across like new wealth, feel free to dress up and show off a bit. Invest some (but not too much) energy into becoming cultured or seeming educated, but remember that you’re quite busy having a good time.

, Rich people have money to blow, so usually they look flawless. Make sure you have great hair (which can be achieved by getting good shampoo, conditioner, and cut) and always keep it neat. You don't have to go to an amazing salon, and when people ask where you went say something like, ""I forgot the name, but I think they did a wonderful job, do you?"" Choose stylish clothes made of nice fabrics (which, incidentally, will last you a long time). You should also get some nice technology. A Fitbit or iPhone is really nice for this. For more advice, see How to Look Rich.

, Familiarize yourself with a few upper-class concerns like the basics of stock trading, the locations of foreign countries and exotic beach getaways, and a few fancy food items. No, this doesn’t mean you should make caviar one of your key talking points or ask everyone if they’ve had the pleasure of going to Malta, but if you’re caught pronouncing foie gras incorrectly, it will raise a few eyebrows.

, People will be confused if all your nice things are obtained in secret auctions and out-of-town trips to the outlet mall. Look for a few ways to visibly spend a little extra while doing something useful for yourself, such as buying organic fruits and vegetables (and enjoying the health and environmental benefits).

, Even if every purchase is at a discount, spending yourself into oblivion by getting a police-auction car you can’t maintain or wearing defective designer clothes you can’t afford to dry-clean is a waste of time and takes you that much farther from your goal. Don’t worry about making every purchase a spendy one; if somebody ever catches you going to a sale or looking through the discount bin, just ask, “Well how do you think people get rich?”

Plan out the agenda of your club.,
Decide your demographics.,
Choose a name and tagline.,
Recruit members.,
Carry out a small survey about the series or genres of anime most popular in your peer group and organise a promotional activity.,
Organize your members.,
Arrange regular meetings.",How to Start an Anime Club," What is it about?


A particular anime or all anime in general?
Do you want to focus on a specific genre like shonen, shoujo etc?
Do you want to delve in the grey land of hentai or want to stick to the ""universal"" shows?
Old anime or the newly released ones?;
, Do you want to keep it local or global?


Do you want a physical location of your club or would you prefer it to be an online thing?
Will there be an age-group limitation or is it open-for-all?
Membership fees or free-to-enter?
Will it be a guys/girls-only club or all genders invited?

, This is the most crucial of the steps as it can make or break your club. The name should be short yet catchy or if you plan it to be long, then decide an acronym that can be easy to pronounce. For example, the ""Indian Manga And Anime Fans"" has a catchy short-form IMAAF that is easy to pronounce. Don't overload your name with too foreign sounding words--it can scare away potential members.


Also, don't forget to decide an agenda of your club. It could be simple, or if you are good with words you can make it into a slogan.

, Create a Facebook Page of your club and start posting interesting information to attract attention. Once you get a sufficient amount of followers, then decide on a start date and inform your fans. Also, create a website that has a ""Members-access-only"" section which can be accessed by only those people with whom you choose to share your password.


Alternatively, if your school allows you to, then you can create colourful posters and pin them up your bulletin board to advertise your club. Relevant information like membership fees (if any), perks of joining your club, physical club room location (if any), website and Facebook page apart from your name and contact details should be clearly visible. Also, if you know people who like anime, talk to them about your venture and get them interested. Maybe they can help you get members!

, It could be an anime-themed party or if you lack people to organise events, you can always put up an online competition like poster-making or fanfiction writing.

, After your recruitment drive is over and you have got enough members, create a small (or big, depends on the number of members) organisational crew who will help you with the events and other work. Proper work division always create wonders.

, Keep up the ante by setting up impromptu discussion sessions, anime marathons and a live online forum. This way, your club will not die out into obscurity and instead will attract more members.

Act like money is not something you ever think about.,

Have your hair cut every couple of months to keep it in good condition. Ensure it is always brushed and smooth.
Don't bite your nails, but keep them a good length and always ensure they are painted, even if it is just with a clear or nude colored polish.
Shower daily, sometimes twice. Brush your teeth several times a day, and remember to use whitening polish, floss and mouthwash.
Wash your face often and use products suitable for your skin in order to get it clean, smooth and glowing. Moisturize too, and apply suncream most days.
Shave daily, or wax frequently, and always ensure your eyebrows are perfect.
Always wear deodorant and a light (not overpowering) perfume.
Don't overeat or under eat. Have a healthy balanced diet with lots of good foods, and you will be the perfect weight.
Exercise. Go to the gym with friends, or work out at home. Take up sports such as tennis, which not only help you keep fit, but also give a sense of wealth. Furthermore, it's easy to dress well while playing tennis!
Treat yourself with fast food or sweets every now and again, but not all the time!;
, This is important before going on to the next steps, as you need to organize and evaluate what items you already have, and what items you need.


Keep good, well made items that you like and are in good condition.
Get parents to repair anything that is torn.
Start selling everything you don't want on eBay. Take good photos (and model the clothes if possible), to try to get the most money you can for your clothes.
With things that are in poor condition or won't sell on eBay, give them to a thrift store, donate them to charity, or throw away.
Make a list of items you think you need, and keep this list in mind whenever you are shopping online or with your friends. Make sure the list includes absolutely everything you need, and make a promise to yourself to not buy anything not on the list.

, eBay is great for buying brands such as Abercrombie, Lacoste and Ralph Lauren for super cheap prices. Look around often in order to grab yourself a bargain.


Buy basic clothes, shoes and accessories in the following colors: black, navy, grey, beige, brown.
You will need polos, oxford shirts, dresses, jeans, skirts and trousers in these basic colors.
You will also need basic shoes, such as flats, brogues, loafers and court shoes. Buying them in the colors stated will mean they can go with everything.
Reorganize your wardrobe after buying these basic items. Put together several different outfits, ensuring you are always polished and color coordinated.

, Now, it's time to make it more obvious to them. Using the money you have saved from buying clothes cheaply online, spend large amounts of money when shopping with your friends.


Buy expensive designer shoes and bags. Having expensive shoes is important as these are often the first thing people notice, and therefore the first thing you will be asked about. It's also vital to have at least one designer tote bag (even if it's just a high street designer), as this will be used every day.
Buy expensive jewelry. Though you can save money on other jewelry, your friends will know you are rich when buying something small in size for a large price.
Get a small number of expensive clothes. Though accessories and shoes are timeless and will always be in fashion, it is also good to buy expensive clothes while shopping with your friends, as this will show them price is unimportant to you.
As well as clothes, you should also get the gadgets. A smartphone and tablet are must haves for somebody that wishes to appear rich. Keep these with you at all times.

,


When shopping, don't look at price tags - if you have to, do it subtly and do not show your reaction.
Never comment on price at all. If you say something is too expensive, your friends will automatically assume you are not rich enough to afford it. Likewise, commenting on something cheap makes it seem like you appreciate it when things are cheap, which rich people shouldn't because they have enough money to buy expensive things.
Don't make it obvious you have money to spend, and don't show off about it, but answer politely if a friend asks you.
Never ever head straight for the sale racks, or even comment when you see one when with friends. Feel free to look there, but only when casually browsing around a store: don't spend hours rooting through, it will make you look desperate.

,


When out shopping with friends, offer to buy everybody lunch.
If any of your friends are running low on cash, take them to one side and offer them money. You should never ever be patronizing, just politely offer and accept if they decline. They will appreciate you offering it secretly rather than embarrassing them in front of everyone.
Give your friends great gifts. This means the gift should be something your friend will like, but also something that has a brand name attached to it. This shows you are thoughtful enough to spend a lot of money on them.

,


Go to the salon, to get your nails done, or to the spa as often as you can, and then bring it up in conversation when with your friends.
Go on holidays or city breaks as frequently as possible, which will give the impression that you lead a luxurious life.
Never go out looking bad. You don't know who you might see, and you should always be well groomed.

Be yourself!",How to Make Everyone Think You're Posh (Teens)," Listen to how people speak in your area and see if you can detect a “posh accent.” If so, try to imitate it. Avoid contractions – for example, say ""you will"" instead of “you'll.” Use elongated vowel sounds, and avoid swearing; it shows a lack of manners and wrong conduct.;
, This is a very elegant, classy, and rare trait which is a valuable tool in becoming posh. You can work on your posture by taking drama classes, or walking around with a book on your head – it does work!

, It is useful to become politically, culturally, and religiously aware – even the most basic knowledge can save a person from embarrassment and awkwardness. If you know in advance that you will be spending time with someone of an unfamiliar background, it is a good idea to do more in-depth research to avoid embarrassing faux pas.

, Excellent presentation is half of the battle! If you’re a girl, never wear anything you feel uncomfortable in, even if it’s fashionable – it is important to remember that modesty is vital in earning the respect of others. Stick to nice colors. Don’t pick something violent or that stands out – look for anything light, clean, and fresh looking. However, remember that what matters most is how you carry yourself – brands and fashions are only the frosting.

, You cannot be posh if you are dirty and smelly: shower daily, brush your teeth regularly, and keep your nails groomed and clean. If you’re a girl, find a light but fresh scent and stick to it, and keep your hair clean with plenty of volume.

, This is very important! Posh people have good manners and know the boundaries in human relations. They know not to tread on toes but equally they know how to upbraid people who do. Manners are a form of currency for the posh person and the more you know of them, the better.

, Don't stuff your face with food – chew your food, don't make any noises or gulp it down, and don’t take huge bites. Avoid eating anything that could get messy or sticky. Don't slouch when you're sitting in a chair – press your back against it and press your feet against the floor, and avoid folding your arms; it can make you look unsure about who you are and where you stand.

, When necessary, voice your opinions appropriately and constructively. This encourages your audience to listen carefully when you speak. But if someone is bullying you, you have the right to insult. Always be nice to other people, unless you have something against them.

, Posh people are not materialistic - that easily becomes garish and common. Rather, posh people seek out quality and style whatever it may be - a handbag, a house, a car. Buy the best that your money can afford and go without the trinkets. Try not to buy badly faked designer items, for example, do not buy a trashy bag with a huge metal G on, or a metal tag that has been stuck on askew, as it will be obvious that it is fake, and will identify you as poor, a chav or a wannabe.

, Begin playing sports. Sports like hockey, lacrosse, golf and tennis are great; but always find the right type of exercise for you instead of joining the latest trend. Never over-eat or over-indulge. Posh people know their limits and respect them; especially since respect in the eyes of others is very important for a posh person.

, Stay intelligent and keen in school, and try hard in every subject you take. Always hand in homework, and don’t talk or pass notes in class. Ask questions and participate in class discussions. Help others if they're struggling, and don't suck up to your teachers. Just try hard, be punctual in everything and share your knowledge.

, Label your things and look after them to make sure they don't get lost or damaged, and try covering your text and school books in clear contact paper to make them look neater. Buy some nice pencils and pens, and make sure you always have enough of everything – constantly asking to borrow things isn't very posh. Go for light and neutral colors and items that are good quality. Don't buy anything in dark colors like navy blue or black.

, Having a selfish and nasty attitude towards others is never posh! Always have a smile on your face, and be willing to let people borrow things from you. Be nice to everyone, and never label people as “losers.” Everyone deserves a chance, so make sure you give it to them. Don't exclude people from games, gifts, or secrets, keep your promises and don't gossip. When someone gossips about someone else, politely tell them you find gossiping rather mean and would prefer not to. Never be impulsive or hot-headed – always keep your cool.

, If you just aren’t a posh person, don’t try to pretend you are – you’ll make more friends and be happier if you stick with who you are. Don’t let people convince you to be posh (or not posh) if you really are.

Be involved.",How to Seem Wealthy (Teenage Girls)," It may seem like rich people wear all designer clothes, but they really don't. To pull off the old money look, your style should be elegant, conservative, classic, and chic. Ideally, you should have the following in your wardrobe: Pencil skirts, cashmere sweaters, cardigans, a few sun dresses, slacks, skinny and wide leg jeans, and button up blouses. Don't wear sweatpants in public. Don't wear shorts and a baggy tee to bed, wear a silk nightgown.;
, Don't be afraid to splurge a bit on shoes, they can complete your outfit. You should have a few pairs of high heels (no bigger than 3 inches), flats in different patterns and designs and wedges.

, Accessories can make many outfits look like they cost way more than they really do. If you're on the fortunate side, a nice Tiffany key or two is always wonderful! If you don't have the money for something that expensive, there is no need to fret. Good places to look for jewelry that looks expensive but isn't are Forever 21 and Target. Try to wear pearls, gems, diamonds, and gold.


Always carry a bag with you. If you can't afford designer bags, shop at a place like Marshall's or TJ Maxx. If you can only afford things from places like Walmart or Target, find one that looks like its copying designer bags. Make sure it isn't fabric, it should look like it is made out of leather. Also, make sure there is no name or designer label on the front of the purse.

, Wealthy people always have good hygiene. Remember the obvious: shower daily, wash your face twice a day, brush, floss, use mouth wash, and whiten your teeth if needed.

, Having a good, classic hair cut is a good idea. The wealthy don't follow fads or trends. A long flowy cut with bangs is cute, or a nice bob. Also, try to stick with your natural hair color as much as possible. Your natural color is much more beautiful than a fake one!

, Keep your skin clear and acne free. Keep your nails clean as well. Keep them groomed, short and nice and smooth. Paint them in pinks, reds, clear, or french tips. Bright blues, purples, and greens are tacky.

, Keep it natural. Use a liquid foundation and/or powder that is oil-free and matches your skin tone. Use a light pink blush and only use it on the balls of your cheeks. It should fade lightly as it heads towards your temples. Use a base on your eyes. This helps the eye shadow stay on throughout the day. Use a gold color and cover your entire lid. Use a light brown on your crease. Use a shimmer white or silver under your brow line, this makes your eyes look bigger. Use a brown or back eye liner or pencil to make a straight thin line on your top lid. Use the same color underneath to make a thin line that ends about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way to your inner eye. Use a black mascara and eyelash curler to finish things up. Use mascara on top (two coats), and on bottom (one coat). Lastly, use a sheer pink lip gloss and swipe it onto your lips.

, You don't have to wear $300 perfume to seem wealthy. Just about any perfume from Bath and Body Works smells great. The key is to not put too much on. One to two sprays should be plenty!

, Wealthy girls have a certain presence about them. They are confident, happy, smart, and sweet. They have everything, but they don't let it get to their heads. Be nice to everyone and make new friends. Always be happy and never complain or whine. Try not to swear! It makes you look trashy and uneducated. Don't do stuff with boys, you need to have a good reputation. Don't drink beer or smoke. Go to parties and dance dirty, but when the alcohol arrives say you have somewhere else to be. It will even add a little mystery to your life from the views of others. Also, try hard in school, get all A's, and a couple B's. C's are not good enough, remember, you are better than just average!

, Eat healthy, especially in public. The most unhealthy thing you should ever be seen eating is a fruit smoothie. At school eat a salad, a deli sandwich, water, and an apple, an orange, or a banana. Be seen drinking Fiji water. Sounds crazy, but Fiji water is what many wealthy people drink. Playing a sport is not required, but if you want to there is only certain ones that will keep your wealthy reputation up. Play tennis, golf, or take dance lessons (only ballet, jazz, pointe and/or modern.)

, After-school activities are also huge! Other than being on a sport you should join clubs (art club or a public service club are good choices), be on student government, learn french in your spare time, paint, take piano lessons, read old literature or American history books.

Know what's in style.,
Work hard to get paid.,

Get invited.,
Have fun and be successful.

",How to Look Rich and Fashionable," However, the confidence and sophisticated demeanor cannot be brushed aside as those economic fears take hold. Use those fears to further climb the social ladder, network to more friends and business contacts and develop a better, more positive outlook to your life.;
, But when it comes to things like cars, furniture, etc., only buy what fits your budget so you can pay for it with cash. Just make sure it looks nice. For example, consider buying a used Jetta rather than buying new VW.

,


Shop at stores like: Marshalls, TJ Maxx, Filene's Basement, Target, Forever21, H&M, Express, etc. These stores not only carry good name brand clothes, shoes and accessories, but they have great prices.
Girls- Wear heels whenever possible. You can wear them to the mall or when you're just running errands.
Hygiene. Keep your hair free of greasy roots, grown out dark roots, frizz and childish styles and accessories. Always smell good! Perfume, cologne, musks, body sprays- all good for smelling amazing.
Get thin and healthy- What celeb or wealthy person is overweight and unhealthy? Obesity is something that should be changed anyway, but to help you feel better about yourself, lose the weight you need to. (if you are thin than just enjoy staying that way)
Get a job. Nothing looks worse then being jobless. If you are young, like 15 years old- get a work permit. Make some savings, learn work ethic. Network while you do - you'll meet a lot of people just from working!

,


Girls- Make up, keep it classy and sexy. Smoky eyes for a formal night, and use lite bronzer, eye liner, mascara, lip balm, and cover-up. Natural make up is best for the workplace. Get glamorous when you need to!

, Have nice hair, a great smile, and an amazing personality. Be fashionable, intelligent, and cultured.

, Give off an air of 'rich' and a proud feeling showing the hard work it took to get you here. Look at your blessings and accomplishments and let that be your brilliance when out and about.

,


Check out blogs like and other fashion forward writers...keep Vogue nearby, 'steal' styles from the wealthy. Look at Carrie Bradshaw, Blake Lively, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Moss. Find a store that 'caters' to your inner diva - everyone has one! H&M is great because all the clothes you would ever need are found right there. Even down to sneakers, bras/panties, coats, etc.
Avoid mainstream stores like: American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch, Aero, Hollister, and Gap.
As well as avoid mainstream styles, no sweats (especially not ones that say 'PINK'), no UGGs, and no leggings. Nothing that isn't classy and mature looking.

, Save up, don't spend huge amounts of money on anything. Give yourself an allowance and stick to it. Shopping is fine, esp if you need a new wardrobe or you are severely outdated, just don't do it every day. Go to college, get certificates when possible, get degrees, make money and get a name for yourself.

, Be cultured.

, Tell yourself that you are a success and deserve to be deemed a wealthy individual.

, Network into the right circles. Live like you are an episode of Gossip Girl, get the scoop on the great parties, clubs, hotspots and become aquaintences/friends with some people inside. Get numbers. Be a socialite.

Don't show people that you're rich.",How to Look Rich As a Teen," Stay sweet, relaxed, cool in every situation, and be polite. Try not to gossip, interrupt, or curse. Speak to everybody, treat them well and don't notice the ""cliques"". Choose your friends wisely though (not everyone likes kinder people). Treat adults like how you should treat them. Most importantly, be yourself, you want everyone to know the real you because every girl (wealthy or not) has different personalities from one another.;
, Remember not to sacrifice comfort though! Wealthy people tend to wear very nice clothes only because they can afford the high-quality. Your garments should be freshly washed and not controversial (i.e. involving politics, racism, etc.). And wear what you like, feel yourself in, and want. You want to be happy and feel yourself in every outfit you choose to put on, and not pressured into what the others wear. Every girl (rich or not) has a style of their own!


Most rich girls look preppy, so you can dress that way if you want. Wear Lacoste polos, Tommy Hilfiger sweaters, Chloé blouses, Acne clothes, Herve Leger dresses, Levi's, Acne, Calvin Klein jeans, and Burberry scarves.
If you're not into the ""preppy"" style, just wear what you like. Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie and Fitch, PINK by Victoria's Secret, Wet Seal, Target, H&M, J. Crew, Express, and Forever 21 are all totally cool to wear. The trick is to just make your clothes look more expensive than they are (by using accessories, layering, making small changes, etc.).
To get an idea on attires: Jeans, chinos, good quality basic shirts, different patterned pants, boots, blouses, flirty dresses (to parties), cardigans, blouses, layered shirts, sweaters, sandals, skirts, and sweatshirts from well-known quality schools (Harvard, Naval Academy, West Point, etc.) are what many casual children from wealthy families wear.

, Ideally, one for formal occasions and one for everyday use. Louis Vuitton (Speedy 30 is a very classy, chic and elegant model, and the damier pattern is fabulous one), Chloé (Paddington is also a chic model), Mulberry (Alexa in light or dark brown, Mitzy Tote in camel is also very chic) or a Chanel 2.55 in black, it suits for most occasions). If you cannot afford it, buy a cheaper one, like GANT, Hilfiger, HM, or you can buy one from Forever 21. Try to avoid buying purses with unreal designs. If money is an issue, buying bags in a similar, ""inspired by"" style is fine. If you do choose to wear unauthentic designer wear, be prepared to tell the truth. Any avid bag lover can spot the difference depending on the quality of the knockoff. Not all rich girls wear 700 dollar bags.

, During the day, you can use a light foundation, neutral eye shadow, lip-gloss, black or brown mascara, bronzer, blush and, if you want, black or brown pencil eyeliner. If you're going to a party, you can use darker or glittery eye makeup. Don't get too many piercings. If you do, get them only on your ears. Take showers every day and make sure you have a clean skin. If you don't buy a product for clear skin.

, Wear your hair down, or up, but don't mess with it most of the time. It's okay to use a gel or spray, just make sure to take care of it.


Wash your hair every two or three days with a good shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. Hair care shouldn't be costly, as some great drugstore brands include Herbal Essences, Aussie, Dove, Infusium, Organix, Pantene, Garnier, and Très Semme. Condition every time you shampoo, and leave the conditioner in for about a minute for very soft and frizz-free hair.
Try different styles on special occasions like curling, straightening, a chignon, or braided bun.

, Well, it would be good to have good-looking and good-mannered parents. However, if nothing else, you should just seem as if you were well-disciplined when you were younger, and be respectful to them.


Try to convince your mother to dress pretty and elegantly. Some good wardrobe basics would be Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Chanel, Banana Republic, Talbots, Vineyard Vines, Bottega Veneta, Mulberry or Chloè  handbag, a Burberry or Hermès scarf, a little black dress, and a pair of pearls or diamonds.
Try to convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/ Tommy Hilfiger/ Polo Ralph Lauren/ Calvin Klein/ Nautica polos and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If convincing doesn't work, just ask him to look clean, comfortable and classy.

, Just make sure that your house looks clean and classy. Most rich families have a maid to come over to their house once a week or two and help them with the chores, but you can probably keep your house clean yourself. Just try to keep your home cozy, nice-looking, and clean.


You can buy small things to decorate your house, like a beautiful vase, placemats, silk pillows, pictures (of family or artwork), scented candles, or pretty lamps to ensure that it looks good and cozy. You should consider painting artwork yourself, and ask to put them on a wall.

, Don't be afraid to go out with your parents sometimes. Ask them to go to a classy restaurant once in a while. Visit with them galleries and events, where you'll be dressed beautifully. Also, be the one friend who invites others to the mall, beach, restaurant, etc. Most rich girls have a huge schedule, almost everyday doing something with friends or extra-curricular.

, Most rich girls show their passion through music, painting, dance, or sports. But whatever you're talented at, classically know you've got it, and make practicing part of your daily basis.


The piano, violin, and guitar are very common instruments to play.
Most rich girls play tennis. Horseback riding, soccer, basketball, cheer, volleyball, crew, and lacrosse are other sports rich girls often go in for.

, Be a good student (go for As and Bs and be nice to the teachers/staff), but that does not mean you have to be a nerd. Just get good grades and show others you actually aim to get a good future.

, Be a friendly, sweet and loyal friend. Develop social skills, have a social life, be charming, and never gossip. People will automatically trust you and love you!

, Rich people are, well, just people, and they know it. When they go shopping, even they are the ones who say about a $40 flimsy sweater, ""That's really overpriced"". Keep a low-profile when it comes to clothes or houses. Rich people are more humble than they seem.

Take care of your hygiene and grooming.,
If you cannot keep up with regular salon visits, do not change your hair color!,
Keep your makeup simple and natural.,
Take care of your nails.,
Have a classic wardrobe.,
Choose simple, classic jewelry.,
Be warm and friendly, and carry yourself with poise.",How to Look Rich when You're Not (Women)," A well-groomed, healthy appearance is key to anyone's look.


Find the right products for you to get clear, glowing skin and shiny hair. Research online to find product reviews and select items that suit your needs. More expensive is not always better here - for some women a $7 bottle of shampoo works better than a $20 bottle. It's all about your individual needs.
For perfume, find a scent that works for you and apply it lightly. Another person should only be able to smell you if they're right next to you, not from across the room!
Clean, healthy, white (but not fake white) teeth also give an aura of wealth. If you have dental insurance, make sure you keep up with your visits. Use a whitening toothpaste and brush your teeth in the morning and before bed, and don't smoke!
If you choose to have a bit of a tan, don't overdo it. Nothing says ""low-class"" like orange skin.;
, Roots look cheap and detract from your appearance. If you want to dye your hair at home, try to stick close to your natural color and use the dye to enhance your natural color.


Typically, drastic at-home dye jobs look flat and obvious. Also, streaky highlights are a big no-no. A short, classic cut, such as a bob, can be very cute, but requires constant trimming. If you can pull off a longer hairstyle you can get away with trimming it less often, saving more money. Long hair in a sleek ponytail can be a very classy, rich look.

, For a smooth complexion, look for a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, that way you only pay for one product and get three! If you want to buy a department store brand, wait until they have a bonus promotion so you can get some great free items.


Choose a soft blush for a healthy flush, and a clump-free mascara). Natural eye makeup with minimal liner finishes off your eyes.
For lips, use a soft, natural gloss. Lip gloss is the one item you reapply throughout the day, so if you can invest in a better brand here, that would help.

, Short, clean nails are essential. If you want to use polish, avoid decals and designs. Choose a solid color in nude, soft pink, or a classic red. Another, even less expensive option, is to simply buff your nails. A few dollars for a nail buffer will give you great-looking nails for months.

, Classic styles are the best option because you can wear them for years and save tons of money on replacements. Look to Jackie O. and Audrey Hepburn for style inspiration.


Choose great cuts in good quality fabrics. Avoid synthetics such as acrylic sweaters (which pull easily) and shiny polyester tops.
If you wear jeans, avoid anything over-embellished or distressed. Make sure you have one longer pair (for heels) and a shorter pair (for flats). A straight cut, or a subtle boot-cut is the most classic. Levi's would be a good choice here because they are classic and have a variety of price points. Khakis in a great fit are another good pant choice.
Plain, fitted (not too tight or too loose) cotton tees are great on their own or layered, and you can usually get them on a special, such as buy 2 for $20. Black, white, and muted colors will go from season-to-season easily.
Cardigans are a great staple; a cotton blend is best because it will be warm enough for fall and winter but not too hot for spring. For outerwear, find a classic trench in tan and a wool pea coat for winter in black or navy. Make sure everything you buy fits correctly, or spend a little bit of money at a tailor to make it fit properly. When showing skin, make sure to balance: if you show a little leg, cover up on top and vice versa.
Make sure hemlines and necklines are modest enough to avoid wardrobe malfunctions. Avoid any flashy logos, as those are very nouveau riche. Look for good quality brands at good prices. Another great strategy is to buy classics on sale at the end of the season. For example, coats go on sale in February, so invest in a classic style at half price and wear it for years! Don't mention that you got a great deal on something unless you are pressed. If someone asks where an item is from, just say the brand and change the subject. You're not lying, and the question is answered.

, You can get very cheap items here and no one will be able to tell. Faux pearl studs and necklaces can be had for under $20 and few people can tell the difference.


Choose cubic zirconia studs instead of diamonds, just make sure they're not too large or it will be obvious that they're fake. Fake metals can change colors, so go with sterling silver, which is inexpensive but good quality.
If you'd like to wear a watch, go with a Timex instead of a knock-off of a more expensive brand. Timex watches are great quality, and lots of rich people wear them.
Lots of people will tell you that you need an expensive designer handbag to look rich, but this is not the case. If you wear leather, choose a basic, good quality leather handbag in a timeless style, without any logos. Check outlets and sales for this item, and make sure you avoid anything flashy or trendy. Another good option is a nylon Longchamp bag (about $125). For summer days, carry an LL Bean tote (get it monogrammed, it's a very rich look) for under $30...preppy and budget-friendly! Scarves can usually be had for cheap at discount stores and can bring a lot of fun to an outfit.

, Don't make fun of others or look down on anyone else. Keep abreast of current events and join discussions, but make sure you hear out others' opinions. Most importantly, don't discuss money. Rich people just don't talk about it, and it's very tacky to do so.

You need to have a good reputation at places.,
Money is definitely an essential.,
Now that the matter of money is handled, we need to move on to what to do with all of it.,
Makeup is an essential for girls and sometimes even guys.,
You never see a celebrity that looks dirty or greasy, so hygiene is very essential to looking good.,
Every celebrity has good, matching accessories that make a statement.,
An attitude can affect you in both good and bad ways.,
In the end, a new image can be easily created with some work.",How to Look Rich and Famous," For example: at school, if you are known for being geeky or slutty, then it make take some time to get to a good level. This may take some time; some people need a minor change and it may take simply a few weeks. Others however may need a year or so to get a better reputation.;
, However, not much is needed. Look for ways to get money. Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it.

, With the money you have collected (anywhere from about $150-$1000) you need to go shopping. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gabanna clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actually store.(check tips for a minor addition to this section)

, Makeup can cover up any marks, scars or unwanted facial features that may cause people to look at you much differently then you really are. Choose a foundation and cover up that is lightweight and matches your skin tone well. Look for cheaper brands such as Revlon or Covergirl as opposed to M.A.C. or Estée Lauder. Apply the makeup lightly and evenly to establish a blended, air brushed look. Apply an eye liner that makes your eyes pop and that contrasts to your eye-shadow. Buy a light or neutral colored lip gloss that makes lips shimmer with out a flight-attendant red color.

, Shower daily with a good shampoo and conditioner. Use a generic brand of shampoo- instead of using Nexxus for example, use Suave (compared to Nexxus). They have the same look, smell and effect but you get more for your dollar. Buy a good facial cleanser- generic brands are good but depending on the condition of your skin, a full set of Proactive or AcneFree will do you well. Also, facial masques can be bought in bulk and applied once or twice a week to help keep skin looking clean, fresh and radiant.

, While both male and female celebrities wear over-sized designer sunglasses, other accessories are gender specific. Save up for a nice watch, wear good scenting cologne (start off with a knock off perfume or cologne, and save up for the real thing. Juicy's knock off is called Jazzy, and you can barely tell the difference). Purchase a nice wallet from Coach or Prada and make yourself look nice. A note on the sunglasses- many people now make knock off sunglasses available for some 80-95% cheaper. Knock off purses can be purchased to for around $60.

, Being snooty may get you noticed and you may be able to fit in with a more ""classy"" crowd- but make sure you look at the good and the bad before you choose the way you act. Being snooty like celebs such as Paris and Nicole, or being sweet and sensitive such as Jennifer Aniston will affect the way people look and act upon you. Also pay attention to the way you walk and sit. Watch how the really rich and famous behave in public.

, Make sure this is an image you can keep up with to avoid another image- a poser.

Make the most of your hair and face.,
Next up, face.,
Work on your body.,
Don't change too quickly.,
Make your outfit amazing every day.,
Be up to date on news.",How to Start a Clique1,"


Top, down, starting with hair. Shampoo/condition once every two days. Shampooing every day dries out the hair, which we all know results in dry, frizzing hair! Use systems made specifically for certain hair types: wavy, straight, curly, dry, frizzy, dyed, etc. Also use glossing spray, shine serum, anti-frizz serum, and styling wax or hair styling mousse. Note: If your hair looks glossy because it's greasy, that's totally different, and it may need to be washed.
Your hair needs to look adorable every single day. Experiment to see what works with your face and style. You may be sporty, which may seem like it calls for a ponytail. But come on, a ponytail every day? No way! Try having your clique wear the same style as you to look extra trendy. Also, if you have curly hair, straighten it every once in a while! (and vice versa, of course!) However, don't get into the habit of using damaging hair tools! Curl your hair, or scrunch it! It looks so cute, and gives you beachy waves if done right! If you are having trouble finding styles, YouTube is a great place to start.
Use cute accessories to make your clique look even better. Make sure the colors don't clash with your outfit, but don't be too matchy matchy. You want to look cute and put together, but not ""my Mommy picked out my outfit and bought me my multi-colored hair scrunchies so each outfit would match a scrunchy!"" That's just... no. Please, never.;
, Zits are a part of growing up. Don't scratch, pick, or pop your pimples... that just makes them even redder! Make sure you wash your face every day, and use appropriate cleansers/creams if necessary. Only you know your skin's needs, to answer their calls! To cover up the pimples, find a match of your skin color and do your best to conceal them. Red faces look awful... been there, done that! If you have a gross pimple, and the only thing you can do is pop it, do it on Friday, so it has the weekend to heal. Proactive works quite well. Only a few days and if you don't have zits, Proactive also prevents acne.


Make-up. Never over-do it. Make it very natural so that it looks like you aren't wearing any, even if you are. Just some lip color, foundation, concealer, blush, eyeshadow, and mascara are all that's needed. You don't even need eyeshadow! Avoid the stage make-up look for every day. Also, stay away from the clown look! Choose a natural lip color, and blend the blush on the apples of your cheeks. Little, perfectly defined red circles just look ridiculous. Or, if your parents don't allow make-up, that's okay. The point is to have a natural look.

, You need to always smell amazing. Shower everyday and use good smelling shower gel. Have complementing body lotion. Use a decent smelling perfume or body spray, or avoid scent altogether.


You must be very toned. Do something active! From just running with your buds every day to folk dancing to participating in a highly competitive sports team, the calories are burning and the bod is getting better. Exercise every day for at least half an hour! Not only does it keep you fit, but you will feel more confident and happy!

, Nothing shouts, ""I'm trying to be popular!"" more than suddenly switching your wardrobe from Walmart to Forever 21. If you don't usually wear ""popular"" clothes, start small, maybe with a bit of jewelry from Justice. Work your way up, slowly but steadily. The same goes for makeup, too.

, It may help to follow the two week rule: Don't wear a piece of clothing for at least two weeks after you wear it the first time. If you go to a school that has a uniform, try to jazz up your look by adding an accessory or a piece of jewelry. Don't be afraid to shop at stores outside where everybody else is shopping. If you find cute stuff, consider buying it. People will admire your unique style. When they ask where you got your amazing wardrobe, don't spill. Say ""I don't remember,"" or ""Some place near my aunt's house."" If you must say something, be very vague. We don't want everybody to start having your excellent taste in style, now, do we?


Always know the latest trends. Others will begin to notice your style and look up to you for trends so be sure to deliver. For trends, read fashion magazines. Same goes for accessories. Always add accessories to all of your outfits: purses, jewelry, hats, scarves, belts, etc. However, don't overuse! Same with shoes... own enough that you wear at least three different pairs of shoes throughout the course of the week. Don't wear Uggs every single day... mix it up!
Don't be afraid to break away from trends! If you look just like everyone else, no one will notice you! A good way to stay in fashion is to mix your own style with trends... or even start your own trend!

, Read news magazines. Talk to your clique about what's going on in the world. Also, get to know at least 3 people a day, in and out of school, and on social networking sites. Make them trust you, and they will talk like there is no tomorrow about anything you want to hear.

Be clique/popular ready.,
Make sure you have a good relationship with the people you want to form a clique with.,
Try to talk to them about forming a clique with rules and a name.,
Form an inside joke that could be used as a name for your group.,
Choose place where you and your friends regularly hang out.,
Buy your friends gifts.,
You may have trouble with couple of your friends not dressing in fashion every day or not doing their hair hotly.,
Start a catch phrase.,
Make sure if you hang out with your friends that its only you.",How to Make Your Friends Want to Be in a Clique," Do this by making your hair pretty, reading some other wikiHows about being popular, getting in shape, getting new and really cute clothes, and even putting on some light makeup.;
, Also make sure you have confidence.

, If they think it's a stupid idea then you have to go into sneaky mode. If they do decide to form a clique with you, you don't have to finish reading this. If not, then you have to move to the next step.

, Maybe one friend refers to your group as something cute or funny. Or one of your parents say something weird, but all in all YOU have to be the one that makes it a group name. You should say, ""Ha ha ha, I can't believe your mom just called us that. That's gonna be our group name forever."" Be causal and not too pushy when you say something like this.

, A way to do this without being too blunt is to just recommend going to a certain restaurant over and over again. Example: ""Where do you want to eat tonight? Ah, we should go that private-owned pizza place!"" and just keep on suggesting that certain place all the time. Sooner or later your friends will just follow.

, Make sure it is something that is matching and that many people at school will see. Try classic silver bracelets or necklaces. Make sure to buy something that will match everything so that your friends can wear them every day. When you buy the gifts, include a card or message that could say something like ""lets wear all wear these to school on Monday."" then a few days later if your friends haven't worn them ask if they didn't like your gift. When they say they did like it, you should encourage them to wear your gift more often. Also, suggest that you and your clique wear these gifts all on the same days to express to everyone at school that you guys are friends and no one should mess with you. Make it sentimental or fun rather than trying too hard to be cool.

, The only way to get your friends to follow the latest trends are to go shopping with them and tell them they'd look really great in whatever is the latest fashions. Then, give them a makeover and do their hair. Suggest to them that they should try it every day.

, if you say it constantly, but not too much, then they might pick it up and when they do just causally say ,""that's our thing"".

, If you go to the mall make sure you ONLY invite the people you want to be in your clique.

Plan the clique.,
Socialize with potential members.,
Reconsider the idea.,
Be aware of yourself and your looks.,
Rules in the clique.,
Everyone should have a signature.,
Make sure your clique has a way to communicate.,
Each member has a rank:


You're the Alpha, or the leader of the group.,
Have a few parties every once in a while.,
Sleepovers.",How to Run the Most Popular Clique in School," If you don't already have a clique, then you should form one! Carry a piece of paper around with you in school, and make a list of people that could be in the clique. Make sure nobody sees this; they’d know you're recruiting them.


Think about the pros and cons of each person you picked, and narrow the list down to 3-5 people.






Cliques are small, and huge ones are hard to control.;
, Once you have people picked out, become friends with them. Although, if you want to make a clique in the next millisecond, then form a clique with the friends you already have.


Once you're close to them, hang out in public places, so people see you together a lot an think you're a clique.






Never say the actual word ""clique"" to your group or anyone else. It's just tacky.

, Now before you try to walk around and act cool, ask yourself: are you really clique material? You can't have a clique where everyone else is cooler than you. You'd probably be voted out for keeping everyone behind.

, Now, you're the Alpha of the clique. So you have to look like one! Don't over-do makeup. It'll make you look like a clown. And make sure to wash your face with cleansers every morning and night so you don't break out in pimples. You should make an exercise regimen for each week (You can be chubby and popular in some cases, but that doesn't work out so well everywhere, especially in the summer) Brush your teeth 2-3 times a day and shower once a day. Make sure everyone else in the clique follows these rules too.

, you should make a list for your clique to follow to the letter. (example: no ponytails on Friday, clique colors on Monday, wear the signature bracelet every day, etc) If anyone breaks a rule, make sure there's a punishment, something small though. Keep reminding people of the rules so they get it, but not too much: they'd think you're annoying.

, Make friendship bracelets, that nobody else has, for the clique to wear. Or just have a group signature color scheme.

, Email, Twitter, Facebook, Cell phones, Morse Code, whatever. As long as somebody has a way to talk about the day and it's happenings.

, Everybody follows your orders, and you're looked up to by everybody. (Make sure they're the ones asking you the questions, not the other way around.)






The Beta is your best friend. She's like a clone of you, only not as powerful. (Don't put anyone in your clique that can overthrow you!) The Beta is also super good at getting the latest gossip, so she can tell you about everything.
The Followers (Gammas) are third in importance. They're intimidated by you, but will do anything you ask. Some of them are good at verbal fighting, so you don't have to get in the line of fire (more on this later).
The Wannabes (Omegas). They're the people who somehow snuck into your clique right under your nose. Of course, you could use them to do jobs nobody else will. And once their purpose is fulfilled? Just dump them on another clique. Easy as pie.

, Alphas have the best parties in the school, and everyone will want to be there. Keep most of them exclusive to your clique so people will wonder about what went on there. Have one of your Wannabes or your Beta spread rumors about how awesome the parties were, so people will try to be close to you.


At the parties others are actually invited to, make sure they lived up to the expectations. The rumors you spread around have to be credible, so people aren't up for disappointment when they arrive.






At your party, have lots of snacks like chips, dip, crackers with cheese, and maybe a punch bowl. Or just have a cooler full of canned sodas.
You could also make a survey of what guests want out of all the people you invited. The music has to be on the radio. Cd's can be cool, but not everyone will like your taste in music. So put on a station everyone knows.

, These are strictly exclusive. Only people in your clique are invited. So spread around rumors like you did before, only make them more outrageous. People wouldn't know what you did there, because only your clique was there. (Still, sleepovers have to be as awesome as your parties).


Pick a room everyone is sleeping in. The den, the living room, or even your room. Make sure your parents aren't getting frustrated over noise, or make sure that they fall asleep quickly. Most sleepovers are ruined when a parent says ""time for bed"" so keep them in their bedroom the whole night.

Start your clique.,
Become friends with the girls in your clique.,
Have a lot of inside jokes and secrets between you guys so you feel more like a group.,
Don't let anyone else sit with you at lunch.,
Move in sync with your clique everywhere you go.",How to Start a Clique2," First, carry a little notebook around with you and jot down possible members. Look at your names and narrow it down to a few. Make a pro/con list about each one. Select two or three names (your clique should have three to six members, including you) to be in your clique. You should have an alpha (the leader of the clique-you!), a beta (the alpha's assistant, second-in-command, and best friend), 1 or 2 ""Charlies"" (third on the group's importance list; the supporters), and the followers (members of the clique who will respect you without a doubt).

, Do everything together, from shopping to eating lunch in the cafeteria. Make sure you are always seen with them, so people start to see you as a clique.

, Have a little thing you all wear, like a piece of jewelry.


Don't be too forward with the jewelry, or whatever you've chosen. Only proceed with this step when you have become best friends with your clique. Then, after school, or during a private moment, present to them. Then, casually, say, ""Hey, why don't we all wear these on ___?""

, If the tables are all connected, put your stuff on the chairs surrounding you, so that no one sits there. Also, make sure that your clique follows steps 1-6, so it will look like a clique.

, Tip: make a copy of the same playlist on their iPods and memorize the night before or wear them in your ears to school. (Try Pretty Girl Rock; it's a nice one for confidence.) Ensure that your clique is always having fun all the time, to make everyone envy you, hence making you the ""it"" clique.

Before you start reading, see the warnings at the bottom of the page to make sure that you want to go through with being part of a clique!,
Study how they dress, imitate it, do not copy them exactly- if you come up to them wearing the same outfit, they will be shocked and creeped out.

,
Figure out what they find funny- it will be your new sense of humor.,
Find out how they talk to each other casually.,
Try to find out what they all have in common, or why they are friends.,
Form a small relationship with a member of the clique.,
Start talking to that one member more often.,
Once you think your friendship is strong enough, ask them who some of their friends are.,
Try to form friendships with one or more other members of the clique.,
Start hanging out with the clique members more often, but do not overdo it.,
Do not stalk them!,
Enjoy your new clique membership!",How to Get Into a Clique," If you want to be accepted you need to fit in because people like other people who are like them.You must carefully study their ways, manners of behavior and mentalities. After acquiring this knowledge, imitate them. Slowly assimilate into their ""clique culture"".
,, Work on your humor. In addition, funny comebacks are very popular with people. Although it is making fun of innocent people, it makes well-known people laugh with you and want to like you.

, Some groups might be very sarcastic, while others are very serious. Study their language, too. If they use many slang words, start talking like that. If they speak very properly or use many txt words, work on talking like that!

, This will show you how their mind works.

, If you are their friend, then they can get you in the clique. Nevertheless, try to be friends with one of the smaller people first off. Do not get ahead of yourself.

, Try to find something you both have in common. Study everything about her, but avoid becoming obsessed

, It is a great conversation topic, and you may even know one of them personally.

, That way you will know more than one person inside that clique, and the rest of that clique will judge you less or in a positive way.

, Sometimes they will think you are weird and/or stalking them. Be careful that you do not hang out with them too much in the first few weeks.

, If you are in some classes with them offer to help them with stuff. Just do not imply they are stupid! They could get very insulted by that.

, Remember to have fun, and do not turn into somebody you are not.

Dress well.,
Create cool hairstyles.,
Add makeup.,
Have a cool carpool to school.,
Use technology.,
Be on social media.,
Make your room into a hub.",How to Put Together Your Own Pretty Committee," A good amount of girls is three to six. There should be an alpha, beta, and other loyal chicks. After you find your perfect girls, befriend them, and invite them to a sleepover.


Do not have more than six girls in the group; after that, it is not very manageable as a clique.
Make the sleepovers weekly (or if your parents don't allow that, monthly), and you should have a chatty group of friends.;
, If you are on the wealthier side, wear designer labels. If you don't have that much money, shop at good basic clothing stores or vintage stores for designer looks.


Buy pretty, eye-catching jewelry. Get a signature piece of jewelry and gradually update every month or so. Have great accessories.
Always carry around a stylish purse that has your money, gum, wallet, cell phone, lip gloss, and notebook.

, If you like your natural hair color, stay with it. To change things up a little, get highlights. A drastic cut or complete color change can be pretty shocking, so really make sure you think it would look good if you decide to do it.


Wash your hair every day, with good shampoo and conditioner. Hair sprays, cremes, and mousses are great to use too.
For hairstyles, wear your hair half up, with a headband, or in a messy but preppy bun.
Buy cute but not tacky clips for your hair, and express your style with them.

, Massie uses lip gloss, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, and concealer. Since Glossip Girl isn't real, find your own signature brand. Buy a few different kinds of makeup and alternate each day.

, Have one of your siblings, parents, or drivers (if you can afford it) drive you to school. On the car ride to school you can dish gossip, play games like ""Would You Rather,"" or simply study for an upcoming test.

, Really have the works! Massie has an iPhone, iPod, iMac, Palm Pilot, and a TV. If you want something but your parents won't buy it for you, save up and get their permission to buy it with your own money. It's really worth it!

, Have a Facebook, AIM, iChat (if you have a Mac), an email, and accounts on other social media websites.

, Your room should be a place where people - including you - want to hang out! Pick a signature color, and make most of the things in your room that color (don't go overboard, though!). Buy a cool bedspread, lamps, bean bag, and a mannequin like Massie.

Make everyone envy you.For example when someone outside of your clique asks if you can come over, say,""what day?"",
Have a big party, but make it so it is even more envy for you.For instance,invite a person's best friend, but not the person.

","How to Make ""the Clique"" in Your Own School"," You need to be totally confident. That is the most important. Don't be shy, know how to start a conversation with anyone! Know you're better than them and dominate in every situation. Do not push it! If you do this wrong, you'll be annoying. If you don't, you'll be average. Also, you must know good comebacks and insults.

Purchase a great facial cleanser, toner and moisturizer and use them twice a day. You want to have clear, healthy skin.



 


Attain a classy, fashionable wardrobe.






Wear light makeup, NEVER overdo it. Kissable lips, eye-enhancing eyeshadow, and light blush are a must. Get some golden shimmer powder too, for special occasions.






Try to be perfect in every aspect. Bath and Body works has amazing stuff like hand scrub, body lotion and so on.





;
, Here's the positions of a clique:


Beta: She is your best friend. Betas get the gossip and have more power than anyone besides you. She is basically a clone of you and gets your clique known. Make sure to choose a beta that is confident and beautiful, but can't overthrow you. Trying to overthrow the beta is punishable by banishment.
Gamma: They are third in command. Gammas are followers and not nearly as powerful, but are more important than the deltas and omegas. They don't get as much input, but girls outside the clique would still kill to be one. The gammas should be pretty good friends with you. They have a fixed spot in the clique, not another 'come and go' girl. Choose gammas that have beta potential, aka the girls you might have chosen as a beta. You can usually have 1-3 gammas.
Delta: These girls are popular and funny, and don't exactly belong to a clique, they are just known everywhere. They come and go, and don't stand out. They have average/pretty good looks. Deltas don't have that 'one thing' that alphas, betas, and gammas have. Choose a delta(s) that is social and funny (that can increase your exposure) Don't be afraid to kick them out. They usually last 4 days-3 weeks. Let the gammas, deltas, and omegas fight amongst themselves for titles. You only need 1-2 deltas. They don't do anything really.
"" Omega: People wonder how she even got into the clique. They aren't very pretty, funny, or popular. However, they are used for the dirty work. Later you can make them eavesdrop or whatever. They can be annoying and clueless. Choose an omega that is desperate to be popular, but not an LBR. Make her do anything the gammas won't, then dump her on another clique.

, Once you become friends , now is the time to become popular!

,, and then say ""I'm not sure I can, I have a sleepover/I'm going to the movies/I'm going to the mall with my friends.""Then make an excuse to walk away.Laugh together a lot, share gossip, and say comments to others.

,"
"
Start with one best friend.,
Once you've found an appropriate amount of girls (an even amount of girls, probably 4 is suggested), start inviting them to hang out.,
Suggest starting a clique at the sleepover.,
Start to think of a name to call your clique.,
Get your clique known by hanging out in public places.,
Wear cute clothes!,
Start making alliances with other cliques.,
Don't let wannabees in.,
If you fight, try to end it as soon as possible.,
Get some matching accessories but in different color.,
Try to get more popular than other groups but don't be mean.

,
Don't try to be popular with being mean and being bad, remember, if you are trying to be popular, you have to be nice, so you'll have more and more friends.

,
Try meeting up with friends to get closer, if you don't you won't be really close to your friends and won't know each other so well.

,
Always smile and smell nice, if you smell bad people won't want to be your friend, and if you don't smile, people will think you don't like them.

,
If a someone comes up to you and says hi don't say something like umm... we don't allow ugly people here sorry, you can say hi and smile,then he/she will like you.

,
Don't brag about yourself like oh i have a hot boyfriend and he is so hot or i am so hot!, if you always talk about yourself, people will get the feeling that you are greedy or selfish

,
When you're talking about something, don't make you sentences so long like yesterday i went to the carnival and i went on the ride and i went on another one and i had fun and i dropped my cotton candy so i had to get another one... try to make it short like yesterday i went to the carnival, i went on so many rides it was so fun!

,
Try smiling, people will feel comfortable and relaxed around you when they know you are a nice person.

,
If you wear school uniforms, try customizing it like, wear a black jacket on top, and some boots, and a bit of makeup (e.g.. mascara, lip gloss) it will give you more confidence if you have to talk to people you don't know.

,
Don't do weird stuff (e.g..wipe your tongue with your shirt or pick your nose) people will always remember you as weird

,Avoid being jealous it can cause you lots of trouble

",How to Start a Clique in Seventh Grade," Scope out the other girls in your grade. See if there's another pair of best friends who aren't already in a clique. Poaching a girl from another clique will make your new clique hated before it's even together.;
, Try having a sleepover.

, If they don't want to, continue your friendship and casually suggest starting a clique at a later point. If they agree, move on to the next step.

, Don't call it the ""Pretty Committee"", that's stealing from a book, which will make your clique seem lame. You need to evaluate the cliques in your grade and see if they're named. If they aren't, you should consider skipping this step.

, Make inside jokes and basically become ""best friends for life"". Start a style in your clique. For example, your clique might wear skinny jeans, converse, Joe Jonas sunglasses, t-shirts (preferably from Forever 21 or Wet Seal), and side ponytails. Others may start to copy your style.

, Wear brands like Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle and Forever21. Shop for the latest trends. Wear a variety of different things like, a skirt one day, skinny jeans the next. NEVER wear the same outfit twice. You can wear the same shirt more than once but pair it with different things and different accessories to change up the outfit. Others will envy your style!

, The popular clique may hate you for a while, but once your clique has wannabes, they will now be the second-most popular clique and want to be your friend. Don't hold a grudge, be their friend.

, They will ruin your friendships. Don't let the once popular girls become too close of friends. They will just use you for popularity gain and eventually embarrass you.

, Don't insult them, but show that you appreciate them.

, Each person should have their own color.

"
Hair can make or break your entire outfit.,
Tops, tops, tops, oh my...,
Bottoms: (DUH!),
Always follow the two week rule.,
Don't wear the same OUTFIT for a month after you wear it.,
If you have your outfit all picked out, you need some accessories.,
Have one purse that you carry everywhere with you.,
Shoes: Must go with your outfit.,
Know when to dress for success.,
Make sure that it doesn't look like you're trying too hard.,
Know all of the latest trends.,
Your outfit must have a main focus so that all of the other things in your outfit work around it.",How to Dress Like an Alpha," So make sure it looks good. No frizzy hair, no out of place hair, and definitely no greasy hair. Buy Moroccan Oil to control frizz, make hair soft, and add tons of shine.


Shampoo/condition everyday (or every other day, at the VERY least). Use a good shampoo such as Bumble and Bumble, Redken, Garnier Fructis, Herbal Essences, etc. Use a conditioner that complements your shampoo, or you can even use a 2-in-1 shampoo + conditioner, if you're a busy bee!
Style! Make sure that you always have an adorable style! Never wear the same style for more than two days in a row. Try French braids, buns, headbands, hairbands, or side curls! Ala cute! (As the French say!)
Tools! You MUST own a flatiron, a curling iron, and a blow dryer. Or get a 3-in-1! A crimper is optional. It makes for amazing 'dos and styles. But don't use these tools everyday; too much heat can damage/dry out your hair. Same goes for dying!
Cute hair accessories are a must! Headbands, barrettes, cute clips, scrunchies, and beads are all accessories that will look absolutely adorable! Make sure that they go with your outfit, though. Don't be a clasher!;
, Tops can make you look hot, or not. They are one of the leading parts of your outfit. Tops represent you, so make sure you're picking the right one! if you live in a cold, snowy area, you might consider layers. If you live in the sun, you might consider v-necks with a plaid jacket. (SO cute!) V-necks are flirty and relaxed. they come in plain or print. You should probably wear an undershirt under them (because they can get pretty low). Abercrombie & Fitch and Victoria's Secret Pink have some stylish v-necks that will make you look twice your age! Tanks and camisoles are good choices for working out or sleepwear. T-shirts are OK, but they can't be big and bulky. Long sleeved shirts are good too! Try some tops with embroidering or beads to really spice up your look!

, Your pants/skirts/shorts MUST go with your top. Like tops, it all depends on the weather. Shorts are for sports and sunny days. Don't wear soccer or basketball shorts to school, only wear them for casual lounge wear and games. Short shorts are cute for the summer, carnivals, beaches, and weekend wear. You can wear them to school too! But... you gotta have the legs to wear shorts! Your legs have to be tone and strong and not hairy, big turn-off! Jeans are great, but you need styles that flatter your figure. Skirts, dresses, and minis are good also. Make sure they look glam, girl!

, Don't wear the same article of clothing for two weeks after you wear it, especially with tops. Also, follow the one month rule.

, But you can repeat articles of clothing, as long as you follow the two week rule.

, Outfits MUST come complete with: jewelry, purses, belts, and scarves/hats/gloves if the weather is frosty! If you have your ears pierced, try wearing diamond studs or pink loops with hearts... maybe even funky beads with tiny elephants! Spice it up a little!

, It must hold: a cell phone, a compact mirror, a mini brush, some extra hair stuff, and lip gloss. Gum and mints are a must because they make your breath smell good! Bring at least two flavors of lip gloss everywhere you go. Have a collection of lip gloss, maybe from Lip Smacker, because they have so many types and flavors and collections!

, Shoes complete your outfit. You must have at least one of the following shoes: Uggs, sandals, flip flops, riding boots, flats, and an everyday shoe. Don't wear your everyday shoe absolutely everyday, but wear it most of the time. Your everyday shoe should not be sneakers. (Unless you're jogging or doing anything sporty!)

, Of course, you should dress for success everyday, but there are a few days where you need to really work it. Mondays and Fridays are the days that you should reserve your best outfits for. However, remember to wear adorable things every single day.

, Your outfit needs to looks effortless, or else no one will envy you. You need effortless beauty.

, Always be the first to try them. Subscribe to style magazines such as Seventeen and Teen Vogue.

, For example, if you have a really eye-catching top, just wear simple bottoms, shoes, and accessories.

Pick your best and closest friends to be in this clique.,
Interact with Others.,
Get comfy with the boys.,
Be a party person.,
Step out of your comfort zone.,
Know your foes: They'll be a lot of admirers but also jealous haters you'll try to get you down.,
Get involved.,
Influence younger girls.",How to Create the Most Popular Clique in School," If you don't have any best/closest friends, make some! Only attract good and nice people into your life that will be loyal and surely support you through thick and thin. Trust is the base of all good and mutual friendship.;
, The first rule in popularity is to socialize. Be cool, laid-back and polite towards everyone you see (even if movies like MEAN GIRLS express that you don't have to be this way). This can begin with your partner in class, people sitting on your table. Just a quick ""hey"" or even a COMPLIMENT can work its magic in no time! But this rule doesn't apply with the person you're talking to is really annoying/rude.

, Even if you're not a tomboy, boys can be pretty cool to hang out with. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to have a boyfriend but even a friendly flirt will get you closer and also expand your clique to.

, Parties are ace for socializing but even if you don't get invited to one (which I doubt highly!), have your own! It might not be an actual dance boy/girl party, but a shopping spree, cinema trip or even a sleepover. But be known for having the best get-togethers ever; this way people will want you to invite them too!

, This is the ugly truth- people generally dislike dull, boring, shy and quiet people. People like wild, funny, loud, kind and daring girls who brighten up everyone's day. Doing something as simple as walking up to a complete stranger and saying something random will make people think you're confident and collected.

, Ignore them as much as possible but if they really get to you, STAND UP FOR YOURSELF!!! Shoot them an icy look and say something short, sweet and sharp that'll make them feel small. Look at some of the stereotypical bitchy people on the TV: Marc St. James (the guy receptionist) on UGLY BETTY, Kelly Jones (the Head Girl) from St. Trinians, Alex Russo on WIZARDS OF WAVERLEY PLACE and Mercedes and Kurt on GLEE. They're not afraid to stick up for themselves or their friends. Plus you don't to even fight. If your foe looks like she's about to throw a fist or give a slap or whatever, just say something like, ""It's a shame you have to stoop so low that you're willing to fight me. Poor you"" or even, ""Well I guess this means I'm the bigger person here"". That'll teach them.

, Everyone loves an all-rounder. So get stuck in in activities and clubs like orchestra, the school paper, the sports team or if there is one- a dance/prom committee. Your name will be on everyone's lips. It's a promise.

, By now, at least SOME girls will look up to you. Instead of taking advantage of that, acknowledge it. Ask them to join your table at lunch, say hi, create a handshake or even compliment them. Say things like, ""Your hair looks really cute like that!"" or ""Hey, I love your top! Where'd you get it?"" They'll feel so appreciated.

"
"
Have a clique.,
Have confidence.,
Look good.,
Get the right attitude.,
Dress with style.,
Learn to handle gossip delicately.",How to Become the Queen Bee of Your School," There should be two to six people who stick by your side. Your group should consist of trustworthy, close friends who love you for who you are. Be sure that they are loyal, smart, and well-dressed, as well as good role models for the rest of your classmates to follow. In order to convince them to remain your friends, allow them to have some of the spotlight as well. Give them equal attention and love, as well as small gifts to show your appreciation for them. Individual clique members vary, but refer to the list below in order to have an idea of an official clique:



The Alpha. She is the leader of the group.

The Beta. She is your best friend who loves but doesn't idolize you. You should be able to trust her with your secrets and reveal some of your imperfections.

The Sweetheart. She can act as a buffer during fights, as well as emotional support for those who are feeling down. Also, she is excellent at conversing with adults. Additionally, she should have similar qualities to the rest of your clique, but she will be softer and sweeter.

The Pro. She will have one or more major talents, such as being an actress or an athlete.

The Party Animal. She will be the life of the party: but with class.

The Middle Ground. She is the standard popular girl. Although the rest of your clique may be talented and outgoing, she will be average and tone down the rest of the group. Despite the fact that she will appear to be a regular teenager, she will perform a teenager's tasks better than anyone else can.;
, Being proud of who you are is essential in popularity. Insecure people are often searching for a good role model to follow, and you must fill the position in order to become popular. Use the tips below to boost your confidence:



Be happy with your appearance. While many people may wish they could change their looks, use a different mindset from them. Realize that you are uniquely beautiful, despite what society says.

If you are unhappy with your appearance, use this method to boost your confidence: put on excess makeup until you appear sickening. Wear it for an hour and constantly look in mirrors. Later, wash it off and look in a mirror again. See how cute and naturally beautiful you appear? That's how the world sees you.



Take care of your personal hygiene. By keeping your body clean, you'll feel more confident. Take daily showers, and wash your face with natural products to prevent pimples. Wear deodorant or perfume, and keep your nails and hair trimmed to an appropriate length. Also, if you are old enough, and if your parents give you permission, shave your legs to prevent them from being too hairy. Take care of your body, and you will be rewarded for your efforts.

Wear makeup. To enhance your beauty, apply basic makeup to your face. Keep it as natural as possible in order to avoid appearing fake.

Participate in different hobbies or activities. By allowing yourself to have adventures in the world, you'll be able to discover more about yourself during your times of relaxation. Find a new hobby or an activity for some spice in your life.

Spend quality time with your family or close friends. Get to know your loved ones. Go out on a special event or vacation with them. By spending time with the people who love you, you'll feel happy with yourself.

Tackle a big project. While your goal doesn't have to be huge, completing an objective can boost your confidence. It'll give you a sense of accomplishment, and you'll feel prepared to take on life's larger tasks.

Go shopping. Browse your favorite stores for sales or discounts. Buy yourself a cute outfit that complements your body type and skin tone. If it helps, have a family member or a friend accompany you to give you advice.

, In order to become a role model for your classmates, you'll need to have a lovely appearance. By taking care of your body, you'll reap the benefits and brighten your beauty.


Hair is often considered the defining feature of your body. Take good care of your locks by purchasing shampoo and conditioner of excellent quality. Additionally, get a haircut that flatters your face shape. Every four to eight weeks, you should receive a trim in order to encourage hair growth and remove split ends. Also, when styling your hair, choose popular, attractive hairstyles that complement your face type. Examples are messy buns, half ponytails, ponytails, and braids. Add cute accessories to your hair for a unique look.
Keep your face clean and clear. By using cleanser, toner, and moisturizer on a daily basis, you'll ward off unwelcome pimples and oily skin. Also, apply light, natural makeup to enhance your beauty and cover up flaws.
Maintain your personal hygiene. Take good care of your teeth by brushing them at least twice a day and flossing them at least once a day. For good breath, use mouthwash. Additionally, take daily showers using good soap and an exfoliating glove for smooth, soft skin. Shave or wax any hair that needs removing. Also, clean your nails and receive manicures or pedicures if you wish.
Stay in shape. By completing thirty minutes of exercise per day, you'll maintain your weight and gain a fit body. Also, eat healthy, organic foods.

, Treat everyone you meet with a neutral but friendly air in order to leave a good impression. Being polite to them will give them no reason to become your enemy or accuse you of acting mean. However, while you should be kind and sweet to your classmates, avoid being a goody-two-shoes. Don't be afraid to scratch back if someone makes a jab at you, but refrain from becoming a bully. The queen never openly attacks people.


Have circles of friends and acquaintances. Although you should mainly stick with your clique, it doesn't hurt to have other connections. While you don't necessarily have to speak with every one of your casual friends on a daily basis, keep in touch with them.
If a person in your circle puts you down, demote her a little and coax a secret out of her. This is more effective and less cruel.

, Purchase clothing from popular brands, and occasionally splurge on expensive outfits. Choose unique outfits that other people won't have, but refrain from dressing in a strange, unattractive fashion. Your clothing choices should be appropriate for events you wish to attend (ex: wear a prom dress to prom, not a tennis dress). Additionally, choose colors and flattering cuts that complement your body and skin tone. Be sure you pair your outfits with cute shoes and complementing accessories, including a cute handbag. It is recommended that you have at least one or two designer items. These may consist of a purse, a pair of shoes (preferably heels or flats), or a piece of jewelry.


Popular brands are Abercrombie, American Eagle, Topshop, Hollister, Forever 21, Old Navy, Aeropostale, GUESS?, and Tommy Hilfiger. If you want to go the extra mile, stores such as Juicy Couture, Marc Jacobs, Urban Outfitters, and American Apparel are excellent choices.
Stay updated with fashion magazines in order to know what's hot and what's not. Although you can allow your style to be inspired by different outfits, do not entirely copy the models' appearances. Instead, steal a little of their style and add it to yours for a unique blend. Excellent magazines include Teen Vogue, Seventeen, and Elle.

Jeans should be a great fit without causing your hips to overlap the edges (which results in an unattractive muffin top).
While you might be tempted to sneer at other people's outfit choices, treat them with respect. Realize that they have their own style, despite how you believe they should dress.

, Everywhere you go, gossip will follow. Although you might try to please everyone, not all people will refrain from gossiping about you, no matter how good you may appear. Avoid gossiping about your close friends. Only spread information about a person behind their back if you believe they deserve it. However, if you choose to spread rumors, do it subtly in order to avoid tarnishing your reputation..

Speaking of keeping your parents proud, always do an innocent act in front of parents.",How to Be the Alpha Girl of Your School," Not 'an' attitude but 'the' attitude. Be sweet to everyone you can stand to be sweet too. If there is someone who you cannot handle, stay away from them. The alpha girl never openly attacks anyone - It's mostly the loners who attack. Have some good insults and come backs, though. If someone insults you, act as though you don't care. Give them an evil-innocent look and finish it off with a witty insult. For some good insults, click this link: http://www.humorsphere.com/insults/ But remember, only use insults when needed. And NEVER re-use an insult. That will just seem lame.;
, Let's start with the hair. Use a fabulous good quality hair shampoo & conditioner like Redken or Bumble & Bumble. NEVER have dandruff or greasy hair (Gross!). Always have a different hair style at school. For instance, have your hair in a slick, glamorous ponytail for P.E, have it curly/wavy on normal days and straighten it for special occasions. Your hair must be beautiful at all times. Try to grow it long, too.

, Eat plenty of fruits. Vegetables are great, but fruit will give you clear skin and the body all Vogue models envy. Treat yourself occasionally, though. Have 2-4 truffles after dinner if you have a sweet tooth. Diets are all about will power!

, DO NOT have bright eye shadow and lipstick. Alphas can't be clowns! Glossy lips, rosy cheeks and a touch of mascara is the look you should aim for. Always have a mani and a pedi on your nails!

, Okay, you've probably heard this HEAPS, but really, no one wants to be talking to someone with tuna breath. brush your teeth twice a day, and use floss and mouth wash. Get braces if you need them, but try to get them clear or in a chic colour, like lavender or silver. Get your teeth whitened if needed. Have clear skin at all times! It won't happen overnight, it may take months. So get to work NOW! Use a cleaner, toner and moisturiser to keep that skin looking fresh. Use an acne scrub if needed.

, Make sure that what you're wearing is IN. DO NOT be caught in last season's clogs. It's hard and costs a fair amount of money to keep updated. But it is required. You don't have to wear designer labels, though. Remember, it doesn't matter if your shoes are Dior or Target, it only matters how you wear them, as Vogue says. It is a nice idea though to carry a designer purse, such as Guess or Coach. Save up for one or get one for your birthday or Christmas. If one garment is designer, people will think the rest are, too!

, Constantly read magazines like Vogue or Seventeen. Have all of the latest technology 'extras', too, like the iPhone, a laptop, an iPod and a Kindle. Get them encrusted with Swarovski crystals for an added touch of glamour.

, First, pick a signature colour, like baby pink, lavender, pastel blue or turquoise or whatever. Paint your walls in that colour, then add some white furnishings. Display all of your high heels for a boutique vibe, and for serious style, add a mannequin. Remember to keep it clean at all times! Make it the sort of room that people envy.

, Have extremely hot photos of yourself on there. Show those losers at school that you know how to work the camera! Try to start a fashion blog, too. This is something that will gain you popularity instantly. Brag a little, too. Share your purchases!

, Dress it up in cute pet outfits like Juicy Couture, and give it a sweet name.

, Accessory ideas include brooches, charm bracelets or hair bows.

, Have 1-4 other friends. If you don't want a clique, just try hanging out with one other extremely stylish girl, like Hannah from Pretty Little Liars. Your clique must be loyal and stylish. Forming a clique with losers is just not acceptable! If there is one loser, give her a total makeover. Invite her over to your huge, nicely-decorated house and teach her how to apply makeup etc, then take her shopping to buy some cute outfits! An alpha of your clique isn't needed, but if there is one, make sure it's you! Have a few clothing rules, too, like no jeans or sweat pants. Don't be too bossy, though, because then your friends will leave you. And you don't want that to happen, trust me. Have a matching accessory, too, like diamond earrings or matching bangles.

, Flirt a little. Make them come to you, don't come to them. Have a boyfriend if possible. This will totally boost your ranking.

, Don't let popularity take over. Make sure you're in the top classes for every subject! Keep mommy and daddy proud.

, That way, they think you're just a sweet innocent girl, which you are, right?

If you buy gift sets, they generally also come with body wash and body shimmer lotion so you won't have any conflicting scents.
Body sprays work too! If you buy the kind by Secret, you can match it with your deodorant for the best effect.

If you have time make a secret cute language.",How to Have the Most Glam Worthy Clique in School," A clique is a fabulous buddy-system. Basically these girls are your sisters. Think big like Sex and the City. All those grown women are friends. Your friends need to be focused on meeting each others demands. The school needs to envy your strong bond with one another.;
, You need to have your own fashion sense. Don't copy those others at school. Read Seventeen and Harper's Bazaar for ideas. Start a new trend, having the followers of your school copy you. Never repeat an outfit. Don't wear the same garment up to 2 weeks. If you do re-wear an outfit don't wear it until a month and several days have past. Have your clique show their style.

, Do not spend all day on Facebook. Your clique doesn't need a useless account on Facebook. Texting is a better form of communication. All have clean reps, you don't want to be notorious as some of the girls from Gossip Girl. IM each other on a specific day. Communicate often to stay in touch.

, You have to have a certain spot you sit in lunch. Have your signature spot, where no one will bother to take since you marked your territory. Sit outside in the sun or indoors. Have a seating order, you all should know what seat to sit in.

, Over weekends and some weekdays the group needs to know where to go. Have an annual event planned. Also when at the mall know where to shop at. The stores should be stores the whole clique can afford and likes. Have a clique member decide what the next trip is. Have the members take turns on where to go. Devote at least 2 weeks in a month to hang out in the weekend.

, Your clique should dress a specific way. Some girl cliques are Preps, which wear Hollister tanks and matching skirts with Vera Bradley knapsacks and purses. Other groups dress emo or scene and shop at Hot Topic. If your clique behaves or act in a certain way make it match with what clothes.

, It's not a hot idea to accept new girls to your cohort. One girl you add can split your clique up. If you do consider adding a new girl make sure you all know her. You have to know how she's like if you do add her.

, The clique should go to a specific house daily. Most likely the leader of the group should hold slumber parties and meeting at her house. Make sure if you are the leader you have a groomed house and room. Don't be messy, especially if you have pets. Be neat and tidy. Provide snacks and yummy refreshments. You don't want your friends starving or dehydrated.

, You want the whole school to know your name, in a good way. You have to be well-known like Oprah or Lady Gaga. You have to be on people's minds. Do amazing things like talent show. Do a hot dance number for talent show with your clique and win. Join the Drama Club and be in the plays with your clique. Apply for clubs and athletic groups. Volleyball and Cheer are popular cliques at my school.

, Have a signature thing about your clique. As in special bracelets or cutting edge fashion.

, Nothing dumb- come up with code names.

"
"
Pick and Choose.,
Name your clique.,
Have a cool carpool for school.,
Have Friday Night Sleepovers with your group.,
Host the hottest parties.,
Use clique-talk.,
Signature!,
Stay in touch with your girls.,
Try to have a boyfriend.,
Make sure people know about you.",How to Form Your Own Pretty Committee," Which girls will be lucky enough to be part of your crew? 4-6 people is a good amount. Find a beta (like Alicia), a gamma (like Dylan), a delta (like Kristen), and followers (like Claire). You should be the alpha, obviously! Once you find your group, send them a cute note inviting them to your clique! Buy nice stationary from a store like Papyrus. The girls will be thrilled when they receive their exclusive invite!;
, Don't call your clique the Pretty Committee-it makes you look like an eternal wannabe. Instead, come up with your own name that will have people looking up to you. Some examples are the Glossy Posse, Beauty Queens, Six Chicks (if there are six of you), Fab Five or Fab Four. You could also come up with a name that uses your initials (e.g. HOT for Haley, Olivia, Talia or CHIC for Cara, Hannah, Izzy, Carly).

, Get a parent, sibling, or chauffeur to drive you and your BFFs to school. If you have money, get a mini fridge (Massie stocks hers with berries and soda) in the car, and listen to great tunes all the way to school. You can also play games like What Would You Rather? and spill gossip to see who can earn the most gossip points. At the end of the week, the Gossip Girl ( gossip point winner) should get a special prize. Make a rule that nobody leaves the car until they are rated from a scale of 1-10. At least a 7.5 is mandatory, and every girl's ratings are added to their gossip point score. Lastly, ask your driver to park right in front of the school- you want to make an entrance, right?

, Have a strict GLU (girls like us) policy and only invite people from your clique. Have great snacks and fun. Have the sleepover in the GLU headquarters (a room where you and your friends usually hang). You could have a theme for each sleepover like camping, fashion, or special ones for holidays. At these Sleepovers you can gossip, give makeovers, and talk about who's hot and who's not.

, Only invite the coolest and most popular people- discuss a guest list with your friends at your Friday Night Sleepover. Make it a boy-girl party if you're old enough and your parents allow it. Though the party will be exclusive, everyone at school, including the LBR's (losers beyond repair) should know about it. Have amazing food, and play games like spin-the-bottle.

, For example, LBR, GLU, ah-mazing, ah-dorable, rate me, etc. Also have excellent comebacks. Don't use the ones Massie uses in the books-the series is very popular and if someone recognizes one of Massie's comebacks, they might think you're a wannabe. Instead, create your own comebacks - as long as they leave your victim tongue-tied, they work!

, A fun idea is to have each girl in the clique have a signature color, perfume, clothing brand, and lip gloss. Don't go anywhere without your signature perfume and lip gloss, and try to wear your signature clothing brand as often as possible. For colors, possibilities are endless. You could have pens, folders, notebooks, nail polishes, and much more in your personal color. Signature items are important because it shows individuality, but you also need to show togetherness. A fun idea is to get your clique matching charm bracelets with the first letters of your names on them, and one additional charm per person. They will make it known who is a part of THE group (and who isn't). Here is an example from my clique (my beta's signature stuff): Color: Pink, Perfume: Marc Jacobs Daisy, Brand: Marc Jacobs, Gloss: MAC lipgloss in Budding Love, Charm on bracelet: Rhinestone Rose

, IM, AIM, call, text, iChat, and Skype with your friends as often as possible. Make sure you all have a Facebook, (if you are allowed to), and be sure to post about all of your fun times. If you just went to the mall on Sunday and raided Gucci, be sure to let the world know. You can even make a special blog so that your clique can update everyone on what's happening with the A-List of your school-everyone will want to read it!

, Only do this if there is someone you like, but it is good to have one. If your friends have guys too, you can group date-so much fun! If one of your girls doesn't have a boyfriend, help her get with the guy she likes!

, Strut through your schools hallways like you own them and set trends. Become friends with everyone and don't make any enemies. Don't be matchy-matchy with the girls in your clique, because then you won't stand out as the alpha.

"
"
Pick a leader.,
After you pick your leader, you need to find loyal subjects.,
Make sure you have a range of people.,
Always follow your leader's directions.,
Be obedient and efficient.,
Be the second prettiest girl in the clique.,
Never flirt with the leader's crush, boyfriend, or brother.,
Give her space!,
Be yourself.,
Above all: Be loyal.",How to Be the Perfect Beta," Make sure she is clever, pretty, and has great leadership skills. She should be able to make great decisions and come up with fool-proof plans in a short amount of time. She should be smart and witty and have the same sense of humor as you. You won't want to fake-laugh your way through a friendship, and you won't want to have an incredibly clever moment and receive little or no credit for it. In short, don't pick somebody whose head you'll soon want to rip off.;
, They should be just as pretty. Pick at least two people to be in your clique. They should also have the same sense of humor and witty comebacks as you and your alpha. They should not be competitive in the sense of friendship. Meaning, they shouldn't try to become the new beta.

, The members of your group should range from being dumb but good-hearted to sarcastic and sassy. This puts chemistry in your clique and gives you more scandal to work from! It makes it easier to get along with everyone, when you don't have every little thing in common. It is nice if the followers are smart, but they don't have to - and shouldn't - be super-intelligent kid geniuses. We're going for a couple of lasting friendships and a few intelligent conversations here, not a blue ribbon. In ""Mean Girls"", you have Regina, the leader, Gretchen, the gossip, and Karen, the honest idiot. In ""The Clique"" series, there's Massie, the fearless alpha, Alicia, the beautiful gossip, Dylan, the diet-obsessed comic, and Kristen, the grades-concerned athlete. (Later, you enter Claire, the sweet and trustworthy outsider.) Consider this diversity when you choose your new group of friends, but make sure that everybody still meshes well. An airhead will quickly get on the nerves of your quick-witted leader, and the perpetual conscience of a goody-two-shoes will soon annoy those up to a revenge plot.

, Failure to do so can get you demoted to follower-status. It's fine if you feel extremely uncomfortable doing something - stick to your conscience! Also, it's good if you're your own person and do what you prefer. But if you constantly refuse to do what your alpha asks you to do, it is annoying and pointless to have a lazy beta in the mix, particularly if your reason for not doing something has to do with pride. Danger or extreme terms (such as expulsion) - fine, don't follow orders. But you wanted a leader, and now that she's giving you orders, you shouldn't just back down.

, When your leader tells you do something do it immediately. Don't wait until after you've bought and sipped at a fat-free vanilla latte - do it now! Prioritize - if school is important to you, then do your homework before following orders. But if you feel like you might want to watch ""Dirty Dancing"" then you can forget about this clique you've created. The alpha thinks of the plans and you go through with them. In return, she trusts you the most, takes your advice over the advice of others, and gives you the most lenience of everyone. Not to mention that you have the second highest hall cred, along with the fact that when the alpha wants to throw out her True Religions? You're the first person she thinks of. Dibs, anyone?

, Well, try to. Make sure your leader is slightly prettier than you. That way you guys can be closer and she might let you one day be the leader. Or she will be closer with you.

, She will automatically either kick you out or make someone else her beta. These people are completely OL (Off Limits) and you should never even consider it.

, Your alpha thinks up the schemes. She's the one who weasels you out of the big hole that you've just dug for yourself. She's the one who is constantly coming up with new ideas to entertain you, the third-in-command, and the delta when you go to her house for sleepovers or during carpool. She works her butt off for you. Give her space. Don't be the annoying kid in the back of the car who asks the same question every five minutes: ""Are we there yet?"" In this case, however, the repetitive question would be: ""Are you done yet?"" Are you done thinking of my plan yet? Are you done finding something suitable to wear because we went shopping while you planned a party for us yet? Are you done? Are you done? Are you done? She will get sick of this very quickly. She will snap. You will not want to be the source of her anger.

, You don't have to change your personality just because you're a beta. Sure, you may admire your alpha a lot - that's fine. But don't turn into her. She won't think that's flattering - she'll think that's a rip-off. Instead, tell her that you like her new boots and refrain from buying an exact pair, even if it is in a different color. Don't copy her new phrase. Don't do your hair the same way she did it yesterday. Don't buy a crimper like the one she just bought. Don't buy that bedspread, tee shirt, or even accessory of hers, even if it is to die for. When the alpha makes a day to match, like say, pink shirts, cut offs, or juicy purses one day, that's different. In short, Don't. Copy. Her. Period.

, Be quick-witted when your alpha falls. Make her laugh. Amaze her with your style and beauty. Don't pretend to be someone you're not - she'll see right through it. Don't back stab her. Don't talk back. Joke around with her - she's your friend. Be yourself.

Take care of your body.",How to Be the Alpha Female," This first step is certainly the hardest, but it is the most important. You need to realize that you have opinions and ideas that are worth being heard. If you don't see yourself as valuable, worthy of respect, or competent, then no one else will.;
, The fastest ways to build confidence in yourself is pretend in order to make your confidence believable. You want to convince yourself as well as everyone around you that you're self-assured and capable.

, Determine what you like best about yourself and your best talents and skills. You might be a good listener, imaginative, or empathetic to friends. Leave that list somewhere you can read it every day to remind yourself.

, For example, push yourself to meet and network with three new people a day. You will become more comfortable with yourself around all sorts of people and develop a web of contacts. Once you've completed one goal, make a new one to work towards so that you're always pushing yourself to be more personable and popular.

, You want to be critical of yourself in a healthy way that helps you grow as a person. Avoid being negative though. Be careful to not beat yourself up to where you doubt yourself. Give yourself constructive criticism in private and not in front of others because that may tell them that you don't think of highly of yourself and neither should they. , As the alpha, you want people to recognize that you are important and worthy of their respect. This will not happen overnight; you will need to work on building relationships where people can see your integrity and honesty. Those two traits, as well as eloquence, charm, and a strong work ethic will help build up your character in people's eyes.


Even though you want the majority of people to like you, there will be people who do not. The end goal though is for people to respect you, whether they agree with you or not. They may not like you as a friend or coworker, but make sure that they can't deny your honesty, passion, and strength.

, Obviously, if you insult or hurt someone or make a mistake, you need to own up to it. But don't apologize for things that you are not accountable for because you will be perceived as weak. Females can be especially susceptible to wanting to apologize for every inconvenience but you need to determine when situations require a ""pardon me""or ""I'm deeply sorry."" , Take responsibility for your actions and own up to everything you do, whether it's an accomplishment or a mistake. This is the kind of honesty and integrity that people associate with good leaders. You don't want to blame situations or other people for your mistakes., If you want people to look to you in times of stability as well as crisis, you need to be the one who does not appear to be affected by stress and pessimism. You may need to set aside emotions in order to see clearly through the storm of chaos, whether it's a looming deadline at work or a friend comes to you for help in search of advice. Use humor to lift others out of the stress, whether it's sarcastic, dry, or sincere.

, First, you need to determine what you want out of life. That could be any number of things, such as a raise, a healthy and stable family, a great relationship, respect and power, or even just being happy overall. Then, once you know what it is you want to acquire, go after it.Do not be afraid. If you feel that you have a right to higher wages or respect from others, then don't hesitate.
Be prepared to give an answer as to why you want something. You may not always have to negotiate or argue, but you want to be prepared.
Speak clearly and firmly when asking. Hesitation is a sign of weakness. Be persistent and don't give up because your perseverance will be respected in the long run.
Don't plead or whine because that comes across as weak. Instead, act like you will get what you want so that it will show others that you are serious about this goal or proposition.

, Alpha females are like ""social conductors.""They have the ability to be the center of attention where people will listen to what they say and do.


You don't have to be the loudest person in the room. No matter how much you say, make sure it is worth hearing. Your words have impact on the people who look up to you so take time to think before you speak.

, Ask other people about themselves and be interested in them rather than turning the spotlight on yourself. If you want to be interesting, be interested in others. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, and they will like you for listening to them.

, You want others to know when you're around and that the atmosphere of the room is different now that you've arrived. Practice walking into a room with your head held high, shoulders down, and a straight, firm walk. Act like you expect people to pay attention to you and they will.

, Being an alpha female means that you can't be a loner. You want to be well-liked by everyone you meet and cultivate relationships that may one day lead to a future job promotion or an exciting party invitation. Don't forget to introduce people to each other. Take advantage of when you're the one person everyone knows in a group and introduce people.

, You won't be best friends with the whole world, but you can make the effort to commit people's names to memory and learn something simple about them. When you remember them later, they'll like you because you made them feel important and memorable. However, remember to also have a close-knit group of friends and family on whom you can rely on to be your personal support system.

, Alpha female traits are steeped in feminist ideals such as the notion that women should be unified and stand together in society.Being alpha female does not mean that you put down other women and degrade them in order to elevate your own status. Instead, you should strive to create a strong group of women whether in your workplace or social life.


Use your power and influence to help better others rather than isolating yourself. Take the time to get to know the women around you and learn to see their value.
This can lead to mentorship. Mentoring other women is a great way to use your power for good. You have the ability to influence other people and develop their skills in the workplace or socially.You have the ability to cultivate the attitude of a group. It's better to develop a healthy bond with other women rather than surround yourself with those who would rather stir up contention and drama.

, As alpha female, you need to stay at the top of your game. That may mean keeping up with the latest fashion trends or going the extra mile at work to make a good impression on your boss. As alpha female you need to avoid being stagnant. Push yourself to grow and learn about your job field, hobbies, or other interests., You should be capable of doing things for yourself and not be the damsel in distress in situations.This shows others that you are competent and don't need anyone.


Just because you can fix a flat tire yourself or cook a meal for a party by yourself, doesn't mean that you can't recognize your your friends', family's, or coworkers' talents and abilities and get them involved.
Asking others to come alongside of you and work together makes them feel needed and valued and they will look to you as the alpha.

, You don't have to be decked out in a blazer, pencil skirt, and heels with a corner office to gain respect and attention from others. Dress to your own style and be consistent with it. Wear clothes that are presentable but that you also feel comfortable in in order to build your own confidence and communicate it to others.Invest in tailoring. Clothing that is too big or too tight will subconsciously show people that you don't know your own body and how to properly dress yourself.
Pick out a few accessories that stand out. You can make people interested in you by choosing striking accessories such as a statement necklace or brightly colored shoes or purses.

, This is a simple step but an important one. Smiling tells people that you are positive, are liable, and can be trusted. Appearing positive and well-groomed is a way to boost people's loyalty to you as the alpha., As an alpha female, people will look to you for direction in life so being healthy and fit is important. It's one way to set a positive example for the people under your influence as well as protect your body from the stress of life. Be careful not to conforming to popular fads and diet trends that may not work so that you are taking care of yourself and setting a good example for others."

Get in shape.,
Focus on eating healthy, not starving yourselves!,
Because the Victoria’s Secret Angels are always looking tan all year round, it is a good idea to use a gradual self-tanner to achieve a warm golden glow.,

Go for a flawless, yet natural look with your makeup.,
File your nails and paint them with French manicure paint, no crazy colors (save that for the rockers!).,

Cure your bad reputation.",How to Be Known at School As the Victoria's Secret Clique," It is best to be at a healthy weight and have a healthy body if you are striving for the look of a Victoria’s Secret Angel. This workout circuit inspired by the Victoria’s Secret Angels will make you firmer all over (*credit to celebrity-diets.org):. Also, Victoria's Secret models are curvy. If you do not have big breasts (size 32C-36C) you may have some problems with looking like an Angel. So, do 30 push ups, tricep push ups, side push ups, wall push ups, chest press, overhead raises, etc. Do exercises that relate to anything that works out your pectoral muscles, and be sure to do about 30 of them everyday. If you have humongous breasts that are size D, you might have to lose weight to get that small waist you want but that is okay. Angels have small waists too. Do crunches, dancing, sit ups, V ups, oblique crunches, twist crunches, the hundred, twist crunches, and bicycle crunches to shrink your waist and get nice abs. Preferably your waist should be between 23 and 25 inches.To be part of the Victoria Secret family, you will need a nice butt. Usually, models butts are usually as large as their breasts. The models do exercises such as leg raises, kickbacks, lunges, calf raises, etc. This is to tone, enlarge, and tighten butt muscles. Perfect measurements are 34-24-34 but if you are pretty close to this measurement you are perfect enough to be a Victoria Secret Model.;
, Try your best not to count calories obsessively and try to focus more on concentrating on eating mostly organic foods. Organic fruits, veggies, whole grains (whole wheat bread and brown rice are good choices), yogurt, and limited fats make for a balanced diet (for more information, research how many servings of each food group you should consume for optimum health). Don’t deprive yourself…have an ice cream cone, candy bar, or some salty snack once a week for a treat! Try to follow the food pyramid recommendations and continue to eat healthy. You can achieve this by making an account on Super Tracker. This will help you monitor how much you need to eat, exercise, and help you set weight goals. The plan is personalized to your needs, even to weight gain or loss, making it perfect for you.

, Some good gradual self tanners are Jergen’s Natural Glow body moisturizer (don’t use this on your face, they carry a variety for the face too) and Olay Touch of Sun. I wouldn’t recommend drugstore self-tanners, they may make you look orange. Before applying the lotion, it is best to exfoliate all over (shave too!) and then apply the lotion before bed. To play up the tan, use a shimmery body lotion to give you a sexy glow. Apply it to your collarbone and cleavage, where it will be noticed most. Bath and Body Works carries a good variety. Don't forget bronzer! Dust some bronzer on your cheeks, nose, and forehead to give you a nice tan.

, When you wake up after having your essential 8 hours of sleep (sleeping too much will make you more tired), play with your hair. Blow-dry it to give it some volume and use a wide barrel curling iron (don’t set the heat too high or else you’ll risk burning your hair) to create soft waves. On other days, you can wear it straightened or in a high messy ponytail. Don't get side bangs, just run your hands through your hair to the side. Also, for less damage, you can shower at night (remember to wash your hair every 3 days and condition daily) and around your bedtime, spray in a curling spray and wrap your hair into a tight bun (or two) on top of your head to give you pretty curls in the morning. Use a deep conditioner once a week and use either a moisturizing, shining, or volumizing shampoo and conditioner on your hair. Ombre is also in right now. That is when you have darker hair near the top of your head and lighter hair near the bottom. It kind of looks like you are growing your hair out and it has been 6 months yet you won't dye it or get highlights. Actually, that is a great way to get ombre hair.

, If it is dull-looking or brassy, you can consider getting it colored (please, go to a salon for this). Otherwise, work with what you’ve got! However, don't forget the power of highlights. If you have ashy colored hair, you can give it some warm highlights with lemon juice and sunlight. If you have black hair, highlights aren't necessary, but midnight blue look fabulous. If you have dark brown hair, auburn or caramel look enticing. For medium browns, light brown, dark blonde, and caramel look amazing. For light brunettes, dark blonde, light red, and medium brown are awesome. Blondes of all shades look good with lighter and darker shades of blonde along with strawberry blonde. Red heads can go with other shades of red and light brown.

, If you have bad acne, consider using topical treatments found in your local drugstore. Otherwise, use a face wash, scrub, toner, and moisturizer that are designed for your skin type (normal, dry, oily, or combo). If you are unsure of your skin type, get an acne face wash. Use lemon juice as a toner, sugar as a scrub, and a light moisturizer to get great skin. If you notice a pimple or breakout on your face, you can apply tea tree oil to it immediately to make it disappear faster.

, First wash your face. Then, steam your face. Next, exfoliate and tone. Also, apply a facial mask. Wash it off and finally, moisturize and massage. For your body skin, use a body brush everyday before you shower. Wash your body with a nice soap and use baby oil in the shower. Rinse off the baby oil. If you have dry skin, you can moisturize afterwards, but the baby oil does feel good. Remember to shave every other day, at most, and always use a lotion after shaving.

, Start with a foundation which matches perfectly (don't use a foundation that is too dark to look tanner, that's what the self tanner is for). Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse is great. Then apply bronzer or blush for a glow. Then apply eyeliner and lots of mascara (despite the fact that the models are almost always seen with the smoky eye, it may be too much for school or work...save it for nights out). Apply champagne colored eyeshadow. Also wear a pink lip stain with lip gloss on top. To create a look of bigger lips, apply a sparkly white eyeshadow to your cupid's bow.

, Do the same for your toenails. If you have the extra cash, go get your nails done. It's super-relaxing and fun if you go with a friend. Give yourself or get a mani-pedi once a week. . Your toes should be red or pink. If you paint your fingers pink, get your toes pink. If your fingers are French, your toes should be red or pink.

, The Angels are often seen in the magazines in good quality jeans and shorts (dark wash is the most flattering), casual and sexy tops (basic tanks and v-necks are casual and lace camisoles and off-the-shoulder tops are some of the sexier tops they carry), and, of course, lingerie. For cute casual looks and pajamas, look at the VS Pink line. Check out victoriassecret.com for ideas on how to create a VS-esque wardrobe. Tank tops, camisoles, short shorts, skinny jeans, yoga pants, heels, push up bras, cute panties, charm bracelets and blouses with the first few buttons unbuttoned and the sleeves rolled up, crop tops, scoop neck tops, sweaters, purses, lockets, studs, lip gloss, flip flops, tights, sneakers, yoga shorts, sweatpants, scoop necks, Dolman tees, cardigans, UGGS, tennis shoes, flats, perfume, strapless floral summer dresses, robes and bikinis and pajamas are cute. In the winter wear cute ankle knitted UGGS, with shorts and tights, a cute scarf, mitts and beanie and a warm hooded sweatshirt. For school, wear a pastel polo shirt, navy blue skinny pants, and black flats, UGGs, or tennis shoes. Accessorize with a lacy tank underneath, a charm bracelet, and stud earrings. Recommended shirt colors are pale pink, bright pink, carnation pink, any shade of pink, red, white, lavender, pale blue, navy blue, and black. If you can have any color polo at school, get two pink, two white, one pale blue, one navy blue, and one red. Wear purple, black, grey, and/or white tank tops underneath.

, Make sure you seem warm and playful. Be modest. Don't boast about your appearance. VS models have a fun and playful outlook on life. They aren't called Angels for nothing.

, After they see your holy hotness and how much the boys are loving you, give them some tips and tricks. If they comment on your hair, tell them what shampoo you use to make it so soft. If they like your shirt, tell them the brand it is. If they comment on the cleanliness of your shoes tell them how you clean them. If they comment on anything, tell them just one little thing about how you get it to look so good. They will eventually learn more and more over time. They may even want to try it out. Soon, they will become Victoria's Secret model look-a-likes.

, Boys will whistle, look, stare, gawk, talk, and flirt with you after you become the hottest girl. So, you need to be prepared with comebacks. If they whistle, turn and wink. If they look at you, look at them. If they check you out, return the favor. Staring is solved by fluttering your lashes, turning your head down, and looking straight at them. Gawking is cured by swinging your hips and ignoring them. If they talk to you, start a friendly conversation with him. If he is just plain flirting with you, flirt back using his tactics. If he touches you, touch him, runs fingers through hair, run your fingers through your hair, etc. This will make boys like you even more. You may even get a new boyfriend.

, If you are known as the weirdo, nerd, or loser, this may help some. But, don't drop your grades, lose your personality, or drop your friends because of this. If you are known as a slut, skank, or hot mama already, this will make your reputation even worse, so act and dress innocent and don't flirt, repeat act and look innocent and don't flirt until you aren't seen as a slut anymore. But, if you are unbelievably hot, a flirt, pretty, sexy, and curve-a-licious, you may gain a reputation as a slut. If this occurs, tone it down a bit.

, In many cliques, there is one leader... YOU! But, you have to work to get there - and stay there. You must always be in the middle when your strut down the hallway. Always have most gossip points, or most gossip. Have the best rating on outfits.

, For example, Massie Block's clique is called The Pretty Committee. other great names are The Cool Crew, The ___ Crew, the It Girls etc.

Don't flaunt it.",How to Look Rich," The most obvious sign of wealth isn't bling, specific brands, fabric, or a particular style – it's tailored clothes. If you want to look rich, you need to make sure your clothes fit like they were made for your body. Clothes need to fit your form and flatter your figure, whether you're talking about casual or formal wear.


Department store sizes are widely variable because of the way fabric is machine cut. Two pair of pants that are labeled the same size might actually be fairly different. Try on at least three pairs at your size to find the best fit.
Spend extra time shopping to make sure every item fits your body perfectly. Even if you really like a shirt, skirt, or a pair of pants, don't buy it if it doesn't fit your body perfectly.;
, If you're trying to save money on clothes but want to look like you're spending a lot, a little smart shopping will go a long way. You can spend big on a few name - brand or designer items, then spread them out with a variety of cheaper clothes to make different outfits that look rich.



Save up for a couple months if you want to splurge on a pair of Louboutins, but make sure you're outfitting yourself with cheap stuff from Nordstrom, TJ Maxx, and other stores that sell fashionable clothing on a budget.It's better to spend on clothes than on accessories, which will only look blingy or ostentatious if you're wearing them with cheap clothes.
It's also obviously a good idea to look for sales whenever possible. If you can get designer jeans for a discount, you can spend more on some value items to round out your wardrobe.

, Expensive designer clothes don't feature brands prominently. If you want to look like you've got a serious bank account, don't make yourself a walking billboard for brand names. Go for clean, sophisticated apparel.


Even trendy brands like Coach, Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, and others may have obviously placed emblems or brands. Even though these might be pricey brands, this isn't a sign of wealth. It's better to have a big wardrobe of beautiful form-fitting items of mysterious origin, than one blingy Coach bag that broke the bank.

, If you're just playing at looking wealthy, you want to look like you've got somewhere important to be. A board meeting? An exclusive dance club? A yacht club? A red carpet? Every day should be an excuse to dress up and look rich.


Things like cardigans in pastel colors, pressed cotton shirts, form-fitting slacks, and slim-fitting jackets should be worn by men whenever possible. No shorts, under any circumstances.
It's appropriate for women to wear skirts, dresses, and pumps, whenever possible, if you're going for that ""old-money"" look, but it's also good to rock a trendy pair of designer jeans, a scarf, and a printed tee in some cases to look movie-star-chic. Just avoid going out in sweatpants.

, Fabrics should be all-natural, whenever possible. Look at the tags when you buy clothes and pick out cotton, cashmere, silk, linen, and wool over any kind of synthetic blend. If you go with blended fabric, make sure that it's a blend of these natural fibers. Or better yet, buy a combination of expensive fabrics and make your own clothes!

, It's important to have good clothes, but it's even more important to have clothes that look good and are well-kept. Wash your clothes according to the directions included, always, and air-dry them to retain the life of the items. Dry-clean fine fabrics and press your clothes before wearing them.


The more you wash certain items, the more they'll age. Press your clothes and fold them neatly between wearings, so you won't need to wash them more frequently.
Wool, velvet and silk need to be dry-cleaned. Cotton and cashmere can be washed fine at home.

, Not only do you want to make sure that you're dressed smartly, but that you're dressed appropriately for the weather. Don't get caught out in the rain in inappropriate clothes, and always be prepared for abrupt changes in weather, given the season that you're dressing for.


Pay attention to fashion magazines to find out about new seasonal fashions and trends as well, so you can be prepared for what's coming up next.
The old money crowd loves to layer, so sweaters, overcoats, and similar garb is handy for cooler conditions.

, The shoes make the outfit, and you can get a lot of use out of them, so it's one good place to spend a little extra when you're trying to get an outfit together. Acquire at least one pair of really decent well made shoes, and some other value options for heavier use.


For men, some very conservative and understated oxfords or loafers are a good idea. Higher-ankle beatle boots can also be stylish and monied-looking. Leather is key.
For women, a conservative pump, like the classic Chanel would be a good choice.
Keep your shoes very clean at all times. Take them off when you're indoors and polish them regularly to keep them looking out-of-the-box. In fact, keep the box and store them inside it.

, Jewelry can be a trap. A little of it cries out ""rich,"" but too much of it cries out ""poseur."" Think Jay-Z more so than Trinidad James, and Queen Elizabeth more than Snooki. A few pieces of stylish jewelry can give your look rich elegance.If you can't afford the real thing, keep it classic. In lieu of a genuine Cartier ""tank"" watch, do what lots of the wealthy do and get the cheapest, simplest Timex with a basic black leather band, small and discreet.Fake pearls are difficult to identify, making them an excellent way to save a little if you can't afford a diamond necklace.

, An authentic designer bag or wallet is nice, but go for something a bit bland or obsolete. Something that is the ""latest fashion"" is by definition a trend, which is anathema to the old money crowd. It must be well made and leather even if not designer, go for simple designs.


The LL Bean Boat & Tote or a classic black quilted Chanel are good options. Nothing avant-garde garde, and nothing that looks like the Balenciaga Lariat, or the Chloe Paddington. However, if you're impressing the nouveau riche, ""trendy"" is pretty much mandatory.
Rent designer accessories from places like Le Tote, Leading Luxury, or Rent the Runway, to help yourself save some money and appear super-rich., Bathing regularly helps to communicate that you're well-taken care of, and that you've got the time and resources to devote to your looks. Wash yourself thoroughly every day and take the time to get clean.


Use a loofah to exfoliate while you're in the shower. Get rid of dead skin cells to deep clean your skin and keep it healthy.
Bathe twice, if you work out. Once in the morning and once after you finish on the squash court. Don't let the sweat stick.
Use moisturizing lotion and soap your skin to keep it glowing and healthy after you take a shower.

, When you're strapped for cash, paying for a hair cut is one of the first things that goes out of the window. Get good-quality hair cuts from a beautician or barber you trust, about 1-2 times a month. Get rid of those split ends and keep your style current and flattering to your face.


Men should have precise haircuts, and well-shaven facial hair. Beards or mustaches should be trimmed extremely finely, and precisely, to a razor-like edge.
Women should have tasteful and trendy cuts, color and shine in their hair. Hair color should look natural and highlights and lowlights must be natural as if obtained on a visit to the beach house.

Learn to cut your own hair, if you want to save some expense.

, A wealthy woman's makeup should be natural, making use of neutral colors and gentle foundation. No over-the-top cat eye-liner, or false lashes. Keep it tasteful.


Take good care of your skin. Perfect skin is a rich woman must. Natural skin color looks much better. No sunspots, so keep on sporting sunscreen, though everyone looks better with a healthy glow.
Classic monied highlights include red lipstick. It's always tasteful.

, Manicures don't have to cost a lot of money to make a big difference in your appearance. Clean your nails regularly and get manicures at inexpensive nail salons. Short tips can be classy and rich-looking, but longer nails tend to look a little cheaper and more fake. Go for a basic French tip for the perfect look.


Men should also invest in manicures regularly, to keep their nails and cuticles in good shape. Taking the time to trip nails and keep them strong and healthy is a sign of money.
Learn to clean your nails yourself and trim your cuticles to save.

, Dental care is expensive. The more you take care of your teeth on your own, the more monied you'll look and the less you'll have to spend to achieve it. Floss every day, use non-alcoholic mouthwash to keep you breath fresh, and brush twice daily using toothpaste with whitening properties. Make your smile look like a couple million bucks.


White teeth aren't necessarily a sign of healthy teeth, but they always look better than stained or yellow ones. Avoid drinking too much coffee and tea, and tobacco products, to keep your teeth as white as possible.

, Men and women should wear a small amount of a subtle and sophisticated scent. Woodsy, floral scents are always classy, while sugary scents tend to scream out ""young"" or ""bought at the mall.""


You don't usually have to break the bank to buy reasonable perfumes that smell expensive, although the high end perfumes are quite pricey. Wait for deals at your favorite department stores and save up for something that smells good to you. Generally, you want to avoid super-new celebrity endorsed fragrances.
Men should wear cologne on the inner wrist and underneath the jaw line. Women should wear perfumes on the inner wrist, inner elbows, and underneath the jaw line or behind the ears.

, New restaurants, new clubs, and other hot spots around town should always be on your to-do list. The rich like to go out to the newest and trendiest places to be seen, just as much as to experience those places. If you want to give the impression that you're rich, try to stay on top of new openings and get your reservations ahead of time.


Sign up for mailing lists for hot restaurants, or follow them on social networking so you can stay ahead of the game on specialities and trends.
Opening night should be your night. You want to make sure you get in when something is hot, not afterward when everybody else finds out about it. Be the first.

, Wealth comes with elegance. If you want to act like you've got money, you need to practice good manners at all times. Even if you're waiting in line at the DMV, you need to be elegant in your behavior.


Eat more slowly and chew with your mouth closed. Take your time and enjoy your food instead of wolfing it down.
Stay calm and avoid raising your voice when you're upset. Learn to speak calmly and evenly, even if someone is pushing your buttons.
Stand up straight and hold your chin up. Excellent posture, both when sitting or standing, are signs of wealth.

, A knowledge of upscale brands can communicate that you're rich, even if you don't actually own any of the expensive gear that you're talking about. Rich people might have a lot of thoughts about the following brands:


Clothing designers like Gucci, Dior, Burberry, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Coach, and Louis Vuitton.
Car companies like Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, BMW, Bugatti, Cadillac, Jaguar, Maserati, and Ferrari.
Other local upscale brands, like restaurants and chefs, designers, artists, and architects. Rich people should be familiar with the notables in their area.
Enunciate your words. Slow down your speech, and lower your voice volume to speak clearly and articulately about what you're talking about.

, The rich have their attendant hobbies. While some of these activities can be kind of expensive, if you want people to think you're rich without spending the money or participating, you can learn about the following upper-class hobbies with the following upper-class wikiHows, to sound like you're a pro:


Golf
Tennis
Skiing
Fine dining
Sailing
Travelling
Riding horses
Playing polo

, Wealthy people frequently receive private schooling, so getting informed about the world around you is important. Brush up on general knowledge, but don't flaunt your education or claim to be an expert.Get informed by checking out the following periodicals of the wealthy:


Forbes
Barron's
Wall Street Journal
The Robb Report
Affluent Traveler
The New Yorker
The Economist

, Wealth comes with the opportunity to spend money on travel. In general, the very wealthiest people are worldly and well-travelled, making the time to visit new and exotic locations as often as possible. If you want to act rich, act worldly and earn your frequent flyer miles.


Try to travel to places off-the-beaten path. Visiting Cabo is what tourists do. Visit Oaxaca instead.
If going on holidays to European vistas isn't in your budget, fake it till you make it. Just search for exotic locations online and repost the pics. Even Kim Kardashian used Google image search instead of taking her own vacation pics not too long ago., Richness sometimes has a very particular presence online. Cruise around websites like ""White Whine"" for good examples of how the 1% conduct themselves on Facebook and Twitter. Secret: It's not always that great.


Complain about the service regularly: ""This restaurant is THE WORST. I mean, how hard is it to get a savory watermelon gazpacho right?""
Embrace the humble brag: ""Today has been tough. The to-go cups at the new coffee place don't fit the cup holders in my BMW, so I had to drink my latte too fast.""
Put up pictures of exotic brands and locations, as if you were buying them or heading there on your next vacation, even if you're not.

, Rich people, really rich people, don't feel the need to talk about how much they have. Rich people are probably the least interested in their own wealth. If you want to give the impression that you're well-off, it's important to pull back a little and let other people guess. Don't push your ""wealth"" on people.


If the topic of money comes up, brush it off. If you're pushed, you can say something like, ""I don't really like to talk about it,"" or ""I'm pretty comfortable.""

Purchase your choice of adhesive.,
Wash your eyelids.,
Cut out a thin strip of tape.,
Apply the tape to the upper eyelid.,
Adjust with an applicator.,
Blink several times.",How to Make Asian Eyes Look Bigger1," Eyelid glue (also known as “putti”) and eyelid tape are popular cosmetic items that help create a “second eyelid” for those who have mono-eyelids. Both the liquid adhesive and the tape are effective, though the tape may need modification to achieve a perfect fit.


Eyelid tape comes in a few varieties, including rolls and “pre-cut” shapes.;
, Give your eyelids a gentle washing prior to applying an adhesive. Too much oil or makeup will cause problems for the adhesive, resulting in your eyelids not adhering properly. If you wish to wear makeup, apply after putting on the adhesive., If using tape, cut a small thin strip that roughly matches the length of your eye. The tape should be completely obscured under the crease of your eye, so avoid cutting the tape too “wide.”









Cutting an appropriate size may take some trial and error. Pre-cut strips may also have to be modified to fit without being visible.
Not all eyes are the same! The shape of your eye, even if ""almond,"" can vary drastically from another set of almond eyes. Review your eye carefully, and talk to a beautician if you need advice specific to your own eye shape., Find the crease of your eye and apply the adhesive along the crease. Look in the mirror if you aren’t quite sure where your to find your crease, or have a friend help while you apply the adhesive.








Both eyelid glue and tape can be removed with warm water, or a small amount of makeup remover.
Take care when removing the tape from your eyelids. Peel slowly to avoid stretching out your eyelids.

, Eyelid liquid glue comes with a small applicator. Once you have applied the glue, use the applicator to push a portion of the upper eyelid upward, so that the glue adheres to nearby skin, creating a fold. Note that both types of eyelid adhesives, particularly the liquid, may require physical adjustments to adhere in place.


Practice using the applicator to create an additional eyelid fold prior to applying the glue. This saves you the trouble of having to reapply the glue if you apply the adhesive incorrectly the first time., Make sure your eyelid folds are to your liking and have a strong enough bond to last throughout the day. It will take some practice to get the perfect look on both eyes. If you feel one type of adhesive does not work well, give the other a try and see if it works better.









Eyelid glue will last longer based on how much you layer on your eyelid. A thinner layer will dry quickly, but only last a few hours, whereas a thicker layer will last longer, though it will also feel more noticeable.
Eyelid tape holds stronger than glue, but can be felt much more easily in the eyelid, meaning it may be uncomfortable over longer periods of time.
Sweat and oil can cause the glue to lose its hold as the day wears on, so reapplication may be necessary (most notably in eyelid glue).

Don't worry if it sounds like a lot; most people have the majority of that already.,
On Monday: wake up earlier than normal, so make sure you went to sleep at a nice time so you can wake up thirty minutes to an hour earlier than usual - to give yourself a makeover!,
Make a clique.",How to Be an Alpha Preteen Girl," First, go to school like you normally do (must be Friday for shopping spree on the weekend). No need to worry about fashion, makeup, or anything like most articles tell you to. Just make sure you have these:


A phone, iPod touch, or any small device you can bring to school that you can save notes in.;
, What you will use with this is take notes on what all the popular girls wear, they way their attitude is, and the main thing why they are popular. If you are questioning on how come you can't bring a notepad and pencil to do this, well it's because writing things (especially when your locker is around other people) makes people curious. Some people will stroll by and might see what your writing, and this can cause trouble. Especially when it's someone who is popular. Using your phone will just make people seem like it's nothing, you're just texting or seeing the score of the big game or something.

, After your first day of trying to become an alpha is over, go home and review everything you typed. If the girls wore Aeropostale, how can you make it better? If some girls were mean, how can you make it better? If girls were known for their pretty nails, how can you make it better? Once you have it figured out, tell your mom or dad that you would like to go shopping sometime this weekend. Some parents will disagree, but if you tell them you will use your own money they will let you go shopping.

, Preferably, these will be more so than what anyone else wears. Like Forever 21 or something like that. Some other good stores are Claire's, Bath and Body Works, and Justice. Remember to buy and/or make sure you have all of this:

, If it's over your budget, skip minors things such as anti-frizz, deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner, Q-tips, etc. and save for later.

,


Take a shower. Remember to use shampoo, and all conditioners. Also put shower gel on a loofah or washcloth and scrub all over your body except your face nicely like you normally would for soap and wash out. Also remember to shave your under arms and possibly your legs if you think it needs it. Tip: Always keep a dry Washcloth and wet Washcloth (no soap on it) by you at all times just for when you get shampoo in your eyes. If you do, first wipe your eyes with the wet washcloth, and then dry them with the dry.
Dry your hair and comb thoroughly. Avoid using combs that are somewhat pointy. That can make your scalp more itchy. Use a comb with small circles on the end of them. Once your hair is completely dry, put your hair up in a bun. Then brush your teeth, floss, and use mouthwash. Now it's makeup time!
Apply little amounts of blush and eye shadow. Use blush and eye-shadow that is natural, such as peach for blush, and brown for eye shadow. Then moisturize your lips by using chap stick, then apply lip gloss. Also add cover up for pimples, curl your eyelashes, and pluck your eyebrows (remove a few eyebrow hairs that aren't in the shape of your eyebrow). Tip: Can't get rid of dark circles? Sometimes you don't need cucumbers, you really need water. Drink two glasses of water right now and walk to the mirror. Looks better, right? Tip: Want really moist lips? Get a not used toothbrush and put Vaseline on it, then brush your lips for three minutes straight. You will have moist lips for up to eight days!
Put down your hair and get styling. Curl it, braid it, straighten it, crimp it, anything you want! There really is no hair style for being an alpha, so just do whatever you want! Tip: Want a cute hair accessory? Make your own! Search ""How to Make Duct Tape Bow"" on YouTube and click on the first video made by ""theduckbrand"".
Find the perfect outfit. Make sure you know what the weather will be like; search the weather for help. But remember, you can't always rely on weather reports. If you aren't sure, wear something according to what season you are in. Like if it's winter and its always cold then wear long sleeve shirt and long pants. Also remember to stick to your outfit's theme. Don't wear the perfect combination of blue and white and then wear orange!
Compliment yourself! Look in the mirror, and compliment yourself, and smile. Now your ready for school. Decide a song for you to listen to when you walk down the halls - remember a good song, get the beat, and listen to it in your head as you strut down the hallways looking very confident. People may or may not stare at you. If no one looks at you, like most girls do for the original popular girls, don't stop and retreat, just keep going.

, Get your friends, or make brand new friends. You should have 3-5 girls in your clique, counting you. Make sure you all have something in common. Maybe your clique loves cheer, maybe they love fashion, whatever it is! Also, make sure to name your clique. It can be maybe: The Blonds if you all have blond hair, the Darling Dancers if you all like dance, WHATEVER YOU WANT! Get creative! And if no one in your school has names for their clique, don't be afraid to get the clique name out of your social bubble.

Curl your lashes.,
Accentuate the eyes with mascara.,
Apply a small amount of eyeliner.",How to Make Asian Eyes Look Bigger2," Curl your upper lashes upward and your lower lashes downward to draw attention away from your lash line, which often appears very straight on almond-shaped eyes. This helps create an open look for your eyes, and couples well with mascara.









False eyelashes work well for drawing attention away from the lash line, particularly if you don’t have particularly prodigious natural eye lashes., Apply mascara to the top and bottom of your eye lashes to draw more attention to the whites of your eyes, making your eyes appear larger. Brush your upper eyelashes “outward” away from your face for three strokes, and repeat according to your desired thickness. Wiggle the mascara brush through your lower lashes to create a smokey look that adds to the contrast.









Use a lengthening or volumizing mascara formula when highlighting the eyes. This creates a thicker, bolder look for your eyelashes, helping further highlight the whites.

, Apply eyeliner just below the lash line, avoiding the rim of your eye. Adding white eye shadow or eyeliner to the inner corners of the eye can also help give your eyes a lighter look and give the appearance of a bigger, rounder eye.









Avoid encircling the whole eye with liner. Completely encircling the eye will create a “gated” look that makes your eye appear smaller and trapped

Consult with your plastic surgeon prior to surgery to get an idea of the nature of the procedure and whether such action can produce the looks you desire. Such surgery can also help remove sagging skin and bags under the eyes., Trimmed medium to thin eyebrows with a high arch are a common shape for drawing attention to the eyes, creating the illusion that they are much larger.

Speak with a beautician before making any drastic changes to your eyebrows to understand how to rock the new look., Specially designed ""circle"" contacts are available that make the iris appear much larger, promoting a round, doe-eyed look.Black is a very popular color when it comes to choosing colored contacts as well, as it makes the pupil look much bigger, thus widening the eye.

Use cream foundation.,
Apply powder.,
Draw on your eyebrows.,
Add girlish eyeshadow.,
Finish your eyes.,
Apply blush.,
Add lipstick.",How to Look Innocent and a Little Girly1," If you want to do a girlish, innocent look, you can emulate the appearance of a childlike porcelain doll, which will read as girly to many. To start, apply primer, which you can find at most makeup stores or drug stores. Primer will give your face a pale undertone, much like a young girl's.To start, spread one thin layer of primer over your full face. Then, massage it into your face with your fingertips. Wash your hands beforehand to avoid getting bacteria on your face.From here, wait for the primer to dry. This should take a few minutes. Then, apply a second layer in strategic portions of your face to bring out certain features. Apply a dot of primer on the middle of your forehead, on both cheeks, and on the tip of your nose. Again, massage it in with your fingertips.;
, From here, you can add a cream-based foundation. Choose a shade slightly lighter than your regular skin tone, as you're trying to create a girlish appearance. For best effects, apply your first layer using a foundation brush. If you do not have a foundation brush, simply apply using your fingertips. Apply all over your face.For best effects, use a circular motion with your fingers or brush as you apply.
Apply some makeup to your neck. This will make the makeup look slightly less jarring, as it's somewhat lighter than your regular skin.

, Once you've applied the cream, you can move on to a powder-based foundation. Once again, choose a shade that's somewhat lighter than your regular skin. You should use a brush or a sponge to apply powder.Use a soft dabbing motion as you apply the foundation, covering most of your face. You should also apply some foundation on your neck.

, If you want to have a girly, innocent look, you'll need to draw on your eyebrows. If your eyebrows are particularly thick, consider plucking them first so they're thin and have a slightly rounded arch.


Use a brow pencil in a darker shade, like brown or black. Draw a line from the bottom corner of your eyebrow straight across to the other side.From here, draw a straight line through your inner eyebrow. Start drawing at the top arch of your eyebrow.Repeat with the other eyebrow.

, Once you're done with your eyebrows, apply some eyeshadow. Choose a light, girlish shade. Pastel shades of pink and purple would work well here. Using a small eyeshadow brush, gently color your eyelids with your chosen shade of eyeshadow., You should also apply some light eyeliner and mascara to bring out your eyes. Large eyes may make you appear more innocent.


Liquid liners tend to work best for an innocent look. Choose a dark shade, like brown or black. On the top of your eyelid, draw a line from the middle of your eyelid to the corner of your eye. Then, move to the bottom of your eye. Draw a line running from the bottom lash and keep going until you meet the first line you drew. Repeat with the other eye.You can consider using fake eyelashes. You can buy these at the store and then follow manufacturer's instructions to apply. You can also apply mascara, moving slowly to elongate each eyelash. Make sure to apply mascara to the bottom lashes as well., You should apply a heavy amount of bright pink or bright red blush. Take a large makeup brush and dab it generously in the blush. Then, smile and apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks., Lastly, you should add some lipstick. As with the eyeshadow, you want to choose a girlish shade. Go for bright or pastel pinks or a pastel shade of red or purple. Apply a heavy amount of lipstick, as this helps highlight the girlish look."

Plus, if you get a Maxxinista card, you get an additional discount and credit toward your next purchase.


Save up so you can afford designer clothing.;
, Shoes make the outfit. The cheaper the shoes, usually the less durable and comfortable. If you're in middle school or elementary, just shop for cute and comfy sneakers/canvas skimmers/Chinese slippers/ballet flats at cute yet cheap stores like Payless or Old Navy. If you have some more money, get shoes like Toms, Topsiders, Uggs, and Converse. If you're in high school or college, you'll just need a few pairs:


A pair of comfortable everyday shoes that aren't sneakers, loafers or moccasins. These can be a pair of metallic leather ballet flats, a pair of pretty purple low wedges, or a pair of pony hair leopard print pointy toe flats. Look into funky neutrals for the pattern, or color such as metallics, a color you don't wear a lot but adore, animal prints, polka dots, black snakeskin. Think of low wedges, ballet flats, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels, and pointy toe flats. These should be comfortable enough to walk to school in, yet cute enough to wear with a flirty sundress.
If you pick a shoe that makes a big statement, limit it to the shoe. Don't pair a leopard print flat with a leopard print purse or worse - a skin tight shirt, or a metallic flat with a sparkly white eyeshadow or headband. Tacky much?
Black is great in simple leather, since it can be changed to look like a new pair of shoes with shoe jewelry.


A pair of comfortable everyday leather knee high boots. They should zip up and flatter the calves. The should be either flats or 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels or low wedges. They can be a nice neutral like black. Be wary of browns and tans because these colors can clash. Look at your skin color and hair color to assess what's perfect for you. Black works for most. But blondes that like to wear earthy browns and neutrals would carry of the earth natural hippie look well with camel colored boots. Make sure you can walk in snow and they are good for rain as well. You can look for very realistic faux leather lined with Thinsulate from good brands such as Enzo Angiolini and Nine west. Unlike the item above, it should not be a metallic/color/print/polka dot/special texture--that would make it less of a staple. It should be dressy enough to wear with a sweet little dainty dress in fall, but comfy too.
With this shoe use cheap jewelry from places like forever 21, or Claire's to sassy up outfits.



, Why two? Trends change every year, but they always seem to ping pong from oversized to teeny tiny. You don't want to be a latecomer to each and every pendulum swing of the trend cycle. Pick leather because it is classic but always in the moment. Pick a color that flatters your skin tone. Don't pick up metallics, or special prints, but feel free to experiment with color. If you have a special color that you have on your everyday comfy shoe, wear it while purse shopping if you would like to have them match. Look at trends in purses; a major theme is dark colors like rouge, purple, and olive green.

, Have two pairs of flattering dark colored (navy) jeans with a super skinny leg. Two t-shirts in colors that flatter you and a construction that skims your curves but doesn't squeeze them. Look into scoop necks and v-necks. If you live in cool climate, invest in a wool coat... Check out places such as Winners, Burlington Coat Factory, TJ Maxx,and Marshalls. Also buy 3 sweaters/jackets in either scoop, v-necks, or zip-down. One should be a basic black, two should be happy colors that make you smile. If you have a school uniform, get at least 5 shirts in bright and happy colors, black or navy skinny/curve-hugging bottoms, and 2 skirts in approved colors. If you can, own at least 1 feminine and pretty sundress.

, This is the jacket that you put on over a pair of navy skinny jeans and a black sweater and it becomes an outfit. It becomes you. Think of your interests... Are you a hopeless romantic that gushes over silks and velvets in Victorian colors? Are you a rocker chick that's life anthem is ""Highway to Hell""? What jacket speaks to you? What do you put with your boring basics, and it becomes your closet staple? What brings out you in this mass produced world? Scour for it in every single unknown boutique. It's pieces like this that sets your closet apart from the pack. Get one in leather if you're rocker, cute and bubbly designs if you are girly, or plaid/stripes if you are preppy.

, Girly girl, what about a necklace with a diamante heart pendant in pink? Like to make jewelry? Make something that makes you smile. Like sports? How about your favorite sports team's emblem on a pendant? Feel like a hippie? How about a hemp string or leather string with a wood pendant fashioned into a flower? If you are preppy, try some pearls. If you are the stereotypical popular girl, wear bangles. Always wear a pair of earrings. Own at least one dangle and one stud. Be creative, and most of all, have something that goes with everything and is totally you.

, Go to websites such as style.com and look at designer collections. Look at ways that clothes are being worn. Are brooches being affixed to a certain part of the jacket or dress? It is not necessarily something you have to buy. Maybe you have a wool coat that hits at your mid thigh? Maybe wearing it with your knee high boots and a pair of translucent black tights with a pair of fishnets is what you can do, just like the model in the picture is being styled. Or wearing the wool coat just like that but with a bright maroon belt? Substitute shoes and colors and certain things for your own version. Always be up to date on styles for your grade. Currently, bright colors are in, so make sure to have plenty!

, Do you have something that you used to love, but now don't like it? Something that is too heavily patterned for your taste can be cut and turned into a scarf, which can be worn as a belt. Something that is too 'blah' can be given extra texture with wearing with more colorful clothes, or can use a ribbon a touch darker for a signature look. Go to a fabric store and scour the reduced section for extra things. An old pair of canvas skimmers in basic colors can be sassed up with a ribbon or shoe jewelry. If you have an old t-shirt that you have grown out of, but love a detail in it, cut it out and hem the edges... You can sew it onto a simple white or black tank/tee to add detail. (See How to Modify Your T Shirt.) You can buy tees and tanks real cheap by the bundle, so that 3 dollar tee/tank can look 30 dollars later. Adding contrast stitching by stitching a color obviously darker or lighter on clothing to create a unique look is the cheapest way to rejuvenate a pair of 3 yr old jeans or tees.

, Get highlights if you can. Get your hair cut in long and pretty layers. Keep it straight most of the time, yet curl it every two weeks. Keep your hair soft and shiny. Wash it every other day with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. Brush it every morning and night. Style it in pretty styles like waves, straight, half-up, braid, french braid, side ponytail, high ponytail, etc. If you really want to come back with a bang, get side bangs!

, Make sure it is super clean, clear, and soft. Get into a daily routine with a face care system made for your skin.Wash your face twice a day.Exfoliate twice a week and give your self a facial once a week., wash, tone, and moisturize twice a day. Exfoliate twice a week and facial once a week.make sure to give yourself a spa day once a week or every other week. Take a relaxing bath, give yourself a mani and pedi, a facial, and a massage.

, Exercise 5-7 days a week. Do aerobics 3-4 days a week and strength training 2-3 days a week. Stretch daily too. Get into a sexy sport, like dance, cheerleading, volleyball, or any other mainly feminine sport.

, Just because you look super hot doesn't mean you are super hot. You need to be outgoing, flirtatious, and adorable. Everybody should love you, even if you weren't popular the previous year. If you had a bad rap the previous year, you can clean it up this year by associating yourself with the right people. Try to be the best you can be.

, They may not seem like much, but really they can make a difference. Get a supply list. Get your number 2 pencils in cute colors like pink or blue. Get patterned folders from brands like Vera Bradley or Lilly Pulitzer. If you can't afford those brands or don't like them, get cute folders with flowers, stripes, polka dots, etc. Get composition books in colors like hot pink, white, blue, or green. Binders should have cute patterns. Label all of your school supplies per subject. Have a different color highlighter for every subject. Get book covers, pens, markers, scissors, or anything else you need in colors like pink, white, blue, green, or other bright colors. Make sure that your patterns are hot and cute with dots, floral, stripes, gingham, etc. Get a backpack in a solid color and make sure everybody can sign it. Make sure it is slightly on the smaller side and has a matching lunchbox that fits in there. Keep most of your supplies in your locker. Make sure your locker is decorated adorably too.

Your bag should be a small handbag; you could go for either one with a cute and kitsch Pic/logo or a sturdy metallic one with lots of pockets and ring detailing.
Stay away from denim or fabric bags.
The only style of hat that really suits this look is the baker boy cap, it can be worn in any colour but make sure it coordinates with your outfit.

The loose, flowing silhouette will give you an instantly fresh look and you’ll be comfortable as well as stylish. There are many different cuts and shapes so you can find a style that fits you best.You don’t need to wear a dress or skirt every single day, but at least once or twice a week will help you look and feel more feminine.
Wear leggings or short spandex shorts under a dress or skirt if you’re worried about flashing anyone.
Cover up with a cardigan or light sweater if the weather is chilly.
Sit with your knees together, whether you cross your legs or keep them side by side. This is ladylike as well as modest.;
, Wear lighter colors with pastel or vibrant hues such as yellow, pink, blue, red, or purple. Navy, brown, and gray are all good neutrals for one article of clothing in an outfit, but using these as an overall outfit color is more manly than feminine. Black is a good accent color, but it’s best to pair it with a hot pink or other bright color.Don’t break the bank by getting rid of everything you own and buying a whole new wardrobe.
Go through your closet and look for tops and bottoms you already have that can be paired together for girly outfits.
Wear darker materials and colors for the fall and winter and bright linens and cottons for spring and summer.
Incorporate pink into your daily style. It is a color that is traditionally girly and adds some feminine flair. Pick out a new pink top or a pair of heels to give any outfit a pop of color.You don’t need to redo your whole closet and room with pink. Just add little hints of color with lipgloss or a belt to start off.
There are more shades than just hot pink. Ease yourself into the color with raspberry-colored accessories or a purple phone case.

, Start with a simple makeup routine: foundation, a little blush, mascara, and lipstick or gloss. These all frame your face and give you an instant feminine flair. Eyeliner and lipstick require a little more finesse with with application but can have a more grown-up effect.Start out small if you’re worried about all of a sudden showing up places with makeup.
Don’t cake on any products. Smearing too much eyeshadow and lipgloss on will make you look like a clown unfortunately.
Waterproof mascara and eyeliner are great options if you’re juggling sports with a social life.
Match your foundation to your skin color. Test out colors in the store by dabbing some on the top of your hand so check the color.
Play around with different colors for your lips and eyes. Some days you might want an understated color that matches your features or you could go with bright, daring colors for a night out or special event.

, Stay away from sweatpants and gym clothes when you decide against a dress or skirt. Skinny or flared jeans look great with most shoes and can be flattering to most body shapes. Leggings are a modest solution to short skirts and dresses as well. Or, you can wear leggings on their own if you want a more fitted pants option., Sneakers should be reserved for working out and sports only. Wearing shoes that have a slight heel to them will elevate your legs and rear and give your calves a workout. You'll also look taller and improve your posture.Be creative while trying out different shoe types such as sandals, boots, and other kinds of footwear that have a stacked heel or supportive sole.

Start with a low, one-inch heel or wedge to get used to a more feminine shoes style.
High heels and stilettos take time getting used to. Practice wearing them at home if you’re uncomfortable wearing them all day.
If you prefer a shoe without extra height, a fashionable flat is great for every-day wear.

, Diamonds are a girls' best friend, but so are silver, gold, and anything with sparkle. Start picking out a pair of earrings to go with your outfit of the day, match your layered bracelets to the accents on your purse, or even change out your watch band to a sleek white leather or metallic finish to add some bling to your day.You don’t have to go overboard with jewelry to look girly, sometimes simple is best.
If you don’t have pierced ears, you can still accessorize with necklaces and bracelets.

, Ponytails can be functional but limiting. Try different hairstyles like braids, buns, and curls. Take the time to brush out your hair and maybe even curl it before heading out the door. Short hair can be accented with a cute headband or bow. Work with a stylist to find out what hair cut works best for your face if you’re ready for a whole new and updated look.

, Girly girls are open with their emotions. Be honest when you’re happy, mad, or any emotion in between. Don’t be afraid to tear up in front of others and have to dab your face to keep your makeup from running. It may take some time to become comfortable with letting other people see your emotions, but just take it one day at a time.Never let your emotions get the best of you. You still want to be in control so that you don’t offend anyone in your anger or cause people to think that you’re overdramatic about the smallest inconvenience.

, Not only is a purse a cute accessory for your outfits, it’s functional as well. You should always carry some backup makeup, deodorant, a little perfume, a notebook or scheduler and pen, a hair accessory, your wallet, and any keys you need.Extra purse essentials can include a portable sewing kit and safety pins for fashion emergencies, sunglasses, school books, or any other items for you day to day routine.
If you still need to use a backpack or tote around heavy items, you can find bags in fun floral prints or colored leathers to upgrade your look.
Start out with one bag that matches most of your outfits and then start collecting others for other special occasions, school, and overnight trips.

, A lady needs to refrain from displaying any rude bodily functions of other people. Try and keep your gassier moments to yourself and preferably in the bathroom. Always cover your mouth with a tissue or handkerchief when you need to blow your nose, clear your throat, sneeze, or cough., Even if organization is not your strong suit, keep your desk and purse or backpack tidy so that you don’t lose track of important things or forget appointments. Being punctual is time-management etiquette that is helpful to practice.Use a label maker or buy cute stationery to help keep your assignments and schedule organized and attractive.
Your handwriting should be neat and legible so that both yourself and others can read it.
You don’t have to dot your ‘i’s with little hearts, but it certainly makes your writing look more fun and girly.

, Rough-housing and getting dirty are not appropriate activities for a lady. You don't want to ruin your nice clothes and it won’t help your image of being a girly girl.For example, things like wrestling, tackling, or using power tools are not traditionally girly.


You can be sporty as well as girly. Going to the gym to work-out is important and so are sports to stay healthy and social.
Just know that there is a time and place for dirt and sweat. After a workout or sporting event, clean yourself up again to out into public.

, Being polite with your speech is incredibly important. Don’t pepper all of your sentences with curse words because it makes you look and sound abrasive.Don’t get caught up in gossiping either. It can be difficult, but refrain from talking badly about others, especially behind their back.
Gossiping says more about you and your bad attitude than it does about the people you’re talking about.

, Start spending more time with girls so that you can watch them and learn how to be more girly. Go to the mall to shop, get manicures together, and simply spend time flipping through magazines together and talk about life with other girls. Being around girls more often will help distinguish you as a lady rather than looking like “one of the guys.”Be calm around boys. As you start to see boys as more than friends and possible boyfriend material, don’t let that psych you out. They’re still people too, so don’t get flustered and nervous just because you start to see them differently.Avoid picking up bad habits from guy friends. You can do this by hanging around girls more often, but be careful that you don’t slip into any old tomboy ways., Changing how you act and look is a big change and is part of your identity. Being a girly girl might not be for everyone and that is perfectly ok. Have fun experimenting but don't get discouraged if you don't naturally feel girly just because you make some changes.

, You need plenty of time to prep your hair, makeup, and accessories before leaving the house. Determine how much time you need from start to finish to get ready and presentable for the day. You may need to start waking up a little earlier in order to get ready on time.Schedule time during your week for extra time to shave, care for your nails, or do other hygienic upkeep that requires more time than your daily routine allows.
Check the mirror before leaving the house. Never leave the house unprepared or half dressed.You will get faster with your morning routine as you get used to it, so don’t worry if it seems like a lot of work at first.
Balance your beauty sleep and primping time. Make sure you get enough rest so that you don’t have to try and cover dark circles or bags under your eyes with makeup. This may mean you need to go to bed earlier or consolidate your primping time.

, As you begin to wear more revealing or feminine clothing like skirts or fashion tank-tops, start shaving or waxing regularly. Body hair is not an accessory that you need as a girly girl. Shave every day during your shower routine or every few days depending on how fast your hair grows out.Invest in a good razor or simply stock up on disposable ones and buy a shaving cream to protect your skin.
Make sure to shave any parts of your legs that show and your armpits year-round. Include your bikini area during the summer when you’ll be wearing a swimsuit.
Facial hair should also be taken care of. Tweeze or pluck your eyebrows to shape them and do the same for any upper lip hair.
If you can’t stand plucking hairs yourself, have a professional do it for you or invest in waxing services. Waxing results will last longer but can be more expensive.

, First, you always want to be wearing deodorant so you don’t offend anyone with surprise body odor. Then, shop around for a perfume or body lotion that gives you a soft, girly scent. Vanilla, fruity mixtures, and lavender are all subtle yet distinct options.

You can find fun-smelling anti-perspirant deodorants to help control any excessive sweating you might have.
Don’t go overboard on spraying too much perfume.
One way to apply perfume is to dab a little on your wrists and under your neck.
Or instead, spray a cloud of perfume in the air in front of you and walk through it for a light misting.

, It may seem like a small detail, but paying attention to details is important for maintaining the image of being a girly girl. Check under your fingernails for dirt and grime and wash under them with soap and water. Use a nail file every few days to keep your fingernails shaped and smooth.Pushing back your cuticles will make your nails look longer.
Even if you don’t like colored nail polish, a clear coat or nude color can clean up your hands.
Every once in awhile it’s fun to get a professional manicure and pedicure.
Don’t forget your toes! When you wear sandals or open toed shoes you want to be able to show off your pedicure.

, Keep your skin soft and glowing, trim your nails and your hair. People see in your grooming your opinion of yourself. Make an effort always to be at your most attractive but be careful of becoming a slave to looks. Appearance, despite what we are told, is not the most important thing. Think about the people you love most dearly; is it their physical beauty you treasure or the beauty of who they are?

, Eat well, do not overindulge and make your health a priority. Find an activity that you enjoy that will also help you keep supple and strong. There is a crushing pressure to be a certain shape but do not give in to it. Let your body settle into its natural curves and cherish them--believe me when I say that there is beauty in every natural body shape. However, if you know that you are truly obese or underweight, take steps to bring your body to its healthiest weight.

, Express your personality through your clothing and never allow fashion to dictate your wardrobe. In the same way, wear makeup that reveals your face, that does not mask it.

, Surround yourself with people who understand you and are devoted to you. At all times be the friend you would wish others would be to you. While you seek out faithful friends, don't exclude others who you might find hard to bear, or even disapprove of. You may never become close friends but you should still show kindness.

, Forgive all wrongs. This doesn't mean what was done to you was right. If you choose to be bitter, you'll be a slave to what someone else thought, said, did.

, Choose to feel strongly, even when it hurts. Take courage and live passionately. Be wise in what you do but be willing to take risks in love. Be alive! Be alive! Be alive!

The truly courageous woman faces her deepest hurts and fears. To reveal your beauty, to believe it you must be strong. You must be strong to be vulnerable, to be soft and to weep.

, Speak the truth. Live the truth. The truth is absolute, not subjective.

Have flawless skin.,
Makeup.,
Use your natural beauty!,
Don't forget your hair!,
Is tanning trendy?",How to Be a Trendy Teenage Girl1," One of the main things every teenage girl wishes for (if they aren't already blessed with it) is clear skin. The three main products you need for an effective skincare routine are a good cleanser, toner, and moisturiser that go with your skin type. There are five main kinds of skin types: Combination, Sensitive, Oily, Dry, and Normal. Match your skin type with the products below:


If you have a dry skin type, you need moisturizing products! Start off with a good cleaner. Follow up with a moisturizing toner and finish it all off with a high-power moisturizing product. Try a good cleanser. Keep your moisturiser oil-free to avoid clogging your pores.
On the other hand, if you have an oily skin type, go for a good cleanser and then a lightweight moisturiser. Lightweight means that it's oil-free and won't clog your pores.
If you have a combination skin, go for a good cleanser and then a regular moisturiser. It should be oil-free and light. Keep things in moderation.
If you're a lucky girl with a normal skin type, you're pretty much able to use whatever products you want. We'd suggest a good cleanser and a lightweight moisturiser. This way, your skin will be kept fresh and moisturized, but also control the amount of oil in your skin.
If you have sensitive skin, you'll need to take extra precautions with your skincare products so that they won't irritate your skin. Go to a dermatologist to see what they recommend.
If you have acne-prone skin, you'll need quality products to maintain a good complexion! Products like Neutrogena SkiniD and Proactiv are effective for sensitive skin.

Buy your products and start your routine! Wash your face at least once a day. For oily and combination skinned people, it is recommended to wash it twice a day, and once for the rest of the skin types. Wet your hands. Take some cleanser and dispense a small amount in your hands. Rub your hands together to spread the cleanser. Stand over a sink, close your eyes, and rub the cleanser thoroughly on your skin for 30 seconds. Stop for 5 seconds to allow the cleanser to settle. Then, rinse it out with cold water--this will close the pores. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. After, apply the toner with a cotton pad. Let it sit until it is completely dry, and then dot moisturiser on your chin, forehead, nose, cheeks, and the region between your nose and mouth. Rub each area in, making sure there is no residue left on your skin.;
, One of the pleasures of being a girl (especially a beautiful and trendy girl) is wearing makeup! If you have great skin that isn't uneven, don't wear foundation or concealer! Learn to apply makeup, and to apply it well. Wear an amount that makes you happy. A good, simple makeup look that suits most girls are:


Use a concealer that matches your skin tone to cover any blemishes.
Take an eyeshadow colour that makes your eyes pop and apply it to your eyelids.

Line your lids with a black or dark-brown eyeliner.
(Optional) Curl your eyelashes.

Apply dark brown, clear, or black mascara.
(Optional) Apply blush to your cheeks.
Add light-coloured lipstick/lip gloss/lip balm to your lips. Try to match it with your natural lip colour, or go a few shades darker.

, You want to look good while wearing makeup, but you also want to look good when you have no makeup on at all!


To zap a zit overnight, purchase a Zeno Hot Spot (they can run a bit expensive) or put a dab of toothpaste (regular, not gel) on the zit. It should disappear!
To get rid of bags around eyes, take two thin, cold slices of cucumber or two frozen spoons. Place them over your eyelids and leave them there for 10 to 15 minutes.
For super chapped lips, take a clean, warm towel and rub it over your lips for one minute. The dry skin should rub off. Then, apply lip balm.
Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day for clear and healthy skin.
Exercise frequently to stay in shape. Be careful not to overwork yourself! Space your exercise regimen responsibly and give your body time to recover to avoid injury.

, No matter what length, colour, or style your hair is, most people agree that the most attractive hair is moisturized, clean, and managed. Identify what problems you have most with your hair. Then, find a hairstyle you like. Preferably, it should go with your face shape, but go with what you feel. Visit a salon and ask some of the hairdressers for hairstyle suggestions. If you want, get highlights, low-lights, or a different hair colour!


There are so many different hairstyle options! Purchase some hair elastics, bobby pins that match your hair colour, a couple plastic headbands, some elastic headbands, mousse, and hairspray. If you don't already have one, splurge on a flat iron or curling iron, as well as a heat protectant. Straight, smooth hair is trendy and looks good on almost anyone. On the contrary, pretty, bouncy curls happen to be trendy and can completely alter your look. Try out different hairstyles and look at other people for inspiration!
Speaking of hair, there's another kind of hair- facial and body hair. There are many ways to remove your hair, and no worries, if you don't want to, you don't have to. If you do, there are many different ways to remove those hairs! You can try waxing, plucking, depilatory creams, and shaving. A rule of thumb is to never shave your facial hair. This backfires and will cause your hair to grow back thicker, longer, and darker than before. Plus, it will be harder to remove in the long run. Consult your parents or your friends for further advice on hair removal.

, The answer is no. Pale is equally (and sometimes even more) pretty than tanned, and actually looks better on some people. But if you adore the way you look with sunkissed skin, use a faux tan. If you buy the right one you won't look orange. Jergens is one type of tanner that works well.

You don't have to be mean to be trendy.,
Be smart.,
Respect others!,
Know when to walk away from anything.,
Be yourself.,
Be connected.",How to Be a Trendy Teenage Girl2," In fact, being nice is probably the best thing you could do for yourself and people around you. Just think about it! Would you rather be loved (pretend love, that is) because people are afraid of being bullied by you, or be loved because you're super nice? We think that it's a pretty easy choice.


Always think before you speak. Words can really hurt people, and if you're the one saying them, that needs to stop! If you're the kind of person that blurts thing out before thinking, Try to stop yourself. Before you speak, take a moment to think about how what you're about to say will affect others. If it will affect them negatively, don't say anything.
Be honest, but in a nice way! Honesty is super important in a trendy girl, and even in a good friend. We want you to be honest, but be kind about it. There's always a nicer way to say something! For example, if your friend got an awful haircut and asks you how it looks, say ""It's nice, but it doesn't suit your pretty face as well as it should."" Your friend might be taken aback initially, but will appreciate your honesty and will take the suggestions that you've made into consideration. However, always know when to draw the line of being honest and not being honest. Sometimes, little white lies are okay.
Don't get trampled on! Stand your ground and make sure everyone knows that you won't get walked over! Friendship and relationships should always be at a green light. If it has turned yellow or red, then it's time to inspect if that person is really worth being in your life.

, Obviously, no one likes talking to a person who has no idea what they're talking about. Pay attention in class, no matter how boring, and talk with your friends outside of class or when the teacher says you can talk. Brush up on knowledge and keep your computer homepage on a website like Yahoo so you can see the latest news as you log in to your favorite websites. We know that being smart can be kind of 'nerdy' to some people, but better that then being labelled a 'stupid ditz'.

, If someone doesn't want to tell you something, you can't make them speak! Be a good listener, and try not to gossip about people. It's okay to look at celebrity magazines every once in a while, but keep in mind the difference between that and gossiping about peers. You've probably seen people being torn apart by rumors. Don't start them and you won't be involved with them. Also, pay attention and help out your parents. They are the ones that have raised you and taught you what you know. Respect them and they will more than likely listen to what you have to say.

, Know when to leave an argument, a situation, or even a relationship. Never take sides in an argument, even if you see one person's reason and not the other. If a friend comes to you for advice, give it, but don't give anything that could hurt others or hurt your friend. In fact, if they ask for advice, give them a word of encouragement and suggest a nudge towards figuring it out themselves. That way, no one can pinpoint something directly onto you. Know when to walk away from a situation if it's getting to risky or dangerous. Also, know when to walk out of a relationship, especially if your boyfriend/girlfriend is trying to convince you to do something that you don't want to do.

, Do what you like to do. There will be people who get you down, but who's living your life? If you have a religion, believe in it strongly. If you don't, that's okay too. Respect everyone's beliefs and state your own too. Find some hobbies you like and stick to them. Remember that it's okay to be different, whether this means racially, sexually, intellectually, or whatever. Be confident and proud of yourself!

, Read good books and listen to music you enjoy. If you want, get an Instagram or Twitter, but never give out your info to strangers. Add only people you know. And don't say anything bad about anyone, especially on the Internet--there's a log somewhere out there that records what you say. Think before you type.

Smile.","How to Be Girly, Bubbly, and Beautiful"," If you're wearing a belly top, cover your legs. If you're wearing a mini skirt then cover your tummy. As for makeup, don't wear much. Don't cake on foundation, or have bright pink lips. If you must wear makeup, keep it natural. Wear a bit of eye shadow, mascara, eye liner, lip gloss, and foundation if you need it. Cover up spots and blemishes.;
, Avoid joggers and hoodies, and wear skirts with cute tops. Girly colours include pink, purple, gold, white or silver. Peplum tops look really girly and cute and so do midi dresses.

, Wash your hair every other day, or if your hair is very oily every day. Here's how to wash your hair properly: brush your hair through until there is no knots. Rinse your hair in warm water. Not hot as this damages your hair, but warm, about 36 degrees. Lather hair in shampoos and massage into your scalp as is helps your hair grow well. Rinse out until the water runs clear or your hair will look dull. Condition your hair, just the middle and ends. Wash out.

, Pour some oil onto your hands and massage it deeply into your scalp. Apply it to your hair focussing on the ends since the ends of your hair are the oldest.

, If you have acne, see a dermatologist if you can afford it. If not, just use a cleanser every day. If your spots are very noticeable, put toothpaste on them and leave it on overnight. This will make them less red.

, Although you have to be very tough, so people learn not to mess with you. Have a good group of friends who would stick up for you if someone was mean to you. Give people compliments to brighten their day.

, Look around for new faces at your school and introduce yourself to them. Exchange phone numbers, emails, and social media usernames to keep in touch. Make small talk with a cashier or the person standing behind you in line who knows this person could be a potential friend.

, Have a huge sense of humour and laugh cutely. Crack a joke when someone is feeling down and share funny stories with your peers. Try not to make jokes that could offend people and hurt their feelings.

, Being dumb doesn't look cute. Always try hard in class and do your homework. Contribute in class discussion by raising your hand instead of day dreaming. Put your studies first instead of hanging with friends or playing video games you wouldn't want to fail the test.

, Stay away from foods that are high in salt, fat and oil. Read nutrition labels before placing the item in your cart you'd be surprised at how many foods people think are healthy are actually a pile of junk. Do yoga, meditation, or pamper yourself weekly to reduce stress which can lead to living a longer and happier life.

, Always smile, don't frown, be upbeat and jolly. Be proud of who you are, and don't change who you are.

Don't change all in one day.,

Go shopping.,

Wash your face.,

In school change your shoes to a cute ballet flat.",How to Go from Goth to Girly," If it's because many people tease you and you think you have to change, don't, if they can't accept you, there not your friends.
, People may tease you if yesterday you were wearing all black and now you're really girly. Wear a black shirt, but it needs to look girly. Wear some good fitting jeans. Wear black shoes, not combat boots or anything that looks Gothic. Wear Vans or flats. Work with what you already have. Make sure your hair looks nice. Straighten it with a straightening iron or blow dryer . Or you can curl it with a curling iron. Make sure you have no fly aways. Wear natural looking makeup. No dark eye makeup or lipstick. If someone compliments you, smile and say ""Thank you."" Be nice to everyone today., That weekend or as soon as possible. Do NOT buy anything black, at least not on this shopping trip. Buy things that YOU like. Don't worry whether it looks Gothic or not. Do NOT go to Hot Topic, unless you're going for a scene look., But on each day, get girlier. Like on one day wear some really cute accessories or a cute purse. Or wear white shoes instead of black., This is your day, so enjoy it! You've transformed. You may wear whatever you'd like on this day. Look around, and see what has changed since you've gotten a new image. Are people nicer? Have you made new friends? Are you happier, more outgoing? Then congratulate yourself, you should be proud., Too much brushing causes hair to look dull, flat and eventually your hair will start to break off. Wash your hair every other day, depending on your hair type but don’t use too many products or your hair will look greasy and just gross! If you have straight hair, curl it. If you have curly hair then straighten it, be unique. Always try different hairstyles. Try a messy bun, ponytail, braids and other simple hairstyles. Remember, it’s not healthy to keep curling and straightening your hair., Be sure to read romantic novels and listen to a few love songs, even write your own romantic poem., Choose a non-comedogenic, or non-pore-blocking, facial cleanser appropriate for your skin: dry or sensitive skin needs something gentle, fragrance-free, and dye-free; oily skin will likely benefit from a product containing salicylic acid, which helps clear out clogged pores., Choose a nail polish in the color of your choice and begin to paint your nails, only if your school allows it, remember to be girly with your school style.

Walk with strong, confident posture.,
Act confident in a variety of social settings.,
Pay nice compliments.,
Master the art of subtle flirting.,
Do what you want to do, not the things other people want.",How to Be a Hot Girl1," Remember the first rule of convincing other people you're amazing: you have to believe it yourself. The quickest way to communicate this to other people is through body language. Stand tall, keep your chin parallel to the ground, arch your shoulders slightly back, and look straight ahead. Make a few seconds of eye contact with each person you pass, and hold someone's gaze when you're talking to him or her. Don't walk quickly down the halls, be sure to pause and socialize with people. Most importantly, don't forget to smile!;
, The hot girl isn't ""playing"" hard to get, she is hard to get.You're talking to everyone, meeting new people, and having fun. Remember, this is more about who you are than what other people think of you. Hot girls just act like themselves instead of playing games or figuring out ""popularity secrets.


Speak and at a reasonable volume. Mumbling or speaking too softly indicates that you're unsure of yourself.
If you tend to be shy, fake it until you make it. After a while, you'll notice that your confidence stops feeling forced and starts feeling like a natural extension of your personality.
Ignore gossips and rumor about people, and walk on like nothing ever happened. Avoid getting into tacky confrontations with anybody. If they have a problem, it's their issue, not yours., The most confident people are those who are able to make others feel good without acting jealous. If you're really trying to get someone's attention, pay him or her a genuine compliment. Pick something you know he or she is proud of, or that other people don't usually notice about him or her. Deliver it with a smile and with your voice slightly lower in tone than usual.

, Flirting doesn't have to mean putting yourself way out there or making big, grand gestures. If you do it right, it can actually manage to draw people in and make them more interested in you without them even realizing why it's happening. Try these things:


Let people catch you looking at them. For instance, if you're glancing at a guy across the classroom, keep throwing small, quick glances his way until he looks up and notices you. Smile a bit, then look away.
If you're talking to a person one-on-one, drop your voice to a whisper as if you're discussing a ""secret."" It doesn't have to be a real secret—the point is that if you're speaking more softly, he or she will have to lean in closer to hear you. If you play this right, it can lead to leaning close enough to whisper in the other person's ear.
""Accidentally"" bump into or brush up against people. Don't bowl over them completely, but do brush the edge of your arm against someone else's arm, or don't avoid a slight touch if you're leaning across someone to reach something.
Smile. Research has actually shown that a simple, open lipped smile is the most effective form of flirting there is., Confidence, and hotness, relies on your ability to be yourself. If you want to do something, like a sport, activity, or club, go do it, even if others don't seem as interested. There is little that is hotter than a self-possessed, self-assured woman who takes control of her life. You'll be happier, and you'll exude the sort of confident ""edge"" that makes you glow attractively.


Who cares if something is ""weird"" or not typically hot. Most people admire courage and self-confidence above any specific activity.In many ways, ""hotness"" is subjective -- what one person thinks is hot another may not. The only way to succeed is to just be yourself and be happy."

Pick a good haircut.,
Take care of your hair.,
Brush and style your hair.",How to Be a Hot Girl2," Ask your stylist about bangs, layers, etc. and what may look good on you, and good for styling. If you want, ask for them to dye or put highlights in your hair.


There are several websites that let you ""try out"" a hairstyle before getting a cut. Type in ""Virtual Haircut"" to import a photo of yourself and see how you look with new colors and cuts.

, Wash your hair with a desired shampoo, and use a conditioner every other wash, or when you plan on styling. The number of washes varies depending on your hair type, but you'll know when it's time—your hair will feel greasy and gross to handle. Get a hair cut about every 2 to 3 months to avoid split ends. Consider these tips as well:


Rinse the shampoo out with cold or lukewarm water, as the cold water will give your hair an extra shine. After you wash your hair, you should condition the ends. Be sure to use a good shampoo and conditioner made for your hair type or use a different kind that makes your hair shine bright and smell good.
If you have frizzy hair, find a good leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz spray at a local store.
As an extra treat, you can apply a mask to your hair. Apply the hair mask mostly at the ends, leave it for about 15 minutes, then rinse it out. This will make your hair look as if you just walked out of the salon.

, If you choose to use heat, straighten/curl your hair 3-4 times per week—daily heat can damage the hair. If you do insist on using heat to style your hair every day, invest in a good heat protectant product.



Beachy waves are a great, fresh alternative to straight hair; you can pick up a good mousse that is especially for waves if your hair won't hold curls easily. Try out different styles and pick out the one that makes you look the best!
If you have and love your curly hair, use a curl-defining cream, gel, or spray to keep your hair beautiful and frizz-free.
If you want longer hair but are too impatient to wait for it to grow, you can try hair extensions. Since going to a salon can burn a hole in your wallet and damage your hair, why don't you try a clip on piece?

Brush your teeth twice a day, floss at least once a day and don't forget to brush your tongue and gums!",How to Be a Hot Girl3," If you suffer from acne, see a dermatologist for more help. Washing your face daily removes dead skin, oil, and dirt that can build up and cause pimples. Moisturizer then helps your skin stay fresh and smooth, as cracked, dry skin is more likely to get infected or lead to pimples.It's important to experiment with different face care products and find one that fits you. If you have dry skin, for example, you should look for products that cater to your specific needs.

, For people with dry skin: if your skin is so dry to the point that its flaking off, exfoliate it. In the shower, or with warm water in the sink, take a washcloth and rub the extremely dry areas on you face with a little soap on the washcloth. Dry, then apply toner and lotion to your whole face. If your skin isn't as dry, then just apply the toner and a good moisturizing lotion.For people with oily skin: definitely pick up oil-free face products. Wash your face at least twice a day and use clay masks regularly to control the oiliness. Use light face lotions and avoid touching your face too much since the dirt on your fingers plus the natural oils of your face will combine to cause breakouts.

, If you don't wish to use any dedicated acne creams, then try washing your face in warm water in the morning and before bed. Change your pillowcase and sheets as well, as they hold onto old dirt, oil, and makeup from your face. If you want to get rid of surprise breakouts, try a product that guarantees quick pimple elimination.


Never touch your face with your hands, and wash off your makeup completely every night. Leaving things caked on your skin leads to acne.If you have normal, average skin, try washing your face twice a day and applying moisturizer as you normally would. Use a face wash to keep your face nice and clear.

, Soft, non-cracked skin is lovely. Use lotion, cream, or body butter on your hands, arms, and legs (if you're planning on wearing an outfit that reveals these). You can also use lip butter or any kind of moisturizing lipstick/balm on your lips so it doesn't get chapped. If you want, get a tan in the summer (but it's okay if you're fair-skinned).

, Exercise and tone up your body. Find a workout that suits your schedule and makes you feel good. This does not mean you need to be a thin, waifish model type. Getting active and moving around tones your body, increases confidence, and helps you stay healthy. All three of these things will help you look hotter, and there are lots of ways to get active:


Join a yoga, spinning, or exercise class at your local fitness center, or play a sport..
Do push-ups, sit-ups, etc. during commercial breaks while watching TV.
Run, bike, or swim 4-5 times a week. Try not to drive unless you need to.
Aim for, on average, 30-60 minutes of physical activity a day., You don't have to be really skinny to be in shape. Looking fit is more attractive than being too skinny. Remember, the super-skinny celebrities and models that you see in magazines are almost always Photoshopped. It is more important to love your body and feel good than to match the unrealistic (and often unreal) image in advertisements and magazines.

, Do little things, like integrating more fruits and vegetables into your diet, while cutting out major sweets and fats. Make sure you're drinking water throughout the day, as it helps manage weight and keep you healthy. Most importantly, eat slowly -- your body takes 10-15 minutes to feel full, and many people overeat during this time., Depending on your culture, it can be seen as attractive and even hygienic to shave, pluck, or wax certain areas of your body. Some common candidates for hair removal include:


Legs
Armpits
Bikini line.
Eyebrows.
Lip or chin.

, These are excellent places for the bad bacteria to grow and cause bad breath if left unchecked. If you want, you could use white strips, mouthwash, or mint-flavored gum afterwards. Your smile will look (and smell) bright and fresh.


If you wear braces or retainers, don't forget to clean those too. They can get very dirty if they aren't cleaned regularly.

Wear makeup that suits you.,
Meet with a make-up professional to find products and looks that work for you.,
Make an effort to smell alluring.",How to Be a Hot Girl4," Makeup can change your look for better or for worse, depending on how you use it. Here's a general routine to get you started:Pick a shade of foundation that matches your skin as closely as possible. If you're allowed to test samples, rub a dab into your throat. If it becomes invisible against your skin, even under bright light, it's a good match.

Wear eye makeup. Choose a light, fresh eyeshadow that flatters your coloring and apply a thin line of eyeliner over your upper lashes (you can also apply eyeliner on your lower lashes for an extra-dramatic look). Finish off with mascara.
Find a shade of blush that doesn't stand out too much on your skin, and use a bit on each cheek. Remember that the goal is to look naturally flushed, not like you just put on makeup.
Use bronzer sparingly. A little can go a long way. Use a light shade and dust it along your cheekbones for a naturally tanned glow.
Wear a tinted lip balm or gloss. Or, if you choose to wear lipstick, keep it looking fresh with a light coat of gloss on top of it., If you're not sure how to apply makeup or what might look good on you, schedule a consultation at a department store or beauty supply store. These consultations are often free, and a trained makeup artist can help you figure out what suits you.

, Wear deodorant and perfume, or body spray, in moderation. While you want to smell nice, you don't want to be over powering. Let your smell draw people in, not announce your presence. While most people should wear deodorant every day, refrain from overdoing it on perfumes. 1-2 small squirts along the neck should be fine.

Wear stylish clothes.,
Buy clothes that fit well.,
Use light colors to highlight and dark colors to hide.,
Toss anything that's worn out.,
Be fashionable, but pay attention to your own style above all.,
Accessorize.",How to Be a Hot Girl5," Buying clothes that flatter you is key to helping you appear attractive. A great outfit should mask your flaws while highlighting your best features. Remember, it's okay to show some skin. If you dress more modest or classy, people may consider you ""sexy"" or ""pretty"" instead (both of which are different from ""hot"").


Take a trusted friend with your shopping -- ask for their opinion if you don't trust your own fashion sense.
Don't feel like you need to go overboard with outfits -- your clothing should be an extension of your own style and preferences above all else., Don't buy clothes that are too tight fitting (""Is that her little sister's shirt?""), or too revealing. It doesn't matter how much you love the style: make sure the clothes fit you. If you can't find anything off-the-rack that fits, buy something that's a bit too big and have it altered by a tailor or seamstress.


A proper fit shows off your body naturally, without having to be revealing or uncomfortable.
Clothes should always feel comfortable on your skin. If you can't wait to get out of an outfit, it is likely not a good choice.

Getting a properly fitting bra is essential for comfort, style, and even health., Love your upper half, but dislike your hips and legs? Wear dark pants or skirts and light shirts to flatter your figure (do the opposite if you like your legs). This naturally draws people's eyes to the parts of your body you want to be accented.

, You might love that shirt, but if it has holes in it or looks visibly worn, it's time to donate it (or save it for wearing on the weekend when you're lazing around the house).

, Don't buy something that looks awful on you just because it's considered stylish. Instead, evaluate trends and pick out what you're willing to wear or what you think could look good on you.


If your parents don't want to buy you clothes, save up money and go on a mini shopping spree for yourself. Second-hand stores are a fantastic place to pick up hidden gems.
Check Tumblr, Pinterest, and Instagram accounts dedicated to fashion to get up-to-date clothing ideas, Pick out a few cute pieces of jewelry and rotate them throughout the week. Wear cute scarves in the winter. Use hair accessories; they're great at making you stand out. Wear leg-flattering heels, a deep necklace, a set of new and unique earrings, or any other extra piece to make an outfit truly ""yours.""Try and save 1-2 of your really nice accessories for special occasions. That way, when you do break them out, they really turn heads.

, Have good body hygiene, be fresh, and stay clean. Nobody will want to talk to you after a whiff of body odor. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, wash your hair everyday and take a shower at least four times in a week.


Shower regularly. Take a shower every one or two days, depending on the weather and the level of activity you've undertaken. Always shower after a heavy workout, though.

Some girls have to wash their hair everyday because it's naturally greasy, and some girls only every other day. Find out what's right for you.
Tuck your hair up under a shower cap. Do so if you wish to take a shower but feel your hair doesn't need a wash.


Smell sweet. Use scented hair or body products in the shower, and use some body lotion in order to keep your skin soft. Spray yourself lightly with perfume or body mists. You may wish to buy coordinated scents to maximize the effect. Whilst a faint smell is lovely, beware of overdoing it, especially at school. Less is more.

No amount of 'smellies' can successfully mask the smell of sweat. Use a good antiperspirant to prevent sweating. You may wish to top off with a deodorant which will mask the smell of your sweat.



, If you wear a uniform, you may not need to wash your jumper, trousers, or skirt more than once a week. However, you should remember to change your shirt everyday or every other day.

, Get rid of acne or pimples if you have any. Use a daily facial cleanser to reduce or prevent acne. Choose one which complements your natural skin type: normal, dry, sensitive, oily or combined. Follow up with a moisturizer as facial cleansers tend to be drying.


Experiment with different products to find what best suits you. Talk to a pharmacist about the products on offer. However, give each product a fortnight or so before you expect to see any real effect.
If you find that you have a lot of problems with spots, visit your doctor. They may prescribe certain medications to help clear it up.

, Use light, natural tones for school. In addition, save the bright colors for parties.


Use a close to your complexion foundation or for a lighter feel, a tinted moisturizer. Apply concealer under the eyes and on pimples. Pat it on, and don't rub it in. Afterwards, lightly dab on face powder to cover your face, and blend in your foundation with your concealer.
Remember to remove all makeup every night. Otherwise, it will clog your pores and cause acne.

, This showcases your lovely eyes and suited for your eye color. Choose what works for you best. If you prefer only to wear lip gloss and concealer, then do that.


If you have blue eyes, there are several shadow shades that will work for you. Shades in the brown, light pink and violet families work best generally. Also, try rich browns, golds, warm taupe, soft peaches, and pretty lilacs.

For eyeliner, go with a brown shade or dark brown to keep it subtle and soft. You want to look as if you woke up that way. With mascara, use brown or brown/black mascara, or even clear mascara to look the most natural.


""Decorate"" your green eyes. Violet and plum eye shadow shades are best for green eyes. Warmer colors like deep purples, mauve, lilacs, and medium pinks are also good choices. Browns, bronzes, golds, coppers, and deep greens will also compliment your eye color.

For eyeliner, try a dark brown, hunter green, or plum shade. Black eyeliner can often be too overwhelming. However, if you think it can look nice, then use it. Your mascara should be brownish black too. Use black mascara sparingly.


Complement your brown eyes. Brown eyes are some of the easiest to complement. This eye color can get away with greens, golds, browns, pinks, blues, grays and purples. Earthy colors tend to look the best for neutral looks.

Black eyeliner will work nicely with brown eyes. Use some black mascara to open and brighten the eyes.


Complement hazel eyes. Shades of pale pink, light purple and baby blush look great with hazel eyes. Use some shimmer on your lids to bring out the twinkle in your eyes. Hazel eyes stand out with deep greens, lavenders and shades with soft yellow undertones. To bring out the gold in your eyes, choose golden based eye shadows.

To bring out the green specks in your eyes, choose a brighter green shade like emerald and apply in three different intensities.
To bring out the blue specks in your eyes, go with purple in three different shades. To highlight the brown base of your hazel eyes stick with natural shades of brown. This will give you that ""do-like"" appearance.
To bring out the green and blue specks with a more natural look, go with soft natural shades paired with dark green or blue liner and black mascara.



, This way, you won't need to lick them all day. Exfoliate your lips once every 2 weeks with a homemade scrub or one bought from the store.


Use a medicated lip balm or chap-stick of your choice. Do this in order to keep them smooth and supple. Apply your favorite lip gloss/lip tint on top, in order to get sheer and shiny lips. Lip glosses come in many sweet flavors. Do not lick them off!

, If you wish to remove hair from your arms or legs, try shaving, waxing or using a hair removal cream.


Try shaving if you haven't already. Use a shaving cream with a razor to remove hair. Buy a woman's razor to avoid nicking yourself. Sensitive razors are available for shavings your underarms and bikini area. If you are afraid of cutting yourself, try a depilatory cream or lotion.

, Waxing is the longest term solution available to most teenage girls. If you wish to start waxing, find a reputable practitioner or try it yourself at home. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure the best experience and results.

, They cause pimples and bumps.

, Any stray hairs should be plucked away. Straight eyebrows tend to look more youthful, arched eyebrows look more mature and grown up.


If your eyebrows are thin and undefined, use an eyebrow pencil, or matte eyeshadow. Use it close to your eyebrow color to color them in. Use a pencil/shadow at least 2 shades lighter then your hair. Never use black; it looks far too harsh, even on black eyebrows.

, Dry hair is more prone to damage and breakage.


Use a high quality shampoo and conditioner, then apply your styling products.
If your hair gets very oily and you feel like you have to shampoo your hair everyday, invest in a dry shampoo from a local beauty supply store. If your hair is more textured (curly or wavy) shampoo your hair once to twice a week, and use a conditioner on your no-shampoo days. Every hair type deserves personalized care; curly hair has different needs to straight or wavy hair.
If you want to add something interesting, try coloring your hair; do not use anything too bold or different. Don't go from black to platinum blonde, you may be labeled as unoriginal or fake.

Do soft, subtle shades about one to two shades lighter for a complete dye. For highlights or a soft ombre, you can temporarily try different colors of your choice. Nothing too out of the ordinary, especially at private schools.



, Once in a while heat manipulation isn't too bad.


Always use a heat protestant to avoid damaging your hair too much. If you prefer using no heat, there are tons of heat-less ways to differently style your hair on YouTube. You can even get new hairstyle tutorials to try.

For example, use a french braid, fishtail, waterfall, heat-less waves, creative ponytails and buns, etc. Style it differently everyday. A little accessory makes a difference.



, Try curling your hair sometimes for loose waves, or scrunching it for a wet beach look. You can also straighten it for a sleek look, and try different ponytail and bun styles with varied headbands.

, If your new school allows you to wear whatever you please, make it your own. Wear plenty of cute tops with skirts and jeans. Simple cardigans, sweaters, and jackets can dress up or down an outfit.

, Never pick style over comfort. Cute wedges, ballerina flats, sandals (if your school allows it), and sneakers (if you're the sporty type) can always make your outfit look great.


Wear what your school allows. If you have a skirt that you feel is a bit too long, Roll it up a bit, but no more than two to four inches above the knee. The school will know and the people will confront you in front of the whole class. How embarrassing!
Try untucking your school shirt, and unbuttoning the first two buttons, which is usually above your cleavage. But, if you can't do anything to alter the uniform due to strict teachers, leave the uniform alone.

, Try jewelry, a pretty headband, and a cute tote bag. Wear the expected socks or shoes. Most private schools have a designated color, such as brown or black.

, For black shoes, wear ballerina flats, low heels, Toms, Sperrys, or Converses/Vans. Many of those shoes come in different color options.

, If you aren't allowed to wear nail polish, just put on a clear polish. If you are then experiment, and try fun and funky colors ranging from red to white, green to blue. Try anything! If you want to look simple, and a bit more matured, you can also try a pretty french manicure on your natural nails or acrylic/gel.

, The nails can snag, and make your natural nail brittle and weak. Weigh out the pros and cons.

, At every class, try to sit and talk to someone new, don't be rude to anyone it can come back and nip you in the bottom.


On the first week of school, just tag along. Don't try to be friends with anyone just yet. Find a person to help you adapt to class. She will be a good friend to you, so don't stop talking to her when you get popular.

, That's the easiest way to become popular, or if they are mean. You don't want to turn into that then stay with the kids you met in classes.


If you gain more friends and are confident enough, try joining the school council, or even president. Don't be fake and try to like everything they like, you still want to be yourself right? And what fun would it be anyway if you weren't yourself?

, Try Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. You can add friends on those websites. Try hanging out in places they would normally be at. ex: Starbucks/Caribou, school gym, mall, etc. Ask to sit with them, Be prepared for a solid ""No"". They might not exactly trust you yet. If they say ""yes"" then your right on track.


Soak up their trends, gossip, and everything else. Do not distribute it, though.

They might not even care for your opinion right now, as they might not even consider you a friend.
You can get into conflicts with others for gossiping about them.
If you tell a secret of theirs to someone else they won't trust you anymore. You'll be at square one again, so don't get too overconfident and forget who you are.



, You'll know when you did everything correctly when they have a party/sleepover that they invite you to, That means they like you. They won't just invite anyone to their house, right? If they have any plans and choose to invite you, that will seal the deal.


If you aren't invited, don't be too disappointed, maybe you'll have to initiate interactions. You can invite her (leader of clique), and her only to your house. She might accept.
Keep the conversations light and flowing. Do fun things like prank call people, watch movies, bake things, do nails, makeup, facials, and hair. Don't feel restricted to only be at your place. If your old enough you could plan it on a night that has a party, you could get ready at your place, (Hair, makeup, cute outfits) and have a blast at the party. Afterwards, you could come home and do something else interesting.
The next time you can invite the others, but if you feel like you have to always initiate conversations and she never tries to talk to you either, then maybe it isn't even worth it. She may also be hard to convince or trust people as a close friend.
Don't share your beliefs and deep secrets yet, focus a little on her for now so she can build your trust as well as you, so you can be certain she doesn't distribute your secrets and beliefs either.

, To have a clique find a few people you feel the most connection with and make a group with them.

, Be yourself, and honest. Don't lie or brag, Nobody likes a liar!

Point out what does look good.,
Critique the outfit, not the lady.,
Redirect her attention to a better outfit.,
Turn the tables.,
Hide behind what does seem good.,
There's always the unvarnished truth.",How to Be Honest when She Asks if an Outfit Makes Her Look Fat," Tell her it complements her midsection, or how the hemline showcases her legs. Point out the good aspects of her figure and hope she doesn't go for followup questions.


Focus on one feature and remark about how many women would kill for that body part. For example, if she always complains about her rounded backside, remind her that numerous women go under the knife to have butt implants or spend hours at the gym doing squats to achieve a similar bottom—and that that skirt really highlights that.
This is a great time to commend her for any dieting and exercising she's been doing lately! Don't, however, phrase it like this: ""That diet is really working—a few more pounds, and you'll look good in that dress!"";
, Tell her that the article of clothing in question is poorly fitted, or made of cheap fabric, or just plain ugly and does not do her figure justice.


The reality is that with a good cut of clothing in quality fabric, most people can look good, whatever their size. However, many people do themselves a disservice by trying to wear fashion fads, clinging fabrics or poor quality clothing and such clothing often accentuates figure weaknesses rather than disguises them. So you can definitely have a go at the clothing in good conscience.
Tell her the outfit doesn’t complement her shape. After telling her what you like about her body, explain that the cut or the outfit’s design does not accentuate the beautiful aspects of her figure. For example: ""You have such nice curves and this dress is like a giant square!""
Explain that the clothing hides her figure. Point out certain areas of the outfit that are unflattering—it’s not her, it’s the clothing. ""I don't like how it tugs at your chest so much.""
Perhaps there’s too much fabric in one area, the color is wrong for her, or the pattern is too busy—verbally identify what seems “off” and unrelated to her figure.

, When asked whether her current outfit makes her look fat, tell her ""I like the pink one you tried on before. You looked awesome in that."" Tell her which outfit(s) make her look smoking hot.


Help her to see that she has clothing that makes her look wonderful by explaining that you love seeing her wear those other pieces. In fact, refer to those other pieces to use as a model when choosing a new outfit.
Grab a pair of pants or a dress that you love on her. If you're at her house, go to her closet and take out the items that compliment her shape. Find different pieces, such as dresses and work clothing to workout wear and casual ensembles that look good on her.
Explain why the other outfit looks good on her versus the one she has on now. Pick apart attractive outfits and identify why she looks great in each piece. For example, you may think she looks great in V-necks or straight leg pants because they compliment her shoulders or legs. Give her examples and why you like certain pieces on her.

, If all else fails and you panic, try to get her to answer her own question. It's cheeky but it may just work. When she asks if she looks fat in an outfit respond by quizzically saying, “Well what do you think?” Followed by, “Do you like the outfit or do you maybe want to try something else?”

, Point out one feature that you do like about the outfit, if there is anything. Not to confuse the situation, you could identify some redeeming features the outfit offers. For example, if you think the clothing is well-made, tell her you like the quality of the fabric and stitching. The drawback to this approach is that she'll probably notice you've not mentioned anything about how she looks and this may sting.

, There are a couple possibilities here. One is that she's overweight, and she's got to be careful how she dresses. She knows she's not a stick figure, and pretending she is could just suggest to her that you have a spine of jelly.


If the outfit makes her look fat, say ""It's not a good look on you. Try that black number you had on earlier—that looked much better on you.""
The other possibility is that she's not overweight, she's just insecure about her looks. In that case, just say something like ""No, not in the least. You have a glorious bod, and pretty much anything you wear looks good."" If you just don't like the dress, you can continue with ""Now that other dress you had on a few minutes ago—that was a wow!""
If she keeps asking about this, cut to the chase. ""I love you and think you're absolutely beautiful. It worries me that you're asking me this so often. Why are you so concerned? Is everything okay with you?""

Use a deep conditioner once a week or every other day, and maybe a leave-in detangler if your hair is really knotty.;
, Find a nice scent you like, such as vanilla or strawberry, and use it every day. Deodorant is important so you don't smell like sweat. Some good brands are Dove, Degree, and Lady Speed Stick.

, Match the scent of your lotion to your body wash so you don't have too many different smells.

, Shave your legs and armpits, and if you have dark hair, possibly your forearms. If you're comfortable, shave your bikini line, but it's not a necessity, as no one will see down there. Don't start shaving anywhere because someone else thinks you should. Lots of 12-year-old girls do not have unsightly body hair. Many girls can be cool, stylish and beautiful without shaving. Only shave if you want to.

, Make sure they fit properly- nothing too short or low cut, nothing too baggy or ill-fitting. Your pants should fit snugly, if they don't, wear a belt. Nothing is less attractive than yanking at your pants or rolling them up.

, Wash it with a nice face wash (not an acne wash unless you have acne) wash twice a day, then use toner, face lotion, and any acne treatments or special creams you wish. Do not skip this step!

, There is no need for heavy foundations, blushes, or eyeshadows. If you really think you need it, some BB cream or concealer, some lip balm / gloss, and a touch of mascara will do it. You also might consider plucking your eyebrow or curling your eyelashes. Don't put on any make-up just because this article says you should. Only wear makeup if you want to; avoid doing it just because of peer pressure or to fit in and ""look cool"".

, Go to bed early enough that you can get up on time in the morning without feeling too tired.

, Be nice to everyone, especially your enemies or the people no one seems to talk to. Have close friends that you genuinely like and feel comfortable around and be close with them: entrust them with your secrets and invite them to sleepovers and parties.

, Although lots of girls this age have them, it's not really ""dating"". You normally just hold hands a little bit and maybe go see a movie or two. In extreme cases, they might kiss but don't let this pressure you!

There are definite ways to be chic on a small budget and finding second-hand stores in high-class areas is one of the biggest ones.You’ll find designer brands and elegant clothes for much cheaper. People who are rich often buy clothes and then send it off to a second-hand shop without ever wearing it, or wearing it only a few times.
The prices will be good, because these types of stores are catering to people who don't have a ton of money, but who love quality, classy clothes. The prices will be much better than those clothes would fetch first-hand.;
, People who set trends, who are chic and fashionable, are people who find clothes that others don't have. This means avoiding the big stores and going looking for clothes. You might have to spend a little more than you would on something at Kmart, but it will last longer and be unique.


Artist bazaars are a great place to find unique and fashionable clothing. You can find printed shirts, skirts and dresses, tailored clothes, as well as lots of different kinds of accessories: jewelry, bags, belts, scarves, etc.
Vintage shops are great places to find elegant and chic clothing. A lot of older clothing is also sturdier and tends to last longer (which is why you can find it in these types of stores).

, You will want to stand out. Chic is about being fashionable and fashionable means that you're not following every single trend. You're blazing your own trails. You're setting trends.


Look into history to find inspiration. Of course there's the typical 40s and 50s inspired outfits, but look to places like the Victorian era (some gorgeous jackets) or wear jewelry and hair ornaments inspired by the 20s.
You could even look into your own cultural background. Avoid appropriating other people's culture for your fashion ends (if you're not Hindu, for example, don't wear a bindi; or if you're not a decorated Chief of the Plains Indians, don't wear a War Bonnet), but you could see what your culture has to offer in terms of fashion opportunities.
Look at the people you see around you. You can incorporate outfits or ideas that you like into your own style. It doesn't mean you need to copy someone else, but you might see something that looks cool and try it out yourself. For example: you see a woman wearing a jewel-toned maxi dress and pearls, you might try out the maxi dress off yourself, but add your own ideas to it.

, Making your own clothes is a great, if somewhat time consuming, way to have a unique look. You can also look at old fashioned patterns and use those as part of your look.


Remember that making clothes, especially sewing your clothes, takes some time. You'll need to practice and start small before you want work your way up to more complicated outfits.
If you do decide to make your own patterns you can incorporate all kinds of ideas from various eras in time and various styles you might see in magazines or on the internet.

, Part of being chic is about being confident in your style and in what you wear. This means that you need to pick clothes that you feel comfortable in. If you don't feel comfortable in what you're wearing, other people will pick up on that and not see you as a chic trendsetter.



Wear clothes that fit you properly. Make sure that you know your dress size, so you know what clothes will fit you the best. When clothes don't fit, when they're too tight or too loose, you don't look fashionable, you tend to look uncomfortable.
Wear clothes you feel comfortable in. If heels make you uncomfortable, don't wear them. Instead, find fun flats or tennis shoes that you like and that work with your outfits.

, While part of being chic is setting your own trends, it's also good to know what other people are wearing. Sometimes you can incorporate these looks into your own style.


The internet is a great resource for keeping on top of the fashion world. There are lots of great fashion blogs, especially ones that exhibit awesome street fashion from around the world. You can also look at photos from fashion debuts.
Look at what's selling in magazines. You won't always agree with the looks, but they can offer interesting perspective on what's considered fashionable.

, These will be the bases of your look. You can rotate through them and build on them, but these will be what you go for.Have a couple alternating outfits based around your “uniform” look. For example: you might build your look around dresses. Now you can cycle between your floral dresses (wearing heels or flats to change it up), throwing in the occasional maxi dress or little black dress.
As another example: your uniform might be jeans and a shirt. You could cycle through jeans and a nice button down, jeans and a sweater, jeans and a t-shirt. You could roll up your cuffs or wear flats or heels, but the uniform stays mostly the same.
This doesn't mean you can't mix it up from time to time. It just means that you know what works for you and what you like and you focus on that.

, It's a good idea to focus on enhancing one part of your body so that you don't overwhelm yourself trying to show off everything. Pick one part that you want people to notice and plan your outfit around that one part.


For example: if you’re showing off your cleavage, don’t show off your legs too. Wear a tight-fitting, scoop-necked top, but then a long flowing skirt.

, Certain looks sit better on certain body types than on others. While these are only guidelines for what you might wear given your body type they can give you a flattering edge when you're picking out clothing.Pear shaped means basically that your lower body is wider than your upper body (hips wider than shoulders). Your bottom half tends to be rounded, although your waist is defined. Go for a-line skirts and skirts and trousers with a wide base to balance out your lovely proportions. Boat neck tops, square and cowl necklines are great for showing off your upper body.
Wedge shaped means that your body conforms to an inverted triangle, typically with a broader chest and wider shoulders compared to your narrower waist and hips. You want looks that emphasize your legs. Full skirts, high-waisted styles, and thick belts are all good looks for you.
Rectangle shaped folks tend to have an athletic body type. You waist, hip, and your shoulder widths tend to be similar and are usually on the slim side. Wear scoop necks and sweetheart tops to emphasize your chest area. Long jackets are great for emphasizing your lean look. Get dresses that show off your arms and your legs.
Apple shaped means that your weight tends to accumulate above your hips. You might feel that you are wider than the other body types since your back, ribs, and shoulders tend to be broad. Try out v-necks, and belts. The empire cut, in tops and dresses, is a great look for you and you'll want to be sure that you show off those lovely legs!
Hourglass shapes tend to have a similar proportion with their shoulders and their hips, with a waist that tends to be smaller. Fitted and wrap dresses, as well as belts, are good for showing off your waist. You want to show off your curves!

, This way you won't be over-doing anything. A tight top, with a tight bottom tends to be a bit too much. You want to leave a little something to the imagination. On the other hand, having everything be really loose doesn't give you any nice shape. You can wear these if you want, but they probably won't look very chic.


Small top with loose skirt or trousers can be a great look. It emphasizes the top part of your body while balancing it with a loose bottom.
Contrasting colors can also be a good thing to play around with. You might not want to go overboard with this, but wearing a blue top and some fun bright orange earrings, for example, can be a good use of contrasts.
You can also play around with elegant versus casual. For example you might pair an elegant top with a pair of jeans and maybe some pearls.

, There are a couple of things that you can do to instantly add a bit more glam to your outfit. These can give you an edge that puts you into the realm of chic, rather than boring.Motorcycle or black leather jacket can basically go with any outfit. It can be worn over a fancy dress to give you a bit of an edge or over a basic jeans and a t-shirt outfit (especially if you pair it with something girly, like floral print flats).
Mix it up with a bit of male attire: a man’s blazer, basketball shorts, a tie, a man’s 1920s hat. All of these can be a great fashion addition for a girl. Think of Janelle Monae, if you want an example.
A white button-down blouse is a great addition to the fashionable wardrobe. It can dress up jeans, or dress down a poofy skirt.

, You want these to enhance your look with your accessories. Try to avoid overwhelming your look. For example, if you tend to wear more neutral colored outfits, Try to pick vivid, jewel-toned accessories.


Jewelry is a great accessory! It can liven up a less colorful outfit, or it can be the understated finish to your elegant outfit. For example: you might pair some chunky, geometric jewelry with a brightly colored, geometric print dress.
Bags should be decorative as well as functional. It's good to have a main bag, one that goes with most of your outfits (typically in a more neutral tone), and then have some that are more fun and brighter.
Belts are great for enhancing your waist and adding a bit of color. You can pick ones that match your shoes so that the colors come together. For example, if you're wearing a red dress, you might wear a black belt, black shoes, and golden and black jewelry.
Definitely add some scarves! Scarves, especially flowing, chiffon ones, can add some instant class to your outfit. Pair them with jeans and a t-shirt, or wrap it around your head ala Audrey Hepburn.

, Shoes can give an outfit that little bit of extra flare. They can dress up an outfit that might have been very plain, or can dress down an outfit that you don't want to go overboard with. Make sure you're wearing shoes that you feel comfortable in!


Flats go well with most outfits and can look just as dressy as a pair of high heels (bonus: they’re easier to walk in). Depending on the sparkles on them, how flashy they are, and what pattern they have, you can pair them with jewelry to accent your outfit, or you can make them stand out as the focal point of your outfit.
Boots are also wonderfully versatile. Depending on the colors you tend to use in your outfits grab boots that are black, grey, or brown. Have at least one pair that doesn't distract from the rest of the outfit. You can also go for some more exciting kinds like midnight blue boots or bright purple.
High heels can be fabulous, as long as you feel comfortable walking in them. There's nothing more terrifying than watching someone totter down the street and hope they don't break their ankle. You can dress up a pair of jeans, or enliven a skirt with a fabulous pair of heels.
Sandals are also good, especially if you live in a hot climate. They're cute with jeans, or shorts, or skirts, or maxi dresses. The fancier ones are good for evening wear and the less fancy are good for wearing during the day.

, Make-up can be great for enhancing your natural attractiveness. It can add that extra touch of style. Again, you'll want to try out different looks to see what works best for you and what you like best with your clothing style.


Enhance your natural features by adding definition to your eyes with eyeliner. You can do this in a subtle shade (like brown), and then brush on a pale, natural shape of eyeshadow. A little mascara can open up your lashes, making them look longer. With a little bronzer you can contour your face to bring out your cheekbones. With blush you can widen or lengthen your face depending on what you want (apply in a horizontal line to widen or across temples and jaw to lengthen).
Create the stylish smokey-eye look. Put a little nude eyeshadow over your entire eyelid. Put on some shimmering eyeshadow from the base to the brow of your eyelid. Next, you'll line your top and bottom lash line with dark eyeliner (in brown or in black). Smudge the eye-liner with a Q-tip. You'll sweep a darker eyeshadow over your eyelid and into the crease of your eye. Blend that color up and out. Apply the highlighting color under your brow bone and tear duct. Line your inner lash line with eyeliner to intensify the effect. Give your lashes a couple coats of mascara and curl them upward.

Find some quirky make-up looks. Use bright colors that bring out your natural eye color, or find a make-up style that is unusual.

, You want to do something unusual and stylish with your hair so that people notice it and you. Hair is a great way to draw attention to your look. It can help enhance your attractive features, as well.


Find unusual inspiration. Again, look through history to see what hairstyles people were using and incorporate that into your look. Experiment with different looks to see what works best with your hair and your outfits.
Wavy hair looks good with looks like a messy updo that has soft, face-framing tendrils, or pulling up the sides of your hair and securing them in the back while letting the ends curl.
Straight hair looks good with a side part that leaves your hair down, or a pony-tail that given some volume at the crown of your head with a little hairspray, or french braiding your hair on either side of your part and securing in back.
Curly hair looks fantastic in a short cut, or you could let it loose with a little product to keep the frizz down. You could also try grabbing small sections of your hair in the back and pinning them up.

Get fit.,
Eat healthy.,
Develop your own style - don't worry about following certain trends (although being a follower isn't a bad thing), just wear what you like and what you feel confident in.,
Be your own friend.,
Do not base your worth on what other people think of you.",How to Be a Hot and Fit Teenage Girl," Running is often the safest option for most people as it is simple and you don't need to join any special clubs (although having a running buddy makes it more fun and there are running clubs you can join if you prefer to socialise!). You don't have to run miles, but you should run until you at least feel uncomfortable (not unbearable). Gradually, you will realize you can run way further a lot more comfortably. You can also do cycling or swimming as a main, regular or basic exercise. Once you have chosen your basic exercise, do this exercise every two days, as well as other less strenuous sports, such as tennis, volleyball, etc. Visit the gym sometimes if there is one you can afford to go to - if you go to Uni or College, there may be a student gym you can take advantage of. A really good way to be fit and have fun is to dance. Even video dancing games (such as Just Dance) will get you to burn calories and have fun doing it. Just don't push yourself to hard on any of these suggestions. Know your limit.;
, Try to avoid eating sugary foods, white carbohydrates, all crisps sweets and ice creams, as well as full fat dairy products (although a little in moderation is okay!). Eat brown carbs (like whole grains and brown rice), nuts, fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, fresh salads, low fat dairy products and lean meat, fish and eggs. The good news is you can eat as much of those food as you like. If you just remember what you can and can't eat too much of. Treat yourself once in a while, but little; the last thing you'll want to do is slip up when you've come so far. You shouldn't need to take vitamin supplements if you eat like this. Stay away from carbonated drinks, even diet sodas are harmful with all of the aspartame in them. Also stay away from milkshakes, and if you need something sweet, get a smoothie. Drink tons of water, it is the best thing for your skin and you can get it almost anywhere.

, Don't try to copy a certain image, this will make people think you are fake and will be very embarrassing when you reach 18 or 19. You may want to follow a certain celebrity or singer's fashion. When it comes to shopping, shop for your size and shape. Make sure your hair and make up matches your style, and make sure you never buy dirt cheap stuff. Make sure your hair products and makeup come from brands you trust and are ethical (i.e. don't test on animals, harm the environment, harm you or come from companies that use bad methods). Be confident and have faith in your looks. Be proud and daring with what you wear, and you'll turn heads.

, Be happy, nice, and helpful. If you're asked to do something around the house or at school, smile and say, ""I'd be happy to."" If you need a hand, ask for one. Smile a lot; not all the time, but you want to appear happy. If ever something is lent to you, do what you needed it for and return it speedily, as this builds enormous amounts of trust. Be a flatterer, and if you're going to give a compliment, let it be genuine, and with a smile. Don't be friends with everyone, but be nice to everyone. If someone is mean to your face, take it on the chin. Once they've finished having a go, smile and brush it off - threatening them, being rude back to them or arguing with them only creates drama and makes you look as bad as them. If you are cool and mature, people will respect that and will either stand up for you when someone is being mean to you, or, if they are the one being horrible, get frustrated and back off. If someone is really bothering you and won't leave you alone, tell a teacher or a parent!

, Just because people say something about you does not make it true! Who cares what other people think anyway? How you see yourself matters more than what other people see - letting the haters get you down only leads to depression, anxiety, self obsession, stress and even developing eating disorders and dysmorphia. Teenagers can be very horrible to each other sometimes and say things out of jealousy or spite, and sometimes they're just downright immature. Learn to ignore them. Your worth is not based on whether boys like how you look or how many Facebook friends you have. Appearances and popularity are not everything - you can be a flawless, hot girl and not look like a supermodel or have a gazillion friends!"

, Abercrombie & Fitch, Forever 21, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hollister...if you don't have enough money to buy these clothes, try to dress at more obscure designer-looking places.

You should be ahead with the fads, and so-over the present fads. The ultimate staple of being fashionable is starting a trend. That can shoot you up with major popularity points.

, You can't let anyone have an excuse to make fun of you. Buy yourself acne creams and wipes, wash your face and DON'T touch it. Know your head shape and what colors will look good on you. Don't bite your nails and try to have them painted most of the time. Have your hair shiny and neat.

, People need to grow up anyway. Make others feel insecure at all times. If a girl is wearing a hideous pair of shoes, say ""Nice shoes,"" in a sarcastic tone and laugh with your friends. Or, if a girl is with her boyfriend, flirt with him right in front of her to make her jealous, then, smile at her and walk away.

, A major part of being cute is acting innocent, because cuteness is something associated with things that are childlike, harmless, and sweet.There are lots of ways you can act innocent and sweet, including:


Don’t swear or tell dirty jokes
Chew gum and blowing bubbles
Play with your hairBe silly

, To be cute, one of the most important things you can do is be personable and fun. Being angry, frustrated, or defensive isn't cute, so work on being kind and friendly.Say hello to people you know when you see them, and introduce yourself to new people when you meet.
Ask people about themselves, and listen to their answers. For instance, when you run into an acquaintance, you can say, “Hi! I haven't seen you in a while. How have you been?”
Be generous with compliments. For instance, if you love a friend’s new haircut, say, “Your hair looks incredible! It really brings out your eyes.”
Don’t cross your arms when you're in a crowd, because this can make you look defensive and unapproachable.

, One of the easiest ways you can be friendly and cute is to smile a lot when you're around other people. Most people know how to smile with their mouths, but you can also smile with your eyes and your whole face:Start by thinking about something that makes you happy. When you have that happy feeling, narrow your eyes slightly without moving the other muscles of your face.
Smile ever so slightly with your mouth by turning up the corners of your mouth. This combination of expressions will give the impression that you are cheery, friendly, and easy to talk to.

, This means spending time with other people and being fun to be around. You can be sociable by going to parties and get-togethers when you're invited, organizing and hosting your own social events, talking to people when you're out, and keeping up old friendships and making new ones.You don’t have to attend every social event you're invited to, but try to make an appearance at as many as you can manage without cutting into family time, work, school, and other obligations.
If you haven't talked to your friends in a while, call or text them to keep in touch and ask how they’ve been.
Make an effort to make friends with new people too. You can do this by inviting them out with you, getting to know them, and finding common interests.

Set a good sleep schedule.,
Incorporate at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5-6 times in a week.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Be a Gorgeous Teen Girl3," You will look and feel ten times better if you do! That doesn't mean you should go to bed at 7:00 every night. But if you go to bed at ten, and wake up at six, that's a good eight hours! When sleeping, you should have at least 8-9 hours of sleep. However, some people manage to be can sleep for only 7 hours while some people need to sleep 10 hours. It all depends on your body and you will eventually find the number of hours you need.


You don't have to keep the schedule up during the weekends. Make sure you don't go to bed at ridiculous times though (1:00 in the morning is not the best bedtime). You don't want to wake up with blood-shot, baggy eyes, and tired and dull skin. You need your beauty sleep!

Make sure that if you are going to put heat on your hair, you use some kind of protection so as not to get split ends.,
Don't straighten your hair every single day.",How to Be a Gorgeous Teen Girl4," You don't want to wash your hair every single day though because that will make it lose its natural oils.


If your hair is short, you can look at inspirations such as Rihanna and Victoria Beckham for hairstyles whereas if your hair is on the longer side (shoulder-length and longer), you could look at Kim Kardashian and Beyonce for your inspiration.

, In order to work your hair, you could keep it straight, wavy, curly or afro centric but it should always have some kind of shine. You definitely don't want dull, frizzy hair. In order to do that, find some products that produce shine such as Garnier Fructis and TRESemmé.

, It is best to air dry your hair instead of blow drying it to relieve it from all of the heat.

, It creates split ends and causes a lot of heat damage and the consequences are not worth it. Some appliances that may come in handy are: flat irons (for days where you want pin straight hair), curling wands (where you want lose waves and no creases in your hair from the clamps of curling irons), curling irons (for days where you want big, glamorous curls) and blow dryers (when time is running out and you don't have time to air dry).

Work on your behaviour, and the air which you carry yourself with.,
Don't talk to people as a whole; talk to people as individuals.,
Your ""look"" follows you everywhere.,
Every four months, up the ante.",How to Attract Attention (for Teens!)," This means never freaking out, or going ""Section 8 Sicko"" on anyone in public.


Always act calm, no matter what!






Don’t get carried away, ever.






Keep your voice low and steady, and never cry or get sad in public.






Don’t cause too much drama and if you do, make sure it’s meaningful. (Ex, someone is spreading a rumour about you or is being mean, then it’s fine to get some backup. But even then, don’t waste your breath; it’s no big deal!)






Look people in the eye when you talk, and don’t talk too loud. (If you talk loudly, it should be in class or at any rehearsals/practices. And even then, do so respectfully.)






Don’t act hyper. Don’t lie about being bad. (Acting hyper means being weird and saying random things and overall, just trying too hard. It doesn’t mean you can’t stand up for what you believe in, and it doesn’t mean that you can’t have a personality.)






Don’t tell everyone if you do happen to get a boyfriend, and even then, don’t prioritize him above all else. And don’t act needy; give him some space. (Don’t rush him into kissing you, and don’t even rush the hugging! Let him decide, but if nothing is happening. Take some initiative, but don’t be pushy and off-putting!)






Keep your cool, and simply reply with a more than snappy comment in a low, indifferent voice when you get mad. (Don’t turn red, and especially don’t yell or get physical. If you get to the point where you’re about to yell or touch them, simply smile sweetly and walk away. You’ll be the bigger person in the end.)






Don’t brag about your grades, or never studying. (It’s good to make an effort for your grades and it’s nicer to keep it to yourself. Ex, don’t get riled up over a bad grade, simply work even harder in order to better it. Don’t take it out on anyone! Ex, don’t brag wildly about a good grade, just give a half smile and shrug, and then put it away. Ex, if someone asks you get grades, make it a mystery: Offer up a “So-so,” and then shrug it off. Then, when they ask to see your report card, they’ll be shocked!)






Always be ready to surprise someone (practice your singing and rarely sing in public. Practice acting and then try out for drama. Practice dancing and then seldom dance in public. Practice reading and volunteer to read in class on day, out of the blue. Practice some random talent and then one day, offer it up. But don’t brag, or even play up your talents).





;
, Seek out what their hobbies, and personal favourites, and once you have an overall understanding of your friends, and others that you might approach, then start conversations casually. Always maintain an air of comfort and ease when talking to people, like so:


You: *in a steady voice.* Oh... hey, Amanda!
(Amanda isn't a really good friend of yours, but she's on your cousin's soccer team.) Amanda: Hey.
You: I've been meaning to ask you about soccer. I missed a few games, and I wanted to know where you're playing next. (Maintain your volume at a comfortable, low level.)
Amanda: Really? I didn't even know you went! But we're playing at Bryce Field next, it's like a mile from my house?
You: Oh, yeah I've been there once. Anyway, I'll be at your next game so keep an eye out.
Amanda: Definitely!
You: I'm late for chorus... But good luck at the game! Bye.

, So make sure you work on it! Pick more subtle, solid ensembles that make you seem true to yourself and real.

Comfy Chic: Pair dark leggings or yoga pants with a solid colored tunic (Old Navy has cheap ones!) and clean sneakers. Keep your clean and properly styled, and you'll look pretty.






High Fashion Look: Skinny jeans in a darker wash, paired with a dark or solid tee, in a looser fit and flats or boots always make you seem more sophisticated. Straighten your hair maybe, and brush it out very smoothly.







, Create an alluring look and dress up a bit. Show it off! And then have some fun with your smile and just be very welcoming that day. This will get people seeing another side of you that they might really like, and leave them wanting more! But only do it every once in a while, to keep the mystery!

, Rhinestone covers are the best though the rhinestones fall off after some time. You can get a rubber cover but they aren't very BBB!

, Most Blackberry Babes are celebrities. This doesn't mean that you should copy the hairstyle of a celebrity, just make sure your hair is always neat and tidy. Bobs and long hair and cute.

, Or as perfect as you can get! Drink 8-10 glasses of water or half your body weight in water if you are over 16 and drink two water bottles if you are under. Wash your face twice a day and exfoliate once a week.

, Find out what your body type is and read articles that tell you what suits your body. Buy lots of magazines like Vogue (and Teen Vogue), Cosmopolitan (and Cosmo girl), Elle and Seventeen. Research Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn but mix that style in with modern celebrities of today.

, A little bit of lip gloss, mascara and eyeliner.

, Walk with confidence-shoulders back and look forward.

, A Blackberry babe CANNOT have yellow teeth. Use a whitening toothpaste, mouthwash and floss.

, Bath/shower twice a day every day. Use deodorant. Wash your hair every other day or once a week.

You must have a stunning figure!",How to Live a Gossip Girl Life," Gossip Girl is, naturally, all about gossip- while sometimes it may be actually harmful, in small amounts it's innocent, fun and very juicy; not to mention it's one of the main ways to popularity. Make your life worthy to be gossiped about; that includes doing some crazy things once in a while (but not so crazy you're looked down at) and making a reputation as a glamour girl. If your popularity, however, is falling, win back the hearts you were once popular among- by throwing the party of the year, getting the hottest guy in the school or getting on the cover of a magazine; anything, as long as it's glamorous and it gains the admiration of people around you.;
, Less than perfect looks are not accepted, as the way you look can make you or break you in a Gossip Girl-like world.


Take good care of yourself. Brand name skin lotions, shampoos, makeup products and other stuff are very often mentioned in the Gossip Girl books. In matters of products used for grooming, buy the best you can afford (well, actually that applies pretty much to everything...). Have a morning beauty routine: take a shower, wash and style your hair, paint your nails, apply makeup. When you afford, go to beauty salons and spas and have professionals take care of your skin, nails and hair; it's very relaxing and you get better results.
Get the style. Trendy clothes, straight hair, polished look- that's the predominant look in the books. Read fashion magazines and go on style.com to find out about the latest trends. Don't follow trends like crazy, though; having your own style is very appreciated. Just buying a few items in style at the moment will save you from bankruptcy and losing your fashion identity.
Buy fine, high quality, well-tailored clothes. They don't have to be designer (although a few designer clothes would be more than welcome), but they must be stylish, well-made and somewhat expensive. In matters of clothes, go for a sexy, sleek, high-end chic style. Buy some awesome shoes too. Own at least a designer it bag, if you afford.

, As fellow Upper East Siders, the Gossip Girl characters have impeccable manners; they don't want to risk being seen in public doing something that would go off as rude, gross, offensive, impolite or socially unacceptable in any way.



Never fart, burp, or cuss in public.
When arguing to someone, don't shout and be elegant in dealing with that person.
Don't be annoying, and especially not on purpose.
Be respectful to everyone.
Learn to apologize and thank people.
When going to an event, respect the dress code, if there's one.
Don't drink too much at a party; drunk people are just lame.

, Have fun, party 'till you drop, meet new people, flirt and dance. Be the center of attention for at least one night. You will be remembered as the girl who entertained everyone at the party and you'll start being invited to more and more events.

, You don't want to be like little J, getting grounded for everything she does wrong. Earn their trust and get allowance from them for partying, consuming alcoholic beverages (don't overdo it and get drunk though, and do not be underage for drinking alcohol) and shopping for everything you want. You never hear of Blair's or Serena's parents getting them grounded for doing these things.

, A gorgeous, privileged teenage girl would have no reasons to be insecure, and since you are aiming for her kind of lifestyle, you'll need loads of confidence to make it. Every time you feel down, do something you enjoy, like shopping or relaxing at a spa, for example. Find things you like about yourself and enhance them.

, For Blair, it was Audrey Hepburn; you can choose her, or any other fabulous personality you admire. It has to be someone that lives/has lived the way you want to live, so that it's easier to follow. For example, if your dream job is acting, choose an actress as a role model. It doesn't have to be a real person; it can be a character too, even a character from Gossip Girl!

, In the world of people like Blair and Serena, getting excellent grades and being involved in extracurricular activities and charity is very important, as these are bonus points in getting into the college of your dreams and having a rewarding job and reputation later in life.

, Nobody wants to hang out with a boring, grouchy person. Entertain people, be talkative (but not the annoying, unstoppable, chatterbox-like type of talkative), make jokes and compliment people. Be energetic and have brilliant initiatives and ideas. You'll attract everyone around you.

, People will look up to you for ideas of where to hang out, what to wear and what social events to attend. Know all the latest gossip about everyone around you; the juicier, the better.

, Someone who shies away from attention will never be popular. Don't regard attention as a bad thing; instead, learn to use it to your own advantage. Don't be too much of an attention-seeker, though, as it's purely pathetic.

, Both Blair and Serena are boy magnets. Learn to flirt and present yourself over as attractive to guys. There are different types of seductive; pick the type that is the closest to your personality and enhances your best features. You can be the mysterious, ladylike siren like Blair, the gorgeous, exuberant diva like Serena and so on.

, Generally, a clique is formed of a leader, her best friend (optional) and a few other weaker, more less confident, loyal sidekicks. These insecure, less socially skilled girls often need a stronger friend to rely on, as it's difficult for them to stand out and be popular on their own. They still have to be somewhat cool and fashionable (forming a clique of losers is unacceptable), but not too much so they can be seen as potential rivals. However, getting such a clique is often seen as social manipulation, and you may consider the other option: forming a group of strong, confident girls you are not bored by. This is a more satisfying option for the less bossy, but be aware that such groups often fall apart because the girls fight more than in a hierarchy-based clique, where you can silence other girls with a look.

, Don't always say what you think; if everybody told the truth right the way it is, our lives would be way more boring. Besides, sometimes a little innocent lie or a ""spiced up"" story is more interesting than the truth, right?

, Gossip Girl characters have a good public image without being completely innocent and ""clean"". The secret is keeping your naughty side for an exclusive group of people (only your friends and close ones); if you act in a way that can be considered promiscuous with everybody around, rumors will be spread and your reputation can go down.

, No one wants to be around someone who is embarrassing to look at. So tighten up those tummies and hush those thunder-thighs, you want to turn heads with your smoking hot bod. (Dress in your comfort zone when it comes to showing skin to look effortless. Gossip girls never look like they're trying too hard.)

Keep a refined home.,
Wear good quality clothing.,
Be articulate.,
Be an entertainer.,
Know your etiquette.,
Be careful not to become materialistic.,
Keep healthy.,
Look for posh people you admire.",How to Live a Posh Lifestyle," Only buy things that add value to your surrounds. Posh people are stylish, not cluttered. Keep things clean, tidy and spacious.;
, Rather than buying lots of cheap items, buy several expensive, well-tailored and classic items. Wait for the sales if they are too expensive now, or try consignment stores. But good clothing is a sign of self-respect and an expectation that you like the finer things in life. And that's posh.

, This does not mean putting on airs and graces (that is snobby, not posh) but it does mean that you should speak clearly, use English properly (know your grammar) and be well read. You should have at your fingertips a wide range of knowledge so that you can speak with a variety of people and impress them with the things that you know. You do not need depth but you do need breadth, which enables you to be a good people person. Be slightly open about your life you have no worries or cares, you have no money worries. You are very good natured and only comment on the good aspects of life not the negative.

, Posh people like to show others the good life and how they live themselves. Have dinner parties and other functions at your place to let people see how graciously you live and how well versed you are in dining etiquette.

, This is very important. Posh people have good manners and know the boundaries in human relations. They know not to tread on toes but equally they know how to upbraid people who do tread on toes. Manners are a form of currency for the posh person and the more you know of them, the better. Start here if you haven't a clue yet.

, Posh people are not materialistic - that easily becomes garish and common. Rather, posh people seek out quality and style whatever it may be - a handbag, a house, a car. Buy the best that your money can afford and go without the trinkets.

, The same for your body - buy good quality food to nourish yourself. Posh people respect themselves. Exercise regularly - find the right type of exercise for you, don't just join the latest trend. Never over-eat or over-indulge. Posh people know their limits and respect them; especially since respect in the eyes of others is also very important for a posh person.

, Don't copy them precisely but do allow their way of being, their style and attitudes to have some influence on yours. That way, you can build a strong foundation on which to become a posh person in your own right.

Try getting highlights in your hair, dying it, or simply getting it cut. Hair needs to be trimmed every six weeks or so to stay healthy. Look through magazines for hairstyle inspiration.Clean, waxed brows will open up your eyes, which should have either clear, black or brown mascara on them, and a light eyeshadow, such as beige or taupe. Use an eyeliner pencil on the top of eyes. Light pink or clear lipgloss is great for lips.

, They make your hands and feet feel so soft and will boost your confidence as well. You can do these at home, but if you want a treat, you can always head off to a salon! Most celebrities use a light coat of paint for their fingernails and a darker color for their toes. For an ultra-glam look, dress up your nails with stick-on jewels!, Work with what you already own first. Analyze your closet and donate anything that doesn't fit your new celebrity lifestyle. Buy a few celebrity gossip magazines and check out what's in vogue. What are your favorite celebs wearing? Your clothing does not have to be designer, it just has to fit your body well. Remember to try clothing on before purchasing so that you can check that it flatters your body type.If you want to buy designer clothing and cannot afford it, start saving. Do odd jobs for your parents, get a part-time job, and put your talents to use. You may soon be able to afford designer sunglasses or a scarf.

, Accessories really set outfits off and take a look to the next level. Try looking at online shops such as Etsy or eBay to find unique jewelry that suits your style. Be sure not to overdo it with accessories, however, as the most sophisticated looks often keep accessorizing to a minimum. Try one statement necklace and a few bangle bracelets, for instance."

Watch TV shows based in Manhattan(Sex and the City or Gossip Girl is good).,
Make your education important.,
Always be meticulous with your grooming and hygiene.,
When doing makeup, don't go overboard.,
Next part-the wardrobe!,
Try listening to some indie bands.,
Another important fashion advice is to have fun.,
Stay healthy and fit.,
As advice, up until your 30s you pretty much okay with eating what you want, BUT!,
Don't over accessorize.,
Read the New York Times to be in the know.

,
Learn about a few socialites and artists living in NYC.",How to Live the Manhattan Life Style(for Teen Girls)," Try to get a feel for their life and pick up on how they dress.;
, In Manhattan, good schools often require you take a test to get in, keeping out bad students. Also, if you ever plan to move there, having a good education can get you far when job seeking.

, It may sound like a given, but it really is important. A whole look can be ruined if you aren't careful. If you have zits, get acne-free(Target+local drugstores have it). It's the same as proactive, only cheaper. Any skin type should get a good facial mask and scrub, as well as the basics(cleanser, toner, moisturizer). Always try to see your hair stylist regularly. It can be hard to afford, but it can be well worth it.

, Do you want to look like a clown? If you have bold lips, keep the eyes subtle and vise versa. Also, don't feel pressured to buy expensive brands. Some are nice, but you'll probably do just fine with things from a drugstore.

, There are many styles out there, but if you want that Manhattan fashionista look then stick with this. Don't just blindly follow trends. They'll go out soon enough and then you'll have no money. Try to get at least on good pair of jeans. Lucky Brand Jeans, Seven, True Religion, and Chip and Pepper jeans are good. They really are good quality and will last you a long time. Old Navy can be good for basics and the occasional funky piece if you don't have to much cash. Some stick their nose up to it, but you can get some good things there. TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Filene's Basement are good for cheap designer clothes. You just might have to do a bit more searching. Target can be good and originated in NYC. If you have the money, splurge on the following:a pair of heels(Manolo Blahnik's are always nice), a purse, and a good quality(non ski-type) jacket. Don't fall victim to the teenie bop trends(Hollister, Abercrombie). Some of their stuff is nice, but why spend there when you could save your cash and get that Prada bag? A pair of those oversized sunglasses would be nice too. Burberry scarves are common in the city during the winter.

, If you go to the Myspace music section and look in the indie genre, you'll get a ton. Try to find some in both NYC and somewhere close to you.

, The most stylish people are not people who just follow what they see in magazines and keep it safe. Take Carrie Bradshaw as an example, she always wears something that you will never see anyone else wear. She stands out. She made you look, and even during the show, she would make you wonder: "" WOW! She's just amazing!"". I know that's corny, but she's possibly one of the most influential fashionistas out there. The point of being fashionable is to create a piece of walking art, not just another scribble walking down the street. Don't ever be afraid!

, Both are very important to maintain a good look. Drink 8 glasses of water a day, eat well, and exercise. If you can't afford a gym membership or equipment at home, walk or run around your area. Go online for some exercises and get some hand weights (they're really not expensive).

, also exercising. So don't feel like ""I can't have that Twix, it's going to make me fat.."" because frankly if you're active, the Twix is not going to do anything to your figure!!! Just a few ideas. I personally think that one should not have to exercise alone, because you need a little competition, you need someone else to push you and motivate you so you can exercise and prove to them how much you can handle. SO! I believe that it's better to maybe take a kickboxing class or Pilates... where you are able to see the people around you, and strive to do better than them.

, Just keep it simple and wear something that works with the outfit. Good quality jewellery is nice to invest in, especially diamonds and pearls. Stores such as Target may even have some affordable fakes that are still beautiful

,, Name drop when appropriate.

Decide what you want to be known for.,
Decide what you need to do in order to improve your reputation.,
Once you know what you need to do, do it.,
Do not talk to people about your new reputation habits, unless they ask you about it first.,
Act like you already have a reputation, and do things to back this up.

,
If you're at school with a rep and you're friend is being bullied, stand up for them.",How to Get Yourself a Reputation," Ensure that your goal is to be known for something positive (perhaps being artsy and unique). When in this planning process, do not choose a reputation that doesn't fit your personality. Don't try to come across as a prep if you can't stand being around them, or try to be a well-known athlete when you hate sports. Even though you may not have been known for a particular attribute before, it still must be something that's close to your heart- a reputation should have some truth to it.;
, It's easier to get a reputation if you are already good at what you are working at (like being known as the intelligent kid or the hard-working one).

, Stick to your original goals. Follow through with them, or your reputation will not be consistent. Do not suddenly come to school changed. Confusion would just be triggered and many could ask what's going on. It will only make things harder for you to manage.

, Simply let it be part of you. If others develop positive chatter about you- good! After all, that's what a reputation is; others believing you have certain characteristics.

,, This will give you a bigger reputation, and a good one too!

Changing your hair is a fast way to change your look instantly!,
Makeup is optional.,
Clear and even skin is recognized world over as beautiful and healthy.,
Clothes are important.,
Accessories can make or break your outfits!.,
MAKE SURE YOUR BRA AND UNDERWEAR FIT.,
Perfume is what people will associate with you.,
People are naturally drawn to quirky, confident people.,
Talking to people makes them notice you more.,
Hygiene is IMPORTANT.,
Language is a great form of communication.,
Finally keep your friends close.",How to Go from a Nobody to A List Instantly," You would want to go to an expensive salon if you struggle with getting nice hair cuts. Think about color; look up a seasons chart to find if you're a winter, fall, summer, or spring. Ask your colorist what she thinks would look good on you, look through magazines but do not copy the exact same style as popular girls at school. If you like your natural color, then just get a hair cut! Ask your hairstylist about your face shape and what she thinks will look good on you. Bangs work well for people who have a bit of a large forehead. Look up pictures online to find what you like.;
, You want to look nice and natural. Tinted moisturizer is a great tool that can make your skin look clear, soft, and even without clogging pores. Check sephora online if you have a budget of around $30. If not, try neutrogena, clinique, and bobbi brown. Concealer is an AMAZING tool. Buy one lighter than your complexion by about a shade or two, and use it under your eyes and blend. A good, pretty blush is essential. Blush gives you a healthy radiant glow. Mineral powder blushes are great for your skin, and are relatively cheap. NARS has famous blushes, but they are a tad expensive. Tints are great, and are also relatively cheap, and many double as a lip tint as well! Your eye color should be complemented by your eyeshadow. Check online to find an article on finding colors that work for eyes. Eyeliner is a tricky beast. It can open up your eyes wonderfully, but it takes practice to apply it like a master. Mascara is an essential tool everyone should own! There are so many to choose from, check sites like totalbeauty.com for reviews. Curl eyelashes, then apply mascara on the top lashes only, or you'll look like twiggy. Black mascara is good for brunettes and other dark colors. Blondes and redheads should use brown. Clear mascaras are great for natural looks and for clear brow gel. For lips, use plenty of lip balm and exfoliate with sugar on a toothbrush. Carmex balm isn't attractive in its yellow pot, but if you use it before you go to bed you'll have silky smooth lips in the morning. DO NOT GO OVERBOARD! Guys hate that and it looks silly. Keep your makeup minimal, in an ""oops-I'm-accidentally-gorgeous"" way.

, This means cleansing and moisturizing! Take off all your make-up and NEVER ever sleep in it. Proactive has always been great for people with acne, but if it's really severe then talk to a dermatologist. If you have minimal skin issues, check out Origins. They have wonderful cleansers like ""Checks and Balances"". Don't forget to drink plenty of water!

, Love it or hate it, society places a big importance on your clothes. Buy what you like, but make sure it complements your shape! Always try things on before you buy them. Clothes are only on hangers because it's an easy way of storing them. Everyone should have this basic wardrobe- dark wash jeans, light wash jeans, fitted t-shirts with a good neckline, long sleeved shirts, a nice coat, comfy sweatpants, camisoles and tank tops, a pair of boots, sneakers, flats, and heels. Remember, these are GUIDELINES!

, Have a few simple headbands and statement ones as well. Silver or gold bangles go with anything. Wooden bangles are cute also. Stores like forever21, pacsun, gap all have plenty of accessories.

, Get measured at a store that offers it, it will make a HUGE difference. It's good to have a basic black bra and white one too, then go crazy and get pretty colors and patterns. Make sure you have underwear in a few of these styles: boyshorts, bikini, seamless, and thong. NEVER EVER have a thong whale tail peeking out over your jeans! SUPER TRASHY. Aerie has bras from sizes 32AA to DDs, and great underwear sales. Victoria's Secret is also a great store.

, Put it at the back of your knees, inside of elbows, wrists, behind your ears, between your cleavage- but not all of those places at once! Choose 2-3 places depending on what you're wearing, but don't drench yourself in it!

, If you have freckles embrace them. If you have big boobs again embrace them. If you have curves, flaunt 'em! If you're flat all the way down with nary a curve insight, embrace it. People are attracted to someone who's confident in their own skin. Don't worry if it doesn't come natural, it's a gradual process.

, Be yourself and don't lie. The worst thing that could happen is if you talk to someone and they brush you off.

, No one wants to sit next to the girl with the sweaty pits and gunky teeth! In the morning apply deodorant that is clear and has a slight scent (dove and degree ultra clear are great!). You can never be too careful. Trim your nails (toe and finger) regularly and keep them clean. If you have some spending money, go to a salon and get a sports manicure. They trim and file your nails, buff them, moisturize, the whole shebang minus the polish. Brush your teeth, floss and mouth rinse. Carry a small compact mirror to check if there's anything in you teeth.Shave your legs and exfoliate and moisturize them regularly! Wash your hair every second day and shave your underarms every time you shower.

, Don't say 'like', 'umm', 'aaah' . keep your stories short. Don't swear often- it makes you seem like a trashy kind of person.

, Do not completely ignore them because if you treat them bad and you decide its all not that cool on the greener grass then you can go back to them. Sometimes its just better being a b-list babe but at the top is where the party is at.

Get good study skills.,
Get a reputation of integrity before anything else.,
Do more work.,
It is necessary to educate yourself on the current topic before everyone else.,
Offer to help others.,
Make study guides.,
If many kids crowd around you for help, offer to help out of school.,
Have fun!","How to Get the Reputation of a Smart, Cool Kid in School"," This is the primary aspect to being smart. No matter how hard you study, you cannot cover all the material learned. This is not an effective way of studying, as it can just wear you down all too soon. Good study skills will get you the ability to smarten yourself anywhere. Good study skills include, when working, not answering any phone/online messages, preferably not being signed onto Yahoo Messenger, AIM or Facebook at all. Start studying as soon as you hear about a test. If you don't get something, confirm it right away.;
, Most smart people who are truly admired have integrity and always finish their work, or most of it, on time. They get all A's. Use your study skills to get all A's and finish all your homework. Go the extra mile and write longer essays, and show more work on the math homework.

, Smart people are known for their ability to go further. Show one page of work in math when only 1/4th of a page is needed. Write longer essays in Spanish and English. In your history research project, if you are asked simply to make a PowerPoint presentation on the Industrialization of the United States in the 1800's, also add a section about how it helps today. As you do this more and more, you will get faster, even if it seems hard at first. It will get easier for you.

, Studying material that shall be covered in one year is not always needed, however, when you start a unit, spend some extra time at home reviewing it. Understand and practice that Spanish grammar. Ask your parents to help you with that math problem. Draw out all the diagrams, or take notes from the science unit. Read up on that history unit online.

, Don't overdo this, but if you see someone struggling or gazing away in thought, ask, ""Do you need help?"" If they decline, leave it at that. But eventually, you will be known to help. People will start coming to you all at once-make them wait, one at a time, otherwise helping may never be possible.

, After you have all the information for a test (or you yourself have learned it), type it out. In history and language arts, an outline may be the best. In math, try to make a bunch of questions with a separate answer key. In science, Cornell notes, or outlines with diagrams work best. In Foreign Languages, a table with vocabulary, along with the grammatical rules and culture on another sheet of paper would do. Type all study guides-you can e-mail them to others and print them. Handwriting them would be hard. You don't want the pain of handwriting to control your fame. People like typed study guides better for the most part.

, You can meet at someone's house or the library. But it must be free-don't charge them, even if they want to pay. They will end up liking you better, even if they don't admit it, if you help for free. It will also count as Community Service for college.

, Budget your time wisely-if you cannot study every day, set aside time on the weekends. Originally you may spend more time working but you will get the hang of it and relax. Go onto Facebook, text friends, talk on the phone, read, hang out, watch TV like you always would. In school, if you are not working, don't talk about academics all the time. Continue to talk about subjects any normal person would, like the recent movies and books, for example. You don't want to get rid of your old self and having fun in the long term. When you relax, forget all studies and academics!

Use your interests to your advantage.,
Step out of your comfort zone socially.,
Start off with small interactions with popular students.,
Use social media to solidify relationships.,
Find a unique identity through your personal talents.,
Accept a small role in the popular group early on.",How to Fit in With the Popular Crowd1," A good way to make friends is via mutual interests, so make use of your existing interests and passions. If you have a shared interest with a popular student, this can help you lay down the foundations of a friendship. Pay attention to the clubs and teams popular students are a part of. Is there a group that strikes your interest? Maybe you could get involved.Think about your own interests and passions. Maybe you've always loved playing softball with your younger brother. A number of popular girls at your school are on the softball team. Consider joining to bolster your popularity.
You can also look into clubs outside of school. Maybe the most popular girl in your class takes dance lessons. You're interested in dancing yourself, so think about getting involved in the local dance scene. This can help you make friends with people that may have an in with this popular girl.;
, It’s easy in life to get by doing the bare minimum, but if you want to fit in with the popular crowd, that won’t be enough. If you're shy by nature, it can be tough to put yourself out there and reach out to popular students. If you push yourself out of your comfort zone, you're more likely to end up in situations where you'll meet new people.This can be particularly helpful if you're shy by nature. You may be a fascinating person who has a lot in common with the popular crowd, but if you tend to be socially reserved, that won't matter. You need to reach out to others in order to make friends.
Push yourself to become more social. Set goals for yourself. For example, promise yourself you will make conversation with the person whose locker is next to yours on Monday. Agree to sit with a bigger group than usual at lunch.

, Small, one-on-one interactions are key to eventually becoming part of the group. Instead of attempting to impress all the popular students at once, look into fostering relationships with a few key members via small interactions over time.Think about who it would be easiest for you to befriend. Maybe you and Jacob don't have a lot in common, but you have a lot in common with Jacob's friend Trevor. You could try to foster a relationship with Trevor, and he can serve as your gateway to the popular group.
Start slow, as you don't want to overwhelm a potential new friend. Stick to small interactions. Maybe you and Trevor are both on the swim team. You could make a point of making small talk in the locker room, or during down time at practice.
Be patient. It can take awhile for friendship to grow, but consistent interactions over time can help build a relationship.

, Social media is a huge part of how our culture communicates. Having an active social media presence allows you to continue to develop friendships and relationships with the popular kids, even when you’re not hanging around them. Add the popular kids on various social media platforms and continue to build your friendships online.Engage with popular kids on social media. Comment on someone's Facebook status or like their Tweets. Focus on people you're beginning to form friendships with. For example, if you and Trevor are pretty friendly at swim practice, try talking to him online after school.
As you begin to hang out with the popular kids, take and post lots of pictures of you hanging out with the popular kids. Soon, they’ll forget that you were not initially part of their group.

, If you have a talent or a skill, share it. People look up to and are inspired by talented people, so if you have a talent, show it off. You can use your talents to find a role in the school. If you're known as, say, the class clown, the popular kids may feel like you would be a good addition to their group.If you’re a good singer or dancer, try out for the school musical. If you’re a strong leader, go out for student council.
Focus on how your talents can help you solidify your identity. If you've always had a knack for making others laugh, do stand up at talent shows. You can become the class clown, which may make you greatly appealing to the popular group.

, You do not want the popular kids to feel like you're forcing your way into the group. If you act overeager, this can be off-putting. Instead, accept a somewhat small role as you begin to hang out with the popular kids. Let your transition into the group happen naturally.At first, lay low a bit. Participate in conversation, but do not try to be the center of attention. Attend group get-togethers, but allow yourself to socialize with a few key people in the background. Do not try to engage in things like inside jokes until you've been in the group awhile.
Eventually, you'll become an established member of the group. At this point, you can begin to be more bold and interact more freely. However, such comfort and intimacy with others must build over time. Do not try to force it when you first join the group.

Avoid engaging in negative behaviors to boost popularity.,
Volunteer to help out your popular friends however you can.,
Be kind to everyone.,
Make people laugh.,
Use observational compliments.,
Practice your charisma.",How to Fit in With the Popular Crowd2," Many people feel behaving aggressively in social situations can bolster popularity. For example, you may think making fun of an unpopular student will endear you to the popular kids. However, this behavior is unlikely to win you any favor. Try to stay positive and be nice to others. Do not push people down to bring yourself up, as this is likely to backfire.In addition to not helping your quest for popularity, bullying has other consequences. Students who are bullied can develop serious problems as a result, and you do not want to hurt someone just to be popular.
You could also get into trouble with your school if you pick on other students. Bullying is just not worth it.

, Everyone likes a helpful person. If you're able to help out popular students here and there, this will endear you to them. You'll be seen as a helpful, agreeable person to have around.Offer to do things no one else wants to do. For example, say the popular group is planning a party. They need someone to stand by the door and let in guests, which is a job no one likes. Volunteer to do it. The popular kids will appreciate you taking this grueling task off their hands.
Use any talents you have to help out others. If you're great at chemistry, offer to help a popular boy who struggles with the subject with his homework.
However, do not let popular students take advantage of you. You want to look agreeable and genuinely kind and not like a pushover. Do not, for example, do someone's homework for them.

, There are some people in this world who have an innate ability to make other people want to be around them. They are able to do this because they are nice to everyone – not just people who are above them on the social ladder. Being genuinely kind can help you be more likable, leading most students in your school to look up to you.Say ""Hi!"" to everyone you see at school or work, even people you don’t know.
Don’t just talk about yourself. Listen and ask questions when you’re speaking with other people. Remember details people have shared with you and ask about them later. For example, ""Hey, you mentioned your cat was getting spayed this weekend? How is she doing?""
Try to make every person you talk to feel like the most important person in the room. Do not go on your phone during conversation. Make eye contact with the person you're talking to and pay attention to everything they say.

, Humor is a great way to bond with people as laughter puts everyone on the same page. Some people are born funny, but if you’re not one of them, make an effort to develop your sense of humor.The formula for being funny is truth+time=laughter. Try to say something honest, quickly. It can help to watch funny TV shows, movies, and stand up comedians. This can help you get a sense of comedic timing.
Only use your comedy for good – don’t be the person who puts other people down to get a laugh. Do not use humor as a form of bullying, as this is unlikely to win you friends.

, Even the most popular, confident people like hearing nice things about themselves – that’s how humans are wired. Instead of gifting people with empty compliments, like “I like your jeans” try making observational compliments.Take something you notice about a person and use that to formulate your compliment. For example, say something like, “I noticed you’re really good at baseball. You must train really hard.""
Do not be shy about telling people how you feel. If you really appreciate how hard a student worked on her presentation, say so. People are drawn to people who are positive and genuine.

, Contrary to popular belief, people can learn to become more charismatic. The more charismatic you are, the more people will want to spend time with you. Popular people are often very charismatic, so honing your charisma can help win you friends.To become more charismatic, stay in the present during conversation. You give off subtle cues when your mind wanders, so genuinely pay attention to what others are saying. You should look like you're listening, but avoid nodding too much while talking to someone. This can make you look overeager and nervous.
If you start to get bored or if you tend to tune out during conversations, focus on the physical sensation in your toes for two seconds. This can help bring you back to your body and help you stay more present.
Make eye contact. People are interested in people who are interested in them. Making eye contact throughout a conversation can make you appear attentive and genuinely invested in what the other person is saying.

Focus on personal hygiene.,
Dress to impress.,
Work out.",How to Fit in With the Popular Crowd3," If there’s one surefire way to get people to keep their distance from you, it’s engaging in poor personal hygiene. Don’t be the smelly person – always shower, brush your teeth, do your hair and put on deodorant before school or work.Eat fruits and veggies every day. They can improve the quality of your skin.
Keep any facial hair you might have neat and trimmed.
Take good care of your dental hygiene. People tend to be more drawn to people with dazzling smiles.

, The way you present yourself is hugely important – it affects the way people perceive you and it can have big implications for your social status. If you haven’t cared about your clothing choices before, now’s a good time to start trying.You don’t have to copy the popular kids’ outfits, but take a moment to observe what they wear. You want to choose clothing that is personal and unique to you, while still following some trends and being appropriate and flattering for your body.
Look in fashion magazines and online to keep abreast of trends and to look for outfit inspirations. Pick trends that work well for you. If you have bigger hips, leggings may look awkward on you. However, something like an infinity scarf can be cute and preppy.
If you don’t have the money to overhaul your wardrobe, try trading some of your clothes with a friend for a cheap and instant wardrobe update.

, Working out can increase your confidence, which in turn can increase your popularity. Working out can also improve your posture and make your body look more toned, which will make you look and feel more comfortable in your skin and in your clothes.Find an exercise regiment you like and stick to it. Play around with new forms of exercise, like yoga or pilates or lifting weights.
Join a sports team. Teams are a great way to not only stay in shape, but to make friends with other popular kids and expand your social circle.

Enhance memorable things about yourself.Embrace the aspects of yourself that make you unique and bring attention to them.,
Be outstanding at your job.,
Present yourself well.,
Look confident.,
Become self-assured.,
Fulfill your parents’ basic expectations.,
Reduce your parents’ workload.,
Be outstanding at something.,
Talk to your parents.,
Consider what kind of image you want to portray online.,
Craft your posts carefully.,
Be active on other people’s social media profiles.",How to Draw Attention to Yourself," Everything you do, from dressing yourself to posting online, presents an image to the world that sets you apart from others. Create your own personal image, using your favorite role model as a guide. What image do they portray, and how do they portray it? For example:


If your role model is Beyonce, consider getting fabulous highlights in your hair.
If you want to emulate Leonardo DiCaprio, grow out a goatee and wear stylishly casual clothing.
If you want to be like Miley Cyrus, get a bold pixie cut and wear fashionably androgynous clothing.;
, If you’re quiet all the time, no one will notice you. If you disagree with someone, speak up! People notice when others have strong opinions. However, avoid disagreeing with everyone all the time just for the sake of disagreement. You will be perceived as a fake and contrary individual. For example:


“Even though ‘The Avengers’ was a popular movie, I didn’t really like it. I prefer Wes Anderson movies.”
“You don’t like the new math teacher? I love her! She’s smart and tough.”
“Even though you guys like to make fun of Pokémon Go players, I’m going to keep playing that game. It’s so fun and interactive!”

, The more people you meet, the more attention you’ll get. Make an effort to have meaningful conversations when you’re introduced to someone. Invite them to activities with your friend group to make them feel included and build a connection.Some examples of showing friendliness include:


“Hey, Stacy! How have you been?”
“Hey, John! My friends and I are getting lunch, would you like to join us?”
“Last time we talked you mentioned an algebra test. How did that go?”
“Mark, meet my new friend Jessica. We met yesterday afternoon.”

, This will help you stand apart from the crowd and make you more memorable to others. This can often mean enhancing aspects of yourself that you may perceive as flaws.


For example, if you feel like your nose is larger than normal, don’t try to minimize the way it looks. Instead, get a nose ring and bring attention to it.
If you’re a part of a sports team, wear team memorabilia to school.
If you’re a tall girl, embrace it by wearing six inch heels wherever you go.

, Try to become the best employee in your department. Additionally, be flexible by working outside of your job description to make sure things get done.This will show your boss that working hard is your priority. Some other ways you can impress your boss include:


Coming to work early every day
Giving 100% on each task, no matter how small
Maintaining a positive attitude under stress

, Your clothing will introduce you better than words ever could. What do your clothes say about you? Similarly, your level of grooming will speak volumes about your personality. If you want to appear professional, you need to be very well groomed.


Your clothing should always be clean and ironed.
If you have facial hair, keep it trimmed and tidy.
Practice good personal hygiene.

, Use confident body language at work to draw the attention of others. For example, relax your stance slightly by resting your weight on one hip or crossing your arms. This will tell others that you are calm and in control. Some other examples of confident body language include:


Looking your coworkers in the eye when you’re talking to them
Smiling a lot to show that you’re feeling calm and self-assuredUsing good posture

, People are naturally drawn to genuinely self-assured individuals. If you feel good about yourself, people will notice. Kill any negative thoughts you have about your self-image, body, or personality. Instead, nurture positive, constructive thoughts.For example:


Instead of thinking about why you’re unattractive, focus on all of your attractive features.
If you’re worried that you’re boring, remind yourself of all of the interesting aspects of your personality.

, This can include chores, schoolwork, getting a summer job, or helping out with your siblings. If your parents are upset with you, it will be hard to receive any positive attention from them. However, don’t expect them to give you extra attention just for meeting their basic expectations as most parents take good behavior for granted.For example, if your parents expect you to make decent grades in school, make an effort to do so.
If your parents expect you to do certain chores around the house, make sure you complete them regularly.

, If your parents aren’t giving you attention, they’re probably very busy. Show them that you appreciate their hard work by helping them around the house or with your siblings. If you help them out, they’ll have more free time to spend with you. For example:


Do the dishes after dinner.
Fold a load of laundry.
Offer to put your younger siblings to bed.
Tidy the house.

, Find something praiseworthy and work hard to excel at it. If you give your parents a reason to brag about you, they’ll give you more attention. If you want your parents to publically show their support, choose an activity that has events that your parents can attend. Examples of praiseworthy achievements include:


Making really good grades
Joining and excelling in a sport
Being a leader in your local youth program
Becoming active in a charity organization

, If you’re still not getting enough attention from your parents, try talking to them about your feelings. Your parents probably don’t know that you feel like you’re they’re ignoring you.Speak politely and present reasonable solutions for your parents. For example:


“I feel like we don’t hang out enough. Can we go to dinner, just the three of us?”
“I’m sad that no one comes to my soccer games anymore. I would really appreciate it if you could attend a few of them.”
“I want to spend more time with you. We should join the local disc golf team!”

, To get noticed, you’ll need to stand out from the masses. Therefore, you need to use your social media profiles to send a unique message about who you are. Ask yourself questions such as:


What kinds of posts align with the image I’m trying to portray?What kinds of things would my role models post?
What social media accounts do I need to have to portray myself well?

, Before tweeting, posting on Facebook, or putting a picture on Instagram, ask yourself if your message helps reinforce your personal image. For example, if you portray yourself as an easy-going indie music expert, you should avoid posting long anti-establishment rants on your social media accounts.


If you need inspiration, look at the social media profiles of your favorite celebrities or role models.

, Draw attention to yourself online by popping up on your friend’s newsfeeds. This will help you stay relevant in their lives and keep people talking. However, don’t spam someone’s page just because you want attention. Only post when you have something interesting to say or to remind them of a recent shared experience.


If someone else mentions you on their social media page, respond quickly and positively."

, If you're always slouching, people will start to think that you're not in a good mood, sad, or mad. Look approachable and sit up straight. You might think that people don't notice these little things, but they do.

, Girls think acting dumb is cute, but it's really not. Guys dig smart girls. Don't go around showing off your knowledge, but don't be ditzy.

, Being a pessimist is not being a realist––it's overstating the negative, all of the time and it drags everyone down. Even if something goes wrong, just say, ""It could have been worse"" and start working on solving it instead of milking it for the bad. If someone is having a bad day, be positive around them, and point out the good things. Don't brag about your perfect day, or sulk about your horrible day.


You can vent to a friend in private or in public. Just don't be openly negative.

, Don't make fun of others, or vandalize property. Be respectful of people's feelings, and property. If you went a little too far, and you know it, just apologize. If you really care, and respect your own self-image, then you'll apologize.

, This can be tough for some people. Lying might always seem like the way out, but it eventually will come back to you. It's better to just tell the truth from the start.

, People like to know that you are genuinely interested in what they're saying. When listing to someone, make eye contact, and really pay attention to them. Don't be checking your phone, or talking to some one else.

, Tell jokes! But make sure your jokes are actually jokes, and not to hurt some ones feelings. If people know they can laugh with you, they'll like you more. If you trip in gym, laugh along with your classmates. A girl who can laugh at herself can be respected. If you feel a little hurt, it's okay. That's natural, but know when your peers are going too far. Never accept insults as if they're true.

, Don't hide things from others. It's okay to keep your private thoughts from other people, but if it's worth sharing, share it.

, Ask questions, but don't be nosy. Don't always talk about your self, and try not to one-up people.

, This means being a shoulder to cry on, a friend to laugh with, and a person to vent to. Be aware of other people's feelings, and help others. They will appreciate it, and recognize that you're a good friend.

, For example, help a friend out every once in a while, or greet them in a nice way. You can compliment people, but don't do it just to get them to like you, do it genuinely.

, You don't have to be friends with everyone, just be friendly. For example, if the most annoying kid in school sits next to you on the bus, smile, and greet them politely. That doesn't mean you have to be their best friend, just try not to be mean. If people know you won't be mean, they'll like you more.


Be nice to everyone. If you're going to be popular, then that means that you're going to be nice to everyone, even those that you don't much like. If someone's giving you a hard time, Just say ""Hi. How was your day?"" It works every time. Just a little compliment will lighten up someone's day.

, If you keep promises and secrets, then people will know you are trust worthy. If you break your friends' trust, it will take a long time to build it up again. Being trustworthy isn't just about the truth. It's also about how you react. Don't be too judgmental about your friends' choices, and don't nitpick at things.

, If your friend is overreacting to something, it might be because she's just had a bad day, or something is going on. In that case, ask your friend if she is okay.

Take care of your skin.,
Wear light make up.,
Shower and smell good.,
Take care of your nails.,
Look after your hair.,
Eat healthy and exercise.,
Take care of your teeth.,
Get enough beauty sleep.",How to Be a Girly Girl1," Wash your face twice a day with a mild cleanser, moisturize your skin after washing, and always remove your make up before bed. Try to wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy, overcast, or rainy, as the UV rays can still damage your skin. Taking care of your skin will help you to keep blackheads and pimples at bay and keep your face looking fresh and healthy!


Remember that many teens suffer from acne at some point and even girly girls are no exception! Don't panic though, there are loads of creams, gels, and lotions available at your local pharmacy that will help keep skin under control.
If you often have severe or painful breakouts, consider seeing a dermatologist. They can recommend treatments, like stronger face creams or even antibiotics, that can help get rid of acne once and for all.;
, A little make up can help to accentuate your best features and highlight your femininity. Lip gloss and mascara are perfect for everyday wear. For parties and weekend activities you can also apply a little blush or highlighter on your cheeks and some pretty eye shadow in a girly color like pink or purple. Foundation makes your skin look flawless, but make sure you get the perfect color to match your skin tone, otherwise it can look silly and fake. Concealer is good to cover up blemishes. Eyeliner makes your eyes pop, but you should be careful not to go overboard with it.


Use a makeup sponge or brush to apply your foundation. This will ensure an even application. If your skin is a little oily, put some pressed powder (in a matching shade) on over the foundation. This will help the make up to stay in place.
Whatever you do, don't apply make up too heavily, especially for school. This can make it seem like you're trying too hard and can look cheap. Make up should be used to accentuate your natural beauty, not hide it!

, Girly girls should always smell fresh and clean, which is why a daily shower is a must. When washing your hair, use a shampoo that helps your hair become frizz-free and shiny. Follow up with a moisturizing conditioner which helps to remove tangles and leaves hair feeling soft and silky. Wash your body with a pleasantly scented bath gel and sponge. Floral and fruity scents work particularly well. Citrus, cherry, and others are good.


After the shower, apply a lotion (with a scent that matches your shower gel, if possible) to your legs, knees, elbows, arms, and hands. If you do this, you will have moist, soft skin all the time.
When spraying perfume, use just enough. Too much perfume can be overpowering and can put people off. Apply just a dab of perfume to a few key pulse points (behind your ears and on your wrists).

, Having pretty, polished nails is another girly girl essential. Treat yourself to a pedicure/manicure once in a while, and make sure to keep from biting your nails, picking at them, etc. People notice your hands more than you think, and jagged nails don't look nice. Try to go to a nail salon to get your nails done. If you can't, just do it by yourself or with a family member. Older sisters and mothers are often good at nail-polishing, so enlist their help if you can! Make sure you don't put on nail polish too much or it can damage your nails.


If this is your first time being a girly-girl-in-training, try not to use dark colors like black or dark purple. Use girly colors like pink, baby blue, or lavender (light purple), etc.
Make sure your hands are soft too; invest in a good hand cream like Vaseline Intensive Care Healthy Hand & Nail Revitalizing Hand Lotion. It makes your nails stronger and hands softer.
Nail polish can be extremely feminine and chic at the same time, and it comes in tons of different colors. Try to use a nail polish that matches your outfit.

, Girly girls are known for their great hair, so make sure to wash your hair every other day (depending on your hair type) and always take the time to style before going anywhere. Try different hairstyles every day, like half-up half-down, high-ponytail, side-braid, low pigtails, curls, side ponytails, messy buns with a headband, and tiara braids. Short haircuts can be cute on the right face type. Be creative!


Be careful, too much brushing causes flat and dull hair. A few strokes to get out your tangles and to style it will make your hair beautiful. You'll look like your hair is flowing when you walk.
If you have flat hair use a volumizing spray to give it some lift. Spray it close to the roots and work your hands through your hair. If you have curly hair, try scrunching it with some mousse to really define the curls.
Straightening your hair every day will damage it and cause it to become dry, so you will need to use a heat protection spray. Apply the protection spray before straightening or curling your hair, while your hair is still wet. Give your hair a break from the styling tools and allow your hair to air dry every once in a while!
A quick spritz of hairspray will keep your style in place, helping your hair look fabulous all day long!

, A girly girl should have confidence in her appearance and feel good about her body. Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy diet will help you to look and feel good on the inside and out!


Try to eat lots of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, along with healthy portions of protein and dairy. You should be eating three balanced meals a day, with some healthy snacks in between.
When it comes to exercise, try to find something you enjoy—like running, swimming, or dancing. And whatever you do, don't let being a girly girl stop you from joining the soccer team!
Eating healthily does not mean starving yourself. Remember, you don't have to be thin to be beautiful. Just try to keep everything in moderation and don't eat too much junk food.
If you're very unhappy about your weight, think about going to see a doctor or nutritionist. They can advise you on the best healthy eating and exercise plan for your age and body type.

, Girly girls tend to be smiling all the time, so it's important that you keep those pearly whites in tip top shape! Remember to brush twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening). Every brushing session should last at least two minutes, so hum your favorite song to yourself as you brush. You should also floss between your teeth every day and rinse out your mouth with a minty mouthwash for extra fresh breath.


Don't worry if your teeth are not perfectly straight—there are several ways to get the perfect dazzling smile. If your teeth are crooked, don't shy away from braces. Just think of them as jewelry for your teeth!
For whitening, you can either do it yourself at home with a store-bought product or go to a dentist. Look for someone who has expertise in the area of cosmetic dentistry to get them professionally whitened.
Ask your dentist if you'll need braces; this way, you may look nice with straight teeth.

, Never underestimate the powers of sleep! Sleep allows your mind and body to recover from the day gone by and to prepare for the day ahead. A good night's sleep will leave you looking healthy and refreshed and put you in a good mood for the day. On the other hand, if you don't get enough sleep you will look and feel tired, be irritable and slow and possibly have purple bags under your eyes! This is why it's essential that you get eight hours sleep a night.


Try to relax for at least an hour before bed to help your body to prepare for sleep. Run a relaxing bubble bath, put on some soothing music, light a couple of candles, and allow yourself to soak in the tub for a while. You'll drift dreamily off to sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow!
Avoid overstimulating yourself by watching TV, playing computer games, or messing around on your laptop right before bed. Try reading a book or magazine instead.

If you don't already, embrace the feminine fashion a bit more.,

Don't be known as 'one of the guys' at school.",How to Be a More Feminine Preteen," If you wear shorts, skirts, or dresses, then you might be beginning to feel a little insecure about those hairy legs poking out for all to see. Never fear, there is a solution to your dilemma! Pull out that razor and bottle of shaving cream/gel, and whisk away all that pesky hair!
, Perfume is a great way to embrace your more feminine side. It doesn't have to be expensive. If you aren't comfortable with perfume, body spray is a great alternative. They sell awesome scents at Bath and Body Works. Don't drown yourself in your scent, however; you don't want to stink up your classroom at school with your smell. For perfume, apply a spritz to the very end of your neck and each wrist, or spray the scent into the air twice, one spray where your upper is and one where your waist and legs are and walk through it. For body spray, since it is not as strong, you will probably be okay with a spray in your hair, on your neck, on your shirt, on each leg of your pants, and one spray down toward your feet., You can get them professionally waxed at your local hair salon, or you can pick up home waxing kits and a pair of tweezers and do your own., Wash it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.

Wash in warm water, as it opens up the pores so you can clean them out, then right before turning the water off, use cool water to close your pores to make it harder for germs to enter your layers of skin., Use a quality shampoo and conditioner to clean and condition it. Again, no one can tell you how often to wash your hair, so just do it as often as you would like. Work up a good lather with your shampoo. When shampooing, focus on your scalp, but make sure to clean your strands, as well. When conditioning, focus more on your strands, as your scalp produces its own oil, and rub any excess conditioner into your roots. Style it in a way you usually wouldn't; straighten it or make ringlets, pull it into a ponytail or low pigtails, it doesn't matter. Healthy, clean hair is beautiful hair., Buy pink, sparkly, sequined, skirts, dresses, whatever; make sure it is something that a guy would never wear. As for shoes, one day try ditching the black sneakers and go for a pair of heels or ballet flats., Talk with the girls, flirt a little bit (if you want to, and all in clean fun,) text smiley faces and hearts, just embrace your girly side for a change.

Read magazines.",How to Be a Girly Girl2," Girly girls should be ladylike and graceful at all times, so try to avoid being clumsy and awkward.


True girly girls should appear like they're floating on clouds, with graceful and fluid actions. Work on your posture; put your shoulders back, keep your back straight, and put your chin up. Think of yourself as a ballerina, graceful and light on her feet.
Don't act like you have too much swagger or swing your hips too much. This can look as if you're trying too hard. Don't swing your arms either, try to keep them by your side (but don't be stiff).
Don't slouch when you're sitting in a chair—press up against the back of the chair and plant your feet firmly on the floor. Avoid folding your arms. It gives off a ""get lost"" vibe, which is the last thing you want!
Being graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe. It's about being aware of your body, being in control, and expressing confidence through your actions.

, Girly girls are usually bright and bubbly. They have plenty of friends, hobbies and interests, and always have a laugh or a smile or something interesting to say. Don't take yourself too seriously; you should be able to laugh at yourself and have fun. Don't be shy to have friends, always remember to be nice and friendly.

, Being selfish and having a nasty attitude toward others is not very ladylike behavior.


Girly girls should be pleasant, sweet, modest, and constantly in a good mood. Just like a Disney princess!
Always try to have a smile on your face, and be helpful and willing to do someone else a favor. You want to set a good example for your peers and be a leader, someone other girls look up to.
Remember to be nice to everyone, not just your friends or the people that are in your group. Everyone deserves a chance. Don't exclude people from games, gifts, etc. Keep your promises and don't gossip.

, Being a girly girl is also associated with romance. Be sure to read romance novels and develop a keen interest in poetry.


Fill your smartphone with romantic music and love songs. Get your friends together for the ultimate girly sleepover and watch some of the most romantic films ever made, like Titanic or The Notebook.
Send anonymous valentines on Valentine's Day and hopefully receive one or two in return!

, Be totally aware of what's hot, what's new etc. Being a girly girl doesn't mean you only listen to bubblegum pop! A girly girl can love indie, musical, and R&B as well, although pop can be something that you hate. If you hate pop though try to stay in the loop of what the new songs are, you don't have to love them just know what they are.

, Girly girls love the mall, shopping, and almost anything associated with beauty, but these activities are so much more fun when you do them with other people.


Get a group of friends and have a shopping spree, do makeovers, host a sleepover, hold a bake sale, or any girly activity.
Your friends are the most important people in your life (a good friend will stand by you no matter what) so make sure that you put effort into your relationships and appreciate them everyday.

, Swearing or talking crassly is often considered unattractive in a girl, and is definitely not ladylike.


It may be hard to stop, but swearing is one of the worst things you could do if you're trying to be girly. Start by replacing your usual curse words with something cuter, like ""sugar!"" or ""shoot!"" and you'll soon train yourself out of swearing.
Try to convince your friends to stop swearing too. Prove to each other that you can control the things that come out of your mouth. Make it more interesting by introducing a penalty—first one to swear buys everyone a Starbucks!

, Speaking well is something of an art and can make you sound much more intelligent and refined.


Try to enunciate and pronounce your words properly, speaking in a clear voice so that people can easily understand. Try to avoid sprinkling your sentences with too many ""ums"" and ""likes"" and ""buts"" and ""and"", as this can be distracting.
Try to speak at a medium level. Don't talk too loudly or too quietly. You want your voice to be heard but you don't want to force your opinion on everyone within a five mile radius either; also you don't want people to stand very close to you so they know what you are saying.
You can improve your vocabulary by reading a lot. Newspapers and textbooks are fine, but you will get much more enjoyment out of reading some classic romance novels written by female authors like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte.

, Shoving food into your mouth is definitely not ladylike or even good manners; learn good manners.


Instead, chew your food thoroughly and try not to make any noises as you swallow. Don't take huge bites either—just small to normal-sized ones.
To look as normal as possible when eating, take a bite of your food and count to 20 in your head as you chew. Only swallow once you get to 20, then take the next bite.
Also try to avoid eating anything that could get messy and sticky, especially on a date (it's disgusting).

, Keeping a secret diary is the ultimate girly girl activity. In it you can keep track of everyday things like what happened in school and your plans for the weekend, along with more intimate details like your secret crush and your hopes and dreams for the future.


Writing about things that are getting you down will also help to relieve any stress and anger and allow you to face the next day with a wide smile.
Just make sure your secret diary is kept somewhere safe and hidden. The last thing you want is your annoying sibling or nosy friend to take a peek when you're not looking.
If possible, find a diary with a lock to which only you will have the key.

, If you are organized, you'll always be able to find the things you're looking for, remember important dates (like friend's birthdays), and be on time.


Make sure you always have everything you need for school (notebooks, pens, pencils, binders, etc.) and keep track of your weekly schedule in a daily planner.
Always have plenty of cute pens and pencils readily at hand. That way you can easily lend them to others when they need them.
Make sure your belongings are neat. You should label and cover all of your binders, folders, and textbooks. Try covering them with clear contact paper; it looks a lot neater. If you like patterned contact paper, try the metallic looking varieties that come in red, silver, blue, and gold.
When buying a school bag, go for light and neutral colors and good quality brands. Don't buy anything in dark colors like navy blue or black—these colors are not suitable for girly girls!

, It's important to be diligent and hard-working at school. Try hard in every subject and class you take, and always hand in homework on time.


Don't talk during class, you have lots of time for that later. Don't pass notes either; it’s embarrassing if you're caught and distracting to others. Ask questions and participate in class discussions.
Try to get involved with the school and its activities too. Join the cheerleading squad (a great girly girl activity!) or find something else you're passionate about, like debating or student council. Sports are also a great way to stay fit and healthy, while also having fun.
Remember that although working hard at school will keep parents and teachers happy, it's you who'll benefit most in the long run. Getting good grades and having lots of extracurricular activities will help you to get into a good college, which is important for your future career.
Study and do all your homework. Girly girls are really sweet and bubbly. They also don't avoid the things they need to do, like homework. If you get good grades, people will start to realize that you're not a bubble gum airhead, you are smart and sweet! Get into study and homework as soon as you get home to avoid procrastinating.

, If someone is bullying you in any way, physically or verbally, understand that you don't have to put up with it.


You may be a girl—but that doesn't mean you're not strong! No one has the right to walk all over you. If you can, try to handle the situation yourself, calmly telling the person to back off and leave you alone.
If you really feel like you need to stand up for yourself, try to have a few comebacks prepared for when the bully says something rude. Don't make it personal though; you shouldn't need to stoop to their level.
If things get very serious and you feel like you need some back up, don't be afraid to tell a parent or trusted teacher. No one needs to face bullying alone.

, Magazines are a great way to help you get caught up on everything going on in Hollywood and in the fashion world.


The most popular magazines are gossip and fashion, but you can read anything you like.
Lots of fashion magazines give you lifestyle tips that come in handy all the time.
The gossip magazines keep you updated on what's going on with any celebrities you like.

Have a sense of style.,
Wear feminine clothes.,
Wear clothing that fits.,
Don't feel like you have to buy brand name clothing.",How to Be a Girly Girl3," Being fashionable is important. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean ""trendy"". Try to read more fashion magazines to learn what kinds of clothes go well together. Try teen magazines like Teen Vogue and Seventeen for starters, and if you want to, move on to adult fashion magazines like Elle and In Style.


Try mixing and matching the clothes in your closet. The results may not always be great, but you're bound to discover new and cute combinations. Once you have built up a wardrobe filled with girly girl staples, it will be easy to experiment with different looks.
Remember that it's often better to have a clear idea of your own personal style than to always be chasing the latest fad look. You could waste so much money on clothes just for them to go out of style a few weeks later.

, Pink is a typical girl color, but don't shy away from blacks and blues, as they can also look very cute! A typical girly girl wardrobe should be full of skirts! It should also have a selection of colored tank tops, some pretty dresses, and cute pastel-colored bras and underwear.


You should also have at least three comfortable pairs of shoes: one pair of workout sneakers and a couple of pairs of cute shoes such as heels, moccasins, flats, sandals—take your pick! Also have a pair of hiking boots ready. Yes, girly girls can hike! Don't go hiking in heels. Ultimately, a girly girl can never have too many shoes.
Don't feel like you have to follow a girly girl dress code, as if you were wearing a uniform. Feel free to experiment with your style and express your personality through your clothes. Don't wear anything that you don't feel comfortable with—it's very important to be yourself.

, The most important thing about buying clothes is making sure that they fit. Clothes that don't fit properly will make you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious, and girly girls need to feel fabulous and confident! Don't worry about trying to fit into a particular size or feeling like you have to go for a particular size - go for what feels right and looks good on you.


Resist the temptation to wear skirts that are too short - your aim should to look (and feel) demure and pretty.
The same goes with shirts. Not tight, not baggy. If your shirt is so tight you can see your bra or you have trouble getting your shirt off of your back, then it's too tight.
To see if the shirt is too small, raise your arms up. If your stomach shows when you do this, then the shirt is excessively short!

, Brands are just status symbols designed to make people feel superior. Don't get caught up in that behavior, because you really don't have to spend a lot of money to be girly and look good. Just make sure you choose clothing very carefully.


On the other hand, if you like something that is affordable and it's a brand name, don't feel like you shouldn't buy it either!

If you want to have shiny hair, wash it with cold water after shampooing. This will make your hair look polished and clean.
Add some finishing touches or hair accessories. Wear barrettes, bows, flower crowns, or headbands. These can help you to look cute and stylish.
If you have short hair, you can do lots of different hairstyles and haircuts that fit you. Make sure haircuts are flattering to your face, and if you wish, use some small hair accessories.

, Makeup is the epitome of being girly. Try watching some YouTube videos to some new learn techniques for applying makeup.


Always wear lip balm to prevent your lips from chapping, and then add some lip gloss to add that glossy and shiny look to your lips. If you want to have some colour on your lips and you love shiny lips, try some tinted/coloured lip gloss. Don't overdo it though.
You can also wear a bit of eyeshadow. Some natural colors for school are light brown, gold, dark gold and brown.

, Make sure you're comfortable in them, but make sure they're also cute as well.


Boots are great. This doesn't mean rain boots, just boots such as ankle-high boots and knee-high boots. Boots look great with a nice skirt.
Wear ballet flats to look elegant in school. If you want to look elegant while making a bold fashion statement at the same time, try wearing a pair of slippers. Again, they match well with a skirt.
Avoid high heels. They hurt your feet and cause knee problems. Kitten heels or shoes with a slight heel are fine though.
You can be creative by making your own pair of shoes.

, It doesn't have to be extravagant - simple outfits can do wonders!


Wear skirts rather than jeans. You will look - and feel - much more girly, especially if all your friends are in jeans. You can match this with a cute jacket or sweater on top.
Casual dresses with a bold belt (studded belt, neon belt etc.) can look really awesome if you put the look together properly.
There are certain stores that cater to the ""girly girl"" image. Try checking out those stores and seeing what you can find. Be careful, though - they can be expensive!

, Depending on how strict your school is, you may be able to get away with some alterations to the uniform. However, make sure you don't do anything that would get you in trouble for messing with the uniform!


Wear a cute, girly scarf or put a jacket or a sweater on top.
Don't make your uniforms look dull and baggy, make it look as lively as possible.
If your school won't let you alter your uniform, just act more girly in general. By doing this, people will see the more girly you! Be polite and kind to others, always listen and get rid of any nasty vocabulary you might have been using.

Don't overdo it. People won't like you if you start acting like a snob.



, This doesn't have to be limited to what you wear - try decorating your bag or school supplies, too!


Wear jewelry. Colorful earrings are a must, as well as cute bracelets or necklaces. However, don't go overboard; you don't want to jingle when you walk!
If your bag looks boring, decorate it. Put cute badges and key-chains on it or sew different fabric swatches on your bag to add a creative and artsy yet girly flair.
If you have school supplies that belong to you, such as a binder or a notebook, don't be afraid to decorate it! Glue photos to it, put stickers on it, or do whatever you want. However, if you have something that belongs to the school, such as a textbook, don't decorate that. You don't want to get fined for vandalism.

, French manicures are good because they are sophisticated and simple. You can also go bold with your nails by adding some colorful nail art to your nails or by using a bright or sparkly nail colour.


If you go to a strict school, you may not be allowed to wear nail polish or nail decorations. However, a clear polish won't be noticed and will make your nails look shinier.

, Don't shake your hips too much; many people find that strange or annoying. Don't skip or run around the school. After all, girly girls are also cute, and how is getting in trouble cute, sweet, and innocent?

, Don't act like you're suddenly famous and rich. Be kind. Meet new friends, and just have fun!

Have important furniture like for example, a vanity.,
Clean your room.",How to Be a Girly Girl4," Every girly girl should have a vanity in their room, because you need a special place to get ready for school and fancy places. A desk is also very important to have because you need a place to put your very cute supplies.

, Keep a pile of things you like. The things you don't like, throw them out. Then, put the things you like in a place where you can easily access them. Also, have drawers, storage space, and more. Make your bed neat, but don't stack them to the ceiling with cute stuffed animals and pillows. Keep it simple.


Make a room chart. When making a room chart, you will be able to be more organized because you will plan where everything will need to be. Start by throwing old, dull clothes out, rag dolls, things that make you feel to childish or boyish. You need to remember that you are growing up into a more mature stage in life. Doesn't mean that you have to be a grown up type of girly, you can still have cute fuzzy pink things and stuffed animals and stickers all over!
Organize your makeup equipment. When you organize your makeup, make sure everything has its own place to be. Plus, don't just let people start touching your stuff like they own you and your room. Take control! There should be a lip, eye, cheek, nail, hair, and jewelry section. Accessories need their own section.

, For swimming, dress cutely. Wear pink swimsuits and for beaches have on a wraparound skirt, as well as flip-flops that could match your swimsuit. Have bows in your hair and cute sunglasses/goggles.

, For everyday looks, wear a little no-clump mascara, some natural-looking bronzer, maybe foundation and pink or clear lip-gloss and balm. Have nicely groomed brows too. A girly thing to do is collect lip-gloss and have loads of weird, wacky, girly, pretty, sparkly and seasonal glosses. Stupid.com sell a lot of weird ones (Nacho flavoured, wasabi flavoured and more) and Bath & Body Works Liplicious have some Halloween ones, pretty and cute ones and just gorgeous ones. It's very scented and has a little flavour. For parties and things like that, have sparkly pink or lilac eye shadow or maybe silver glitter, and body glitter, and lip-gloss until your face is positively luminous.

, Being cute isn't all about the outside, though. Having sweet manners and looking out for others shows a sweet temperament and makes others attracted to you.

, Being a pessimist and trying to be Kawaii isn't so cute.

, It's not cute to be obsessed with yourself. Others will think you're arrogant, and being arrogant isn't cute.

Wear the correct clothes for your body shape and size - ones that are pretty and modest.,
Wear a little makeup.,
Accessorize.,
Love every inch of your body.,
Set aside time for grooming.,
Wear perfume or scented lotion.",How to Be Feminine1," Start wearing skirts instead of pants or jeans — nothing works better at defining you as a girl who cherishes her femininity. A skirt looks cute paired with a blouse, belt and flats. Don't wear skirts too short. The right length is just above the knee so you look demure and nice. Don't fall for the 'girly' trap of wearing pink or baby blue, if you look great in black or navy blue or perhaps maroon. Nothing really beats a classic pencil skirt, while a pleated skirt can be both cute and comfortable. If you've been wearing jeans for years, wearing a skirt will be a revelation; it will make you feel classy and feminine, especially when you're out with friends who are all wearing jeans or if you're the only girl at work wearing a skirt.


Dresses (fit & flare dresses with a belt) are sweet too.
Always wear hosiery rather than bare legs. Go for the classic sheer look and avoid patterns. Tan or nearly black are also great colours to choose. Your skirt will help you enjoy the feeling of having your legs on display, so never wear opaque.
Wear flat shoes if you don't like heels. The key is to choose something simple and classy
Avoid the ""just rolled out of bed"" look. Don't wear anything that hides your shape. Whatever you wear, people should be able to tell you've put some time and effort into putting your look together.;
, This step is not necessary, but it will help make you look a little more feminine. Red and pink lipstick and neutral eyeshadows will help to create a feminine look. But remember, you do not need makeup. Wear it only if you want to. If you're not comfortable with makeup, then so be it.


If you're really opposed to makeup, make sure your lips are moist by wearing lip balm whenever you can.

, In addition to your clothes and makeup, you should spend some time finding the perfect accessories to go with your wardrobe. You don't need a box full of accessories -- just a few key items can help tie your look together and can make you look more feminine. Here are some items to consider as you work on your more feminine look:


A pretty silk scarf
Pearl earrings or other studs
A cute headband
A ribbon hair barrette
Some thin silver bracelets
Rings that are cute, but not too chunky or flashy

, Your body is what makes you female, so how can you be feminine if you don't embrace your female form? A woman's body naturally has a higher body fat percentage than that of a man, so don't dismiss your curves. On the other hand, part of loving your body is taking care of it, so maintain a healthy diet, get enough sleep and exercise to stay in shape. Fortunately, you don't have to look like a model to look feminine.


Loving every inch of your body doesn't mean flaunting your body or showing it off every chance you get. It just means loving how you look and being comfortable in your own skin.
Don't think that you can't work out because it's not lady-like. Taking a yoga class, a dance class or running or swimming will get you more in touch with your feminine side and will make you love your body even more.

, Though you don't have to take a two-hour shower every day or spend an hour doing your hair, you should make sure that you always look, feel and smell clean and that you've devoted enough time to keeping up a ladylike appearance. Showing up somewhere after working out without showering is not very feminine; make sure that you exude cleanliness and poise and look relatively put together wherever you go.


Never look like you rushed to get your look together in time or put on makeup or comb your hair in front of your friends because you didn't have time to do it before.

, If you want to look like a lady, then you have to smell like a lady. Consider putting a dab of perfume on your neck or rubbing some scented lotion on your neck or arms. Remember to only use a light touch , You don't want to overwhelm anyone with perfume that is overpowering

Be graceful.,
Learn to dance.,
Be playful.,
Be confident - another important step to projecting femininity.,
Walk in a more feminine way.,
Be a good caretaker.,
Have admirable manners.",How to Be Feminine2," In most societies, women are thought to be more naturally graceful than men. There are always exceptions, of course, and it is totally up to you whether you choose gracefulness to express of your femininity. Generally, however, many women appear more feminine when they make smooth movements, rather than jerky, powerful ones. And, of course, consider the context. You might want to be fierce on the volleyball court or shooting range and svelte at a bar or in the bedroom. There's no rule saying you have to be graceful (or feminine) all the time.


To be graceful, wear cute shoes that are comfortable for you to walk in so you don't trip or walk in a way that looks unnatural. If you want to master walking in heels, but don't quite know how, practice at home or in front of a mirror before you take your new look out into the world.

, Dancing is an extension of your body and through dance you can find ways to emphasize your femininity. Belly dancing, for example, accentuates the natural curves of a woman's form. A partner dance, like salsa or the waltz, can also help you feel more feminine because such dances are built upon the traditional differences between men and women — the man guides, while the woman follows and makes more fluid, extravagant movements.

, Let's ditch the whole idea that being feminine means being perfect and ethereal. For those times when grace is lacking and you fall flat on your face in the middle of a room, the true test of your femininity is your ability to laugh it off! Think about it: taking life too seriously isn't very feminine in most people's estimation, nor is it very healthy overall. So, smile a lot, flirt, tease and play. Have fun! Ultimately, being feminine is about feeling at ease with yourself and you can't feel at ease if you're too stiff, somber and serious, so be the opposite: lighthearted and playful.


Flirting is a part of being a woman. Don't think that you're not allowed to flirt just because you're trying to be feminine.

, Having confidence will not only make you look and feel more feminine, it will help you to be more independent and outstanding. Never give up on yourself, ever.


Part of being confident means mastering the body language of a confident person. Walk with your head high, smile and look straight ahead of you, not down at the floor.
Being confident doesn't mean being arrogant. You don't have to brag about your accomplishments to make people see how confident you are.

, If you want to have a more feminine walk, then you should work on walking more with your hips than your shoulders, taking lighter steps instead of stomping, and taking your time to move from place to place. To be truly feminine, you should be gliding gracefully on your way and not look like you're rushing off to your next location. If you have to rush, try to look composed as you take quicker short steps to reach your destination.

, If you want to be feminine, then you have to know how to take care of someone, whether your boyfriend has gotten sick, your dog has gotten injured or your best friend just needs a shoulder to cry on. Be prepared to serve chicken soup, take a person's temperature or tell a person to lie down and make him or her feel more comfortable and cared for. A feminine woman helps, when she sees who clearly needs her help. She should spring into action when someone needs to be nurtured.


This doesn't mean that you should focus your energies to taking care of other people. It just means that when the time comes to be a caretaker, you should be prepared.

, If you want to be feminine, then you must have good manners at table and in all other aspects of your life. Manners mean not eating with your elbows on the table, greeting a person kindly even if you're having a bad day, not slouching or sneezing into your hands instead of a tissue and generally acting in a way that can serve as a model for others. Here are some other things to consider as you refine your manners:


If you're eating dinner in a group setting, make sure you say, ""Please pass the chicken,"" instead of reaching and invading another person's personal space.
Find a nice way to give negative feedback. Instead of saying, ""Will you shut up already?"" say, ""Would you mind lowering your voice?""
Avoid burping in public. Once you reach a certain age, burping in public is not funny anymore. If it happens by accident, just say ""Excuse me,"" or ""Pardon me.""
Avoid rolling your eyes or generally being rude when someone is saying something you don't really want to hear.

"
"
Talk like a lady.,
Give sincere compliments.,
Avoid bragging.,
Be polite.,
Be compassionate.",How to Be Feminine3," To be feminine, you can't curse like a sailor, yell to get what you want or talk so loudly that any person in the building can hear you. Part of being feminine is knowing how to get across exactly what you want to say, while being graceful, poised, delicate and considerate. Speak more softly, more slowly and express your thoughts as eloquently as possible. A lady says, ""It's a little chilly today,"" rather than ""I'm freezing my butt off!""


You don't have to change the way you think or all of the things you ordinarily talk about to be feminine. You just have to consider the way you convey your thoughts.

, Giving fake compliments is catty, not feminine. A lady should be able to find something kind or complimentary to say or make a person feel special and important by pointing out something that he or she is doing well. You can say something as simple as, ""I love your dress. It matches your eyes perfectly."" or ""You're so great at piano. How long have you been playing?"" Take a sincere interest in a person and find a small way to show that you're paying attention.


You don't have to go overboard. Just give a compliment whenever the mood strikes you.

, If you want to be feminine, then avoid bragging about your accomplishments, talking about how amazing you look or generally showing off. A truly feminine person is confident enough in her looks and abilities to let other people figure out how amazing she is. You don't have to be so humble that you can't take a compliment or never talk about your achievements, but avoid doing anything that may come off as bragging or making you seem a little full of yourself.


A truly feminine person doesn't need to show off for the compliments to come.

, A feminine girl isn't rude, off-putting or generally mean to anyone around her. Even if you're hanging around someone you don't like very much, you should avoid being openly combative or hostile. Instead, smile, be polite and limit your contact with the person as much as you can. A feminine woman also says ""Please,"" and ""Thank you"" whenever it's necessary.


Being polite also means talking about polite topics. Don't talk about anything overly vulgar, curse too much or bring up inappropriate topics in mixed company.

, A feminine woman feels compassion for other people, knows how to sympathize with people and says the right thing when she's trying to help someone. Know how to say things like, ""I'm so sorry you're feeling that way,"" ""I can't imagine how hard that is for you,"" or ""Please let me know if there's anything I can do."" A feminine woman knows how to recognize when someone is feeling upset, whether it's a dear friend or a small child and knows how to make that person feel better.


While you're saying comforting words, you should also behave in a comforting manner. Don't be afraid to put your arm around the person or to use your body language to show how sympathetic you are if it's appropriate.

If the guys you like seem to only be interested in ditzy girls, they are not good relationship material. Look for someone who appreciates your intelligence instead.;
, Traits often associated with femininity include kindness, honesty, compassion, and openness. Embrace this by always being nice to everyone, helping others, and sharing your emotions.Don't lie or spread gossip. This is not nice and it will make people think badly of you.
You can be honest without being cruel or blunt. Always try to put a positive spin on things.Keep in mind that there are some potentially negative aspects to being nice all of the time. Because we live in a male-dominated world, feminine traits like kindness and compassion are often undervalued. If you want to be successful, you may need to be aggressive and competitive at times.

, It may be hard to be perky and energetic all the time, but it helps if you always try to at least match the energy level of the people you are talking to. If you have a lower energy level than the people around you, you will come off as dull, boring, and not particularly girly.Even if you are not enjoying a conversation, always maintain eye contact and be polite.

,  A water bottle, deodorant, an ice pack, face wipes, extra hair ties, sunscreen, and a hat are the essentials.  When you carry all these things, you won't be scorching hot when the time comes to go outside.

,  If you have medium to long hair, make sure to put it up.  If you want, you can even cut your hair short.  A ponytail is classic but tie it tightly so you don't have to fix it every ten minutes, but not too tightly.  


Make sure your hair is out of your face and neatly away from your face.  You could also wear a bun or ponytail braid.

,  Do not wear black; this will reflect heat on you.  Instead, wear white, which does the opposite.  Wear white and light colours.  Try not to wear tight tops, wear breezy and thin tops made out of comfortable, silky fabric if you can.  Try to make them oversized.  Also wear loose shorts or thin pants.

,  After going inside with your face beaded with sweat, take a face wipe and gently wipe the sweat and dirt off.  It will feel refreshing.  If you're outside or just got inside and you're really hot, place an ice pack against your forehead, cheeks, neck, and anywhere on your body.  If you lose your hair tie, use another one to tie your hair up again.  


Always apply sunscreen after every few hours and drink lots of cold water. Always wear a hat when you go outside for optimal sun protection.  Use deodorant if you smell.

,  Ah, so refreshing!

Allocate time to each task. Many people allow themselves an hour to get ready, while others only take about fifteen minutes to get themselves ready for the day. On a weekend or an extended vacation, practice your morning routine and see how long you will need for each lesson. You do not need to plan out every aspect of your after school activities, but make some things certain, such as your study time, a bedtime, and a dinner time. A good after-school schedule might look something like this for the average middle schooler:

, A lot of people like radio alarm clocks. It's always great to have your favorite song to wake you up in the morning.


A lot of people need about an hour to get up, get dressed and eat breakfast. If you take a shower in the morning, reserve at least 30 minutes to an hour for showering and blow drying hair.

, You'll probably need different items to get through your day. A purse, a backpack, homework, books, paperwork: you name it. Make sure that you've gathered everything that you need. Staying organized is very important.


It can help a lot to make a list of everything that you'll need daily and then leave yourself post-it notes for the unusual items that you need to remember (like a class project).

, Try to get up as soon as your alarm sounds. It's hard, but try.

, Do everything you need to do in the bathroom before you get dressed. It's less messy. Take a shower if you didn't shower the night before.

, Wrap a towel around your hair to get it started drying and then start getting dressed. Pick out your outfit for the day and then put it on. If you have to share a bathroom with a lot of people, it might be a good idea to get dressed in your room, so that someone else can have a turn with the bathroom.


Try to choose a layered outfit, if you can, because that will let you easily adjust to temperatures throughout the day.
If you need help choosing what to wear, wikiHow can help.

, With your clothes on, start going through the rest of your grooming routine. This is what takes the longest for most people, so it’s important to look for ways to reduce the amount of time you spend grooming. Look for products that will save you time, like a combined moisturizer and foundation cream. You should also think about what grooming activities you can cut. Some things might seem important, but are really unnecessary, like applying a lot of makeup. To get ready, you can do things like:


Brush your teeth.

Take care of your skin.

Do your hair.

Do your makeup (if you wear makeup).

Shave your face if you are a guy or you can pluck your eyebrows if you are a girl


, Some people object to applying makeup before getting dressed, because you might get makeup on your clothes, but as long as you're careful you should be okay. Besides, you'll smudge your makeup pulling your shirt on.

, If you have time to (and you should make the time), eat breakfast before you start to get ready. Telling you that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is clichéd and actually wrong, but eating a healthy breakfast will help wake you up and get your mind nice and sharp for the day.


Eat something simple like a cereal bar to save time.

, You're ready to go. Try to leave a few minutes earlier than you think you need to. This will help keep you from getting stressed and keep you prepared for when things don't go according to plan.


One trick is to set the clock next to your front door, so that it is about 10 minutes fast. This will help motivate you out the door.

, If you really want your morning to run smoothly, one of the best things that you can do is to wake up earlier. This sounds awful, but it doesn’t have to be as bad as it sounds. Even waking up just 15 minutes earlier can buy you that extra time you need so that you are not reenacting a 1980s teen movie every morning. If you can manage to get yourself up even earlier you might have time for a nice slow breakfast or even some entertainment to help you wake up. All in all, you will find that waking up earlier can lead to a much less stressful day.


Move the alarm clock if you are finding it hard to stop hitting the snooze button. Plug your alarm clock in across the room or get an alarm clock that is harder to turn off. Both will help you in getting out of bed.
Fit in exercise. If you can save yourself some time in the morning, it’s a good idea to ease into exercising as soon as you get up. Just a little light activity can get you feeling more awake and alert than a cup of coffee and it won’t have the crash feeling that comes with caffeine.
Now, if you don’t get a lot of sleep, you might need to adjust for this by going to bed earlier too. However, if you get the recommended 8 hours a day or more, you might actually want to consider sleeping less. Did you know that oversleeping can make you feel tired and groggy all day too?

, Eating breakfast in the car can save you time, especially if you spend a lot of time sitting in traffic. “But what about driving” you ask? Just be sure to take travel-friendly foods and only eat them when you are stopped at a light or in traffic. Choose a healthy option with lots of protein and you will have a great start to your day.


You can try making apple and cheese quesadillas. Place a whole grain tortilla on a plate and top with cheese and thinly sliced apples. Top with another tortilla and place in the microwave for 30 seconds, to melt the cheese. Slice and your breakfast is ready to go.
You can also make a healthy smoothie. Mix low-fat milk, vanilla yogurt, apples, and a little bit of kale into a blender. Stick it in a to-go cup and you’re road ready. This is a healthy meal and you can make 2-3 days worth of smoothie at once.

, Showering at night can save you time in the morning. This is especially helpful if a lot of people share your house. You’ll have less of a fight for the bathroom and you can sleep in just a little later in the morning if you want to. You can even style your hair a little before bed, which means your hair will only need a little fixing when you get up in the morning.


You can also use dry shampoo either at night or in the morning if you want to buy yourself some more time. You should still shampoo your hair at least once or twice a week, but dry shampoo can save you some time, especially on particularly busy days.

, Shaving your legs or face can take a lot of time. You might want to consider not doing these things, especially when you know you’re going to have a really busy few weeks or months. For men, keeping a well-groomed beard is just as professional as a clean-shaven face. For women, even skirt weather does not have to mean hair-free legs. Just wear opaque tights or leggings. You will be perfectly stylish and you can save yourself that extra 15 minutes in the morning.

, Find opportunities to double up on morning activities. For example, you can brush your teeth while the water for you warms up. You can put on some clothes and do some grooming activities while you sit on the toilet. Do some of your makeup while your hair straightener heats up. There's lots of chances to make use of the time during your morning routine.

Determine how much sleep you need.,
Set a bedtime.,
Reset your internal clock.",How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School1," Over the summer, you most likely got into the habit of sleeping in and staying up late. To prepare for rising earlier for school, you will need to reset your internal, or circadian, clock to make the adjustment back to school easier.


While everyone is a little different, the rule of the thumb is that those between 5-9 years old need 10-11 hours of sleep per night, and those between 10-18 years old need 8½-9½ hours of sleep per night.;
, Calculate what time you will need to go to sleep in order to get up and out the door on time in the morning. For example, say school starts at 8 a.m., and you need to leave the house by 7:30 a.m. Let’s also say it takes you an hour to eat breakfast and to get ready. If you need 9 hours of sleep, then you will need to get up at 6:30 a.m. and be asleep by 9:30 p.m.


Depending upon how quickly you fall asleep, you may need to go to bed earlier than the time you calculated. If it takes you a ½ hour to fall asleep, and you’ve determined you need to be asleep at 9:30 p.m., then you should be in bed at 9 p.m.

, Move your bedtime back by 15 minutes per day every 3-4 days. Wake up 15 minutes earlier on these days, too. Do this every day of the week, including on the weekends, until you’re falling asleep at your decided-upon bedtime, or at 9:30 p.m. in the example above.Depending upon how late you’ve been staying up, this method may take several weeks to accomplish to get to your desired bedtime, so plan ahead.
If you don’t plan ahead, you’ll need to speed up the process. Try moving your bedtime back by 1-2 hours every 1-2 days and waking up 1-2 hours early on these days, too. It could be rough going at first but likely less so than making the change in one day, especially on the first day of school when you might already be nervous and have trouble sleeping.
Stick to the plan on weekends, or the one, if you’ve only given yourself a week to complete the process. If you don’t stay on your sleep schedule during the weekend, it throws off your circadian rhythm, making Monday morning a literal drag."
"
Eat your breakfast early.,
Get ready as you would for school.,
Leave the house.",How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School2," Summertime doesn’t just throw your sleep off-kilter. Your whole daily schedule changes, which can be pretty fun and relaxing, but also difficult to kick to the curb when it ends. When you wake up, eat your breakfast at the same time as you will when you wake up for school.


Studies have shown that breakfast helps wake you up and gives you more energy. Eating in the morning provides your body with glucose, the source of energy for your whole body, so it’s not surprising if you often feel lethargic when you first awaken.And why breakfast will help pep you up – you are, after all, breaking your overnight fast.
Research also shows that eating carbohydrate-rich cereals improves your mood, which can only help in gearing up for school., After you wake up, proceed as if you are going to school. If you normally eat first, do that. If you normally take a shower first, do that.The point is to reform habits, so when school starts you won't be quite so startled when the alarm starts ringing in your ear and the act of getting out of bed won’t feel quite so drudging.


Make sure you finish the job. For instance, if you normally style your hair and wear make-up to school, do your hair and make-up during this period of readjustment, too.
Also work toward getting it all done in the same amount of time that you have allotted for getting ready once school starts. If you get in the habit now, you won’t feel so rushed later.

, If you’re able, leave the house at the same time that you would for school. This will push you to stick to your schedule, and it will get you back into the habit of doing something outside of the home in the morning.Here are some suggestions:


You could go to the library. This could serve the dual purpose of also helping you freshen up on your Algebra, for instance, or catch up on your summer reading.
Go to a friend’s house who is also re-establishing his/her morning routine. Together you can set off for the day to go to the park, see a movie, go the mall and so forth.
Sign up for a morning class in your community. Many local art centers, YMCAs, churches and parks departments offer a variety of classes throughout the summer for students to take during breaks.

"
"
Eat dinner at the right time.,
Read in the evenings.,
Prepare for bed.,
Go to sleep on time.",How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School3," Over the summer, your eating schedule may have gotten a little wild. So start eating at the time you plan to once you’re back in school.


If you've been consuming a lot of fast food during those lazy summer nights, get back to eating nutritious, well-balanced meals. Healthy foods aren't just better for your body. They also boost brain power.To determine what time you will be eating dinner, you’ll need to sit down and figure out your evening schedule, looking at things like a) after-school activities, b) how much homework you think you’ll have, c) how much time you’ll spend preparing for bed, d) how much free time you’d like, e) what time you need to go to bed and f) what the rest of your household’s schedule looks like.

, Reading at night (reading in general if you haven’t for awhile) will get those brain circuits flowing again. This will make studying easier, and it will get you back into the mode of doing homework at night.


You could also work on things like Sudoku puzzles, crossword puzzles, children’s workbooks, flash cards – anything to kick-start returning to an evening routine that includes studying and homework.
Try to get your schedule and do activities related to your schedule, like finding online Geometry problems. It will actually be more like homework than reading and puzzles, and will also improve your grades for school.

, You may have gotten out of the habit of taking that nightly shower or bath, if you take it at night, or even brushing your teeth. Now’s the time to start doing these things again regularly. And, as with your morning routine, do them at the same time you plan to do them once school starts.


This is also a good time to get back into the habit of or create the habit of laying out your clothes for the morning. Doing this will make you feel less rushed in the morning and less stressed overall, especially if you are very particular about what you wear.

, Once you have reset your clock, continue going to sleep at the time you've set for yourself, even on the weekends. Resisting all temptations to break your new sleep schedule will be rewarded soon enough.

Power down before bedtime.,
Stay away from caffeine before bed.,
Avoid rigorous exercise before bed.,
Break electronic insomnia.,
Darken your room.,
Go to sleep the same time each night.",How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School4," Winding down in the evening is equivalent to telling your body that it’s time to call it quits for the day. You can’t expect it to go from 100 to 0 simply by getting in bed and pulling up the covers. So spend about 30-45 minutes slowly shutting down your brain and body.


You might do this by taking a hot shower or bath. When you get out, your core body temperature drops, which is a signal to your brain to produce melatonin, your body’s natural sleep hormone.Other ways to prepare for sleep are by putting away the electronic gadgets and gaming systems and, instead, reading a book, listening to classical or relaxing music or by doing easy stretches., Caffeine is a stimulant, and while most people associate it with coffee, it’s also in tea, chocolate, soda and some pain relievers. Sleep experts recommend avoiding these things for 6 hours before going to sleep.


This may seem like a really long time, but that’s how long it takes for caffeine to leave your bloodstream., When you exercise vigorously, your body temperature goes up, and it takes several hours for it to drop to normal levels again. Because lower body temperature is needed for better sleep, don’t exercise for 3-4 hours before going to sleep.On the flip side, exercising regularly promotes good sleep. The precise mechanism between regular exercise and sleep is still uncertain, but numerous studies on various populations have shown that it works., Turn off the TV, and put away your cell phones, computers and tablets once you’re in bed. They not only prevent you from winding down because you’re so busy clicking, scrolling, typing, chatting and so forth, but they also trick your body into thinking it’s daytime and, therefore, not time to go to bed.


Here’s how it works. These devices emit a type of blue light that mimics natural light, thereby suppressing melatonin levels. When this occurs, your brain tells your body it’s not time to sleep; it disrupts your circadian rhythm.TVs also emit this light, but the problem is amplified with cell phones, laptops and tablets because they are closer to your face.

, Turn off all lights while you sleep. Your circadian rhythm, or inner clock, is largely regulated by exposure to light and dark, with melatonin secreted in darkness and suppressed in light. Since melatonin induces sleep, the darker your room the better.You might also want to dim the lights during those 30-45 minutes that you are powering down before bedtime as a cue to your brain that it’s almost time to go to sleep.
If you live with a roommate or there are lights that you just can’t avoid, try wearing an eye mask to block out the light.

, Make sure you stick to your bedtime each night of the week. While it will be tempting to stay up late on the weekends, doing so will really throw a wrench in your internal clock and make Monday mornings rather unpleasant.

Eat dinner 2-3 hours before bedtime.,

Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Make hitting snooze hard.,
Use more than one alarm.,
Utilize light to your waking advantage.",How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School5," It's significantly easier to wake up early if you've slept well the night before. Eating a lot late at night, though, can make sleep difficult because food takes time to digest. Spicy, garlic-flavored and highly acidic and fatty foods are especially troublesome because they frequently cause heartburn if you lie down too soon after eating them.Conversely, hunger can also disrupt sleep. So if you find yourself really hungry before bed, stick to snacking on things like oatmeal, bananas, cereal and milk, yogurt, raw veggies or some popcorn., One of the reasons so many people hate waking up early is because of that rushed feeling they have when trying to hurriedly get ready and out the door on time. To help avoid some of this, choose and lay out your clothes the night before, prepare your lunch, pack up your homework and books in your satchel or book bag and make sure you have any forms signed that you need for school.


Lay out your clothes, shoes and accessories where you will put them on – whether that be in the bathroom after you shower or in your bedroom.
Have your backpack, gym clothes and musical instrument, if you have one, by the door, ready to go.

, Continue with your returning-to-school schedule and eat a hearty breakfast. It will increase your glucose level, get your juices flowing and set a good tone for the rest of your day.

, Most of us have done it, probably more times in a row than we’d care to admit. But hitting snooze only makes getting up harder and your mornings ultimately more rushed. So move your alarm – further than arm’s reach.


If you have an extremely hard time waking up, consider putting it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off., Purchase and then put more than one alarm clock in different places around your room. You might set them to go off at the same time, or you might opt to have them go off at different times, but no more than 2-3 minutes apart. Otherwise, you’re apt to get back in bed after turning off the first.


Buy different types of alarms, so the buzzers sound differently and have different volume levels.
You could also use your cell phone as long as it has an alarm and is loud enough. Some even allow you to download annoying alarm tones, which might be frustrating but ultimately effective.

, Since your internal clock responds to light as its wake-up call, you can use it to help awaken yourself even if the sun has yet to rise. And there are some pretty neat gadgets out there that can help.


For example, there are a number of alarm clocks that help wake you up by slowly increasing light, as if the sun were rising, thus tricking your body to respond and say, “Okay, it’s time to get up.”Science has even demonstrated they do, indeed, help rouse people from sleep more easily and quickly, even though the light is artificial.
There are also lamps you can put by your bed that slowly turn on, simulating the sunrise. Some even offer the opposite effect, simulating a sunset for help in going to sleep.
Ultimately, however, natural light is the best way to go. It’s certainly what our ancestors relied on prior to Edison.Allowing natural light into your room by leaving the blinds or curtains open when you go to sleep is the best jolt to your rhythmic system. Yet because this is often not possible when getting up early enough for school, natural light simulators are nice alternatives.

Purchase a malleable binder.,
Cut the binder.,
Add your own design.,
Cover the binder.",How to Make a Planner1," It helps to pick out a binder that you can easily cut to make a smaller planner. The best way to make a personalized planner is to find and purchase a cardboard binder as a frame. The cardboard will also allow you to customize the design if you decide to adjust the outward appearance.Try to find a binder that uses small rings that aren’t very long. This will allow you to modify the dimensions of the binder without affecting the binder’s rings.;
, Lay the binder flat so the rings are facing up. Use a ruler and pencil to measure out 5.7x6.7 inches. This is an estimated size that may not work for your binder. Measure the height by leaving an inch above and beneath the rings. Then make each side around seven inches. Be sure the sides don’t overlap each other by making their sizes equal.


Use an exacto knife to produce a clean cut. Hold the ruler down with pressure along the outline and carefully make your cut.You can also use scissors if an exacto knife isn’t available to you.
The spine will be 3 or 4 inches depending on what binder you picked out.
Don’t try to tamper or cut the ring holes. Modify the binder’s size based on the ring holes.
You’re not required to cut your binder, but planners are generally smaller than standard binders.

, You aren’t required to design your planner, but it might encourage you to use it if you enjoy how it looks. Reflect for a moment on what you’d like to see as you write down your obligations and schedule. Perhaps a series of inspirational quotes will complete the look and feel of your planner. You could also go with a minimal design by gluing three different colors of construction paper into a grid-like pattern on the cover.


It is also a popular choice to paste an inspirational figure onto the cover like Nelson Mandela or Serena Williams.
Choose whatever design you feel connected with., To effectively use this binder as an outer shell, you’ll need to protect it from water and other types of damage. You can use plastic book covers or a waterproofing spray. The book covers should be in a school supplies store and the spray can be found in a hardware store or the internet.


If you decide not to use a cover or spray, consider covering the edges of the binder with tape. You could even use a colorful duct tape to add something flashier.
An adhesive spray could also be used as an alternative to a waterproofing spray.
You could also glue a laminated sheet of paper onto the cover to act as a cover.

, Take the full two minutes to carefully brush your teeth. Make sure to use toothpaste and mouthwash. Rinse your mouth with water.

, Take the time to splash your face with cool water to help wake you up. If you use any type of moisturizer or acne wash, apply it now, following the directions on the packaging.

Create a page template.,
Add the days of the week to the columns.,
Determine the time period.,
Print and cut the pages.,
Punch holes into the templates.",How to Make a Planner2," Softwares such as Microsoft Word can help you create a template for your planner pages. Using the computer will save you time from manually creating each page. First you’ll need to set the page size to something smaller than what you cut your binder to. Then make three columns for each page to be used as the days of the week. Use these margin settings for the columns: 1” for the top margin, 1” for the bottom margin, 1.5” for the left side, and .75” for the right side., Use a small, but legible font to add the days of the week onto the columns. You should have two pages in your word processing software. The first page could have Monday through Wednesday and the second page could have Thursday, Friday, and Saturday/Sunday.


For most planners, it’s okay to combine Saturday and Sunday into one column.

, You’ll need to decide on a range of dates for your planner. Think about your schedule and what you will need your planner for. Create the next three months before creating any additional months. Some softwares will fill in the date for each month while others won’t.Add the month on the top or bottom of the page in a legible size.
Add an inspirational quote for each month to add variety.
If you’re unable to add the dates of the month, fill them in manually with a pen as you use the planner.
Be sure to create enough weeks for each month. Look at a calendar to help you design.

, Once you finalize your design, you’re ready to print the pages. If you have access to a double sided printer, use this function to save paper.Use a paper cutter to cut the pages down to fit into the binder. If you don’t have access to a paper cutter, use a ruler and an exacto knife to make the cuts.


Stack multiple pages on top of each other for a quicker cut. Be sure all the pages are aligned evenly.
Do not rush through cutting the pages or else you might damage or tear one of the pages.

, To fit the pages into your binder, you’ll need use a hole puncher. Adjust the hole puncher so that it matches the binder’s rings.Use a ruler to match the binder’s rings with the hole puncher. Once everything is aligned, punch holes for your templates.


You can hole punch multiple pages at a time depending on your hole puncher.

Use endpapers.,
Create pockets.Pockets are handy for storing loose papers on the fly.,
Use binder tabs.,
Make reference pages.",How to Make a Planner3," Endpapers act as separators for the actual planner. These are pages that are typically laminated or coated with strong plastic. Endpapers also protect the planner pages from being damaged.It is also common to decorate these pages in a similar theme as you did for your planner’s cover.

, They can be mounted onto your customized endpapers. Construct a pocket by cutting half a page of thick paper. Then staple the edges around the end paper. Create a couple of pockets in case of an emergency.

, Binder tabs are helpful for organizing and accessing papers by subject or month. You can find binder tabs in an office supplies store.They contain tabs that allow you to insert a written subject like “Fieldwork” or “January.” Cut the height and width of the tab pages if needed. The tab pages should be the same size as your planner pages.


Hole punch the tabs once cut to the proper dimension. Do not cut the edge where the tabs are overlapping.
Use tabs to separate the months so you can access the month and date quickly.

, Sometimes it is nice to have a quick fact sheet to use on the spot in your planner. You can find or create a reference sheet of a relevant subject and include it into your planner. Reference sheets are helpful for storing mathematical/scientific formulas, historical timelines, or even verb conjugation.Your reference page should be in the beginning of your planner.

, Unless you get up around 2 to 3 hours before heading off to school, leave hair washes for the evenings. This will ensure that you avoid wet hair for school, and sudden bad-hair days. This is especially important during winter.

If you're thinking about doing a new hairstyle for school always try it out the night before, and always make sure it's appropriate for school.
If you want, don't be afraid to straighten or curl your hair but use protective spray to protect your hair from singeing and be careful not to burn yourself.

, If you don't have enough time in the morning, then shower the night before. This is much better than skipping showers or being late. If you have enough time, shower in the morning.

, This is a great time saver., Even if you're not a morning person,getting up on time is a great way to start the day. Aim to get up an hour before you need to leave.

, Stay within the dress code. If you wear a uniform, don't go overboard with accessories.

, Don't take too long. If you wear makeup, do it too but keep it minimal, such as some lip gloss and a little blush.

, This stops decay and keeps your mouth fresh.

, Grab some shoes and your bags and get to school.

Energize that voice in your head.,
Wear bright colors.,
Play in the rain.,
Dress up.,
Limit your TV usage.,
Get happy.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
Go for natural stimulants.,
Exercise.,
Get a good night's sleep.,
Rock out.,
Get with your friends.,
Plan some activities where you can exhibit your excitement and can have serious fun -- with a purpose.,
Spread the enthusiasm: Don’t try to “stay calm” on the way.,
Go for it!,
Wind down: Don’t just quit all of a sudden.,
Plan it again!",How to Become Hyper," When the voice in your head sounds like Eeyore, it's pretty hard to get pumped up. But when it's saying things like, ""9 AM -- BE AWESOME. 10 AM -- Dominate gym class LIKE A BOSS. 11 AM - Rock the chemistry test,"" it's pretty hard to not feel like the Energizer bunny. So get to training your head for energy. It's here to pump you up, even if it doesn't sound much like Arnold Schwarzenegger.


The idea here is to A) talk to yourself in exclamation points -- with enthusiasm, with excitement -- but also B) talk to yourself positively. It's very hard to get enthusiastic about failing or things not going your way. So to energize your thoughts, think brighter.;
, There's a reason we wear black to funerals! Turns out wearing bright colors can make you happier and more energized. In other words, hyper!So if you were thinking of going goth, sorry. You'd be better off going Rainbow Brite.


Looking at bright colors can do it, too. It's as if the bright colors cue your brain to get ready for fun and excitement. No wonder adults get tired -- they're constantly around blacks, blues, and tans. They need a little orange in their lives!

, Okay, that's probably the funniest thing you could do. But really, getting wet at all alerts your system, waking up all your senses. Showers can actually get your metabolism going! So go splash some water on your face or go puddle jumping -- it's all good!


It also wipes away stress, almost literally. So if you're feeling worried about something (which can be a total drag), aim for the water. Maybe life should be one giant pool party, huh?

, If prom were to happen every day, it wouldn't be special. Very few people would get excited and the buzz it cultivates just wouldn't be there. But when dressing up (even if it's not prom) rolls around only once every so often, it creates this intangible excitement that you can't help from feeling energized about. So take this Friday night to get dressed to the nines!


You don't have to put on a prom dress or tux to see this effect. Just throwing on nice clothes can put you in a good mood, especially if your friends are doing it too. When it comes to effects like these, there's definite power in numbers!

, Turns out plopping yourself down in front of the TV is more than just relaxing -- it's energy-zapping and turns you into a vegetable.You end up not wanting to do anything but sit there and the cycle just gets worse. So if there's a show you absolutely have to watch, watch it, but then get up off your butt!


Instead, try playing games -- even if it's just Words with Friends on Facebook! It's the same relaxing stuff, but it keeps your brain entertained and just plain going -- instead of zoning out and shutting down like it does when you crawl in front of the tube.

, We've sort of touched on this already, but let's lay it on the line: it's super hard to be hyper when you're down in the dumps. When you think of a sad person, are they running about, flailing their arms, screaming for the hilltops, and being, well, unstoppable? No. Never. So if you want to get hyper, you'll need to beat those nasty thoughts into submission. There's no room for worry, regret, or sadness here. You need a reason for that pep in your step!


So whatever makes you happy, do it. Dance naked in your living room. Spend the night baking 3,197 sugar cookies. Play online chess for 4 hours and then do your homework. If it gets your endorphins going, it's good.

, Studies show that eating a good, healthy, protein-packed breakfast (think oats, egg whites, and lean meat) versus, oh, say a package of donuts can have a lasting, energizing effect all day. You'd think the sugar in those donuts would get you going, and it does -- until you crash a couple hours later (and then you're hungry again). So eat a healthy breakfast for the sake of your entire day.


In addition to eating a healthy breakfast, it's also important to just eat breakfast. It gets your metabolism going, your body revs up, and you're ready to tackle the day. If you don't eat, you may feel sluggish and that afternoon siesta may turn into a lost evening., Caffeine and sugar are standards that will pump up your activity level. The form you choose is one of personal taste but energy drinks, coffee, soda and candy are great sources. If you had the time to plan ahead, you might want to “carb load” the night before to give your body that extra boost so you can last longer.


Of course, with things like this, you will experience a crash. It could be minutes later, it could be hours, but it'll happen. The solution is not to consume more. That just will make the next crash worse!
Be careful with caffeine pills; do not take more than one. Your heart will start going crazy and you'll feel like death's knocking. Be aware of the dangers of crushing and snorting caffeine pills (or any pills for that matter). It is not advised and can cause you bodily harm.

, You know that whole ""sitting in front of the TV makes you want to sit in front of the TV"" thing? The opposite is true, too. When you exercise, you get your blood pumping, your juices flowing, your body ready and raring to go -- making you more hyper, even though you've spent your energy working out. You'll feel good, you'll feel energized, and you'll be healthier!


Did we mention that exercise releases endorphins, your get-happy hormone? Talk about killing two birds with one stone!

, This one is definitely a no-brainer. If you want to have some serious stashes of energy, get 8 hours of sleep -- or get however many your magic number is (somewhere between 7 and 9, probably). When you're not fully rested, just making it through day can be a challenge, much less being excited about it.


Keep the same sleep schedule as much as possible. Your body gets used to when it wakes up and goes to sleep and if you mess that up, it gets messed up. It'll be a lot easier to wake and be happy about it when you've woken up at that same time all week.

, Being hyper originates between your ears. It's a mental thing, but it does take cues from your body. So put on some music that excites you for a good start. Move with it.


If you’re into very active video games, those are good, too. Who says it's only music you can rock out to? Killing zombies is a rhythm all its own, after all.

, Being hyper with people has a purpose: to get excited together and to play and work together. The energy of many can create a wonderful thing! You're not a chaotic mess. You have a purpose: fun and energy!


Consider being hyper while alone sometimes, too, so that you can try your best in conditioning, running, jogging, or practicing individual skills of a sport like basketball -- dribbling or practicing three point shots at your speed without fighting the big D.

, Choose a place where being hyper is acceptable; the mall is probably a bad choice whereas a skate park might work fine. Gathering up your friends and going to the old folks home won't be the best use of your time. Aim for places that won't get you shushed or kindly shown the door.


Large, open areas are best. Think parks, the beach, fields, or places dedicated to athletics like the basketball court or pool.

, Get your friends excited with you. Hand out the candy; get the others to buy energy drinks and sodas with vitamins and caffeine. Hyper activity is contagious so you will all “feed” off each other; you will all enjoy it more if you’re all sharing the experience.


If someone's not up to snuff, get 'em there! Don't nag or make fun of them, simply invite them to have as much fun as you're having. Nagging or teasing just brings your positive energy (and the energy of the group) down.

, Release that pent up energy! Run, jump… just do it! Being this way can actually become an almost spiritual event (think Native Americans dancing all night to the beat of drums). The more you do the more amazing you’ll feel. Dance like nobody’s watching. Why would you dance any other way?


Just a friendly reminder: release that pent up energy in legal ways. Having the cops show up on the scene is the worst kind of buzzkill there is.

, Your body has a huge store of endorphins running through it – if you just quit you’ll experience a “drop” that you will not enjoy. You warmed up by preparing – cool down before you stop. You wouldn't land a plane suddenly; think of your body the same way.


Take a minute to reminisce with your friends. Laugh about it. Eat some decent food (meaning not candy and Mountain Dew) and take in the day. Phew!

, The longer you wait, the more energy you will build up to be hyper. Think of it as something to look forward to! Now how will you make it even better next time?


Consider inviting more people, too! The more the merrier. And if you can't wait that long, think about getting hyper on your own time. A little practice can't hurt!

Don't lose yourself.",How to Become a Socialite," If you already come from a dirty rich family, consider yourself lucky in this regard.


However, don't put others down because they don't have your kind of money- that's pathetic. If you're like 99% of the world and aren't super-rich, hope is not lost- you just may need to work a little harder. It will help if you and/or your family are involved in your community, so consider that. And let's face it, even the Trumps and Hiltons had to start somewhere.
When people ask you about your early life -and they will-, think of some interesting details to tell them. Avoid any embarrassing details and focus on saying positive things, even minor things can make a big difference and earn you respect. Above all, don't say anything rude about your family- that's just lowlife. Rich people want their entourage to come from a good familiar background (and good means rich here) for a very simple reason: they want to surround themselves with well-educated people. So, as long as you are mannered and proper, they won't care that much.;
, Preparation for becoming a socialite begins in middle school. Of course, it is possible to become a socialite even if you weren't brilliant in middle and high school and didn't attend prestigious colleges, but it’s much harder.


If you are still in middle school or high school, make the best you can out of your school years. Get excellent grades (B’s are the lowest grades accepted, C’s are unacceptable), get involved in extracurricular activities, and obtain high scores at exams.
Attend prestigious universities; either one of the Ivy League ones (warning: you must pay up to $50,000 a year, so make sure you save enough money for that), or a renowned European one (Sorbonne in Paris, or Oxford and Cambridge in the UK). However, any private college will do the trick, there are many nice colleges that aren't Ivy League and still prestigious. And if you go to a public school, choose one that specializes in your field (examples include Purdue's engineering program and IU's journalism school, they are very prestigious indeed) Only 29% of American adults have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent, so possessing one from any institution is a great thing. If you can get into graduate school and get a Masters or higher, even better! You'll get TONS of respect from people.
Choose a career path that can help you meet more people. Law, non-profit, fashion, finance, the arts and business are great because they make lots of connections with socialites and celebrities. Non-profit is one of the best because the organizations require people with many different skills, so you can find your place and meet prominent people at events. You may have to work your way up, but it's worth the effort and you're bound to find an organization that supports something you're passionate about.
Understand if your degree is in something else, you're not restricted. Natalie Portman is a famous actress now, but guess what she earned a degree in at Harvard? Psychology! Bet you didn't know that. Truthfully, there are prominent people in almost and you can even create a career path all your own. Do what you want and take advantage of any chances you get to meet experienced people in your area.
Learn a few foreign languages. French is a must; German, Spanish and Italian would also help. But the more languages you know, the better. However, you don't have to be completely fluent, just enough so you can have a normal conversation with someone. Even just knowing how to do hellos and goodbyes properly are ok.

, In theory, it is quite easy: establish a business and make it grow. Again, pick one of the fields above; if you do, you’ll certainly find quite a lot of well-paying, fun jobs. Strive to be the best in your field; try to meet some famous people working in your field and learn their secrets. Start small; you won't be extremely successful by the beginning of your career. Get a few different jobs in the field, gather experience, then start a brand of your own. This may take a while, but it's well worth the effort and you'll earn major respect.

, Make a website for yourself or your company, make some business cards, convince some related brands to empower you, advertise yourself or your company in some newspapers or magazines and so on. Especially at the beginning of your career, it is very important to meet the right people. Establishing a good social network can get you many good deals. Go to events related to your field, meet some moguls in the given industry, and make them help you.

, Yes, you can become a socialite by marrying the right person, without having to work for all that fortune yourself. You can then use your spouse's money to get a good start in business (you thought you could still get away without working? You will be disappointed to find out you can't, dear). Do you think Tinsley Mortimer was always one of the most prominent socialites in Manhattan? Wrong. She wasn't that known until she married Robert ""Topper"" Mortimer, a very rich banker, and became a designer for the handbag line Samantha Thavasa. So don't worry if you haven't been an excellent student; there's hope for you too. However, don't give up true love just to find someone richer, that's pathetic and will label you as a gold digger (and nobody likes that, do they? Didn't think so.)

, As a socialite, there are a few things you must (emphasize ""must"") know. For example, the most basic thing to start with is knowing the names and faces of the most prominent socialites of the moment.

, Make sure it sounds extremely WASP-y, uncommon and maybe foreign. Don’t go for already “taken” last names such as Vanderbilt, because people know the Vanderbilts and will eventually figure you out. However, if you have to go by your ""common name"", don't worry. Being true to yourself is better than being a fake.


The caveat to the above is that you must look the part. If you have olive skin, kinky hair and brown eyes, no one is going to buy you as Muffie Sutton. In this case, you are better off settling for something that suggests old Spanish heritage (""Isabella Segovia"").

, Know all the big names in everything: fashion, art, crafts, cuisine, sports etc. In the socialites’ world, when someone mentions a name, everybody is expected to know it. Also be able to pronounce all those foreign names properly. You may want to start reading some specialty magazines.


If you're clueless about anything luxurious, go on Fashion Net and start doing your research. The website contains some excellent links to the sites of the brands that matter. Try acquiring some stuff from any of those brands.

, ""Nouveau riche"" is an often derogatory term used to describe the upper class people who don't come from a wealthy family and achieved their fortune through work, not heritage. You may get looked down upon just for the fact that previous generations in your family were not wealthy. It's a sad fact of life; however, it can be diminished by not acting like the stereotypical new money fellow. Nouveau riche tend to be more extravagant in appearances, but it is understandable, because they automatically link opulence with happiness; but in time, the second, third, and so on generations who grew up with wealth tend not to find it that important.


Don't be too enthusiastic about your possessions; for true upperclassmen, wealth is something they got used to, therefore they don't think about it too much. Be modest and don't brag about your belongings. Better yet, don't mention prices at all.
Spend your money wisely. Don't rush into buying opulent stuff, just because you can afford it; have a little Class. Don't show off your economic status by being as extravagant as possible; you will only end up looking ridiculous and proving that you have no experience whatsoever in being rich. To summarize, don't be a total snob.

, Refinement is the quality that separates ditsy celebrities from the true elite; lack of sophistication is a crime in the socialite world.



Have excellent manners. Tend to slouch? Put your elbows on the table while eating? Yawn without covering your mouth? Such signs of lack of good breeding are unacceptable among the socialites. Your manners must be perfect. Buy the most detailed book on having good manners you can find, then learn it by heart.
Be cultured. Read a lot, visit museums and art galleries, go to the theatre, meet artists and poets. Also keep in mind that it is unacceptable for a socialite not to know anything related to common knowledge; remember that if a 7th grader knows it, you're supposed to know it too. Re-familiarize yourself with basic history, science, geography and art.

Speak properly. No slang whatsoever; cursing is also unacceptable. Use The Queen's English. Occasionally drop in some French words (like calling somebody “cheri” instead of “darling”). Use formal rather than informal language, both in speaking and in writing.


Be confident. As glamorous as it may seem, the socialites' world is very gossipy and mean; and you'll need loads of confidence to make it through it all. If you don't consider yourself worthy enough to be among them, they won't either. Not to mention you often need witty comebacks when someone says something mean to you; and a person without confidence can't quickly say something witty back to them.

Be classy and discrete. Avoid doing things that draw negative attention to you, such as being very loud, getting drunk at parties, flirting with everyone that crosses your path, or cursing.
Be fashionable. It is crucial that you have a sense of style and wear stylish, tailored clothes- and brand names make a huge difference. Everything you wear in public should be designer. Adopt a classy, timeless style; something that now looks just as good as it looked in the '50s, and just as good as it will look over 50 years from now. For ladies, get inspired by Jackie O., Charlotte from Sex and the City and Audrey Hepburn. For gentlemen, a tailored suit will always do it. Also, you should have a signature look that distinguishes you from other people- a fetish for a certain color, a nice haircut, whatever.

, There are some travel destinations you may not miss as a socialite- New York (obviously), Paris, London, Milan, Saint- Tropez, maybe. Take the time to visit all the important places there.


This goes for holiday destinations as well. Summer in the Hamptons (many famous people have summer houses there) and winter in Aspen, these are the regular vacation spots for rich people. Other exotic, expensive destinations go as well- Hawaii, St. Barts, Dubai, Greece, etc.

Avoid acting like the stereotypical tourist; many people, especially the locals, find it annoying. Don't combine a colorful T-shirt and some shorts with white sports shoes, a big backpack, a baseball cap, sunglasses and a huge camera hanging at your neck (the typical tourist outfit). Don't buy tons of cheap, tacky souvenirs. Don't travel in large groups- your family or significant other is enough.

, The number one thing that you must do if you want to be a socialite is this- give. Yes, and you should have a few charities under your belt. The great thing about this part is that it can be whatever you want, whatever amount you want, be it $30 or $20,000. You don't have to tell people about how much you gave; just tell them about the cause. And as you go up the ranks you will be able to give more. Oh, and there are perks like meeting celebrities, the affluent, intellectuals, politicians, artists and free things like gifts, free access to facilities, and rooms not open to the public. For a good example, check out the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York.

, After all, that's what being a socialite is all about.



Make friends wherever you go. Whether you're at the local supermarket or at a posh event, you meet a lot of new people every day. Be friendly, appear interested in the person you're talking to, exchange phone numbers. But don't worry too much about establishing a genuine, lasting friendship with all those people. Keep your circle of close friends small, but establish superficial relationships with as many people as you can- you never know when you might need them. Remember, it's all about building a well-rounded social network; many of the ""friendships"" you'll establish will be for the sole purpose of gaining some advantages.

Better yet, befriend the right people. A little chit-chat with the local it-girl can go a long way. Having a few socialite friends will come in very handy; after all, the simplest definition of being a socialite is hanging out with other socialites.


Learn about event planning, and cultivate your taste in things like flowers, appetizers, music, etc. As a socialite, you'll be expected to throw some big, stylish events and parties. When you finally get your big break and your committee asks you to help plan some gala, this will come in handy. Reading Vogue (particularly the articles chronicling events thrown by real socialites) should help you develop this intuition. Of course, there will be a lot of people to help you plan an event, like your PR assistant, secretary and so on, but you must know how to organize them all. Get some phone numbers of service providers like caterers, decorators, DJs etc.; they're extremely useful.
Have the magical C word- charisma. Don't be a bore. It's pretty easy- just act like you're having a great time. Smile a lot, have interesting conversations with other people at parties, be lively and energetic. As you spend more time around socialites, you will learn a few tricks about charming your audience.
Be photographed next to VIPs. Photos of important people always appear in newspapers and magazines the day after an event- and you may have the chance to hit Page Six if there's someone famous next to you. But don't make it too obvious- like rushing by the closest socialite as soon as photographers enter your line of sight- that's just pathetic.
Seek real friendship with some people. You will still need someone to be there for you when you fail- someone who would not alienate you from the very moment you show them your less perfect sides.

, These specimens are immediately detected and removed from the social scene; their desperation to become a socialite can be sensed in an instant. Being tagged as a social climber is the worst thing that can happen to an aspiring socialite.


Don’t go out of your way just for meeting someone. Even if you happen to run across a VIP, don’t freak out; just be natural and treat them like you would treat any other person. If there’s someone you know from magazines or socialite blogs, but you haven’t been introduced to them, don’t say ‘hi’ to them. Doing all sorts of crazy stuff only to meet someone, like stressing out their personal assistant to make them give you their phone number, is also a big no-no.
Don’t be desperate about getting into somebody’s good graces. Putting yourself in a position of inferiority to someone would do nothing but make that someone treat you like you were inferior. Have some dignity.
Don’t auto-invite yourself to parties; this is extremely rude. Not to mention it’s very likely that the bodyguards will never let you in without an invitation, but as soon as the host notices you, you’ll be out of there in an instant; and you can say goodbye forever to other parties and events.

, Do your best to keep your public image clean. No sex tapes, no drugs, no controversial divorces, no public breakdowns and scenes. Be respectable and mind your morals. Stay cool and collected even when you’re raging mad. If someone did something bad to you, find a civilized way to deal with the situation.

, Some people are very mean and catty, but don’t let yourself be affected by what they say. Remember that scandal Olivia Palermo was dragged into, which led to the closing of Socialite Rank? Her reputation was ruined soon after that, but she managed to end the charade by revealing the identity of those behind the bitchy, malicious socialite blog Socialiterank.com and defend her public image.


Sometimes it's better not to reveal some things from your past (only if you're 100% sure they're not going to be discovered anyway). Don't give gossipers more material, so they can say more mean things about you. Of course, we're talking here about innocent little things that may get misinterpreted. If, for example, you had a nose job when you were still young and unknown, don't talk about it, if you don't want people to go like, ""She's totally fake; just another manufactured beauty"".
The best way to bring gossipers to silence is to laugh it off and admit that you’re not perfect (even if society expects you to). By acting like that, you’ll gain many admirers and you’ll still be able to walk with your head held high, no matter what is said about you.

, In a world as superficial and materialistic as that of socialites, it's very easy to forget who you really are and where you come from. Whenever you feel like it, take a break and unwind, to avoid turning into a very shallow person. Always keep in mind your personal values.

, This will save you from having to dig through your closet, or search for that homework assignment in the morning.

, Choose your outfit and even your underclothes for the next day. Get into a habit of doing this every night.


A lot of time in the mornings is easily wasted by just rummaging and looking for clothes, so save some time by simply picking out the outfit that you want to wear the night before.

, This is an ideal way to relax at night, warm yourself up (or cool down) and be clean or the next day.

, Pack what can be packed into the lunchbox and keep perishables in the refrigerator for grabbing quickly the next morning.

, Pack the bag the night before so that there is no last minute rush.

, If you want to sleep in, get up 15 minutes prior to the time that you have to leave for school. Right when you hear your alarm go off, jump out of bed and make the bed (this should take about half a minute).


Get up at least one hour early if you want extra free time.

, Dash to the bathroom and get dressed, brush your hair, brush your teeth, put on makeup, etc. Allow about three to four minutes for this.


Gently scrub your face in circular motions before rinsing with warm water.
Poor brushing can result in tooth decay, enamel loss, and cavities, so make sure to do a good job!

, Give yourself about 5 to 6 minutes.


An alternative is to take fruit, energy bars and a toasted sandwich to eat as you leave or travel

, Or if you have extra time, chill before you leave, but try to be at the bus stop at least 5 minutes before the bus is ready to pick you up.

, You don't have to use foundation, just skip to concealer! Warm it up in between your fingers (make sure to wash them well first though!) and then apply to the needed areas around your face; acne, pimples, redness, scars, under eye circles, etc.

, Take a matte brown eyeshadow with a soft fluffy brush and outline your eye crease with it. If you have trouble finding where your crease is, just poke around your eye socket until you find it. Blend out, tapering the ends slightly. This will make your eyes appear larger.

, Take a white or peach (peach is better for school, it looks more softer), and outline your waterline; it makes you look more awake and alert.Taking a liquid black eyeliner, put a thin line on the upper lash line. Remember, less is more. You don't want to end up with raccoon eyes!

, Using an eyelash curler, curl your eyelashes. Then, swipe on a coat of mascara. Work from one eye to the next, and wait for it to dry completely before adding another coat of mascara, or else you run the risk of it clumping.

, The great thing about this is that you can double up the lipstick as blush too. Choose a light peachy or coral color (no shimmers or glitters) and apply this to your lips. Then, taking a large blush brush, carefully dab it onto the lipstick bullet and apply it to the apples of your cheeks. It will instantly give you a rosy and healthily looking glow.

, Maybe your concealer slipped, or your lipstick rubbed off on your teeth. Now is the time to fix it.

Get an alarm clock (if you don't already have one). You could get a radio alarm clock and set it to your favorite station so you can wake up to your favorite song. Plus it's a lot less annoying than waking up to a buzzing alarm clock. It's true! Don't put your alarm clock by your bed, put it on a dresser or on any surface that's not close to your bed. That way you have to get up out of bed to turn it off.;
, (this is especially important if this is a rule in your home)it will also make you feel more organized. This is not time consuming if done right. You don't have to make your bed perfectly, just fix the blankets/ sheets, and neatly place pillows on top. This also helps in keeping you up, and not crawling back under the covers to sleep in longer.

, In the mornings you don't need to take hour long showers. Showers should take up to 10-15 minutes. Wash your hair and body, shave if necessary, and wash your face. After you're done apply a moisturizer (suited to your skin type) to your face and use body lotion for the rest of you! Also comb your hair.

, Nobody wants to look at gross yellow teeth or smell bad breath! Use mouth wash as well, bring along some breath mints or gum (if you're allowed to in school).

, Even though you're trying to be fast DO NOT skip breakfast. Eat a piece of fruit, a bowl of healthy cereal or a piece of toast - if you really need to get out the door grab a granola bar.

, Less really is more, all you really need is mascara and/ or eyeliner (optional). A light colored eyeshadow, light blush, chapstick (keep your lips soft and smooth) and lip gloss; if you have a really bad zit then use cover-up.

, If you want your hair to be straight, straighten it before bed and touch up in the morning. If you want your hair to be curly, wet your hair and braid it before bed. Or you could sleep in rollers. If you don't want your hair to get sweaty and messed up,wear a shower cap or something similar when you wake up. Undo the braids or take out the rollers and spray lightly with hair spray and mousse if your hair is really straight and doesn't curl easy.

, As soon as you get out of the shower, or when you first get up, stretch, take your PJ's off, put on deodorant, get dressed and spray yourself lightly with sweet light smelling perfume or body spray. There you're dressed quick!

, Put your shoes on and be on your way to school.

, When you do this again in the morning it won't be so tangled. If you don't want to take shower in the morning or if want to take a bath, now is the time! If you do it the night before, you can also shave if you need to.

, Now you just need to set your alarm, probably at least half an hour before you need to leave for school. If you tend to fall back asleep after you hit the off button, try moving it across the room so you're forced to get up in order to turn it off again.

, Get in your pajamas, get in bed, make sure your clock is set and get ready for a new day by getting a good night's rest.

Use your status positively.",How to Become a Celebrity," There are lots of different kinds of celebrities from singers and actors to bloggers, fiction writers, humanitarians, models, or, even, chefs. To become a celebrity, you have to pick an area to become a celebrity in. Simply 'being a celebrity' isn't going to get you very far, as it is too vague a goal to work towards.


It's also good to decide whether you're looking for that 15 minutes of fame or whether you want your celebrity to be a lifelong endeavor. The former is easier to accomplish, but won't give you much lasting power. The latter takes time and effort to accomplish, but will last much longer.;
, If you're wanting to be a celebrity at something, you're going to have to work at it until you're at a level that makes people want to invest in you. While it's true that celebrities aren't always the best at what they do, they still tend to be good at it, whether it's acting, singing, writing, or cooking.Put in 1 hour every day at your chosen field. This will help get you focused on your creative endeavor and keep you focused towards your goal, which is having people know you and your work.

, There is a lot of the same old same old out there, and it is true that copy cats can become well known (think the many copy cats of books like Twilight or Harry Potter), but it's the original product that is remembered the best.


This means, you can use the work of others as a jumping off place. You'll need to add your own flare, or individuality to what you're presenting. For example: if you want to write a vampire novel, that's great! But instead of copying the Anne Rice or Twilight formula of pretty immortal vampires, come up with something unusual about your vampires, something that readers will be intrigued by and remember.
Being creative basically means having something that people will remember, because it stands out. Of course, this can backfire if you're too focused on complete originality (there is no such thing), but you should tease out what specific and original thing you have to offer, because that will help when you're selling your project.

, You need to see what is popular in your chosen field to know how to market yourself so that people want to see you and you'll get a good idea the things you want to avoid and the things you want to emulate.


See how those celebrities got famous. Chances are, however, you won't see all the background work that went into getting them to their celebrity status, but you will be able to see where they started.
For example: a lot of celebrities talk about their early years and what they did to further their careers. Study how and where they got the break that allowed them to become a celebrity and how much work they had to do simply to get to that place.

, Part of becoming a celebrity is about who you know and who is helping you achieve your goal. This doesn't necessarily mean befriending a celebrity, but it is good to find someone in the industry to act as a sort of mentor, to help you avoid pitfalls.


You'll want to hire, or at least speak with a marketing professional, since a lot of getting famous comes through marketing yourself and you'll want, if possible, to have an expert's opinion on how best to market yourself.
You really will want to acquire a mentor of some sort, someone who has experience with the area in which you're interested in becoming a celebrity. For example: if you're wanting to become a published (and celebrity) author, seek advice from other writers.
Look around your city or town and see if there are others who are going for the same goal and work to help one another out.

, This is a version of you, since you don't want to pretend to be someone else, but a more idealized version of you. It's the person who you'll be publicly and which you'll capitalize on when you're marketing yourself.


Basically, there are two different people in this equation. There's the real you, which is fallible, imperfect and then there's the idealized you (which is the one that you're going to be selling). The idealized you is perfect, amazing and awesome.
The times when you need to use this image are when you're selling yourself and your product (book, singing, cooking, etc.) to others, whether it's the general public or a publisher or music producers. Just remember, the idealized you only needs to be on for a short period of time, and then you can go back to being your usual self.

, This is the big one, because if you can't market yourself you're not going to be a celebrity. People who make celebrity status are the ones who create an image and then know how to effectively sell that image to whatever industry they want to be part of, as well as to the general public.Explain why you're unique. Part of marketing yourself is to show why people should be interested in you. What is it about your work and your presence that people should like.
Be persistent. Marketing yourself means being visible and being visible means you have to keep marketing yourself. For example: if your book keep getting rejected from publishers, submit things (like short stories) to literary magazines to get writing credits that will help your writer's image.
Before you can go on big media circuits to the Daily Show or Ellen, you'll need to set yourself up on local t.v. and radio, so that people will be able to see that you're a good person to interview and that you are providing interesting and unique product. When you've gotten yourself set up in whatever it is you want to become a celebrity in, contact your local news outlets and let them know what you're doing. Again, be persistent. If they aren't immediately interested, keep doing what you're doing and keep letting them know what you're up to.

, Social media and the Internet have helped a lot of people gain some amount of celebrity (or notoriety) and so it's definitely an avenue you want to consider when you're attempting to become a celebrity. While it's probably not best to rely on social media alone, it can definitely help.One of the most important aspects of social media is having a constant internet presence. Set up a website that showcases your talents. Get on YouTube and create a vlog. Become part of the Tumblr and Twitter communities. You can talk about things other than your talent (and should because otherwise people will lose interest). You want to create an interest in you, so make sure you're using the idealized you, because you are still marketing yourself in these interactions.
Look at people who have achieved fame through social media (especially through youtube) and consider what they did and how they did it. Justin Bieber is one of the most obvious ones, as he was discovered through his youtube videos, but again it was perseverance and talent (he does have musical talent) that helped cement what he created by putting himself out there.
Another example could be John Green who does youtube videos back and forth with his brother Hank Green, but who has also become a bestselling author. He created the groundwork to delve into writing because he already had a following and had already, in a sense, proved that his image was marketable. Proving yourself marketable through social media, can greatly help your marketability in the long-term.

, A good way to break into a field is to have someone who is already a success in that. It isn't easy to just 'make friends' with a celebrity, since a ton of people are already trying that.


Approach them in a public setting, if you can. For actors, or writers, there are workshops and panels that they sit on for events that you can attend and meet them. You can also connect with a lot of celebrities through social media, where you can ask them for advice.
Sometimes it's good if you have a moment with them to ask for tips on how they got to where they are. Many people are happy to share their advice and their experiences with someone who is interested.

, One you've achieved your celebrity status, you'll want to keep a hold of it. A good way to do that is to change things up. Experiment with different ideas and options.


Do more than one thing. If you're a singer, for example, try out dancing or modeling or acting. Branch out into comedy. Utilize these things in your music.

, Your fans are the ones who got you to the place you're at, through their own devotion to you and by passing the word about you along to other people. Treat them with respect. Thank them in interviews and in person.


Consider occasionally releasing something free for them (a free story download, or a free song).
If someone (especially a fan) offers criticism of whatever you're doing, don't get angry at them. Instead, if it's abusive, respond appropriately by blocking them or having the authorities deal with them (this can mean something like the admins on Twitter, etc; it doesn't necessarily mean the police), and if it's not abusive, respectfully engage the person to find out where they are coming from.

, If you've become a celebrity it means that a lot of people are watching you and learning from you and taking what you say as the gospel. There's a lot of responsibility that comes with making that sort of impression on a large group of people.


Organize and participate in fundraisers for good causes (ending hunger, making sure everyone has access to health care and clean water, ending slavery, and sex trafficking). Give money to these causes
Raise awareness for these issues through social media and through your own work.

Go on vacation with your friends, go to the mall, hang out all the time (don't let it get in the way of your schoolwork, though, dumb girls aren't popular, even if they look good), go to the movies, go everywhere with them, but make sure you're having fun with them.

, Wash your hair every second day. If your hair gets dry, wash it a little less often. Always brush your hair, and keep a brush in your bags and locker. Mix up the dos. Don't wear your hair the same every day. Wash your face every day, use astringent and zit-zapping cream. Have basic hygiene, do your nails, wash your face and shower every day.

Not only does healthy eating and exercise make you look better, but you feel better and more energetic, too.#

, Shower daily, wear deodorant and a little perfume, wash your face and teeth, and keep your hair and face nice. Don't overdo it, though. A ton of hairspray and makeup is OBVIOUS and definitely not attractive. Keep your nail looking fresh with clear nail polish or a color of your choice. Don't wear anything crazy like bright orange or olive green, or yellow. Wear makeup like tinted moisturizer, mascara, eyeshadow, bronzer, blush and lip gloss.

, If you are a rude, stuck up brat, all of this will be in vain. No one likes a snob. So be nice to everyone, forgive and forget, and don't start stuff. That is just immature.

, There are many places to shop that have great prices and amazing clothes. Aeropostale, Tilly's, Wet Seal, Forever21, Macy's, Charlotte Russe, Papaya, Kohls, and Marshalls are just a few. Try not to buy clothes with store name on them, though, unless it is like a sweatshirt or something. You will just look like a walking advertisement, and that comes of as pretty shallow. Things like V-necks, Daisy Dukes (wear them comfortably), gladiator sandals, blazers, nice jeans, short jean skirt (make them look comfortable), Hollister or Aeropostale T-shirts, and accessories are acceptable. Get tips from Seventeen, Teen Vogue, or Cosmo Girl. Do not dress out of your comfort zone when it comes to heels, showing skin, makeup, jewelry etc. If you are 13 or older, don't wear shirts with words (Princess, Angel, Happy Bunny, etc....) or those screen shirts with the silly phrases on them. You're kind of too old for that. Be tasteful, and wear clean, nice, yet laid back clothes. Again, be yourself.

, People will see RIGHT through your act and they will just think you're weird.

, If your hair isn't brushed, teeth yellow or with food between them, bad breath, smelly, or sweaty and greasy, there is no way to be posh unless these problems are fixed.

, Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy/posh. T-shirts and sweatpants will not cut it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or some designer. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some ""minor designer"" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Massimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work.

, Excellent presentation is half of the battle. Wear clothing and accessories which flatter your body and never wear anything you feel uncomfortable in. It is important to remember that modesty is key in earning the respect of others. A bit of cleavage may be fashionable, but true gentlemen will appreciate modesty more than exposure.

, A serious, dull person is about as posh as a plank of wood. How exciting. Always be charming and outgoing to people you wish to be friends with.

, If you cannot think of anything, the insults will come depending on the person. Always be nice to other people, unless you have something against them.

, When necessary, voice your opinions appropriately and constructively. This encourages your audience to listen carefully when you speak.

, Extremely low necklines, too short skirts, belly-bearing tops and revealing clothing can make a girl look like she does not respect her body and herself. Shirts with inappropriate sayings, logos or sexual innuendos can make a girl look like she's desperate for attention. The posh are not desperate for attention.

, It will annoy people and cause friend loss.

, Even if you trust someone, you never know if they will go and blow it out of proportion.

, It can be hard, but think of how you would be rather posh than snobby. Plus snobs aren't as well rounded as the posh clan.

, This is very important. Posh people have good manners and know the boundaries in human relations. They know not to tread on toes but equally they know how to upbraid people who do tread on toes. Manners are a form of currency for the posh person and the more you know of them, the better. Start with Emily Post if you haven't a clue yet.

, Posh people are not materialistic - that easily becomes garish and common. Rather, posh people seek out quality and style whatever it may be - a handbag, a house, a car. Buy the best that your money can afford and go without the trinkets.

, The same for your body - buy good quality food to nourish yourself. Posh people respect themselves.

, Never over-eat and never over-indulge. Posh people know their limits and respect them; especially since respect in the eyes of others is also very important for a posh person.

, Don't copy them precisely but do allow their way of being, their style and attitudes have some influence on yours. That way, you can build a strong foundation on which to become a posh person in your own right.

, It is wise to become politically, culturally, and religiously aware. Even the most basic knowledge can save a person from embarrassment and awkwardness. If you know in advance that you will be spending time with someone of an unfamiliar background, it is a good idea to do more in-depth research to avoid embarrassing aux pas.

, Do not berate yourself, but be receptive to constructive change. In our world, change is inevitable. Be a positive and flexible part of it and show others the way as well. Face life rather than burying your head in the sand and others will know instinctively that you are someone whose opinion counts.

, As difficult as it can be to heed the advice of those more experienced than yourself, it is a necessary step at times. No matter your age or ability, allow yourself to learn from the mistakes and victories of those older or more experienced than you. You will win their favor and be available to pass on your own wisdom or advice.

, Posh girls leave their surroundings in a condition at least as good as they found them. Unless they are in a restaurant with wait staff whose job it is to do the clearing up, classy people insist on taking care of their own trash and baggage, not expecting others to pick up after them. And when others do favors for them, while stuck-up or spoiled people assume it's only to be expected and ignore others' assistance, truly posh people are quick to notice and to express their gratitude and their appreciation. Also if you drop a silverware, don't count on the waitress to pick it up and replace it. Simply pick it up and put it to the side If you want or need a new one politely ask for a clean one. If the waiter asks you why, then explain why.

, These serve to confirm that one ""seeks wisdom"", that one is ""open to personal development"" and ""knowledgeable and aware"" . However, it is also posh to get bad grades when one spends ones time pursuing a posh pastime instead of studying. But be careful as that can also make one spoiled. Appearing spoiled cancels out poshness quicker than one can possibly imagine.

, An appreciation of popular culture is important but a knowledge of gossip and rumour surrounding famous people only serves as confirmation that one is so far from being posh that one has wasted ones time reading this much of the article.

, Posh people have a large vocabulary and know when to employ it. However, posh people never force words into sentences that don't belong.

, Truly posh people instinctively recoil at the thought of inconveniencing others, offending them, getting in other peoples' way, or in any way making nuisances of themselves. The posh are all about minding their own business when among strangers and putting others at ease when in social situations. Truly posh people are gracious and affable to everyone, whether the CEO, the mail carrier, or the custodian. The posh know others' names and use them when greeting people they see regularly, whether the doorman, the security guard, or the boss' wife. The posh treat everyone the same - with courtesy and respect.

Something other than stamp collecting .Good hobbies are sewing,creative writing,most sports(with the exception of rarely heard of sports),and music. Try to have at least 3 or 4 interesting hobbies.;
, DON'T go around saying 'hi' to everyone like a maniac. Just try being nice more often. For example, if you have the same classes with someone, yet don't know his/her name, go up to them and say, ""Hey, we have the same classes don't we? What's your name?"" and smile very politely.

, Such as the popular group, the smart kids, the skater dudes, surfer dudes...everyone. Try to open up a bit and accept people for who they are. Not everyone is like you. And they'll very much appreciate it if you don't judge them just by who they talk to or what they look like. People will find you very unique and fun if you get along with all types of people. :) Just avoid bullies and girls who gossip too much.(But still treat them nicely, just don't hang out with them)

, Please, do not wear black lipstick, black eyeliner, black eye shadow and all that if you're a natural bubbly person. (Nothing against people who wear all black). Dress like how YOU feel. But don't show up to school looking like a hooker. That will open you up to a new set of problems. If you're more of a girly girl, try showing that more by your clothes. I know appearance isn't everything. But it does play a huge role in inviting people in. I mean, who would think that a girl who wears sweat pants (even though they're super comfy) and over sized t-shirts, interesting (or even attractive)? Just make sure you dress appropriately yet fun. Don't wear too much makeup. For middle school, use clear concealer for bags\ zits\ red spots, a blush one shade lighter than your skin tone, eyeshadow one shade darker than your skin tone, and clear lipgloss. For high school, use the same thing but with brown\ clear mascara, brown eyeliner. Both middle schoolers and high schoolers can curl their eyelashes.

, Trying to be ""interesting"" doesn't mean you have to change yourself at all. You're just trying to find the fun side of you.

, Just because you have new friends, doesn't mean you have to be rude to another person or dismiss them at all. Be polite, kind and help anyone in need when you can.

, They were the ones who always stuck with you. Be sure not to instantly ditch them. They should still be your friends.

, Take up new things. If you're good at volleyball, try swimming. You wouldn't want to be good at just one thing would ya? It's always good to have at least 2 things you are really good at. Everyone needs to have something to say at the end of the day new.

, Always! Have a shower every day. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Make sure you smell awesome all the time. Brush your hair neatly, cut your nails. Wash your face with face scrub.

, Music is the main thing. EVERYONE likes music. However, different people like different things, so find the type of music you like.

, How cool is that? You're one of the most awesome, most interesting girl in school And you get good grades. Make your parents proud, hon. People respect you more if you are smart.

, You should go to parties have fun, learn to have a good time, but, don't lose control and become a party animal. Remember not to be a party pooper either.

, We all know that a group of friends includes a circle of drama. Try not to get caught up in that drama. If you do, this may lead to losing some good friends.

Ladies: if you want to wear makeup, learn how and do so. Red lipstick is very sophisticated. Otherwise, just wash your face daily. When picking out your clothing for the day, know what looks good on you. It helps to be stylish, but stylish does not mean anything if the article of clothing does not look attractive on you. Avoid men's clothes because they will make you look sloppy and very unrefined.
Men: Avoid women's clothes and shirts that are too tight. Even if you want to show off your muscles, it's not sophisticated.
Both: Shower daily. Wear deodorant. When picking out your clothing for the day, know what looks good on you. It helps to be stylish, but stylish does not mean anything if the article of clothing does not look attractive on you.;
, Sophistication requires you to never be tired-looking. Hold your head up high, pull your shoulders slightly back, smile and straighten your back! You should not tire yourself out, but it is important to have good posture if you want to be sophisticated.

, If you have your ears pierced, wear earrings every day. If not, then wear other simple necklaces, rings, bracelets, that match your outfit. Keep it simple!


Men: It's best to not wear any jewelry other than a watch.

, Some adults will put on airs, others will become your best friends. Keep that in mind. With children, act interested in what is going on in their lives, such as: what sports do they play, how is school going, etc.

, Refrain from running around, screaming, waving your arms wildly if you see someone you know. A cool wave and a smile will do the trick.

, Nothing too juvenile or revealing is appropriate. For example, if the occasion is formal, dress in formal attire.

, Tidy your room often. You will no longer stress out at the last minute looking for something. Once every month, go through your room and look through the things that you don't need and throw them out. If you have a hard time with this, then every day before you go to school, make sure your floor is cleared and no clothes or anything is on there. Step by step you will get to a perfect room.

, Always arrive at your destination at least ten minutes before you are supposed to be there. Wake up early. People will not take you seriously if you are late to things. You are letting people, as well as their expectations, down.

, Learn proper dining etiquette and use your utensils properly. Learn when to begin eating when seated with a group. Also learn to host a group through proper ordering, tipping, and especially leading good conversation throughout your meal.

, People want to be around someone who is polite. You don't have to be politically correct, just polite. People want to know how you feel about things. Don't spend an hour long meal on small talk, but don't skip small talk.

, Arrogance, condescension and false superiority are turn-offs to people who might otherwise want to be your friend.

, About the hair:


Ladies: Styling your hair is a must. If your hair needs more body, buy voluminous products and become friends with your hairspray bottle. If you have wavy hair and want straight or curly, scrunch it or straighten, although many wavy hair types are pretty by themselves. Curly hair needs to be frizz-less, so buy smoothing products that enhance your curls but fight the frizz. Keep your hair no longer than the middle of the back, as longer hair than that is tacky.
Men: Keep your hair neat. If your hair is prone to cowlicks, it may be best to keep it short if you are trying to look sophisticated. Don't let your hair grow longer than shoulder length, even if you think it will look good.
Both men and women: Avoid dying your hair any unnatural color or too bright of a natural color. Pretty frequent example: If you have a dark complexion, avoid dying your hair blonde as it would look very fake. And always comb your hair.

,, Carry extra money with you. If you have a cell phone, always make sure that it's fully charged. You never know when you will be stuck in a situation where you are stuck on your own. You will be very thankful that you brought your cell phone with you.

, If you absolutely have to receive a message or take a call, excuse yourself from the group and proceed privately.

Whatever YOU are truly good at. Use this and flaunt it. So tell those jokes, write for the school paper, get that trendy new purse, and post Facebook pictures of that new drawing.;
, When you smile, you automatically attract people. Smile all the time, but know when to stop. Never smile so much that it looks fake.

, You don't have to buy Hollister or Abercrombie to dress nicely. Actually, it will make you look like a big wannabe. It's best to stay away from shirts with huge logos on them. People will only think you are trying to be cool, which you don't want. Instead, wear clean and well fitting clothes. Go to secondhand shops and pick out unique pieces like leather belts or pretty rings, but stay away from anything TOO out there. Dress clean, fresh and well put together until you make new friends. THEN you can experiment with crazy fashion.

, Aside from making sure your clothes are washed and not wrinkled, you need to make sure your hygiene is up to par too. Have a shower every 1-2 days depending on if your hair gets greasy or oily often. Scrub with soap or body wash everywhere, even behind your ears. Make sure you shampoo and condition your hair as well. Make sure you also wash and moisturize your face once in the morning and once at night every day with a cleanser that will not hurt sensitive skin. I would try Cetaphil. Cut your nails so they are not too long and make sure you get rid of all the gross dirt underneath them. Paint them a pretty pink or coral if you are a girl. Put on a body lotion that smells like the perfume or cologne that you are going to apply after so that it will smell nice like that all day. Girls should curl their eyelashes and apply mascara and a bit of lip balm and blush and cover up if you have zits, but NO MORE. You want to look pretty and presentable but still natural and pretty. No heavy black make-up. This will scare the popular kids off! However, do not wear any make-up unless you know how to. Ask your mom or an aunt or simply go to the make-up counter at a drugstore and ask them to show you how. They will be happy to help. :)

, Do not go up to people telling them how great you are at whatever. People will think you are arrogant and will not like being around you. Instead, just join clubs and submit pieces to newspapers or enter talent shows to discreetly show off your talent.

, Post flattering pictures of you and delete ugly ones, but do not make a big deal about it. Post a picture of your new painting. ""Like"" that funny comedian. Post a status update about your shopping trip to New York. But don't get obsessed. Only update once every 2 days, otherwise you will look super weird.

, People love to talk about themselves. Ask them their favorite hobbies, colors, music, sports, and stores. Practice on less popular people and then work your way up

, He or she is most likely not a queen bee or football captain but is one of the main popular people. Slowly befriend them and flatter them. Compliment them on their cool cell phone or pretty eyeshadow. If they ask about you, tell them about what your hobby is. If it is humor, LET IT SHINE. After you have known him/her for a while and they seem to like you, invite them to the movies or mall or even over to your house as long as it will not be boring. Keep up with this friendship, but do not seem like a stalker! If things get awkward, back out of it slowly. You should only ask to hang out with him/her after knowing them for a week and talking to them at least 5 times.

, One day ask your new friend to invite some of his friends to the pool or bowling or even a movie. They will surely bring them along. This is your time to show what a unique and great person you are. Make another new friend at this group outing by finding the next nicest person and joking around and complimenting them a few times. But don't cling to them. Just make sure that you've complimented them or joked with them once or twice. Make sure it's natural. Make friends with this new friend over time just like you did with the first friend. Eventually you will be accepted into this new popular group!

, Keep up with this new group by sitting with them at lunch, texting occasionally and inviting them over. Don't lose touch.

, When the popular kids have practices for sports, work on your talent at the same time they are practicing. It will give you something to do and your friends will love to see your progress.

, Come to their games occasionally but maybe ask if you can before just showing up. It might make them nervous. But if they say you can go, go! Watch the game and cheer for them. Don't get too excited or you may be kicked out or embarrass your friend. After the game ask if they want to go for ice cream to celebrate the big win. Compliment their great spike or shot or goal or touchdown or whatever. If they lost, say that the other team must have cheated in a joking way.

, Just a little. Smile at the opposite sex. For girls: Say things like ""Oh Bobby, football has really done something good for you. Take a look at those biceps!"". Giggle at their jokes. Gently touch them. For boys: Say that the girl has pretty hair or that the color of her shirt brings out her eyes. Laugh at their jokes. If the person you are gently flirting with looks uncomfortable or walks away, do not flirt with them again.

Carry yourself well.,
Be the expert.,
Talk like a snob.,
Avoid certain duties.",How to Be Snobby1," Always watch your posture. This means walking with your head up, shoulders back and direct eye contact. Gliding into a room with this attitude will immediately send an air of superiority.


For ladies, wearing heels helps create the image. By towering over others, you will seem better than them as they will be forced to look up to you.;
, All great snobs know everything, of course. Even without formal training or education in a given subject, you can offer up a poignant thought on anything from wine to classical music. Avoid considering anyone else’s thoughts, ideas and feelings on a topic. Use terms like avant-garde and noir to make yourself sound more intelligent.
Question why others didn’t ask your advice when making a particular decision. , You have a personal rating scale that you use for everything: people, vacation spots, happy hour locations, etc. and it’s foolproof. Be sure to let everyone know where each thing falls on your snob-o-meter. How else will they know that you’re right and they’re wrong? When sharing your thoughts, be sure to include words like “should” and “always.”
Dazzle those around you with as many off-the-cuff responses as possible. Keeping them on their toes will ensure your snob status.

, Proclaim with all the confidence you can muster that you simply don’t do certain things. Everyone should understand that you are above manual labor like scrubbing the dishes and yanking weeds from the garden. Even at work, you huff and puff when someone suggests that you make a breakfast run or fix the copy machine…even if it is in your job description.


You can do this by just refusing. Sooner or later, they will stop asking.

"
"
Skip uncool establishments.,
Order with flair.,
Buy high-end groceries.",How to Be Snobby2," Using every trick in the book, coerce those around you to only visit the spots you deem worthy of your presence. There are a lot of exceptional places to choose from but if you didn’t think of it, it’s not good enough.


Consider using tactics like pouting to manipulate those around you into caving in.
Throw out words like ""Tacky"" and ""Gross"" to convey your utter disdain.

, Whether a 5-star restaurant or a local coffee shop, you must have everything just so. You can’t imagine simply ordering straight from the menu without any substitutions or chef recommendations. Don’t hold back when ordering either. Ask the waiter where the ingredients were flown in from and when. You expect the most natural, organic and freshest at all times. Find out how the fish or steak will be prepared and insist it be to perfection.


If you don’t like something, send it back immediately.
Tell the staff you won’t pay for the meal if you are really feeling feisty. You shouldn’t have to fork over cash for something that was sub-par.

, Like all things in your life, your supermarket is just another extension of your awesomeness. Snobs don’t shop at places like Walmart. They prefer the niche supermarkets where employees are dressed to impressed and the floors sparkle. Only frequent a store where your ever whim can be catered to. This means, if they don’t have your favorite item, they’ll order it and deliver it to your front door. Anything less is unacceptable. "
"
Purchase only the finest.,
Buy a trendy item first.,
Dress like success.",How to Be Snobby3," There isn’t a snob alive that would be caught shopping locally, in their home town, no matter how high fashion it may be. Instead, take shopping trips. Pour over fashion magazines, websites and blogs for ideas. Pack your bags and jet. Don’t forget to bring along an empty suitcase for all the great finds.
Download a currency conversion app for your trip too. This will help you ensure you stay on budget…if you even have one.

, You MUST have the latest and greatest before anyone else. If you are a tech snob, make sure you pre-order the newest iPad to hit the market. More of a sneaker person? Have your friend who works at the retail store to set a pair (or two) aside before it even hits the shelves.


Be sure to boast to those around you about how sweet the new item is and that you can’t believe they don’t have one and have to wait in line.

, Snobs always look like money from the top to the bottom. Make sure you wear pricey sunglasses, perfume/cologne, shoes, etc. You can still come across as a snob even without the funds. It’s all about how people perceive you. You can accomplish this by leaving tags on a few items in your closet. It will give the illusion that you have cash to blow.
Take tips from those you admire like athletes and musicians and copy their style.
Watch to make sure you don’t see your favorite accessory all over town. If you do, toss it!

"
"
Be rude to others.,
Dismiss wait staff and other “help.” These peasants are the lowest of the low in your opinion.,
Schmooze with the elite.",How to Be Snobby4," Don’t waste any time trying to get to know new people. You can tell right away that they are beneath you and far less cultured. Showing them respect is unnecessary. You can really show off how snobby you are by pointing out their lower-class behavior.


Say things like, “I can’t believe you hold your wine glass by the bowl, instead of the stem. Where do you come from?”

, You often find the perfect way to put them in their place and display your impressive knowledge of their field, all at the same time.


When ordering, roll your eyes, scoff or barely make eye contact. Launch into a rant about how you wouldn’t dare drink a non-craft beer. This will help them understand who they are dealing with.

, Hanging with this crowd is where you feel most comfortable and at home, but they still have a lot to learn from you. While rubbing elbows with these folks, interrupt as often as possible to show off.


Drop lots of names you know will impressive them during the conversation.
One up them with each story they tell. For example, “Oh, you spent summer in upstate New York?” “That’s so over. I prefer northern Italy.”
Prove you understand the societal hierarchy. You can illustrate this by pointing out someone’s cheap shoes or banged up car. “Can you imagine leaving the house with that?” will be a staple statement in your verbal arsenal.

Do your ""homework"" on fashion.,
While you are doing your ""homework"", keep a journal with all of the looks and clothes that you like.,
Check out the items of clothing, jewellery, accessories, etc that you already have and see if there is anything that you can use.,
Have good hygiene.,
Buy some stylish clothing based on the information in your journal.,
Get a unique or cool hairstyle that suits you.,
Don't forget to accessorize and wear good shoes.,
Put every thing together.,
Now that you are a fashionista, keep up with the trends but remember to always be you!",How to Become a Fashionista," When you don't study, you don't know about it well enough! Not for school in this case, but instead you need to study up on fashion. Start with the magazines lying around your house, even if they aren't completely about fashion. For example, does your mom have a magazine like All You, Canadian Living, or Women's World? These have some advice on fashion, despite it not being solely about fashion. As long as the magazines are from this year or somewhat current, they are a good place to start. Find tips on what is new and what staples from your own closet you can use. Look for the pieces that you see multiple times, because then you will know they are in style. Another place to look is online. There is a great site is called Hel-looks. It shows street styles from Helsinki, Finland. Street style is a great place to find inspiration. Even if you just type in Street Style in Google, you can find some good sites, like the cool hunter. Finally, watch shows on TV that are based on fashion. Shows on the Style Channel are good, but they can sometimes be geared towards older women so be careful.;
, Jot down pieces of clothing, colors and outfits that you like. Separate them into things that you own and things that you want to add to your wardrobe. Use pictures from magazines or words. This will be where you base your new look.

, Keep in mind that you cannot change you style overnight. Also, you want to incorporate you personal style into what is in fashion. If you are ""preppy"" mix your blazer or polo with a funky skirt . If you wear a plain T-shirt every day, try to layer them with a cardigan or add some cool jewelry or an interesting scarf.

, Think about this: A fashionista wants others to notice a cool girl with a killer sense of style, not an acne face. Smell nice too by using perfume and deodorant. Take care of yourself. Also, remember that you don't need makeup to be a fashionista.

, Go out and find some new pieces to add to your closet. Here, you have to take into account your financial situation. If you can't or are not willing to spend a lot on clothes, then thrift stores like Goodwill or Plato's Closet, or stores like Target or Walmart are a great places to get started. When shopping second hand try to find clothes that are in good condition and are good quality. Also, keep in mind you can alter a long dress and make it a fun mini just by hemming it. So, if you find something you like have an open mind and you can always alter it. If you are willing to spend a lot more, try out Urban Outfitters, Aeropostale, American Eagle, Hollister, or Anthropologie. Ask someone whose style you admire where they shop and if you are friendly with them see if they could help you with your new look. A common love of fashion is a great way to make new friends. If money is of no concern to you, then get a stylist. However, remember that there is no need to splurge all on one outing. Keep your eyes out for pieces you need and you will begin to accumulate some great clothes.

, Ask your hairdresser for what you'd look good in. You could also wear your hair in different ways everyday. Be sure to know what your face shape is however. The some of the different face shapes are oval, square, heart, pear, round, oblong/rectangular, and triangular. After you know your face shape, then you can do your hair.

, A great necklace can complete a look. Before going out ask yourself whether your outfit is missing something or if there is too much. Also, shoes can completely change your outfit, so make sure your look is put together with a great pair of shoes. If you want to go for something sort of casual but really cool and put together, use flats. Try flip-flops for a casual, summery outfit. For a formal outfit, try heels. If heels scare you, try a low espadrille, because they will stay on and usually are pretty comfortable.

, Go back to the journal you made earlier and try to put together some new looks. Find a full length mirror and just try on lots of things until you find some outfits you like. Don't be afraid to step out of the box - fashion is all about doing something new and being the first to try something.

, You don't want to just be a trend follower. Also try to be a trend setter! Good luck!

You can achieve this by going through a yearbook, writing down people around you and looking them up online, or just paying attention to the order in which people are.;
, This means people that aren't considering dorks and people are aren't considered really popular. These people are usually nice but some can be clingy which is okay for now. Just make friends with at least three of these people. They usually have one semi-popular or popular friend. If your friend has negative attention because of the way they dress (too revealing maybe), act (maybe they eat like a pig), or something else you might want to stay away from being a best friend forever of them. Still be a friend, just not a super close one. Making these friends is super important in working your way up. Still don't be artificial with these friends. Get to know them and make them really good root friends that you can always turn to.

, You pass by hundreds of people a day.  How do you know if that person has the same interests as you; how do you know if you're meant to be friends? You guessed it; you don't. So just don't be afraid to put yourself out there and just maybe share some of your opinions with this person and compliment them. Try to casually figure out if you like the same sports teams, movie stars, or musicians without asking too many questions, and you can bond over that.

, If you want to be popular fast, it's important to be engaging when you talk to people and to make casual small talk. Ask people questions, smile and be friendly, and don't worry about people not liking you. The more people you know and talk to, the more popular you'll become. Do this quickly to be popular as fast as you can.

, As you get to know people more, you will spend more time with them and may even make them your friends. Make an effort to hang out with people as often as possible and to connect with them. Ask them if you can have their number or if you can add them on Facebook or something. Try to warm up to them and be around them often, always supporting them. If you want to be popular fast, don't hesitate for too long.

, Open up to your new friends. Show them that you trust them, and that you accept them for everything they are. Share some past experiences, and maybe even share some personal stuff if you guys are really close. Don't be afraid to spill it all out when you're around them and just build their trust.


Be a good friend to everyone. Now, just do this to everyone and make as many friends as possible. If you follow all these steps, you will for sure be either a good friend of theirs or a best friend.  If they turn out to be your best friend, that means you guys were probably meant to be best friends. Always hang out with them, talk with them, and be nice.

, Once you have made your first friends ,target their friends to extend your posse. Branch out to them and hang out with them. Get more and more friends. Never abandon your old ones though. If you abandon your old friends then you won't have near as many friends and a bad reputation along with it. Be equal and fair as far as friendship goes and try to make as many new friends as possible. If someone with a bad reputation is trying to be friends with you be friendly just don't be friends.

, Even the people who seem snarky to you can be really nice once you uncover them. Always try to find the good in people and be nice and friendly with everyone. Being kind is a good quality and is very attractive. No one likes mean people. Try to be caring and considerate with every person that you meet. Then you will create and establish not only a great clean reputation but also a nice strong trust with each person.

, Wear clothes that are in style but still you. Try to dress a little comfortable so people don't think that you are trying to hard. Yet, still have some style. Following trends can be good to some extent. Read fashion magazines, books, articles, and more to catch up on what's in style for your age group right now. Ask friends what they think if you are unsure (ask for a direct opinion, don't get hurt by it). Go online into chat rooms even and send them pictures of clothes that you like. See what the public thinks.

, Be clean. Take a shower every day, every other day, or even twice a week depending on if you do sports, your perspiration level, and other things. Always, no matter what, wear deodorant or anti-perspirants. Shave if you need to. Ask your parents if you are under 16 if you can shave. You want to be safe. Make sure to wash and moisturize your face. The best tip for your skin is to wash and put on sunblock. Yes sunblock. It has anti-aging properties as well as other great ingredients that are good for your skin. Put sunblock on all over before you head out. Even in winter because light shines off of snow and can be even deadlier than a hot summer day though it may not seem that way. Just make sure that you rub the sunblock in all the way, sometimes people still have an embarrassing white glob on their face or a half rubbed in white smidge. Anyway, hygiene is the key ingredient! No one will ever want to be around someone who stinks or someone that is dirty! Just think of your own preferences!

, Beyond normal hygiene there are some things that popular people do. The first thing is perfume, cologne, or body mist. Using these moderately is great and can be very attractive. If you want to use it, a slight bit of make up can go a long long way. Lip gloss or balm, some foundation if you have pimples, and some mascara (Some just prefer curling their lashes and sometimes adding vaseline to make them grow long). That is all you will need if you are under 18. Most teens think that you need to have like raccoon eyes or something. See a make up counter for more help!

, Conditioning is a must. Also get regular hair-cuts and style your 'do. You can learn how to on YouTube! Curl, crimp, straighten, there is a lot to hair. Go with what you like.

Gossip about small things.",How to Be Popular and Manipulative," If you're normally shy and reserved, or very nice, then you'll have to change. It would be good to change over the summer holidays, or if you're moving schools.;
, If you're allowed makeup at school, wear it. If you put emphasis on your eyes, then don't put emphasis on your lips, and vice versa. Make sure you cleanse, tone and moisturize every morning and night to keep your skin clear and free of spots. If you do get any spots, then cover it with makeup.

, If your school doesn't have a uniform, then this is a must. Make a dress code, so that you won't be wearing the same thing everyday. Wear modern fashion and styles. Look in magazines for tips. If your school has a uniform, personalize it. Make a look that symbolizes you. Hitch up the skirt, or wear different coloured stockings.

, Look around at what seems the most fashionable hairstyle right now. Is it a side fringe? Is it short hair? Straight or curly? Well, if these are what's ""popular"" right now, then don't be afraid to start a new trend. Just make sure it looks good, and isn't messy.

, Every popular girl has one. They are other popular girls who follow around the main popular one. It doesn't have to be a properly classed clique with an alpha, beta, etc. It can just be a group of populars who always hang out together. You should go everywhere together, and on weekends have sleepovers and go shopping together. Make sure you're the boss of them.

, You don't have to be mean directly to someone's face, but just get them to do what you want. If you want them to give their seat to you and move somewhere else, just tell them. They probably won't refuse. If they do, then call them a meanie and glare at them all day. Get your clique to do it too. Just don't bully them or be really mean.

, Chat to teachers randomly at the end of lessons, or if you see them in the corridor. Always smile and be polite, and show off just a bit. Don't boast, because this can upset people. It helps if you're really clever, because then you can answer questions in class lots and get really good grades on homework and tests. Make sure you get better than everyone else.

, Click a picture of yourself for your profile picture and Photoshop it. Making it black and white is a popular one. Get lots of friends, just random people you've heard of at school or other activities. Then chat heaps to your clique on Facebook. Make sure you're never idle. Put heaps of photos on there, but only let your friends see them.

, If someone's being weird then give them that, ""What the heck?"" look.

, Like how someone got a low mark on the science test or you heard that person one is going out with person two, etc. Don't be mean AT ALL, as it can really hurt someone's feelings and they'll hate you.

Get involved in your community.",How to Be Popular," Nobody's perfect. Therefore, you don't have to be perfect to be popular. Even if you feel that you're far from ideal, the first step to gaining confidence is to believe in yourself.


Don't hide in the corner. Get up and bask in the spotlight, if the moment is right. If you spend all of your time worrying about how you look or what other people think of you, you won't get very far. Instead, work on loving who you are and what you do. If you love yourself, everyone will want to join in.
In class, also get noticed, raise your hand, and finish your work on time. People will get to know you better, Never be afraid to speak!
Fake it until you make it. Even if you don't feel confident, just acting confident is the first step to making you feel good.
Confidence has a lot to do with body language. Walk with your head high and your arms at your sides instead of crossed over your chest. Don't hunch.
Develop your confidence by excelling at the things you love or developing new interests. If you find something you really care about, you'll be more likely to feel good about yourself.;
, This usually means to be willing to step out of your comfort zone. If you're not popular, it's because you're not comfortable doing the things that popular people tend to do, such as:



Making conversation, cracking jokes, flirting, and in general, engaging people. Remember that popular kids are popular only because they are known by (and get the attention from) others.
Remember, if it isn't yet working out, don't wait for someone to come talk to you, you might as well talk to others you never did before.
You may be introspective, shy, or quiet, but in order to get what you want, you need to change how you interact with people.
At first, that might feel like you're being shallow or fake, but remember that being yourself is, at its core, all about knowing what you truly want out of life.

, To get noticed, you don't have to dye your hair pink or get a tattoo on your face. What you should do, however, is find your own look and style and let people see that you're comfortable being yourself.


If you're hiding behind a pair of gray sweatpants, you won't get noticed—at least, not in a good way. So, find a look makes you comfortable, whether you look preppy, hipster chic, or grungy, and own it.
You don't have to buy the trendiest clothes that everyone else is wearing unless you think you can really look good and comfortable in them. If you're buying the same Converse that everyone in school is wearing but they just look wrong on your feet, everyone will notice.
Whatever you wear, have confidence in it. Don't check yourself out in the mirror or ask everyone in your path if you look okay, or people will know that you doubt yourself.
It's great to pay attention to your looks, but looking like you're trying too hard to be popular is worse than looking like you don't care. So, if you're not really into makeup, don't slather your face with it. If you don't like popping your collar, don't do it just because that's what everyone else is doing.
If you want to get trendy clothes but don't have the budget, check out stores that have cool clothes at an affordable price (especially during their sales). Check out Aeropostale, American Eagle, or even Forever 21 to get some great deals.

, To be popular, you're going to need to take a few chances on a social level that may normally feel uncomfortable to you. So be prepared to be bold.


Take risks by introducing yourself to someone you haven't met, going to a party you were invited to (even if you don't know many other guests), or by making statements that make you stand out in a crowd.
If you get used to taking risks (without putting yourself in danger, of course) you will definitely get noticed more.

, Yeah, if you go around acting like you're too cool for school, people may notice you, but it won't be in a good way. Though you may not want to be the teacher's pet and answer every question right, participating in class and making an effort will get you more positive attention than shrugging or being rude if the teacher asks you a question.


Part of looking like you're ready and excited for whatever life throws at you is to smile more. You don't have to smile like a maniac; however, you should smile when people greet you, or even be the one to smile first. This will make people want to get to know you.
If you're in high school, then you may be at the point in your life where most people around you think it's cool to look bored or totally uninterested. However, you'll get noticed even more if you go against the grain here.

, Don't try to act interesting to get other people's attention; act interested in them. Ask them how work or school is going, how their family is doing, how that situation they mentioned a while back turned out, and so on. Then relate. Talk to them about how you or someone you know had something similar happen to them, and how they dealt with it.


Stop thinking about yourself and how you can impress others. Of all the people skills that popular people have, the one that none of them can do without is empathy. How well do you relate to other people?

Stop worrying so much about how you look, how you sound, how you compare, and start thinking about how other people are doing.

, Popular people are on friendly terms with pretty much everyone—not only their peers, but also the teachers, the supervisors, the grocery store clerk, the janitor, the parents, the kids, and generally anyone who's even the tiniest bit nice. They're on good enough terms that they can hold a short, friendly conversation with anyone in the room. There's no reason you can't do that, too. Being friendly doesn't take a big effort, but it makes a real impact.


Keep it casual. Small talk is all about sticking to ""safe"" topics. Stay away from anything controversial, like religion or politics. By expressing your views on a controversial topic, you're bound to be unpopular with people who disagree. Keep the topics ""light"".

, There's a difference between being friendly and going where you're not wanted. Respect people's privacy; don't pry. Learn to read body language so you can see when your questions are starting to make them feel uncomfortable. If a person is backing away or leaning away from you, checking his phone every five minutes, or talking quietly to another friend before you approach, it may not be the best time to talk.


Don't invite yourself anywhere, don't stalk, don't brag, and don't interrupt. In other words, don't be annoying.

, Popular people don't just know everyone—they're on good terms with everyone. They establish those terms by helping people out, and they don't do it in particularly noticeable ways. They do little things to establish rapport (in addition to some big things, like volunteering). They offer someone a pencil when they need it. They close the neighbor's gate when it opens after a strong wind. They hold the door open and wait for the person behind them. But most often, they listen to people when they talk, and they offer to help somehow.


If you truly empathize with people, you'll want things to work out for them. If there's nothing you can do to help then, at the very least, let them know that you're hoping the best for them.

, This may sound trite, but people who are truly popular don't worry about what they should do to ""fit in"", because they really do just because they're comfortable with who they are. You might think that in order to be popular, you need to be attractive and talented, but while it's true that those qualities are more likely to make you a hit with people, there are extremely popular people who are otherwise quite average, and there are extremely good-looking and talented people who are anything but popular.


Remember, the only thing you need in order to be popular is a good set of people skills. The remainder is all yours to mold as you see fit, regardless of what anyone else thinks.
Part of being yourself is knowing yourself well enough to laugh at yourself. Show people that you recognize your quirks and don't take yourself too seriously, and they'll be impressed.

, Surprisingly, many ""popular"" people don't put too much conscious effort into it. They simply are themselves. If you're desperate to be popular, it will show in your actions, and people will think you're a poser, or worse, a freak. One way to make friends is if you find a group of friends that shares your interests, whom you can easily be yourself around. Then as you become more and more accustomed to hanging out with people, you can branch out and start talking to different people.

, You don't have to be Lebron James to join your school basketball team. Joining a team is not only a great way to exercise and feel good about yourself, but it's an awesome way to broaden your horizons and make friends. If you're even a little athletically inclined, it's worth it to try out for one of your school's sports teams or to join a casual sports league in your neighborhood.


Joining a team will expose you to more people and will help you learn how to get along with a variety of people that you might not otherwise encounter in your classes or daily life.
Joining a team will also improve your social life. You'll be more likely to make plans for what to do after the game, or to go to pre-game dinners and other activities with your team.
Joining a team is also a great way to put yourself out there and to let more people know who you are.

, Joining a club is another way to broaden your horizons and to meet more people. You may not meet the same kind of people at the school newspaper that you'd meet on your soccer team, so it's a great idea to join a club and a team if you have the interest and the time in your busy schedule. Find something you're interested in or even just curious about, and try to put yourself in a leadership role in the club once you've gained enough experience, so you're more comfortable being a leader and know more people.


Don't worry about a club being ""too nerdy"" for you. Doing something that you love and meeting more people will make you more popular.

, You don't have to suck up to the teacher or have your hand raised in the air the whole time to stand out in the classroom. Just be friendly to people when they sit down next to you, answer your teacher's questions without being overbearing, and generally show that you care without being so absorbed that you don't notice the social dynamics around you.


If you're more active in class, more people will know your name and recognize you if you come up in the conversation.

, Don't just be a jock or get obsessed with the school yearbook. Instead, maintain a variety of interests by having a few irons in the fire at once. Though you shouldn't spread yourself so thin that you don't have time for yourself, being more involved in more activities will help you get recognized, put your name out there, and get to know more people from different walks of life.

, Getting involved in your community will not only help you improve the life of people who are in need, but it'll help you learn how to interact with a larger number of people from different backgrounds, ages, and financial situations. The more people you know how to get along with, the more adept you'll be at meeting new people and making them feel welcome when the time comes.

Make sure your dress is an appropriate length.,
When you are walking, don't take long steps.,
If you drop something, be very careful!,
When you sit, use the proper technique.,
Never, under any circumstance, bend straight down at the waist.",How to Be Ladylike in a Short Dress," There is virtually no way to be ladylike if your dress is just too short! A good rule of thumb is that the dress should go past the tips of your fingers. If your fingers can touch bare leg with your hands straight down, your dress may be too short. Also, make sure that it covers your bottom and make sure your underwear isn't exposed. Remember, it may be long enough in the front, but it may not be in the back.;
, This can cause your dress to ride up on your thigh, potentially too far!

, A good way to pick things up in a short dress is to press your legs together, and as you are bending your knees to squat, turn them slightly to the side so you are beside the object. Then pick it up.

, Fold your dress under your thighs. Always keep your legs together. Cross your legs only at the ankles, moving them slightly to one side.

, This is a big no-no, as your skirt will go straight up.

, Buy makeup from brands such as Covergirl, Rimmel London, and Revlon at your local Walgreen's or other drugstore. Buy eye shadows that work for your skin tone. Some possibilities for this particular look could be ""baby colors"" such as baby blue, baby pink, yellow, white, and nude eye shadow. Buy liquid eyeliner, especially the color black. Buy mascara. Use the Exact Eye lights Eye-Brightening Waterproof Mascara to make your eyes pop out. Buy lip glosses in colors like pink, clear, nude, or whatever works for your skin tone and outfit. Buy the make up to ensure you are like a Mean Girl. Take it a step further and wear the makeup if you wish.

, You won't want to look emo or like a geek! Shop at Stores like Forever 21, Easy Pickins, Rainbow, Wet Seal, BeBe, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Papaya, Daffy's, Mandee, Marshalls, and TJ Maxx. However, you do not have to shop at these stores. You can find cute, Mean Girl-esque clothing even at stores like Walmart, Target, and - yes - even thrift shops! You never know who donated something there. Maybe it was even a ""Mean Girl"" like you. Channel your inner ""Mean Girl"" look. Shop at stores you like and buy things you like. Wear the clothing if you wish, it's less important than buying the items obviously.

, Buy purses from Juicy Couture, TJ Maxx, and Marshalls. Never buy a fake designer handbag. A purse can be cute without trying to look like something else! Have two basic ones and always keep them neat so you can switch them out regularly. Again here the emphasis is on having the bag, use them if you like, or just keep them on display.

, Just like the movie Mean Girls, don't buy hoop earrings! However, this is just a movie reference that you don't have to live by. If you like them, or they were given to you, and they look good with your outfit, wear them! Jewelry is something completely reflective of your personality. Popular girls shine!

, You know to use shampoo and conditioner, but you can also use hairspray, straightening or curling spray, heat protectant, or anything to go with your look! If you want, buy a ""Bumpit"" to be like the character Brooke from Bring It On: In It to Win It. Mean Girls can straighten their hair like Meagan Fox in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, wear it curly, wavy, up, or any other style! As long as is it's trendy, a ""Mean Girl"" can wear it. Cliquey girls also accessorize with bows, flowers, and big headbands for their hair.

, Mean girls always have a confident walk! This is also referred to as ""the model"" walk. Megan Fox in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen walks like she owns the world! Just don't fall!

, Every ""clique"", or small group of popular girls, always has about 4 members in the group. Remember: pick wisely about who you want in your clique! Always be friendly to them while in a Girl Scout Meeting, Camping Trip, or a Hotel Trip! You want them to want to stay in your clique! You can also pick what ""style"" your clique has, such as sporty, ""good girl"", or fashionable!

, Gossip about other girls, or what you saw that you hate or love. But do not talk like you're stupid! Don't use the word ""like"" too much. Don't always use the phrase ""O.M.G."" and other phrases like that. Also use hand motions while you are talking.

, Is there anybody from another troupe that is camping with your Girl Scout Troupe that is talking about your clothes or the way you talk? Just roll your eyes at them! Mean Girls are confident and know they look good, so don't forget it! Since you are on a camping trip or something like that, don't try to be ""cool"" and say something mean back to them: you will get in trouble! It is a very stupid thing to do. Mean Girls don't get caught.

, Know how to stand up for yourself. Try studying some ""Mean Girls"" who seem to always have it under control.

, This means troupe leaders, teachers, and parents. You don't want to get caught confronting a hater in front of someone who can get you into big trouble!

, Brush your teeth every day. Mean Girls are clean and kissable. Always have gum in your purse. Also always take a shower everyday and wash your hair if needed too.

Wash your hair at least every other day or every two days. If your hair gets tangled easily, or you like your hair looking shiny, condition your hair every single time it gets wet. Never use a brush after taking a shower (unless your brush is made for wet hair); use only a comb on wet hair.
