Consider having your bath or shower before bed.,
Eat healthy snacks before bedtime.,
Go to bed on time.,
Set an alarm.",How to Avoid Being Late for School2," This will save time in the morning if you can't get up early enough.

, If you get hungry don't eat sweets or drink caffeine, as these can keep you alert and awake.

, Ensure that you get sufficient sleep for your body's needs. If you wake up late every day because you've been on Facebook or World of Warfare all night, you've only got yourself to blame. Your body needs sufficient sleep and a sleep deprived body will prevent you from waking up on time. Go to sleep around after half past eight, nine o-clock. Then you will wake up early because you have had a full 8 hours sleep.


Some people like doing work early in the morning rather than at night. This is something you might wish to consider for homework––early to bed, then getting up early to do your homework.

, Whether this is an alarm clock or a digital wake-up device such as an app or phone, always remember to set it. If you have a sophisticated alarm, set it to allow you to sleep in on the weekends and wake up in time on schooldays. Try setting the alarm clock a little earlier than when you usually get up but not too early––just a few minutes earlier.

Get up when you hear the alarm.,
Shower or bathe if needed.,
Brush your teeth and your hair.,
Get out the door and on your way.",How to Avoid Being Late for School3," A frequent problem is slapping the snooze button and drifting off again.Don't do this. Instead, when your alarm goes off, think fast, get out of bed straight away. If the snooze button turns out to be hard to resist, place your alarm somewhere else in the bedroom so that you have to get up to turn it off. By the time you're up, you're up.


Move your alarm clock to the complete opposite side of the room (away from your bed). So you have to physically get up out of bed each time the alarm goes off.
Play the alarm or music as loudly as you can in the morning, so that you can't stand it any longer, and you just want to get out of bed.

, If not, get dressed. Head down to breakfast and eat at a sensible pace. Don't bolt down your food.

, If needed, wash your face as well.

, You'll now be sure get to school before it's too late!

If you prefer to buy lunch, make sure you have your lunch money.
Make sure you have all of the essentials (your pens, pencils, erasers, folders, planners, etc.) packed.
Avoid unnecessary items, as they can just become unnecessary weight.

, Chances are the adult you want the slip signed by won't have time to sign it in the morning.

, If you've prepared very well the night before, you probably can wake up a little later. If you do go to bed fairly late, you'll definitely need extra sleep in the morning.

, It's a good idea to shower everyday. However, doing it the night before saves time in the morning. On the other hand, many people get hot and sweaty at night and prefer to wash in the morning.

, Brush your teeth, wash your face, put on deodorant, and turn on straighteners and curling irons if you plan to use them.

,


You could also take them into the bathroom with you so that you can change right there, as opposed to going back and forth between the bathroom and your room.

,


If you have any homework due next week or even tomorrow then get it done. Don't wait around for later, thinking that it won't matter if you just get an OK grade. Do it earlier and do your best so that you can get a good grade.

, Being that girl that everyone can count on will give you an awesome, responsible feeling. Always carry with you a spare pen or pencil, and carry some scrap paper with you in case your friends might need it during or after class.

, If you go to a school where having a locker is optional, then choose to have one! They're super helpful and they lighten up your bag a bit. You can go get your books that you need for each class either in-between classes or during interval and breaks.

, If you need to get up quite early in the morning for school or work then go to bed early too. By doing this, you'll feel much better the next day and you won't look like a zombie. Plus, set an alarm on your clock or your phone too.

, Nobody likes waking up with a tangled mess! Do not use a hair dryer for this!

, This means putting it in a messy bun, a ponytail, or even a worn out headband. As long as it is out of your facial area.

, Start by damping your face with warm water, then apply a small amount of your facial wash on your finger or hand.


Start applying the cleanser on your face and avoid getting it in your eyes.
Now splash warm water on your face and pat the excess water off.
Never try scrubbing the towel on your face! This can be harmful for the skin.

, This can prevent cavities and gingivitis. It also helps with bad breath. Apply a small amount of toothpaste on your clean brush. start with the bottom teeth. The back is the best place to begin. Brush small circular motions on each tooth for at least 10 seconds.The longer the healthier! Work your way down your teeth until you get to the top set. Do the same as above until you are completely finished. Well, now you have a mouth full of soapy toothpaste. What now? Spit, of course! You can use your hands or even a plastic cup. Just make sure to work the water around all teeth getting the left behind paste in your mouth. If you have a tongue scrubber (optional), It's always a good idea to use it. It can prevent bad breathe and mouth diseases. Now, lets get onto flossing. Flossing is an extremely important thing for teeth. Cut a small piece of floss off your floss box.

, Washing your face refreshes your morning and keeps you awake. It also helps with acne and pores.

If you just want to blend in, a regular length is 100 percent okay. WARNING: don't make your skirt TOO short or you might get in trouble for it!;
, Give it a style rating of 1-10. This will help you figure out how much adjustment is required.

, These should add at least 1 style point.

,, Also, leave your top one or two buttons undone to look flirtier!.

, For preppy looks, tie your hair in a sleek, high side ponytail and tease/curl the tail. Geeks can do braids and ponies or simply clip up your hair. Try a mid-height ponytail to blend in.

,, Geeks could stitch on things like ""Maths is fun!"" on their bag. To blend in, keep it very plain, with a cool logo.

Accessorize your hair.,
If you're allowed to wear make up to school, and you like to wear make up, by all means, go for it.,
Ask for a copy of your school's uniform policy, and search meticulously for loopholes.,
Most uniforms consist of - a blouse, a skirt, a blazer, a jumper, socks and shoes.,
You can shorten your skirt, if you want, but NOT TOO MUCH!!,
Buy your blazer relatively big - but not too big.,
If you can choose between jumper and cardigan, it's probably better to go for cardigan.,
Balance your skirt and blouse.,
Ballet flats, or Kickers are a good idea for shoes.,
For a unique take on your uniform, stack on the bracelets.,
You may need to have a coat for school, and usually it has to be black.,
Scarves look good, no matter what the season.,
Personalize your schoolbag.,
Personalize your school supplies.",How to Personalize Your School Uniform," Do you want to be preppy, alternative, etc etc? You don't have to channel just one thing when personalizing your uniform - but don't be channeling complete opposites. However, don't feel like you have to conform to any norms. You ARE yourself; and yourself is probably a mix of a lot of things.;
, For most people, this means: Getting in the shower, exfoliating face, then cleansing face, then washing body, then exfoliating body, then washing hair (again, if necessary). Get out of shower, and MOISTURIZE!!! Then apply deodorant.

, Keep you're sparklers sparkling!!

, You could shave, wax, really, the possibilities are endless!! Trim your eyebrows, as well. You may think this step, and the two steps above aren't that important. Honestly, no one will care how individual if your don't practice good hygiene.

, Some people don't have to wash their hair as often as others - but hair that you can fry chips on really IS NOT attractive, or personalized. Wash your hair whenever it starts to feel greasy. If you use blow-dryers, or straighteners, make sure you apply some form of protection. Don't use too much hairspray, or product - honestly, it's better to embrace what you've got, and accessorize it, than have it all fall out.

, The possibilities are endless. You hair is YOURS, and yours only - no one has exactly the same hair as you. Experiment with what style you have - bob, long, short, up, down, bun, messy, sleek, straight, curly? Your hair is YOURS, and has pretty much personalized itself already. If your hair is naturally curly, please don't straighten it everyday, and vice versa. Yes, it's nice to change it up a bit every once in a while, but it's not you!

, The possibilities really are endless. Bobby pins are amazing for creating quite a natural look, and you could use bobbles, clips, slides, Alice bands, bows? It's all up to you. Work your personality in your hair., But, PLEASE don't go overboard! There's nothing more distasteful than a young lady with too much make up on. And, plus, it's school, not a party! Bright lipstick is a definite no-no - it looks tacky, and like you have your mum's make up on. Not good. Tinted moisturizer is a lot more natural than foundation, and is less likely to cause a breakout. All you really need is mascara, lip gloss, bronzer, and tinted moisturizer. You may think that personalizing your make-up means drawing things on your face. Don't. It looks childish, and teachers will not take you seriously, and will probably put you in detention. Keep it natural - and if you don't want to wear make-up, don't! Lots of boys prefer a girl that doesn't wear too much anyway.

, There WILL be some. You really don't want to get into trouble for personalizing your uniform.

, If you only have to conform to colours, rather than a particular shape or size, than you are definitely in luck. Look in shops you like for items on your list - the shapes are more fitted, and will look better on you, and will be different from your peers. But, you may have to buy your uniform from a certain shop, and, therefore, it's similar to your peers. These next few steps are for you.

, It looks tacky, and your parents and teachers will kill you!!! If you want to shorten it, go to a tailors, or, if you can't afford that, use safety pins to shorten the hem.

, Blazers look better when they're oversized, but don't swamp you. Go two sizes over what you're meant to be.

, School's probably won't notice if you buy a slightly different style, and there's more choice.

, If you wear a large blouse, wear a small skirt, or you'll look swamped. And vice versa.

, Don't wear heels - you'll get into trouble, and they're not very practical. Pick a hard wearing shoe, so they'll last you the whole year.

, Tribal, and weaved bracelets look AMAZING, and individual. Don't make it frumpy. Make it edgy, and cool.

, But, a lot of schools aren't picky about the style. So, go all out. Express yourself. Box coats, with a Peter Pan collar are very in right now, but you don't have to go with what's 'in'. The whole point of personalizing your uniform, is that it's what YOU like!!

, For winter, a woolly, block colour scarf looks cool, and in summer, you can experiment with more floral, and more patterned numbers.

, Totes, backpacks, handbags - choose whatever you want!!! Or, you could get a plain bag, and decorate it yourself! That really makes it personal!! Add badges, decorate it with Sharpies, whatever you want.

, Cover your books with wrapping paper, and scrawl your fave lyrics on them. Look for your supplies, and pick out ones you like.

Braid your hair.",How to Get Ready Before School P.E. (Girls)," Check the weather to make sure you won't get too cold or hot in the clothes you choose, especially if you'll be going outside. Make sure you have gym clothes for all weather stored in your locker so you can choose what to wear based on weather conditions. Most schools won't allow tank tops, so go with a T-shirt and shorts or sweatpants.


Your sweatpants or gym shorts should be breathable and loose-fitting, but not so baggy that they easily fall down.Similarly, your T-shirt shouldn't be restricting, but it also shouldn't be too baggy. T-shirts can be fun... wear a graphic tee or wear bright colors if you want to mix it up!Check the tag... Don't wear all cotton clothing because it will absorb your sweat, and a wet T-shirt against your skin is not ideal! Wear fabrics that will keep you dry such as CoolMax or Dri-FIT.;
, Regular bras are uncomfortable to run in.Wearing a sports bra will ensure you are comfortable while working out. Remember to put on your regular bra after gym class so you don't smell like your sweaty sports bra for the rest of the school day!, If your gym class is in the morning, put your gym clothes on before school so you don't have to change back into them once you get there. Otherwise, quickly put them on in the locker room at school. If you're uncomfortable changing in front of others, go to a private area of the locker room to change.


Be sure to apply plenty of deodorant after you put your shirt on.

, Yes, you will be changing into your gym shoes, but try not to let your bare feet hit the floor. Catching warts from locker rooms is more common than you may think, so it's best to cover your feet. It's also polite and respectful of other people who may have hygiene concerns when it comes to locker rooms., If you don't want your feet to be stinky for the rest of the day, change into a fresh pair of socks for gym class, then change back into your other socks right after gym., Wear athletic tennis shoes that are comfortable on your feet. Sit on a bench while putting on your tennis shoes and socks, and make sure your bare feet don't touch the dirty, germ-covered floor. Lace up your tennis shoes tightly in a double bow so you don't trip on your shoelaces while playing sports or running!Don't wear flip flops, flats, slip-ons or any other shoe that might fall off during physical activities, as it could lead to injury.

, Put your jewelry in a small bag and keep the bag in your locker during gym class. You can even place the post of your earrings through a button hole, then clasp the back end on. This will ensure that they don't fall off during physical activity, and you can easily find them in the bag you keep them in., Washing your face before gym ensures that extra dirt and oil isn't going into your open pores while you're hot and sweaty. You wouldn't want your pores to get clogged!, Although washing your face will keep your pores from clogging while you sweat, the process is time consuming. Use a facial wipe if you don't have time to wash your face before your gym class starts., Avoid applying moisturizer because it could run down your face and into your eyes if you sweat during gym class.Quickly apply a sunblock made for sports to the visible areas of your skin if you're going outside., Use little to no makeup and a tinted lip balm to liven up your face. You're going to be doing physical activity, so it's likely you will sweat some or all of your makeup off. Plus, your pores open up when your face gets warm which could lead to makeup clogging your pores., Squirt a small amount of deep conditioner in the palm of your hand and quickly apply it to the ends of your hair, avoiding the root area. Wash it out after gym class and follow up with shampoo.Your hair will look shiny and moisturized after gym class so you won't have to do much with it while quickly preparing for your next class., Pull your hair up using either a scrunchie or a hair tie. Wrap your hair up in a bun if you want the deep conditioner you applied to keep your hair looking healthy and moisturized. This way, you'll be prepared to run around in gym class without your hair falling all over you.There's no need to brush your ponytail so that it's perfectly free from bumps! You're probably just going to fix it again right after gym class so your hair looks on point for the rest of the school day.
Put a headband on if you really want to even out the bumps and keep your hair in place.Keep extra hair ties on hand in your gym locker because they're easy to lose.

, If you're going for a more girly look, pull your hair back in a loose braid to keep your hair intact during gym class. You can keep it up for the rest of the day after gym, or undo the braid so your hair falls into luscious waves."

Paris and Kim have Barbie doll looks, Lindsay has a punk, skater, girly look, Ashlee also has a look, Jessica has an urban prep look, Nicole has a very trendy look, and Mary-Kate and Ashley have homeless people looks. Britney has the messed-up look and the glamorous look like Paris.


Wear nice and classy clothes. Don't ditch your style, but think about whether or not a mature and ""looked up to"" young adult would be seen wearing it. Think of someone successful that you know, college-age, even someone you saw walking to the subway station in NY, whatever! Get that 'idol' for your wardrobe and go for it!





;
, If you don't like your hair color, then dye it a natural normal color. Many paparazzi princesses have platinum blonde locks; Paris, Lindsay, Mary-Kate, Ashley, and sometimes Nicole and Ashlee. Cut it and style it or get extensions, most of these Princesses have extensions.

, First of all the tan. This isn't needed for the Ashlee, Ashley and Mary-Kate look, but for the Paris, Lindsay, Nicole, Kim, Britney and Jessica look, this is needed. Paris, Kim and Nicole do spray-on; even though Kim and Nicole don't need fake tans since they're naturally tan; Lindsay and Britney do the cocktail, which is bed and mystic or bed and spray on. Jessica does the spray-on also.

, Oversize sunglasses are a must, they don't always have to be the Jackie O or Dior Glossy style, they can be oversize aviators or oversize shields.

, Shower and take good care of your body.

, A responsible young adult and/or socialite is not unhealthy. Obesity is a major concern and confidence fails from it too. Take charge now!

, The 'reward' of being a responsible young adult, is simply to go out and have fun. Since you are under 21, try an under 21 dance club, a nice lounge-restaurant that allows younger people, a beach road trip, a free weekend with the girls, spa time, hair done, a night off of life...etc.


Once parents feel like you are responsible in all that you do, they will trust you. They have to! What have you done to make them suspicious?







, Not only will it help your future, but you will gain confidence and feel better about yourself knowing that you took good care of your grades and classes.

, You need your friends to let the good times roll.

, Everyone knows that a shy and timid person is always overlooked in a crowd. So stand up tall and talk with a smart and secure attitude. Don't cross your arms. Don't talk down to people. Speak only when you must and always have your cell nearby to text or even pretend you are texting.

, 'Play hard-to-get'. You should make everyone feel as though they are around a celeb (you) and they should feel privileged. It works like a charm every time.

, Don't pick fights and act younger than your age. Always think of a high-profile, SUCCESSFUL celebrity, like Reese Witherspoon for example, and think to yourself, 'Would Reese say that? Would Reese do something like that?' It will help your image and adults will grow to like you more too.

, Let people know on each one of these which ones you have.


Make your Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter pages public. If you like your privacy, then have two accounts for each. Make sure you're organized.
Make sure to take lots of pictures and post them in your photo gallery. Make sure to label them carefully and by event/date. For example: Torrie's Bash Mark 2015.

, Don't be too picky because then you know that someone is free everyday/night. Call/text them, face book them, IM, Myspace, whatever. Just don't act like you have nothing to do.

, No, that is not drinking and having 'sleepovers' at your boyfriends house! Try things like walking on the beach talking about your future and college, shopping at nice stores, going to fancy restaurants with friends (even if you can only afford tapas and drinks!), read books, watch quality TV and stay up to date with current events, save money, be responsible, act very mature in everything that you do. And you will be rewarded! :)

, Talk to both girls and boys with the same air. Crushes are hard but you can handle it maturely!

, Be a good friend!

, Not in the bad manipulative way though.

, This will show that you have good taste in cars.

Value extroversion.,

Keep the party going.",How to Be an Extrovert," It's important to concentrate on the great qualities that extroverts have: they generally make friends easily, are comfortable in front of and with crowds, and can keep a party going. While it's true that both extroverts and introverts have downsides (some extroverts talk too much and sometimes interrupt others, which can be inappropriate at times), focus on the good.


It's easy to think of extroverts in a negative light -- people think they speak before they think and that they're overly concerned with the superficial. It's not true! Extroverts are just as intuitive and thoughtful as introverts. If you want to become an extrovert, you'll have to associate it with positive attributes -- and there are many!
The definition of an extrovert is someone that recharges when they're around people. That's all. They're totally capable of deep thought and being good listeners. They generally have good social skills (...generally) and can be quite the go-getters.;
, It's true: some extroverts come off as fake and phony. Think of a car salesman that pressures people into buying their product -- that's the kind of extrovert you don't want to be. And you don't have to be. You can be whatever kind of extrovert you want. Some extroverts are even shy!


What are the qualities of your ideal extrovert? Maybe they feel at ease in groups, maybe they speak up more, maybe they get the party started. Whatever it is, these are things you can accomplish. It's simple habit. Think of a few things and write them down. ""Being more extroverted"" is a tough goal to hit; ""speaking up more"" is something a lot more doable.

, Heads up: research says most of us are ambiverts.It's your standard bell curve. Some people are on one end (introverts), some people are on the opposite end (extroverts), but the vast majority of us lie somewhere in the middle.


Even if you're mostly introverted, you have at least a few extroverted characteristics. Even Jung (the famed psychologist) said that no one is only one or the other -- if they were, they'd be in an insane asylum.All you have to do is draw out your extroverted tendencies. They're hiding somewhere.

, Though there is an argument that the studies are a little biased, some research has shown that when introverts act more extroverted, they're happier.Experts aren't super sure why, but the idea behind it is that in general, you receive a more positive response. That positive reinforcement from others can be very, very powerful.


It does seem to be true that introverts underestimate what they'll enjoy. Even for some extroverts, there are parties you just dread going to, but then you end up having a good time. Whether it's because you're proud of yourself for breaking out of your box, you experienced something new, or Mohammed did a spit-take onto the chocolate fountain, we are not the best predictors of what we enjoy.

, Sure, the brain is plastic, but you can't teach a dog to be a ferret. If you're extremely introverted, being an extrovert will be incredibly draining. Heck, even some extroverts find too much social stimuli draining at a point. This could be a hurdle that takes years to cross.


If you border on agoraphobic, don't force anything. Instead, consider this: Western cultures highly value extroversion -- Eastern ones don't as much. Is it possible this desire to be extroverted is not an innate desire and rather it's one that's taught to you? Consider accepting your introversion -- introverts are just as necessary to society as extroverts are!

, Changing your personality is hard work. But the brain is plastic and it is doable. Start by observing the extroverts around you. Notice how there are different kinds and how they thrive in different settings. Some might be on top of their game in small groups while others are on top of their game in large crowds. Some might even get inhibited in certain situations!


Also take the time to note what it is that you think makes them extroverted. Remember this: some extroverts are naturally shy. Just because a person is shy doesn't mean they don't get their energy from others. Are you looking to be more confident? Outgoing? What other traits aside from extroversion are these people showcasing that you'd like to emulate?

, This is a nice way of saying ""fake it."" But you're not faking it -- you're just performing. Now that you've spent some time observing other extroverts, mimic them. When you're in a social situation, put on your extroverted hat. Robert de Niro, Barbara Walters, David Letterman -- they're all introverts.They get up there and do it. And then they go home.

, Start small in both task and time. Take 15 minutes out of your day to be around people. Get out of your comfort zone; do something small that makes you a tiny bit uncomfortable. Go knock on your neighbor's door and introduce yourself. After the first one, the second one will seem a lot easier. The third one will be cake.


As you get comfortable with being extroverted for that chunk of time, make it bigger. Next week, spend an hour going around to everyone in your building. When you're at the bus stop, ask the person you're standing next to for the time and follow it up with some other comment on the situation. Get the cashier at the grocery store to smile. The tiny things will add up.

, The fact of the matter is that you can't be extroverted when you're by yourself. Kinda part of the definition. So get around people! Whether it's joining the circle around the watercooler or accepting the invitation to Julie's baby shower, go. You'll never grow and get better if you don't.


Generally people stop asking you to things if you always come up with an excuse not to go. Do yourself a favor and take people up on their invitations. The more you get around these people, the more comfortable you'll be with them and the more comfortable you'll feel being extroverted.

, Some of us peg ourselves as geeks or dorks. We think of extroverts as socialites who wouldn't have the time of day for lame-os like us. Not true! Not true at all. Just because you're introverted does not mean you lack social skills or value. There's a role to fill in any group.


Let's take the most extreme example: you sit at home every day of the week on your computer playing video games and eating Kraft mac n' cheese. Are you still intelligent? Yes. Do you still have skills? Yes. Does a man with a business idea who can talk to people need someone else to format his website? Yes. What can you bring to any table?

, Extroverts tend to be a bit more impulsive than introverts.To mimic an extrovert's impulses (until they come naturally, that is), think off the cuff. If you're walking by a stream, jump in (if you can swim). Start singing in the middle of the supermarket. Anything that you might've deemed a little crazy before should be given a second thought.

, Sometimes the problem isn't us -- it's the people around us. In the nicest way possible, of course. Part of the issue could be that you just don't jive with the people around you. Maybe an older (or younger) age group, different demographic, etc., would be more up your alley. These people could bring out a side of you that's more talkative and, quite frankly, enjoys people more. Think about it.


Test this theory out by joining a club. Anything that's a small class where you could get to know a group of like-minded people could show you that it's not everyone who makes you clam up -- it's just certain types of people. Some people inhibit us and others don't -- find the ones that draw you out.

, Maybe you're a great listener but not a great talker. Maybe you read a lot instead of partying. Newsflash! Your introverted strengths can be extroverted strengths. The next time an acquaintance is making it quite clear they're having a bad day, go up to them and ask them what's up. Your listening skills will take over. Start a conversation about the book you're reading -- if you didn't know it, extroverts read, too!


Odds are if you're truly introverted, you're reflecting a lot, getting in your head, observing and noticing things. If that's the case, you're set: you have an attention to detail that is hard to cultivate organically. Use that. Notice something small and comment on it. People might be taken aback for a split second before a smile erupts on their face that someone finally noticed something about them. Everyone loves that feeling.

, Once you're in a social situation (which is really half the battle), get to talking. Anything. Anything at all. You obviously have opinions! And if you're uncomfortable stating how you feel, ask questions. Everyone loves it when people seem interested in them. Asking questions is an easy way out.


If this is an issue, start talking when you're by yourself. Start talking more around your family and best friends. Sometimes it's hard just getting used to the sound of our own voices. Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make habit. The more you get used to talking a lot, the better you'll be at it in all situations.

, The next step after talking is asserting yourself. When a chance comes up to give your opinion, take it. Unless you're advocating mass genocide or that an amorphous purple blob follows you around on Tuesdays, you probably won't incite chaos or rejection. In the scheme of things, is saying what movie you'd like to see momentous at all? Nope. How about what you thought of your boss' presentation? Nope. Just spit it out.


Let other people set the tone if you'd like. One of the things most people are good at is complaining and they get really good at it when they're in groups. Find a time when you and a few friends/acquaintances are jabbing about nothing and give your opinion. If others don't like it, so be it. The conversation will move on.

, Introverts are guilty of often being too nice. An extrovert will grab the conversation by the horns and take a hold. Let that be you! You don't have to wait for an opening -- because it may not come. It's not rude if it's timely. Extroverts do it all the time.


The only issue is to know when to do it. If you think about it, you'll probably recognize acceptable opportunities. The middle of a story about your friend's sick best friend isn't the best place. The middle of a soap box on veganism might be. If it's an active conversation or debate, go for it. If the person is venting or grieving, wait to state your business.

, The smaller stuff is outta the way -- now it's time to break out the big guns: attracting attention to yourself. This may involve being loud, it may not. More often than not, however, it does involve instigating action. Start a game. Talk about doing something Friday night. Get people organized.


Get people doing things. Bring up a subject that everyone can talk about. Start tossing popcorn down the table. Hide awkwardly behind a small pole. Send a funny video to all your friends. Get people doing things and get people talking.

, Though not all extroverts are comedians and not all comedians are extroverts, if you want to be noticed socially, a good way is to do it is to get your group laughing. The step in attracting attention is a good place to start, but you can take it even further. Even if it has to be at your own expense!


Even something simple like making funny noises or moving in slow motion can get people laughing. If quirky is doable, it'll work. People will be amused and hopefully put at ease. Being social will just skyrocket from there when they join in with you!

, A true, true extrovert can take any awkward silence and run with it, even if it means talking about their cat. If you're in a group of people and thumbs are a-twiddling, start talking. See how many marshmallows you can balance on your forehead. Ask someone ""truth or dare."" Turn on the Macarena and get dancing.


Different crowds will respond to different things. If you're with a group post-Vivaldi operetta and the classic debate of steel-barrel wine vs oak-barrel wine has awkwardly drawn to a close, turning on the Macarena may not be your best bet. Know your audience -- what might get them going?

The less you have to do to prove your arrogance, the better off and more convincing your verbal brags will be down the road. Often, we think of arrogance as being part of competition in sports or in office environments, but it also applies to social interactions, lifestyle, relationships, and lots of other areas of life. Strive to be the best in everything you do.


Train hard and devote your time to whatever craft you hope to excel in. Arrogance just comes across like ignorance if you're bragging about something you don't even fully understand, or practice.;
, Even if people don't like you, they need to take notice when you walk into a room. Have a silent presence and aura by taking the steps necessary to control people with your body language, reflecting your high status and your value. To command people's attention without words:


Stand up straight at all times, keeping your shoulders back and your head up and at attention.
Move purposefully. Don't wander around rooms, or take little half-steps toward the bar. Walk right up to it at full-stride and grab a place at the table.
Smile less. If you want to communicate your superiority, try your best to remain aloof and gaze critically at others as they complete tasks.

, Compete regularly to keep your skills sharp and your hunger for winning large. It's much better to brag and boast about things that other people already know or have seen you do, making your boasts that much more believable. Make an effort to win things that you know you can win with your skills and your arrogant edge.


The earlier your start competing, the better. If you instill a serious competitive edge in yourself early in life, it'll carry through your adult years.
Be competitive in all facets of your life. When Rafael Nadal was injured and needed to recover from competitive tennis, he started playing high-stakes poker, becoming obsessed, just to keep that arrogant edge.

, Arrogant people need to prove their superiority on a regular basis, and that means making an example of people weaker than you in competition. Whether that means calling out the worst worker in your office team, sticking them with some work that will expose their weakness, or challenging a weaker opponent to a contest, you need to dominate on a regular basis.


Never, under any circumstances, take it easy on someone. Arrogant people compete at a high level at all times.
It's also important to challenge upper-level opponents that will actually challenge your skills, but it's also helpful to fight the occasional squash match.

, Arrogant people should come across like they're completely responsible for all their successes and attribute nothing to coaches, teachers, training, or any other facet of their skills. Arrogant people should seem like they were born in Armani diapers, with a big charge card in one hand and a championship trophy in the other, and have done nothing but dominate from that day forward.


It doesn't matter if this is true or not. Just make it seem true by living ostentatiously, showing flash when you've got it. Wear your success visibly.

, Walk the walk by wearing the uniform of the person that you're trying to be. One expensive suit, jacket or wrap-round dress is worth 50 cheap versions. It lasts longer and leaves a lasting impression.


This involves a certain amount of conformity and a dedication to a particular look. You have to subscribe to the expected image of the ""arrogant athlete"" or the ""arrogant bro"" and find the style and garments that fulfill that image.
Be groomed in the way that your arrogant field calls for. Arrogant rockers have to look as if their awesome-looking hair was the last thing they thought of that day, and the perfect-fitting leather jacket just fell into their lap.

, Arrogance is about projecting superiority in all things, and it's easier to be superior and to brag about it when it's about things you've actually done. When you score more points than anyone else on the team, when you get your work done the fastest, when you beat your brother in a footrace, make sure everyone knows about it.


Only brag about things that you do excellently. It's much more difficult to brag when you're only mediocre, and then your arrogance just comes off as ignorance. If you want to command presence, brag when you've got a reason.
If you want to be more arrogant, you don't need to wait for an opening to brag, just start doing it. Arrogance is bullish and obvious, and arrogant people don't care if everyone knows it.
Feel free to slightly embellish your accomplishments as well. It's better to exaggerate slightly than to flat-out lie, because you can get your arrogant bubble burst a little if people find out you didn't do as well as you claimed.

, If you want to come off as arrogant, start setting big goals and trying your best to live up to them. Your standard for excellence should always be higher than everyone else's, yet always within reach of your skills. Make the bar too high for anyone else to reach.


Let your standards evolve with your skills. The more you accomplish, the higher your standards should become. It's not enough to win one championship, you have to repeat and three-peat, you have to win MVP trophies, and be the best in the room.
If someone offers a compliment, an arrogant person will sometimes respond with something like, ""Oh, that's nothing. I'm not even trying.""

, When other people fail to live up to the standards that you set for excellence and for yourself, point it out publicly. While it might seem cruel to point out other people's failures and inadequacies, it's an important way to position yourself on top of everyone else. That's just as important as bragging about yourself.You don't need to do it in a rude way to be arrogant, but it does help to be somewhat blunt. If your teammate or opponent in a game messes up a play, let them know that you disapprove, gently but firmly: ""You know and I know that was a bad play. You just lost that for us. Pass me the ball next time.""

, Eventually, you'll probably get into verbal altercations as an arrogant person. Other wannabe arrogant people will try to take you down a notch or two, and it's very important that you be rock-solid in your verbal jousting. Don't let insults or witty jokes get to you, and practice your quick comebacks to stay one-up on the competition.


A lot of this will happen ahead of the game. Learn to identify your competition and keep them either on your side by befriending them and working together to dominate, or by knocking them down a few pegs before they get the chance to gain confidence and challenge you.

, Ideally, your arrogance should make you magnetic and attractive, especially to member's of the opposite sex.A good sneer or a snicker at a ridiculous person or a ridiculous idea can be arrogant, but it can also be somewhat playful and charming. Think of the following playful arrogant icons:


David Letterman
Chandler from Friends
Barney from How I Met Your Mother
Lady Gaga
Ron Burgundy
Terry Crews
Oprah Winfrey
Phil McGraw

, Remind yourself that you are the best and take pride in every single thing you do. Really take this attitude on board in all of your thinking and dismiss the niggling doubts, should there be any. Know that you are amazing in every way, and let this confidence transform your words and actions.


In some cases, it might also help to invent slights or perceived insults that help to motivate you. Michael Jordan used to tape up disses from other players in his locker to help motivate him to dominate on the court.
Come up with story lines for yourself to help give you something to work with. Position yourself as the underdog, even if you're the best in the room. Pretend that you're overcoming the odds, even if you're doing what you know you can do. Keep that fire lit.

, One of the easiest ways to come across as arrogant is in everyday conversations. When someone else tells a story, or lists an accomplishment, don't recognize it or congratulate them, just launch immediately into a related story of your own that's more impressive and spectacular.Your friend just got back from a vacation at the beach? It should probably remind you of that one time you went snorkeling in Malaysia with local fishermen and lived on the beach in a grass hut.
If you teach your friend how to do something, you can tell them that you learned how to do it in a few seconds (or however shorter than theirs might be). This will probably make them feel less superior and feel they can never do things as soon as you can.

, Never talk down to people you truly value or respect. The purpose of being arrogant is to ""tone down"" or silence your critics or those who are a little bit more happy with themselves than they should be. It is also one means of keeping a workplace enthralled with you, but it can backfire. It's probably best to never act super-arrogant around:


Your boss
Coaches
Your parents
Service staff
Dates

, There's a fine line between arrogance and being a straight-up jerk. Being arrogant does not mean being rude and forgetting basic manners and etiquette around others. Besides, basic manners serve as the means by which you maintain your aloofness and keep others distant in a socially acceptable way.


Never talk down to wait-staff or other service workers in the interest of cultivating your arrogance. This will make you look weak, petty, and immature.
Forgetting someone's name might seem like a good way to take them down a peg, but it really just makes you look like a jerk. Respect people enough to treat them with common dignity, up to the point that you dominate them in competition.

, If you claim to be superior in an area in which you lack the skills or expertise, your arrogance will fall apart and lose its effect. You'll just look like a fool. Make sure to avoid conflicts and confrontations, any competition, in which you don't have at least a sporting chance of winning.


It's good to learn to lose, so you don't end up looking like a cry-baby after a close loss. Learn to lose with dignity, because no matter how arrogant your self-image, it's going to happen eventually.

, Arrogance should be a type of self-improvement. Think of Michael Jordan and Steve Jobs, arrogant people who came, saw, and conquered, not the arrogance of has-beens. Let your arrogant image of yourself motivate you and force you to new heights.


Always do what you say you will do. You've got to live up to the hype that you set for yourself, or you'll just come off like an ego-inflated loser, just like any other. When it's your turn on the field of competition, bring it.

, It's possible for a lot of arrogant people to end up like 30 year-olds hanging out in the parking lot of the high school they graduated from, talking about the glory days. You don't want to be one of these losers. Keep finding new ladders to climb and challenges to face and ways to improve yourself.


After winning a championship, do the Jordan move and try out baseball. Aim to be the best at some other related field. After you dominate the world of industry, become the best fly-fisherman you can be. Set endless goals and meet them.

Value your virtues.",How to Be a Shy and Classical Girl," Audrey Hepburn had a 20 inch (50.8 cm) waist so she made sure to buy dresses that cinched at the waist. If your arms/shoulders are your best assets, wear tops/dresses with roused/cinched sleeves. Black, white, and pastel pink should be signature colors (and if your totally serious...the only colors) in your wardrobe. You should NOT wear tube tops, denim, any rough material, anything 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the knee, anything with a neckline over 1-1 1/2 inches below the collarbone, fluorescent colors, or anything that Lady Gaga would deem appropriate. For makeup, the cat eye look (it's on YouTube, look it up) is good or for more conservativeness, just a touch of mascara, powder, and lip gloss will do. Your jewelry should be diamonds, pearls, any stone, silver, and gold. NO plastic preteen jewelry.;
, You don't have to be a total introvert, unless you naturally are, but you don't want to be the center of attention. When you talk, talk soft and delicate as if you were to raise your voice any louder your voice box would explode. Don't kiss and tell. In fact, try to actually BE conservative, not just pretend. That means no wild behavior your grandma, dad, or God wouldn't want you to do. It's very ladylike and when you DON'T talk about things like that and don't engage yourself in those behaviors, you send off a mysterious aura about yourself.

, Clip and polish those nails. Clear coat or pale pink ONLY. Keep your hair styled, trimmed, and neat. If you have long hair, wear it in a bun, french twist, or the half up-half down look. Wash your face two times a day. Keep your teeth straight and white. Pluck eyebrows, shave/wax unwanted hair and apply lotion everyday.

, Extremely low necklines, too short skirts, belly-bearing tops and revealing clothing can make a girl look like she does not respect her body and herself. Shirts with inappropriate sayings, logos or sexual innuendos can make a girl look like she's desperate for attention. Classy ladies are not desperate for attention.

, This shows politeness. If you talk very loudly, it will seem that you're desperate for attention. Being loud in public isn't just obnoxious, but also inconsiderate to the people around you. Listen to what people have to say and always make eye contact.

, Never swear or say racist comments.This makes you ugly on the inside and rude.

, Parents will appreciate a girl who cares more about her education and her work ethic than her nails. This will reflect in how you are viewed by those in authority. Who do you think gets the break when her homework isn't turned in one day? Teachers are harder on a girl who admits to spending two hours doing her nails than the one who is usually consistent.

, If you really want to know who is well brought up and classy, look at how they treat their inferiors (the people below them on the social ladder), not their equals or superiors.

, Classy girls leave their surroundings in a condition at least as good as they found them. Unless they are in a restaurant with wait staff whose job it is to do the clearing up, classy people insist on taking care of their own trash and baggage, not expecting others to pick up after them. And when others do favors for them, while stuck-up or spoiled people assume it's only to be expected and ignore others' assistance, truly classy people are quick to notice and to express their gratitude and their appreciation.

, Read classic literature such as Emily and Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Sylvia Plath, and other great writers. Study art. Research music theory. Update yourself on current world events. When you apply such knowledge to yourself you will start noticing how much more you engage in conversation with people. As far as maturity goes, keep laughter to a modest level. Don't make sexually themed jokes. Don't act like the stereotypical high school/college girl. Don't go to parties where alcohol is served. If the party gets wild, leave.

, If you have any good skill or kind of talent, such as drawing, or dancing, singing or playing any musical instrument, do not hide it, work it. Let people see how good you are by exposing your pictures, or maybe playing a musical instrument in front of someone. If you're good at acting, look for a part in any play at theater.

College professors look into your past grades and achievements to ensure you deserve the spot at their college. Studying is the key to knowing answers for tests, homework, and your general class participation. As soon as you come from school have an hour of brake time; don't go beyond 2 hours, you'll get too comfortable. Afterwards do your homework, and then study for at least 10 minutes on each subject (language arts, math, science, history). Taking notes during class insures that you have a back-up 'brain' if you forget some material (this also helps for studying). Depending of where you live, for getting good grades, you can get trophy's for your achievements or an honor roll breakfast.;
, It is the most important thing! Showering your body daily is crucial to smelling fresh & clean! If you do not wash your hair daily, you can wear a shower cap (it can be bought at any local beauty shop or dollar store). Putting on deodorant (of your choice) daily, cleansing & moisturizing you face (I recommend clean&clear or Neutrogena) daily, making sure your nails are trimmed weekly, and applying hydrating lotion (I recommend Victoria's Secret PINK lotions, Bath&Body works lotion, and Lush's lotion if you want organic materials) daily.

, You can wear what you want! All I suggest is to wear clothing more on the feminine side. Skirt, capris, jeans, dresses, tube tops, spaghetti straps, shorts, etc. works fine enough! Wear whatever colors you want! I am not telling you to JUST wear pink or blue or purple, WEAR what YOU want! It's your choice, style, and life; I am not going to tell you how it should be. Depending on your personality, depends on your clothing; that's why I'm telling you this. It's not the same for everyone. Be yourself, just amp up your feminine side a little & be happier. :)

, I am not telling you to apply make-up, it's your choice. I say this because you have plenty of time to wear it when your older; let your natural young beauty shine first. I would recommend lip gloss and CLEAR mascara if you would like to enhance your features now. :) If you do want to use make-up, go right ahead, no one's stopping you; it's your decision. (:

, No one likes a grumpy, mean fella anyways. Be realistic though; if your hurt don't say it's no big deal, express it.

, In your bag you should have your cell phone (if you have one), lip gloss, perfume, travel size lotion, mints/gum, mini brush, nail file, female products (if you've had your period), a mirror, & of course your school necessities. :)

If you're looking to be like the traditional Sloane Ranger, investing in a green Barbour wax jacket & a pair of Hunters is an absolute must. Watch out for the end of season sales!;
, No Sloane is seen without her colourful pashmina (http://www.mypashmina.co.uk do beautiful ones for under £30), pearls and Louis Vuitton handbag. Well. It doesn't have to be Louis Vuitton, but if you can afford it, it's worth it. Just make sure it's not scruffy looking. Black is the best colour because scratches are hidden, it never goes out of fashion and goes with every outfit.

, All Sloanes are attractive, because they can afford to be. Blonde hair/blonde highlights are fantastic, and the typical style is a side parting with a sweeping fringe, with lots of hair tossed over the top to create height and volume. A Sloane's hair is never thin, and usually is either slick straight or tousled and wavy. If you want to wear it up a messy bun or ponytail is perfect. As for makeup, never fall into the trap of overdoing it - Sloanes always look like they are wearing hardly any. Try to go for warm colours with pastel overtones, with smoky eyes, but never vampy with heavy eyeliner - make it as natural as possible. Carry around a cute bag for touch-ups throughout the day.

, Fruity with musky undertones are perfect - try Amor Amor by Cacharel or Hypnose by Lancome. Go around the perfume aisles and see which works best for you - but never make it too overpowering.

, A slick black iPod and a flip phone/slide phone are definitely in at the moment. Carrying around a battered Nokia is not. Carry them in your handbag and listen to them on the train...or in your private taxicab!

, Call your friends ""darls"" or ""babes"", abbreviate names, words, exclamations!

, Sloanes love their sport. No wonder they're all so toned and beautiful! Typical sports include tennis, sailing, golf, horse riding, polo, lacrosse and hunting. Try to take some sports up, as if you get invited to an exclusive game of golf - you don't want to look uncultured, do you?

, They'll show you the ropes, introduce you to the hottest parties and the wild public school life of southern England.

Have high standards for everything.,
Buy things with the intent of impressing people.,
Wear clothing and jewelry that reflects your snobbery.,
Hang out around people in the elite crowd.,
Spend time in strategic public places.,
Cultivate manners that set you apart.,
Be cultured and communicate your knowledge.,
Manage your money wisely.",How to Be a Snob1," As you begin your journey into snobbery, you must first know that being a snob means being selective. You must have standards about everything, such as how your steak is prepared to which grocery store you shop in. Be picky about your lifestyle because being a snob is to know and be vocal about the best life has to offer.;
, It doesn’t matter exactly what you purchase because everywhere you go the standards for fine living can change. What matters is that your possessions are what other people deem as valuable.Brand name items are an easy way to show status because most people recognize them as expensive and exclusive.
Food, alcohol, cars, and even pets are other options for show status.
Learn to appreciate the finer things in life. Snobbery is also an enjoyment of quality beverages or the classiest art museum around. Not because they necessarily have a large price tag, but because effort and time went into making a good product.
Only buy authentic items. Faux fur, leather, or gems will eventually be spotted and you don’t want to be caught as a fraud., You don’t need to be flashy and loud with your fashion statements. In fact, being obnoxiously plastered in designer labels and logos can be seen as tacky and trying to hard. To be a snob you need to dress better than everyone around you.


Aim for a clean, classic look. Black and white, pearls, diamonds, gold, and silver are all universally recognized as colors and materials of status and wealth. Incorporate these into your wardrobe.
Be careful not to go overboard on accessorizing. Overloading yourself with too much jewelry or customizing your car with undercarriage lights and a spoiler are ways to get attention, but they don’t reflect the tastefulness of being a snob.
Simplicity goes a long way.
Keep yourself groomed. A perfect outfit can be ruined by torn-up nail beds or bad breath. You need to maintain your elite status and bad hygiene is the fastest way to jeopardize it.

, Again, you want to give off an appearance of status and one way is to intentionally spend your time with those who have it. Your goal is to blend in with the elite crowd. Your appearance, manners, and attitude will help, but you have to actually associate yourself with other snobs., Where you shop and eat is important because if you are a snob, then only the absolute best establishments are good enough for you. Being a snob requires an audience to be complete, even if it’s composed of strangers. The exclusive rooftop bar in New York City is a more suitable place to be than the McDonald’s on the corner of Times Square.


Join a country club, attend events with the powerful people in your community, or become a member of a community club with other snobs.
High-end boutiques are a great place to meet women of wealth as well as simultaneously stay on top of the latest fashion trends.
By rubbing elbows with other people of status in their element, you’ll also learn the dos and don’ts of your particular social circle.

, Treat everyone, regardless of their station in life, with respect. Many snobs have a reputation for acting snotty and uppity towards people of a lower class or social status. Though you want to appear to be the smartest and best-dressed, it does not mean that you have to step on other people to rise to the top.


Refer to others by their title and proper names and expect the same. If you don’t receive the same respect back, correct people so that everyone will know how to treat you.
Don’t swear. Vulgar language is not appropriate in most settings and will taint your image of class.
A fake accent is easy to spot, so don’t force yourself to speak unnaturally. However, you should work on using proper grammar and word pronunciation to appear well-educated.

, Expand your knowledge of art, food, music, politics, and language so that you have an education on a variety of topics. This will help you participate in any conversation and appear intelligent, even if you only have a basic understanding of the topic. People of status often have an impressive education background, for example they may have attended an Ivy League school. Even if you have not, being well-read will help you connect with the upper academic echelon.


Learn a new word every day so that you can build a vocabulary that will impress people.
Take up a hobby that’s physical. Tennis, golf, and other games are great ways to socialize with other snobs as well as stay in shape.

, Being a snob does mean spending money on high-quality, big ticket items. However, you only need to spend your money on the best options. Be strategic and have one outstanding car rather than several medium quality cars. Or, spend your money on one expensive, designer little black dress instead of buying a closet full of jeans and t-shirts.At first, you may not own a lot. But remember quality is better than quantity.
Being smart with your money shows that you are picky and that your money is in fact valuable; you refuse to spend your money on anything but the absolute best.

Be original.","How to Be a Pretty, Nice, and Perfect Preteen"," As a preteen, wearing large amounts of makeup can look tacky, so remember that less is more. A little lip gloss in a soft color and maybe a little swipe of mascara once in a while is generally all you need. But only wear it if your parents are okay with it!;
, It will make your skin nice, smooth, and rich.

,, Wash your face everyday to keep acne away, and to keep your face clean.

, You can shop at stores like Ralph Lauren, Tilly's, and Abercrombie and Fitch. If you cannot afford these however, shop at stores like Forever 21, Wet Seal, and Charlotte Russe. If you are too young for those, go to places like JCPenny, or Kohls, or Target. Even Justice will do.

, Being a great preteen is not just about being pretty and fashionable, but having respect for others and yourself. You must have good values in life to even try to attempt all of this. No calling names, cursing or saying anything rude. Even if someone is mean to you, they might become nicer someday, and they will be happy that you were always nice to them. You don't have to like everyone, just be polite and respect them.

,, Being ""sassy"" is not cool, it just makes you look like a brat.

, And who knows, a boy might see you and ask you to dance with him!

, When you start middle school, you will see a bunch of kids who seem to act similar, dress similar, like similar things, and be clique-ish. Don't try to fit into one of their stereotypes, it makes you boring, un-original, and like a ""poser.""


Don't forget who you are! Everybody is different and nobody is the same. Wearing the same clothes or being an identical twin doesn't mean you're just like the person you look like. You're all different, and be happy with who you are.

, You may be a great friend, but nobody will know if you are to shy to talk to people. Be more outgoing rather than shy, for it is an important step to being popular. Be friendly.

, While others should not judge you based on what you look like, they tend to do so. This is why you should always look your best. Brush your hair, put on some clean clothes, and smile. It is also a good idea to smell good, wearing deodorant isn't a bad idea.

, Now that you are prepared, it's time to make some friends. You could be friends with your neighbors, the people you hang out with at school, or other people you know. Be sure to choose friends that influence you in a positive way. Once you know who you want to be friends with, become their friend. You can do this by


Talking with them more and getting to know them.
Inviting them over to your house, or inviting them to see a movie with you.
Getting their phone number, so you can talk.

, Manage your time so you can spend time with each one of your friends at least once a week. When you do this, you keep your friends and develop strong relationships with them.

, If someone was mean to you, accept their apology. This makes you a better friend, and more popular friend. Understand that forgiving and forgetting is only used when your friend apologizes to you.

, Despite what you see in movies, being mean does not make you popular. Don't pick on another preteen simply because they aren't your friend. Don't tease someone because they are different. If someone is doing that, set a good example and stand up for victim.

, This is one of the worst mistakes you can do. Never do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, even if it means disappointing some people. Chances are, those people aren't going to be good friends.

, Throwing a party boost your popularity. It's recommended you throw a party on your birthday. Don't be afraid to invite friends that don't know other people your inviting. Maybe your friends can get to know your other friends.

Have a specific interest or hobby.,
Be an expert in your field.,
Build an impressive vocabulary.,
Spend time doing what you like.,
Attend events centered around your interest or hobby.,
Be critical of yourself and others.",How to Be a Snob2," If you don’t already have a special thing that you like to do in your free time, pick something that you think is fun. A lot of classic snobby interests include film (not movies), wine and cheese, literature, coffee, or fashion. However, you can be a snob about anything as long as you have an attitude of exclusivity.


Being exclusive about your interest means knowing what is good, bad, and the inbetween. As a snob, connoisseur, or enthusiast, you will want to be vocal about what is the best and what is to be avoided.
Collecting things is a great way to become a snob. For example, it would be impossible to collect every coin or stamp ever made. However, there are some that are more rare or valuable than others which is a standard that makes them better than the rest.

, Be the person who everyone can come to with a question in regards to your interest or hobby. You want to be the one that knows everything about how coffee is made, the best methods for brewing, and all about the bean varieties. The worst kinds of snobs are those who talk as if they know everything in order to seem superior but can’t back up their claims.Be careful about having an air of superiority.
There’s a fine line between being a know-it-all and being the best source of information on a topic. In order to walk that line, humility is the key.
Take the time to do extra research in order to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and newest information.

, You need to be able to “talk shop” with other enthusiasts. For example, if you’re going to be a motorcycle snob, you need to be able to discuss the differences and benefits between a four-stroke and two-stroke engine. In addition, being able to use complex terms and technical jargon, even among people who know nothing about your craft, will impress them with your intelligence and proficiency., In order to become an expert on anything, you need to invest your free time in studying and practicing your craft. If you want to be a connoisseur of cheese, be prepared to eat a lot of cheese. You’ll have to in order to compare and contrast different types and flavors in order to discover the best and the worst. All snobs need to construct a standard of what is the best your particular interest has to offer., This will give you exposure to new ideas or methods. Snobs can often be close-minded because of their pickiness. You still want to hold high standards, but exploring new options will help you develop your tastes and convictions about things.


Libraries and convention centers often hold conferences or events for hobbyists.
Bars and wine shops often have tastings or flights available for you to compare different products.
Being involved in the community is also a great way to meet other snobs in your field.

, Don’t compromise on your standards for good art or a fantastic meal. Rate your experiences as you go to maintain consistency. However, be critical but not condescending. You will alienate yourself and you will lose your credibility. Impress people with your extensive knowledge but avoid acting like another person is beneath you because they are less knowledgeable."

Know what you like about yourself, and don't forget it. The road to popularity can sometimes be hard. In order to keep yourself happy you need to remember these things.
The things you don't like about yourself, change them. If you don't like that you are fat, then lose some weight, but only do it if you want to. Not all popular people have rock hard bodies.
The most important things of all are the things you don't like about yourself that you can't change. If you realize that there are things about yourself that you can't change, and you're okay with that, it will boost your self esteem and overall make you a better person that people will want to be around and feed off that energy.;
,, Shower every day, brush your teeth, and wash your face to help prevent acne. Consult a dermatologist if you have serious acne problems.

, Don't slouch, but know how to relax when it's appropriate. Look people in the eye when you speak to them, and show off your pearly whites when you smile; it's a lot more attractive than looking somber and emo. Self-confidence is really important, because that is the thing that sets your body posture. A lot of people who don't have much self-confidence usually slouch.

, Interest yourself in what others do, and who they are. They will then pay you this same respect. Try not to talk about yourself all the time and obsess over your special interests. People like someone listening to them.

,


Start slow and work your way up. Know the group you want to hang out with. If you want to be in a ""popular"" group, figure out who that group is. Study the group, and decide if it's what you really want.
Pick one person from the clique/group you want to join, preferably someone you see a lot (i.e. having classes with them, do after school sports with, or live close to). Start talking to to this person, learn more about him, and he will slowly start to become your friend. Don't throw yourself at this person or they will be weirded out. As you become more of a friend to this person, you will learn more about the group, and how the people act. As you work your way through time, he will introduce you to some of his friends, and soon, you may just become part of the group.

, It's not really true that the clothes make the man, but looking nice can't hurt. Take a look at current trends, but wear what makes you feel good and confident.

, As time goes on, you will feel comfortable enough to be funny, and others will laugh at your jokes.

, While money can't buy you popularity, it can be useful. Want to buy an iPod? Buy it with your own money to make it look good.

, This is apparently the most important step because it will definitely help you to meet people with the same interests as yours.

, While some guys might look good with slightly longer hair with highlights, some look better with spikes. Having a friend who's a girl (or a girlfriend) is very helpful in this case. Most of the time people say do what feels right for yourself, but if you want to be popular you have to start listening to other people's ideas. Just don't go too far.

, Even though you might not seem to be a positive guy, act like one. Don't gossip about things, don't participate in an inappropriate activity, and try to stay normal. The reason why most guys try to impress people and end up pissed off is because people would think that this dude is acting like a maniac. It's okay to start a joke or prank once in a while, but don't try it too many times. People will think you are hyper and weird. They'll also think that you are some insane and tacky person.

The night before your first day, avoid watching TV or being on a phone or computer for at least an hour before you go to bed, and make sure you go to bed in comfortable clothing. This will help you get the best night of sleep you can possibly get, which will help minimize or avoid dark circles, heavy eye bags, or wan skin.If you have trouble sleeping, you can try some peppermint or jasmine tea to relax.
Lavender oil can also help you get to sleep--and stay that way.;
, Taking a shower will make sure you are looking and smelling your best. After you’ve showered, put on lotion and deodorant to keep yourself looking and feeling fresh.


If you are prone to night sweating or are nervous about having a bad hair day, try to shower the morning of your first day.
Showering the night before is great if you are prone to waking up late or running behind.

, Whether your hair is short or long, style it in a way that makes you feel confident and strong. Take note of the weather, as well. If it is extremely windy outside, for instance, you might want to put your hair up. If it is due to be rainy, you may want to just let it sit naturally.

, The last step to looking great is giving yourself a smile, and sharing that smile with your peers. A smile is the surest way to appear smart, kind, and confident, and can not only draw others to you, but can also improve your mood and mental state in a matter of minutes., Most schools have simple, easy-to-follow dressing guidelines. Before you begin the process of choosing a first-day outfit, read through your school’s dress code, including its limits on hems and cuts., Different clothing styles flatter various body types. Curvy girls, for instance, look great in tops and dresses with cinched waists. Boys with slim builds benefit from slim-cut pants, as baggy pants might look a bit too unkempt.Dressing for your shape can be harder for a boy. If you have broad shoulders, make sure your shirt’s shoulders fit properly. If you have wide hips, you can try a shirt with a rounded hem.

, Although you don’t have to get a new haircut for your transition to high school, it can be a great way to change up your look and boost your confidence. You can choose a cut based on your face shape, or you can talk to your stylist and ask what type of haircut would work well with your face shape, coloring, and hair texture.Even if a magazine or article says a haircut won’t look good with your face shape, don’t be afraid to experiment. Remember that hair will always grow back.

, Different skin undertones work well with different colors. Cool undertones, for instance, work well with white and blue tones, while warm tones look great with darker, richer colors. Choose a shirt or dress that works well with your skin.If you love and look great in a certain color, but it doesn’t match your undertones, wear it anyway. After all, the point is to feel great.

, If you wear makeup, opt for a more natural look. There is nothing wrong with dramatic makeup, but application can take quite some time, and might be too much stress for your first day. Opt for a lighter eye and a natural lip.Although barely-there makeup is faster and easier to apply, if you do not feel comfortable without a full face of makeup, you can paint your face. Just make sure you give yourself enough time to finish your application.

, Trendy outfits can be tempting, but don’t sacrifice comfort for the sake of looking a certain way. If you are uncomfortable, your body language will show it, and even the most trendy outfit will look out of place.An outfit you feel great in will be one that doesn’t make you feel nervous, uncomfortable, or fidgety. If you feel even slightly uncomfortable, try another outfit.

, In addition to laying your outfit out the night before, make sure you try your chosen outfit (or outfit candidates) on ahead of time. This will help you make a definitive decision, and will reveal any problems you might have before the morning of your first day.


You can try on multiple outfits and have two or three set aside for your first day, and decide which one you like best in the morning.
Make sure you try on the whole outfit--shoes and everything. This will make sure you aren’t rushing to find anything in the morning.

, Try on your outfit and make sure there is no bunching, pinching, or ill-fitting area. Ill-fitting areas will mean a lot of adjusting and fiddling throughout the day, which has the effect of making you look uncomfortable or like your clothes don’t fit.If you aren’t sure about the fit of something, ask your parents or a friend what they think.
You can put on a mini fashion show to get the opinions of your friends and family, and get new ideas for outfits.

, Provided there is no bunching or pinching, take a few laps around your room or your house in your chosen outfit. This will also help you identify any problem areas, such as pants falling down, a skirt riding up too high, or a shirt chafing your skin.


If you know you’ll be walking to school, or have an idea of your activity level, try to mimic this activity level to make sure your clothes will last the whole day.
This is particularly important for shoes, as you don’t want to wear shoes to school only to find that they pinch or give you blisters.

Keep everybody happy.",How to Be a Party Boy," The best time to throw a party in school is just after an exam or the end of term. This way, you won't get in as much trouble for just randomly throwing a party. If you do get in trouble, it will be much easier to explain why you had a party than if you simply felt like throwing one. If everybody got good results, the teachers will be more understanding about your need to have some fun. If you're at work, throwing a party for somebody's birthday always works. Christmas, New Years Day and right after somebody gets promoted are also good times to throw parties.;
, If your school is OK with it, you can rent out or borrow one of their halls. The sports hall, assembly hall or canteen usually work best as they are very spacious and shouldn't be too expensive to rent. If your school is still unsure about the party taking place there, offer to raise money by selling ticking and drinks and give them a small percentage of it (20%, for example). If you're not in school, you may need to rent out an external hall. If money's not on your side though, somebody's house works well, depending on how many people are going to be at your party.

, While you might personally like hard rock music, it's rather difficult to dance to for a prolonged amount of time. Instead, go for some pop music, dub step, techno, house and general clubbing music. Make sure the music is interesting, easy to dance to and recognisable by your peers. Is everybody singing that new pop song? Download it. Did your friend tell you that he likes a certain song? Download it. If the music is boring, people will leave. If people like the music, they're more likely to stay, even if everything else goes wrong. Make sure to have the music ready on a CD beforehand.

, The amount of people you're going to invite depends on the size of the venue and how many people you actually want at your party. If you're cool with people bringing their friends, a lot of people will show up. If you don't want that, you won't have as many people at your party. It's not always a bad thing to have less people at the party as it's easier to control and keep everything running smoothly. On your invitations you must include;


Where the party is.
When the party is (Date and time).
Dress code (If there is one).
Ticket prices.
If people can bring their mates along. Make it clear if the friends also have to pay ticket prices or not and the limit on how many people can be brought along.
Any other information.

, It is always a good idea to start the party when everybody has finally shown up. That being said, don't wait too long and try to start the party as close to the time that you gave out. Nobody wants to wait too long and some people will probably leave if the music still hasn't started after an hour because a few people still aren't there. When the music does get started, you won't get too many opportunities to speak to your guests all at once so right before the music starts, get everybody's attention, say your thanks and announce that music will now begin. Take five minute breaks every half an hour or so. That way, people can relax and not risk missing their favourite songs.

, Don't spend all the time headbanging and admiring your own playlist, make sure your guests are happy. If you've run out of drinks, go buy some more. If there's a shy girl in the corner, invite her to dance. If somebody's fallen over, don't laugh, just pick them up. If they're badly hurt, offer to help them or call an ambulance. When you keep everybody happy during the party, nobody will be able to walk out and say that your party was a failure. Also, when people see that you're so considerate, they will look up to you and you will probably become very popular among your peers. If you do see somebody that is having a rubbish time, ask them how you can help them and give them a refund if they ask for one.

Review your school dress code carefully: It does not feel good to be dress-coded in a school where you are trying to set the trends.,
Look into your closet, drawers, and other places where you keep your clothing: Ideal things you would want to look for would be things appealing to you.,
Shopping is an interesting part of a fashionista: Some popular Las Vegas preps would shop at Hollister and A+F.,
Be interesting about your clothing choices: Most ""preps"" would wear layered shirts and a pair of skinny jeans w/ flats.,
Have a mixed style in lower wear: Make sure your jeans are good quality.,
Footwear does not have to be as varied as the shirt and lower wear, but it is preferred: Examples of classy footwear would be plain flats.,
Be careful on accessories: Classy jewelry would include real gold, silver, sterling silver, white gold, and other real materials.,
Get a purse: A tote bag is overly common, and tends to repeat itself among people.,
Go different on the make-up: One of the most important steps in make-up is to make sure that you are not allergic to it first, so make sure to lightly test it.,
Have your hair cut in a trendy style: Most ""preps"" would have their hair in a poofy rocker style.,
Be hygienic: Brush your teeth and gargle mouth wash every morning.,
Remove acne from your face by using different products, depending on your skin: Proactive is good, but not recommended for people with gentle skin.,
Hang out with whom you want to hang out with: This is for looks, not popularity.

",How to Be a Las Vegas Fashionista in Middle School,";
, Be adequate in your choices. An example of inadequacy would be a plain T-shirt with simple designs. Those are good for when playing sports. Otherwise, read on. Adequacy would be a piece of clothing that has interesting styles and cuts (still in dress code).

, Those brands are okay to wear, however, are overly used. Designer brands such as BCBG, Escada, Juicy Couture, and other high class brands are good for a varied closet. However, don't spend all your parent's money on overly-priced jeans. Remember, not everyone is rich and you want to keep a mixed wardrobe. Some cheaper brands for you would be more obscure brands such as Wet Seal, Forever21, Roxy, and Charlotte Russe. Be careful about Wet Seal and Forever21, some of their clothing can be quite cheap and mediocre. If you shop at department stores such as TJ Maxx, Walmart, Target, Marshalls, or Ross, pay attention to what you buy. These stores come with an advantage though, as their clothing is extremely varied and rarely runs out.

, Try to avoid that style. Choose clothing that is interesting towards your fit, and makes you stand out if you were to stand in a group of preps.

, Charlotte Russe has good fit jeans ranging in short, regular, and long. Get a couple of Bermuda shorts, jean minis, normal jeans, crops, capris, and be minimal on the skinny jeans. For instance, you can wear normal jeans for some time, and then shock people by wearing a pair of skinny jeans.

, These are completely dress code, and also flirty. A pair of Converse All-Stars and slip-ons such as Vans are good, too. And in the winter, a pair of Uggs or furry boots pair great with tucked-in capris. Be careful on the peep-toe flats, for they might or might not be a part of the dress code. Heels/wedges shouldn't go past three inches.

, Tiffany and Co. is a good place to get a designer quality sterling silver necklace, but it can cost around three-hundred dollars. Pearls and diamond studs are good. If you can only afford fake jewelry, buy some that looks wooden. Keep the fashion diamonds small and unnoticeable. If your ear is pierced more than one time, avoid wearing more than one ""huge"" earring.

, Purses can be used to hold school supplies, but also make-up and other things you might need. Good brands would be Coach, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Dolce and Gabbana, and other designer brands. Don't buy a fake purse. You can get cute, fashionable purses from the cheaper stores listed above, but make sure it comes in co-ordinable colors.

, The most popular dance steps in one area may not be the most popular in another area. Use the Internet or the entertainment section of your local newspaper to determine what is popular in your area. You can also talk to any dancers you know to obtain their help.

, Most venues that offer dance lessons are very happy to help out new dancers. The lessons are a way to attract newcomers to their venue. Talk to those who you meet there and ask questions about other places to dance.

, There are social rules that apply to dancing. Learn them and practice them. It will make you a popular dance partner if you do.

, It is important that you consider your partner’s needs and dance ability. As you become a better dancer you will be dancing with all skill levels of dance partners. Remember it is your job to lead your partner so that you both have a good time together. You are not there to show off your skills but to make each partner enjoy her dance with you. There may come a time when you want a permanent dance partner and you will have many to choose from if you treated everyone with respect.

, As the leader on the dance floor, you are responsible from your partner’s safety. Watch out for other dance couples in your area of the dance floor. Try to avoid running into others on the floor and be especially alert that you do swing out your partner into another person. A good follower, as your partner is known in dance jargon, will do the same for you. You or she may have to change or terminate a move to avoid a collision on the dance floor. If the floor is really crowded, you should think of it as the same as driving on a crowded city street or freeway and be very alert. If you do bump into someone you should say I’m sorry to them.

, Do not turn down a request to dance. You do not have to ever dance with a person again but you should be courteous and dance at least once with anyone who asks you to dance.

, Since you are the leader, you should practice a strong lead so your partner does not have to guess what you want her to do. However the lead should be firm but not so strong that you hurt your partner by it. You are not to throw her around but to guide her with your leads.

, If the dance moves allow it and the music is not too loud you should engage in light conversation. If this is the first time you danced with her you should ask her name and tell her your name. That helps to break the ice with her and she will feel more comfortable with you. However do not turn your conversation into a life history of yourself or an inquisition of her life.

, Thank your partner for the dance. If you want to dance with her again you could add we should dance again. Or say that was fun lets dance again. Her response will tell you if she is interested in dancing with you again.

, Be confident, be observant of your partner and her reactions to you and your dance style, be open to helping new dancers, adjust your dancing to your partners ability, be fun to be with, be happy you are dancing with your partner, be friendly to all at the dance, don’t latch on to a person you just met but allow her to get comfortable with you by dancing with others between dancing with her again. All of this will make you a popular dancer at your dance venues.

Try using hem tape, fabric glue, and even bobby pins to adjust your clothing!Make sure that you wash all your pieces before you get them tailored. They may shrink, and you don’t want them to become too short or small!;
, These are simple and quick ways to adjust and style your uniform without spending lots of money on tailoring or accessorizing. Roll up your shirt sleeves to the elbows to make it a bit more casual. If your school allows it, try rolling your skirt at the top waistband to make it a bit shorter. This has the added benefit of making your legs look longer! Knee socks are the ultimate preppy addition to a uniform, so keep a couple pairs of those on hand., If your school is strict and allows you to only wear specific pieces, purchase all of your options. If your school provides a list of acceptable pieces or colors, make sure you get a range of appropriate items. The more variety or selection you have of school-approved uniform clothing, the more combinations you can create and you don’t have to dread wearing the exact same style of pants day in and day out.


For example, if your school allows you to wear navy or khaki pants or skirts, buy one of everything, if you can. You’ll be able to change up accessories and footwear along with your uniform, and feel less restrained.
If you’re short on cash, check secondhand shops for uniform pieces. Many students will donate their old uniforms after they graduate, so there are options even if you don’t have a lot of spending money.

Try out different ways to wear it to find the most comfortable, the most flattering, and the most you!

Consider tying a uniform sweater around your shoulders for a preppy, sophisticated look. Layer it over a long sleeve button down with the collar exposed, cuffing the sleeves for a casual, sweet look.

, This is only possible if your school allows it, but many schools do as long as the jewelry isn’t too flashy. A simple strand of pearls or diamond stud earrings can add a little feminine sparkle to your outfit. Alternatively, a studded bracelet or a chain necklace can add some edginess.Find simple jewelry that really encompasses your individual style, and use those to express your personality in ways that you can’t with your clothing.
It can be fun to have a “trademark” piece of jewelry that you’re known for.

, You need something to carry your books in, so why not have some fun with it? Whether it’s a pink floral backpack or a leather tote bag, use this necessary school supply as a way to have a little bit of fashionable fun.


Make sure you know how many books you'll be carrying around on a daily basis before you purchase a cute new bag. It won't be very useful if you can only fit half of your belongings in it.
Alternate your bags throughout the seasons. Not only will this keep you from getting bored with your book bag, but it'll keep your style evolving.

, Depending on your school regulations, you may be able to really set yourself apart with your shoes. From Converse sneakers to delicate ballet flats to combat boots, add some personality to your uniform by picking shoes that show off your individuality.Make sure that whatever shoes you choose, they are comfortable. No one will be admiring your adorable shoes if you're limping or wincing as you walk!

Additionally, these little accessories can be found pretty cheaply, so you can gather an entire assortment. By adding something different to your outfit daily, you'll have more freedom with your look despite wearing the standard uniform pieces., If you can’t get away with changing much about your actual clothing, focus on making your hair look cute and unique instead. Use a curling iron to add some voluminous curls, or create a sleek look with a flat iron. If you don’t have time to use hot tools on your hair, alternate throwing your hair up in buns, ponytails, pigtails, and braids. Mix it up! You can even get highlights or lowlights to enhance your hair color.


Tying your hair up with a ribbon can add a little bit of color, or popping on a studded headband can really make you stand out.

, The power of a great pink lipstick or a shimmery bronzer should not be underestimated. When everyone is wearing the exact same thing, a beautiful face will really stand out.

Remember that if it gets to tough to manage or too much for you, stop!",How to Be a Party Girl in High School Without Screwing up Your Life," Try to stick to black and other neutral shades. A black short bandage skirt with a brown tank-top and black converse is a perfect outfit. Otherwise, black sheer tights with a long neutral-colored cardigan is great. Stick to basic outfits like this that show off your beauty. Maybe some jean shorts and a black crop top or t-shirt. Or you could go overboard with maybe a plaid skirt with a blank tank and combat boots. It's really the best to wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Buy a good foundation and concealer, and use this to perfect your skin tone. Also wear black mascara and a thin line of eyeliner on your top lash line and water line. Perfect a makeup routine that leaves your face looking mysterious but fun. Also, be sure to style your hair every day. Consider dying your hair a color that you feel fits your skin tone well. Go to the gym every day for half an hour to get the party girl body and be sure to eat a balanced diet.;
, Beg your parents or even get a weekend job to pay for this if you don't already have it. This is an essential to being a party girl. You will make lots of friends, and will need to be keeping in constant communication with them, but don't ALWAYS text them because then they might get annoyed and not invite you somewhere again. Just make sure you know where the boundaries are.

, Chances are that after changing up your look, you will start to get more attention from guys but even if you don't you can probably approach them yourself now with more confidence in your appearance. If someone is talking to you, talk back casually but be friendly. Don't put too much pep in your words, but don't sound like your bored either. Always think the best in everyone first, and never judge anyone based on their appearance. However locate the other party girls and make it your goal to become friends with them. They will probably look similar to you and can be found hanging out in various locations including but not limited to: the back of the school, outside of a club, outside a bar/liquor store, the mall, a local cafe, etc.

, Try to talk to the person having the party casually. Have a conversation and then you could casually say ""So what are you doing over the weekend?"" When they mention the party talk about and say ""Cool that sounds really fun I haven't been to a party in ages."" This is practically an invitation for them to invite you, and if they do sound casual again and say ""Yeah I hope I can, I might be busy but should I text you?"" But this might backfire and they could say ""OH if you're busy then don't worry about it"" but they usually won't. Then if you don't already have their number you can get it for them to text you the details. Follow up the next day and text them saying you can come. If they don't invite you, don't stress, there are always new parties happening.

,), or depending on the party type, you can wear some jean shorts with a tank top or a crop top or a t-shirt. For makeup, try a mild black smoky eye over your everyday look. If your parents are strict, tell them you are sleeping over at a friends house, and wear a jacket over the top. If you play it right they will never find out. But if you have strict parents this doesn't always work. They might need to speak to the ""parents"" in which case you can make a friend that they don't know the voice of act as a parent. Or you can always sneak out, but be careful because if you're caught, they'll be more cautious next time. Bring a small wrist-let bag with your cell-phone, at least 20 bucks just in case, your makeup to do touch ups, breath mints, a condom (just in case) and anything else you think you might need.

, Believe it or not, getting really drunk is a downer on everyone because you can become a total hot mess. You can Google how many drinks you can probably drink for your weight and gender. Try to stick to 2 or 3 at the most. Only accept drinks from people you trust, and never ever leave your drink unattended. It doesn't make you a loser to do this... the best party girls all do. It's best to be safe and have fun Keep in mind that in most countries, the drinking age is after you're an adult. Bear in mind that it's illegal to drink underage, and also know the consequences before you drink. Your brain is still developing at your young age, and alcohol or other drugs can severely hinder that. Don't forget about what can happen with your parents and also sometimes things at school. Depending on where you go, you can get kicked out of clubs and other groups. Take my word for it. If you get really drunk, you may regret decisions you've made. Also, don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want to, but don't be scared either. Don't do any drugs because you never know what's in them. Always have money for a taxi just in case, and a crash plan for the night. Never ever get in the car with a drunk driver.

, Hopefully you are there with a friend who will want to go meet some new people with you. If not, go off and just talk to someone who looks nice. Just say ""Hey, what's your name?"" ""What year are you in?"" and start a little conversation. If they seem cool, keep talking; if not, go talk to someone else. You might find yourself hooking up. Don't have a one-night stand. Don't do anything other than make out and maybe touch a little. Then get his number before you leave. It's best to not have sex at your first or any party because you don't know who you are messing around with.

, Congrats, now you're officially a party girl. Don't progress it more than that... party girls get lots of attention from guys and can turn into girls who dress way out of their comfort zone, druggies or get into difficult situations. You're a party girl, not a whore. Don't be afraid to say no, or yes. Speak your mind.

, Do at least an hour of homework every night to stay on top of things, and a couple in the weekend. Then you have plenty of time for parties and boys. If you just get your work done before a party, you'll feel so much better.

, Just tell them sorry and that it was a dumb decision and you won't do it again. You can make it more convincing by saying things like ""I know I'm stupid"" ""I shouldn't be friends with those bad influences anymore"" ""I was scared to say no"" etc. After they catch you, lay low for a while.

, If you live in the states or many other countries, you could be in trouble for alcohol use if you've been drinking underage. This could be bad! That's why it is important to leave parties if you feel they are getting too rough and neighbors are getting annoyed. Don't feel the need to stay just because your friend is. You won't be a loser for getting yourself and your friend out of there before the cops bust everyone. However if you are in this situation, be polite and apologetic to the police. Chances are you won't be in too much trouble; the worst thing is that they will notify your parents.

, Don't feel the need to do it just because everyone else is. The important thing is that you're comfortable with your life and your decisions. If your every thought is a worry that one day you'll be caught and you're a nervous wreck, maybe it's time to stop."

,
Have to have a sweet and kind attitude.

,
Talk respectfully.,
Be a nice person.",How to Make Your School Uniform More Kawaii (Anime Styled),"


For example, uniform colors are typically: black, navy blue, red, green or white; or a combination of these colors.;
, The colors must be: white, black or navy blue.

, For example, Mary Jane shoes, ankle boots, flats, or any shoes that match the school colors and stop at the ankle or shorter.

, Make sure the cardigan or sweater is an inch over the end of your shirt/start of your skirt. Also wear a tight fitting (not too tight) shirt that is tucked in or short (not so short that when you lift up your arms, people can see skin).

, Try hairbands, high buns, low buns, braids, hair ribbons, ponytails, or low pig tails. Whether you have thick hair, straight hair, or curly hair these suggestions will work for you:


high buns
low buns
low pig tails
ponytails with ribbons
braids
wear your hair down
ponytail with ribbon.

, They'll just not fit properly. Also avoid them if you have sensitive temples, as you'll end up with constant headaches.


Only treat headbands as a cute accessory, not as something that actually works well.

,, Also cover up pimples. Remember less is more!

, This will always make your eyes appear larger and more kawaii.

, For the kawaii look, apply preferably colored eyeliner to wear under eyelashes. Apply from the outside corner and make a line following the under lashes about the width of a pencil eraser.


This look might make you feel uncomfortable, so you can always make the line smaller. If you make the line bigger, you will make your eyes look smaller.
To make your eyes even more bright add white eyeliner on the water line and inner corner.

, For example, a pastel pink or a lavender pink. Maybe a light red.

,,, Don't swear or talk meanly about others. Respect your elders (unless you don't want a Senpai). Respect your classmates––don't call them stupid or get annoyed at them (don't show that you are annoyed).

, Let go of things you will be more innocent, light-hearted and more fun to be around (kawaii).

Finished.

",How to Make a School Uniform Look Very Stylish Like Massie Block," She curls it almost every day, and it's hardly ever straight. It's also very healthy. Use a salon brand hair care product, and if you can't afford one, use Pantene's Pro-V system. It makes hair smell good and makes it soft and manageable. After you get out of the shower, air dry your hair and use a volumizing spray or product to give your hair volume at the roots. Use a leave in conditioner to make your hair soft and non-frizzy. Just don't use too much product, as this can tangle your hair and make it nasty, smelly, greasy, and damaged. Don't put conditioner on your scalp, it can make your hair greasy.


If you're one of those lovely young ladies of color, use an African American shampoo and conditioner. And wash your hair only 2 times a week at the most. After you get out of the shower, spray a hair oil all over your hair and scalp, blow dry your hair on Cool or the lowest heat setting to avoid damage as African American hair can burn and damage easily, and flat iron it with a high quality iron, like a Chi. If you want, for whatever type of hair you have, curl your hair with the straightener by wrapping the strands around the curler and wait to feel the heat to go through. Do this to all layers, but avoid using too much heat. You do not want fried ends.
Also, use hair accessories. Massie is RICH, like, really rich. She has a ton of money. But you may not, so try to shop at places like Forever21 and Hot Topic for cute hair bows and headbands, clips, etc.
Try spritzing a perfume in your brush/comb to give your hair a pleasant scent.;
, Get high quality make up from Sephora and similar places. If you can't afford it, use CoverGirl or Hard Candy makeup. It's excellent. Wear eyeliner that compliments your skin tone, brown for fair skin tones, black for darker complexions. Use a foundation and concealer to make your skin look flawless, BE SURE IT MATCHES YOUR SKIN TONE. Massie A L W A Y S wears lip gloss, no exceptions. Wear a few coats of mascara, again, whatever matches your skin tone. Make sure it doesn't have any clumps. Wear a couple coats on the bottom lashes. Wear a light blush. Groom your eyebrows with a grooming brush and pluck or wax them when hair grows back. Massie's eyebrows are amazing.

,


Massie uses Chanel No. 19. Try Viva la Juicy, or Pink by Victoria's Secret. Don't use cheap knockoffs, it's very noticeable and people around you - and yourself, too - can react badly. Look for good smelling scents at Bath and Body Works, Aeropostale, or Kohl's. JCP has good scents, too. To test it, try it in an inconceivable area and see if you have an allergic reaction.
Brush your teeth 2-3 times a day using a whitening toothpaste. Crest 3D White works well. Also, rinse your mouth with an enamel strengthening mouthwash, like Listerine. Use an electronic spin brush. These get more germs off of teeth.
Shower at least once a day, with a good smelling soap/gel.
Shave your legs and underarms daily or every other day.
I know it seems gross, but please, shave your privates. Odors can linger in pubic hair and that's not very Massie-ish.
Wash your face everyday with a high quality wash like ProActiv, or Neutrogena Skin ID. Clinique's facial washes are very nice, too.
Chew freshening gum.
Wash your clothes everyday, and shower immediately after coming home from a hot day outside or working out.
Massie has french nails. Try to buy some or get yours done professionally.

,


Aeropostale has really adorable charm bracelets, like Massie's. Find charms that can fit onto the bracelet. Massie has an ""M"" on hers; Find one for your initial.
Necklaces are very cute. Try one with a diamond, or a cute figure, like a cupcake, or an angel.
Massie doesn't wear cheap stuff, so try not to. Do not shop at Claire's. That's, ironically, a place where Claire would shop.

,


Wear form fitting tops. Aeropostale has amazing uniform tops. They're form fitting and very stylish. They have small sleeves, not very much past the end of the ending of the shoulder. Try wearing designer tops, too. Most uniform schools allow blouses.
If your school provides uniforms for you, try to find loops in it. Try wearing a bright cami underneath the shirt. Also, try to tailor the skirt to a couple of inches above your knees. Be careful, though. Schools are very strict about dress codes, and it can get you suspended, or even expelled.
Arizona and SO from Kohl's are good choices for pants. Try getting about 5 pairs, 1 in light khaki, one in dark khaki, two in black, one in navy.
If you can't wear heels, wear designer shoes, like Sperry's, Uggs, and Converse, though Massie would NEVER shop for Converse. Try shoes that no one else knows where they're from.
Studded belts are in. If your school doesn't allow them then just wear a black leather belt.
If your school allows it, wear a pretty jacket over your shirt. If not, wear a school sweatshirt over it. It helps if you get cold.

, Massie has a really big, but really beautiful, bag. It holds a lot. Don't bring a backpack, use your bag. Put notebooks, gum, a make up bag with a comb or brush in it, a Teen Vogue mag, an iPod if you wish, cell phone, nail polish, elastic headbands and rubber bands, bobby pins, etc. Whatever you need!

,,"
"
Try playing with different shapes and cuts like a pea coat one week and bomber the next, if your school only allows black or grey coats.,
Wear fingerless gloves, because you most likely can keep them on during class, and they look cool in a grungy sort of way.

,
Try going with a slightly larger shirt or a smaller-go long sleeves because then you roll sleeves to add a laid back vibe.

,
Try ribbed stockings or ones with a little pattern.,
Try slipping in to some warm boots-go for any style-knit-ankle-knee high etc.,
Try going for bright colored scarves, especially if your school regulates coat color.,
Wear pins on your uniform.,
There's not much you can do about your blazer.,
Keep your hair clean!!!,
Get a huge collection of sunglasses and have fun with them.,
Glasses.,
Keep jewelry to a minimum.,
Nails-Keep them clean you can't go wrong with natural color.

",How to Make a School Uniform Look Cool in the Winter," If you can have color try picking colors that compliment your your uniform like reds, yellows,browns, etc.;
,,, Most schools only allow grey, black, navy blue or whatever the main school color is, but they only specify color not textures.

, before and after school.

, If your school regulates your scarves too then mess around with textures and fabrics. Try wearing your scarf different ways too.

, Some look really nice, try them on on your coat or sweater if your school gives out pins.

, It's probably school issued and there's not much you can do with it. You can try buying different sizes like one a bit to big it looks like a boyfriend blazer or a smaller one to accentuate your shape.

, Look to the leading ladies of gossip girl for ideas. If you can take full advantage of your natural texture so that you don't always have to flat iron or curl your hair ( which leads to breakage, dull, and unhealthy looking hair)

, Honestly what are teachers going to say? You are simply protecting your eyes. Try bringing up sun damage to the eyes up in one of your science class the day before your start this trend that way if anyone says anything you can subtly pin it on your science teacher.

, Again: mess with different styles and colors

, Studs (small or large), one bracelet, a cool watch, if you can get away with it get one that looks like a cuff or bracelet, and two really cool rings.

Learn about your school's dress code.,
Keep clean.",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform1," Get a copy of this uniform policy and read it carefully. Be respectful of your school's uniform policy and remember that they can--and will--ask you to be more adherent to the policy at any time., Shower every day. Use nicely scented natural products, body lotion and a good antiperspirant/deodorant.

"
"
Try your tops on, and allow for shrinkage.,
If you have to wear a blouse: You may want to get a hold of fitted blouses, which are generally much more flattering.",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform2," Clothes that fit right or a little on the small side are essential for popular/prep styles. However, baggier shirts can make a statement too, especially if you are more of a rocker. Another thing to think about is fabric. Also, consider getting shirts that are a slightly different shade if allowed.;
, 3/4 length sleeves are tend to be a bit more stylish, if they're an allowed length.

"
"
Get the right length.,
If you are allowed to, buy a skirt with a bit of character; like ones with lace details (goth), or bubble skirts, pencil skirts (retro), pleated, or layered (popular/prep).",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform3," Schools do not approve of turning your long skirt into a mini-skirt. Definitely find out the preferred length so that you don't break dress code.


If you can, get your skirt tailored. Make sure your skirt is straight, and that you get the right measurements. If you know somebody who can actually sew, then ask them to tailor it for you.

, Although this could mean that you have to push the school rules boundaries a little, just don't blatantly cross them.

"
"
Wear well-fitting ones or slightly more baggy, like combat trousers.",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform4," If you feel lucky enough to get away with jeans, then black skinny jeans with no rivets look gorgeous. Some schools might have a day once a week where you're allowed to wear jeans and/or spirit shirts. If that's allowed, take advantage of that opportunity. If your school is very lenient on types of jeans and everyone at your school breaks the rules, break them too. Wear baggy/bootcut jeans for a tomboy look, skinny for trendy, slim for sexy, and straight-legged for preppy.

"
"
Buy your jumper slightly smaller if you prefer tight-fitting tops and jumpers, (popular/preps).",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform5," However, buying a slightly bigger size is good for the more alternative people, just don't go overboard. If you can get away with wearing a jumper/sweatshirt that's not part of the school uniform then you could get a plain black jumper which flatters your personality and figure, rather than the shapeless sweatshirts supplied by many schools. Some schools allow turtlenecks, sweater vests, etc. If you can, wear a sweater vest for a cute, chic feminine look, have a short sleeved white oxford button down blouse and if you are allowed, wear different colors for the vest. If your school allows you to wear pullover sweaters, wear a cute white pullover/sweater/sweatshirt to make yourself look a lot more casual and normal. If you are allowed to wear solid color jackets, wear cute colors if allowed to make your outfit more casual. Turtlenecks are cute if in cute colors as well. School sweatshirts are great and allowed. If your school is not great though, don't wear the school sweatshirt because that is just encouraging them and giving money to your school.

"
"
Change the buttons and add a decorative zip or two (if possible).",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform6," Putting pin badges of your favourite bands or phrases can come across as a bit childish, they are also not fashionable and most schools will not allow it. Iron-on/sew-on patches also come across as childish and most schools don't allow it.


Make sure your school allows you to do this, or you could risk getting in trouble.

"
"
You could just wear Vans or Converse (alternative) in the matching colors, or try combat/Doc Martens boots (goth/alternative).,
If you are forced to wear plain 'regulation' shoes, then you could get hold of some cute black ballet shoes.

",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform7," They look great with nearly all dark-coloured clothes. Sandals aren't allowed by most schools. Choose your shoes carefully - depending on your school you may be doing a lot of walking between classes, so choose shoes that are both comfortable and match the rest of your overall style.

Use your hair to express your style.,
Straighten, scrunch, curl, or tease your hair.,
Grow it long or cut it short.,
Style: High pony-tails and sloppy buns are really cute, especially with ribbons around them.,
Colour your hair.",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform8," Hair style can count for a lot. Schools with uniforms tend to have rules regarding length, color and styling but you've generally got plenty of lee-way to be unique.

, It really makes a difference! Try to mix it up, to keep people guessing.

, Layers and bangs are cool too. Go for a mohawk or dreadlocks if you dare! However, mohawks generally aren't allowed. Do whatever you want (within reason).

, Low/side pony-tails, pigtails and French plaits can be cute, too. Just do whatever you like. Buy an assortment of hair accessories to style your hair.

, Ask your stylist what colors they think will suit your skin tone, eyes, etc. You can add highlights or just strips of colour, or you can go for the plunge and dye your whole head. If your school doesn't allow coloring, try natural looking highlights or lowlights.


Add streaks. Try a wash-out first, to make sure it's okay before you try permanent dye. Or try clip-in streaks; they are easy to take out, and you can change the color on a daily basis. Also, they don't damage your hair the way hair-dye often does.

"
Get a suitable belt that reflects your personality.,
Wearing glasses can be cute, if you pick them right.,
Wear cute stud/small hoop earrings, in gold or silver preferably.,
Consider how you'll wear your tie, if your school uniform has ties.,
Accessories become quite important if the rest of your outfit is standardised.",How to Look Like an Individual While Wearing a School Uniform9," Pyramid studs or bullet belts are considered very alternative. Plaited, over-sized or metallic belts look good with preppy style. Remember, an overly elaborate belt may be frowned upon by authority figures to the extent that they force you to replace it.

, Black with thick-rims are very alternative. Rockabilly chicks look super in leopard-print. If you are more preppy, go for black/silver/gold half-rimless.

, You could mix up your earrings and wear mismatching ones too. Get several pairs so you can change them every few days. A couple of pretty bangles look nice and accentuate nice hands and arms. Get a (or several) signature necklace(s). Do keep in mind that many schools don't allow necklaces or bracelets.

, It's possible to wear them quite short or quite long, it all depends. Furthermore, a new tie will be a lot wider, whereas a second-hand tie will be a lot thinner and flatter through use. Experiment to find the look that best suits you. There are different knots one can use as well that give them slightly different looks. Long ties with thin knots are cool, as are short ones with fat knots.

, Choose wallets, handbags, backpacks, etc. that express your individuality. Also, you might want to try decorating pencil cases, wallets and purses with stitching. Badge pins are seen as a bit childish.

Decorate your clothing.,
Have your uniform custom fit.,
Add accessories to your clothing.,
Wear personal accessories.,
Pick your gear.,
Try new hairstyles.,
Keep makeup simple.",How to Look Good in School Uniform Without Breaking the Rules," You may not have much choice on what shirt to wear, but there are a few decisions you can make:


If your school allows it, leaving your shirt untucked can be more comfortable and casual.
If your school requires tucked shirts, pulling it up to leave a little loose fabric can stand out. (This trick is usually used for boys' uniforms.)
Try cuffing your sleeves to stand out a little.
Consider undoing the top buttons of a polo shirt. Check the dress code first; many schools have strict regulations for girls.;
, Most schools allow a dress shirt or camisole underneath your school uniform. This adds class and may allow you to undo the top buttons of your uniform for style and comfort. If you prefer a more covered look, buy a uniform sweater (cardigan) instead.


If your school doesn't have uniform sweaters, check the dress code to see what tops you can wear. If you only need to stick to a color scheme, you can find a sweater with flashy buttons, macrame, lace, or other decorations.

, Shoes are often the least regulated item, but check your school's dress code before you shop. Even if you are required to wear black or white shoes, there are many different styles to choose from. Pick something that suits your style:


Flats look classy.
Calf-high boots are exciting.
Athletic shoes are comfortable and handy to have on gym days.
High heels may be too impractical for school.

, Socks are another loophole in many dress codes. You still might get called out if you go too over-the-top, but a neutral pattern or dark shade can add some variety.

, You'll usually have to be subtle about altering the clothes themselves. If any of these are allowed at your school, though, they can supply fantastic customization:


Replacing buttons with new buttons the same color, but a different shape
Iron-on patches

Embroidered designs

, If you're working with a very strict dress code, this may be one of your only options. Take the uniform to a tailor and pay to have it altered . Here are a few ideas:


Bring in the waist or sleeves. If you are proud of your waist or your muscular arms, have the garment narrowed slightly in those areas.
Loosen the shirt or skirt. This is most helpful if the uniform is uncomfortably tight, but it can be a fashion statement as well.

Hem the skirt. Take care not to bring the skirt higher than the dress code allows. Just fold it over a little bit to create a neater edge.

, Students in uniform love to add personality using badges, stickers, and ribbons. These usually go on the collar, sweater (cardigan), or book bag.

, Your school probably has guidelines for these, but there's usually a lot of wiggle room. Here are a few ideas:


A decorative belt or belt buckle
A hair clip, headband, or bow
A watch
One or two small, unobtrusive pieces of jewelry
Tie or bow tie (if not already part of the uniform)
A scarf, hat, or gloves

, If you can, pick your own bags, backpacks, lunch boxes, and any other gear your bring to school. Even an umbrella can be part of your fashion statement.

, Even the strictest school allows for some variation in hair styles, at least for girls. At most schools, students of any sex can experiment with hairstyles.


For any hair long enough to part, try out different parting styles.
For long hair, try the many types of braids.
If your school allows hair dye, consider highlights.

, If makeup is allowed at all, subtlety is usually required. The following is usually appropriate, but check the dress code first. These are roughly arranged from least noticeable to most, so you can decide how far to go:


Light foundation, concealer, or tinted moisturizer.
Thin application of mascara
Eyebrow pencil, used only to dot in gaps
Clear nail polish
Light shades of blush
""Nude"" or light shades of lip gloss or lipstick

How long skirts, shorts, or dresses have to beWhat kinds of jewelry, makeup, and accessories are acceptable (if any)
What colors you're allowed to wear
What type of shoes you can wear;

Even if you can't get away with a crazy belt, try adding some interest with a plain belt outfitted with a unique belt buckle.


If you're wearing a skirt with a shirt tucked in, try tying a sash or ribbon around the waist of the skirt.
You can also leave your dress shirt untucked over a skirt and pair it with a chunky belt at the waist.

, For schools that don’t allow uniform alterations, personalization, and additional clothing items, you may at least be able to get away with a few accessories here and there.


Scarves are great accessories for look and added warmth, and you might even be able to sneak some color into your outfit this way.

, Many school dress codes don’t mention what kind of bag you can carry, so you might have a little more room for creativity here. Unique ideas for schoolbags include:


Over-the-shoulder and messenger bagsRegular bags that are decorated with patches, pins, and badges, How much jewelry you can wear will depend on your school, but if you're allowed to wear it, jewelry can be a great way to jazz up a uniform.


Try wearing multiple bracelets on one wrist
You can also layer multiple rings on a single finger
Basic chains can add a touch of class, but a colorful necklace can completely change your look
If you aren't allowed to wear jewelry at all, try wrapping a headband or hair elastics around your wrist., Shoes can be a great way to add a personal touch to a uniform without breaking any dress code rules. But if your school does have a strict policy about shoes, try shiny black shoes with a slight heel or minor decorative feature.But if you have more freedom, why not try:


High-top or low-top Converse with high socksBoots with fun shoelaces
Flats or ballerina slippers
Trendy dress shoes
Bright or unique running shoes

, Even if you can’t get away with fun shoes, you may still be able to experiment with different socks, leggings, and tights. These can include patterned socks, knee socks, baggy socks, textured tights, fishnets, and other decorative leggings., There are many trendy hairstyles that will bring a whole new element to your uniform, and as long as you don’t try any crazy dye colors, you might be surprised at the hairstyles you can get away with.


If you have long hair, try a side braid, bun, or twist at the top of your head.
To add extra color or interest to your hair, you can also wear bright headbands, flowers, ribbons, and bows.For girls with medium-length wavy hair, you can either leave it loose and shaggy, bed-head messy, or combed back for a more professional look.

, Many schools have policies about cosmetics, but that doesn’t mean you can't sneak in some natural makeup here and there. For instance, try wearing:


Tinted lip gloss
Pale blush
Foundation to smooth your complexion
Some bronzer or neutral eyeshadow in the crease of your eye
A pale or metallic eyeshadow in the corners of your eyesNail polish

Mend your uniform when necessary.",How to Make Uniforms Look Good," Some schools offer different options for shirts, skirts, and pants. Visit your school's uniform shop and see what options there are.You may find various styles of shirts, pants, and skirts to choose from.;
, If your school offers shirts, pants, and skirts in different colors, try to mix and match. You want to pair light colors with dark colors. Don't wear a dark-colored bottom with a dark-colored top, or a light-colored bottom with a light-colored top. Too much of one color will look bland and boring.


If your school offers pants, skirts, and shirts in both khaki and navy, pair the khaki pants/skirt with the navy shirt, or the navy pants/skirt with the khaki shirt

, Just because your school requires black pants and white shirts doesn't mean that you have to look like everyone else. If your school doesn't have any requirements other than color, try a pant style that suits your figure—but that is also accepted by the dress code. For example:Get a pair of boot-cut pants. They are classic and tend to look great on just about everyone. (They bring out the hips and long legs too!)
If skinny pants are against the dress code, try a pair of straight-leg pants that have thinner legs. You will get something that is still slender and flattering without going against the dress code.
If you have shorter legs and want to make them appear longer, try a pair of straight-leg or high-waist pants. They will help your legs appear longer.

, If your school doesn't have any specifications on what shirt you wear other than it has to be a certain color and cannot be a T-shirt, don't despair; there are many styles to choose from. There are polo shirts, short-sleeved button-up shirts, long-sleeved button-up shirts, and blouses.


If your dress code allows it, get a solid colored shirt with some trim on it. For example, you can choose a white, long-sleeved button-up shirt with a black color, cuffs, and buttons.If you choose to wear a blouse, pair it with a cute belt around your waist. It'll make the blouse appear less baggy and bring out your figure.

, If you don't like wearing skirts, consider a skort instead. They are shorts with a flap of fabric across the front, making them appear like a skirt.


If you do like wearing skirts but don't like how careful you have to be in them, wear a pair of form-fitting shorts underneath, such as bike shorts or gym shorts. Choose a color that is close to your skirt color, and make sure that the shorts are shorter than your skirt so that the cuffs don't peek through.

, Some schools will have some restrictions on schools, including style on color, but others will not. Try pairing your uniform with sandals, boots, colored flats, or shoes with an interesting pattern.If your school has strict rules on shoes, try something with a slightly taller heel. Not only will it look stylish, but it will also make your legs appear longer.
If you have to wear a specific style and/or color, see if you can change the shoelaces. A different set of shoelaces can add that much-needed spark of color or personality to your uniform.

, If the dress code permits, pair your skirt with some knee-high socks or colorful tights. They can be solid colored or patterned. Not only will this allow your individuality to shine through, but it will also keep you warm on cold days.


If you have to wear a plaid skirt, put on a pair of solid colored tights or knee-high socks. Try wearing black, grey, or white.
If you have to wear a solid-colored skirt, put on a pair of patterned tights or knee-high socks. Argyle is a classic pattern that is also flattering on most.
If you don't like wearing tights or knee-high socks, try crew socks in another color or with some trim. For example, you could wear a pair of red crew socks or white crew socks with a delicate lace trim.

, Some dress codes might not allow non-uniform jackets or sweaters, but this doesn't mean that you have to freeze during the winter. Visit your school's uniform shop and see if you can get a sweatshirt or jacket with your name on the back and your school name on the front. Not only will you keep yourself warm during those chilly winter months, but you will be showing off your school spirit.


If the dress code is lenient and doesn't have any restrictions on outerwear, opt for something simple and solid-colored. For example, if you have to wear a dark green plaid skirt and a khaki shirt, try a dark green cardigan or a black blazer.

, Hats can lend your uniform a chic, stylish look with minimal effort. They can be worn during any season, although the they might have to come off once you are indoors. Try a neutral-colored newsboy hat or a beret the same color as your uniform. Stay away from casual hats, such as baseball caps and visors. For example:


If your uniform has a red plaid skirt and a white blouse, wear a red felt beret for a chic, polished look.
If your uniform has khaki pants and a navy polo shirt, try a plaid newsboy hat in brown or plaid for a quick stylish look.

, By styling your hair, you can show off your creativity and individuality.Some places have guidelines on how you can style your hair, so altering your hairstyle daily may not be possible, but many don't have such restrictions. Choose a hairstyle that works with your hair length and compliments your face shape.


If you have short hair, you can spike it up with some gel or mousse, or you can brush it off to the side.
If you have longer hair, you can wear it pulled back into a ponytail, piled up into a bun, braided, or French braided. You can also simply create a side part and brush it off to one side.
Try varying the hairstyle from day to day. For example, you can go with an up-do (such as a bun) one day, and a low style (such as a flipped ponytail) the next.

, Buy a headband, clip, or ribbon that matches your uniform's color, and add it to your hairstyle. Similarly, you can wear hair accessories that fit the season or holiday, such as pumpkins and neutral colors during Autumn, and flowers and pastels during Spring.


If you cannot find a hair accessory that matches your uniform, you can make your own by purchasing a blank metal barrette and hot gluing fabric or ribbon to it.

, A little bit of makeup can not only help your natural beauty shine, but it can also help boost your confidence and highlight your best features. Choose neutral colors if you can, or one focal point on your face. Don't overdo your makeup. This is school, after all, and not a night out. For example:


If you want to wear bright red lipstick, pair it with a neutral eyeshadow.
If you want to wear a bold eyeshadow and lots of mascara, don't pair it with bright lipstick. Put on a light coat of lip gloss instead.

, Scarves don't have to be made from scratchy wool; they can be made from silk and worn around your neck. Try wrapping a solid-colored silk scarf around your neck and knotting it off to the side for a chic, stylish look. If you want something that looks more cute, try tying it like a bow tie instead, and center it in front of your neck. Use colors that match your uniform. If you want to be bold, try a bright color. For example:


If you have to wear a tan skirt and a white blouse, add some color to your uniform by wrapping a red silk scarf around your neck and tying it in a cute bow.
For a chic, polished look, pair a solid-colored silk scarf knotted around your neck with a solid-colored beret.

, Jewelry can add some extra sparkle and shine to your uniform, and set you apart from everyone else. If your dress code permits, pair your uniform with some jewelry. It can be simple and subdued or expressive and extravagant. Choose something that looks good on you, but that doesn't violate the dress code.


Simple jewelry includes: stud or post earrings, pins, a delicate chain necklace with a small pendant, or a thin wire bracelet.
Statement jewelry includes: hoop or dangling earrings, necklaces made from large beads or containing large pendants, and thick and colorful bracelets or bangles.

, Uniform cardigans, jackets, and sweaters don't have to look simple and dull; you can make yours more unique by adding a patch or small pin. For example:


You can wear a small pin with your initial and birthstone on the collar or lapel of your jacket.
You can apply a patch to the front of your jacket, or sweater. For example, you can iron or stitch an embroidered patch with your school emblem to the left shoulder of your jacket, right over the heart.

, You can make your uniform pants more colorful and unique by adding a belt. Try pairing khaki uniform pants with a brown belt, and navy or black uniform pants with a black belt. If you want to be bold, you can wear a belt in a bright color, such as red or rainbow. You can also wear a leather belt with tooled or embossed designs on it.

, Just because you have to wear a plain uniform that looks like everyone else's doesn't mean that your bag or backpack should. Buy a bag or backpack with bright or interesting patterns. You can also go with a leather bag or a simple, solid-colored tote.


Consider having two bags or backpacks that you alternate throughout the year. Not only will you have another bag to use in case one breaks partway through the year, but it will add some variety to your outfits.
You can add more style and personality to your bag with some keychains, patches, and pins. Choose ones that reflect your interests. For example, if you like to read comic books, add a few keychains depicting your favorite comic book heroes.

, When buying your uniform, get a size that fits you properly. You might have to get a size that is larger or smaller than the one you usually wear.


Shirts: The shoulder seam of your shirt should rest on the edge of your shoulder without drooping down your arm. The cuffs of a long-sleeved shirt should come down to just past your wrists.Pants: You want the pants to rest comfortably around your waist or hips without sagging down. Sagging uniform pants will not have the same effect as sagging jeans. The cuffs should reach your ankles.
Skirts: The skirt should rest comfortably around your waist without sagging down. The length of the skirt will vary, depending on the dress code. Some places will require the skirt to end right at the knee, while others will accept skirts that are no shorter than 3-5 inches above the knee.

, If the waistband of your pants or skirt fits comfortably, but the rest of the garment is too long, you can hem the bottom. Simply fold the pant cuffs (or the bottom of the skirt) until you reach the desired length, and stitch it down. Be sure to use a thread color that matches the garment.


You can hem your pants or skirt using a sewing machine, but if you are renting the uniform, then hand-stitch the hem instead. This will make it easier to remove the stitching when you have to return the uniform.

, Uniforms are not meant to be worn like casual outfits, so tuck your shirt into the waistband of your pants or skirt, even if you don't usually tuck your shirt in. This lends a clean, crisp, and professional appearance, which in turn will improve the uniform's overall appearance on you.

, Sagging jeans may look cool, but sagging uniform pants will look sloppy. They will also most likely will violate the dress code.


If your pants are too loose, you may have to purchase ones with a smaller waistband, or secure them with a belt.

, A clean uniform will not automatically make a you look clean; you have to take care of yourself as well. This includes bathing every day, cleaning under your nails, brushing your teeth and combing your hair, and washing your face.

, When your uniform gets dirty, turn it inside-out, and wash it using cold water, then remove it right after the cycle ends. Turning your uniform inside-out before washing helps prevent fibers from piling,and a cold wash cycle will help preserve colors. A dirty, wrinkled uniform will look unkempt and messy, which will take away from its appearance.


Be sure to read the tag so you will know what materials your uniform is made from. Some fabrics might require warm water, while others cannot be washed at all. Cold water, however, is generally the safest and gentlest on fabric.
Try to air dry your uniform, as the drying cycle may damage the fibers. When air drying your uniform, keep it out of the sun to prevent fading.
Don't dry clean your uniform unless the tag's instructions say so. Some uniforms may be damaged by dry cleaning.

, When you are not wearing your uniform, either hang it up in your closet, or fold it up and store it in your dresser. This will prevent wrinkles from forming, and keep your uniform clean longer.

, Wrinkles will detract from your uniform's appearance, so you will need to iron them out if they form. Read the tag on your uniform to find out what material your uniform is made out of, as this will help you determine what setting to use on your iron. Cotton fabrics generally require a higher setting than synthetic fabrics, such as polyester. Don't iron your uniform if it is dirty, as you risk sealing the dirt in.


If tag says not to iron, then don't iron your uniform. Instead, hang your uniform in the bathroom while you are taking a shower. The hot steam will remove the wrinkles.

, When you leave school, put your uniform away. This will help prolong the longevity of your uniform, and keep it clean longer., Sometimes, fibers may attach themselves to your uniform, which will detract from its appearance, but a lint roller will remove them quickly and easily. You can purchase lint rollers in pet stores, super markets (usually in the laundry detergent section or the pet supply section), or in a fabric or arts and crafts store.


If you don't have a lint roller and you find that fibers have attached themselves to your uniform, you can remove them with a piece of tape. Simply tear off a bit of tape, press it over the effected area, and then remove it.

, When your uniform develops a small tear or rip, or a button comes off, mend it by hand-sewing the damage. Be sure to use a thread color that matches the fabric or button, and that you are using the smallest stitches you can.


If your uniform pants or jacket develop a hole in the knee or elbow area, get rid of it—or donate it. Ripped jeans may look cool, but ripped uniform pants will only look old and messy.

Style your hair differently.",How to Look Good In Your School Uniform2," For a male uniform, your school’s dress code will determine whether you have to wear a tie, if you have to button every button or if you can get away with leaving a few open, what shoes you can and can't wear, and whether you always have to wear a collared shirt.

, The basic school uniform usually consists of pants or shorts that are paired with a dress shirt, but you may also have the option of a blazer, a vest, or a sweater that can be worn over your shirt. These different apparel items can be paired differently to achieve different looks, and there are various style choices you can make with each to make your uniform a little more unique.


Pick clothing in the right size, because the baggy look is mostly out, and clothes that are too tight will be uncomfortable.

, For a laid-back look, try a 90s-style Kurt Cobain cardigan. For a folky look, wear a vest, sweater vest, or fitted blazer. If you want to try for a dressed up casual look, pull a sweater over your shirt.

, To give your uniform a little more style, undo the top button on your shirt or polo and upturn the collar so it stands up.You can do this with your blazer or jacket as well, but choose one or the other: don’t pop the collar on your shirt and your blazer.

, This allows you to control the length of your shirt, which can make your uniform look less oversized and more fitted. Tuck your shirt in completely, and then slowly pull it out to puff it out slightly. If you want your shirt a little longer, pull out a little more shirt and fold the excess down over your waist.

, Instead of wearing your pants higher up near your waist, let your belt out a little so you can wear your pants lower on your hip., Along with rolling up the cuffs on your sleeves, you can actually roll up your blazer sleeves as well. This look works well with the popped collar.

, Accessories like a vintage watch,a briefcase instead of a school bag,a funky or elegant tie, or a great hat can make any uniform a little cooler. For hat ideas, try an ivy cap, a fedora, or porkpie with your uniform.


Try wearing a tie over your shirt but underneath a sweater, or paired with a cardigan.Try leaving your tie knot a little looser than normal., There are tons of interesting hair styles that are popular right now that could give your uniform a new dynamic, especially when paired with a cool tie, watch, and hat.

Think about what your school gives you to work with already.,
Use this to your advantage.,
Start with a good base.,
Get some nice, unique shoes.,
Do something with your hair.,
Accessorize!,
At the end of the day, the tip to being successful and unique in school, is to read the rules and compromise!,
Make up.,
In winter always take a lip balm with you to school because then your lips are likely to get chapped with the cold and chapped lips are not nice to look at!",How to Jazz up Your School Uniform," Do they have a policy? If so, have a read! What is it saying? Does is specify certain colours of socks or tights?;
, For example, blazers might be required. Try jazzing it up a bit by pulling off all the boring black buttons and sewing on multicoloured star and lady bird buttons! There certainly wasn't anything about that in the policy!!!

, Have solid pieces such as a skirt, a pair of trousers and 2 or 3 shirts or blouses. How could those be modified to be different, yet acceptable? How about buying a fitted blouse or having a slightly shorter or longer sleeve length? Why not add a belt for instant glamour? If you had a jumper as many schools do in the winter you could roll or fold your sleeves up so your shirt rolls up it, creating a white cuff at your elbow which is very fashionable at the moment. Could you go for a different type of trousers? There are plenty to choose from, wide leg, pedal-pushers or shorts (if you're very brave and your school allows it!) What's your fave style of trousers out side of school? Try this style with your uniform... some schools may even allow black skinny jeans as long as they are very plain.

, Love them or don't care about them, they can make or break an outfit. Try black converse or pumps or doc marten boots. have a look at what others are getting away with and explore! Remember to keep it comfortable, you'll be moving about all day. So girls that may mean choosing a lower heel or ballet pumps!

, Hair is one of the main things we remember about people. We remember people with waist length hair afros, in fact anything unique like colour always gets remembered! Think about someone at school - i bet you can remember their hair in detail! How they wear it, what colour it is and so on. So experiment. Try different braids, styles from other countries and different techniques such as using paper or rags to curl your hair. (it works! Google it!) There has never been so many products and ways to style your hair so get out there and experiment! Many schools may not agreed to false colours, gels or extensions, but there are plenty of accessories you can dress your hair up with!

, Girls will know all about this one. But what about the guys? Try finding a signature baseball cap (take it off indoors, to avoid a telling off) or a wrist sweatband that has an interesting motif. Both guys and girls can wear scarves, what ever colour. Cute guys can get away with more feminine colours, rocker boys could wear a thin scarf and simply cold guys can wrap up their crushes in thick wooly scarves! Girls can wear any type of scarf they like as there are many out there on the market, from ornate Easter looking ones to stripy wooly ones, there's bound to be something to suit your style! You can add badges to your bags, blazers, jumpers, shirts, scarves, hats, even pencil cases! They'll go anywhere and everyone will know what you're into! maybe you could even wear rainbow stripy socks!

, If you follow the rules, and manage to improvise without actually breaking any then you should be A-Okay!

, Many schools do not allow this, so make it minimal and unique. Many make up brands have sheer eye shadows which allow you to wear your fave colours without it being outlandish. You could always go for a 50's pin-up girl look, or even adding things such as false lashes only in the corners of your eyes or a beauty spot. Lip gloss is a school girl's best friend. Or if you're not so into make up fruity or bizarre flavoured lip balms keeps things zingy!

Don't use any creams except moisturizer in the mornings.

, The steam opens your pores. Use a set that has a scrub, toner, and moisturizer. If you want, you can use a spot treatment to clear up zits. Always rinse with cool water. It closes your pores. NEVER rinse with really cold water, it can close your pores too tight and cause blackheads.

, To have a really fresh mouth, use these steps: mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash. To make your breath feel even more fresh and clean, pop in a mint or chew some sugar-free gum.

, Wear something cute and clean. Never wear something that MIGHT be clean. It might smell clean, but it might not look clean or the other way around. Don't assume nobody will notice a small stain, even if you cover it up, someone will. A Tide-to-Go pen is great if you get a stain during the day, I highly recommend it. Never wear a revealing top AND revealing bottoms. It looks cheap. Wear one or the other. For shoes, flats are foolproof- comfortable and stylish. Try to have a basic pair of both brown and black, they go with practically everything. Heels can make you seem too old if you're very young and can be hard to walk in. If you're old enough, stick with two inches or lower for day, but if you want to go a little higher for a special occasion or night out, go ahead.

, Do it whichever way you want, as long as it looks well kept. Use hairspray, but not too much or it can backfire on you. Don't shampoo every day, all you'll get for your trouble is brittle ends and greasy roots, yuck! If you're hair gets greasy on the second or third day, however, dry shampoo is a handy thing to have. Heat styling ,may deliver best results for curling and straightening, but don't use these too often because they can fry your hair. Use a good heat protectant if you're using any kind of heat, even a blow dryer. I recommend the Tresemme Heat Taming Spray, it works wonders.

, Put on deodorant, lotion, body spray, perfume, etc. Try buying a set or relentless ones because to many scents make you smell like a walking perfume factory. Obviously, these things should be effective and in scents you like, but be careful with body spray and perfume during the day. Try a lighter or fruity scent so you don't knock out everybody in your lecture hall or office. Body sprays are generally less concentrated in smell than perfume, so it's better for the daytime. Whatever you do, don't use too much. Nobody likes being around a person whose perfume is so strong to where they can taste it, guys especially hate that. Just go easy on the scents, it's that simple.

, It's better to own a few nice pieces of jewelry than a bunch of cheap stuff you'll throw out within a month. If you need help on finding classic pieces or don't know what looks best on you, ask your mom or sister. Try to have one signature piece like a charm bracelet or ring that can go with anything. Charm bracelets are great because you can personalize them so its all your own, the Italian style ones are really nice. If you are going to use a bold statement accessory, be it a necklace, scarf, ring or whatever, keep the rest to a minimum. Wear pearls by day and diamonds by night. They don't have to be real, but they can't be plastic. In fact, steer clear of plastic, fake leather, (unless it's nice, I mean the cheap kind), and nickel.

, You don't HAVE to wear makeup, but if you do, make yourself look polished and use a natural look for every day. It doesn't have to be channel, but don't buy Chinese makeup. Walgreen has a surprisingly good selection of budget makeup. Most girls who wear makeup for the first time are clueless on how to wear it, so turn to an experienced person, magazines or YouTube tutorials for help. If you have a facial feature you like a lot, make it stand out and keep everything else subtle. NEVER do a dramatic eye AND a bold lip, it will make you look like a clown or a drag queen. Doing one or the other for special occasions can be very classy if done right. Mastering makeup takes practice, but once you've got the hang of it, there are no limits to what you can do. Eyeshadow and eyeliner are hard to master. For your first time, go with bold lip. You can never have to many lip products if you are a beginner.

",How to Be a Hot Chick," In the modeling world, models are classified by type. Are you a natural beauty (meaning you look pretty even without makeup and in sweatpants)? Do you look exotic?;
, Do you look so feminine you make men feel like a man just by standing next to them? Or are you a flawless beauty (meaning you look gorgeous even with some acne/flaws)? Find out what you are and don't try to be anything else. Show 'em you don't need a guy to define who you are. It's super hot.

, What do you like about yourself physically? Stay proud of who your body type. Find out which outfits and makeup accentuate your best features: Are you tall and leggy? Wear cute short skirts! Are you ""well endowed""? Wear a sexy v-neck! Got a tiny waist? MID-DRIFTS, PEOPLE!! Do you have gorgeous eyes? Cute nose? Pretty pout? Play 'em up!

, If unsure what they are, ask a few people. Makeup is the icing on the cake (though some guys prefer a clean face, too). First, use a concealer or foundation to blind-away zits and acne. After that, think back and remember what compliments you received in the past: Anyone ever say you have nice eyes? Play them up with attention-grabbing eye shadow that makes the color pop (purple and green look wonderful with brown and hazel eyes, while smoky blacks and browns accentuate blue and green eyes). Do you have a pretty pout? Two words: Lip Gloss! AND LADIES PLEASE DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE CLASSIC RED LIPSTICK! It may not be what everyone is doing nowadays, but it's such a classic, polished look, I guarantee all eyes will be drawn to your lovely mouth!

, Men are very primal creatures that respond when all senses are stimulated. So a dab of scented body lotion, a drop of perfume, or a spritz of body spray can't hurt. Always remember a little goes a long way because guys hate it when girls over-do it in that department!


Note* Studies show that men are more aroused by scents that remind them of their favorite foods: fruit sprays are sexy, exciting and sassy, while candy scents (vanilla or even cotton candy) are winsome, innocent and playful. If you make em hungry, they'll want a bite!

, Don't gush or they'll get the idea that they're ""too good for you""... Guys get dumb like that sometimes. But you'll get more flies with honey! If you make a guy feel good about himself when he's with you, he'll want to be with you more and more and more. A little compliment can go a long way, even something so small as ""You're so funny!"" can brighten any guy's day. *Note* Men are generally accomplishment-oriented. If you make him feel encouraged that he CAN DO IT (whatever ""it"" is) he'll fall head over heels. Make him feel like he can conquer the world! Be a personal cheerleader for him! Why do you think guys say cheerleaders are always hot??? (aside from the short skirts, of course)

, Models have a ""runway walk"" that always make heads turn. Learn how to do it and practice practice practice! One model suggested walking with your back straight, chin up, and push your pelvis slightly forward, rotating your hips in a backward circle with each step (think Shakira-hips). This will make them swivel a bit when you move. Now, when you step try to step with your toe touching the floor first, THEN your heel, like a cat. Look straight forward as if to say "" I know you're all JEALOUS of how gorgeous I am, and you should be!"" Smirk a little, as if you know something they don't know and it's a secret.

, You hear the modeling agents and whatnot bragging about ""attitude attitude attitude"". What they mean is CONFIDENCE. This starts from within. KNOW you're hot, and you will be.

, Don't compare yourself with others because in reality, they're probably comparing themselves with you! You've got what it takes, girl, every woman does. You just gotta find it inside, bring it out, and FLAUNT IT, BABY! Make those boys DROOL!

Don't act immature.",How to Enjoy Uniforms More," There is nothing you can do if the head of your school wants students to wear uniforms. You'll have to live with it, no matter how hard.;
, Having uniforms means less time stressing on what to wear to school. It also means that everyone is dressed the same, so, some people that don't have great fashion sense don't feel left out.

, One of the worst - looking types of uniforms are the ones that are way too big or way too small. Tight-fitting clothes will be uncomfortable to sit in, and will attract your strict teacher's attention.

, Okay, you're not the prettiest girl at school- so what? You may think uniforms make everyone look alike, but faces are all different. There is no one like you. Express your individuality by styling your hair different, or wearing cool earrings.

, Take a shower in the morning, preferably a cold one, to wake you up! Scrub in some lovely-smelling shower lotion and wash off. Apply some body lotion and deodorant. Smelling good is vital with uniforms too. Smell different and feel different, too.

, Some schools don't allow a trace of makeup. Apply a little mascara and a nude shade of gloss. Voila! Natural beauty here she comes!

, If you're feeling hot, ask to turn on the AC or drink some water to cool off. If you're cold, bring a sweater(according to the rules,) and ask to turn off the AC. Hem your skirt if it's too long.

, You'll be walking around a lot. Make sure it's okay with the rules of whatever shoes you want to wear. Black tennis shoes are cool as well as comfy. Think about it!

, Crying about uniforms won't help and will make you depressed easily. It's just wearing uniforms! Don't feel as if you'll never get used to it- you will.

, It's not about the makeup. A person should be able to accept you as you are beneath the cover. Nobody is perfect.

,, They are the mid-range common-life with a universal style.

, Stick to a basics! Being a floater is more about your personality, not what you wear.

, Play a sport, participate in band/choir, be a part of a school play, have a part time job, and be in many clubs that you are interested in. This way you can be social & meet many people and have friends from different cliques. It doesn't matter if you don't excel in sports or are a good actor or could sing or play an instrument well. Just join in to be as active & healthy as can be and feel free spirited. Even if you think it's a sport you may not like, you just might. Also new experiences introduces us to things we may do well but never would have known without taking that opportunity.

, Use your own filter- Some songs you may like, others you may not. Remember it's not about the group or the label. You may actually like a couple of those opera songs, a few country, a lot of psychedelic.. Who knows! Don't just think, ""If it's not labelled soft or hard rock"" I won't like it. Mix it up & listen to a broad selection. Don't just say you like the music just because it's what your friends like or is the latest fad. If you like it and others say it's geeky or uncool well SO WHAT! Don't let that make you give it up, just listen to it on your own time. Listen to the music for the music, not for the social aspects of it.

, Be very nice to everyone. Be very confident.Be polite and considerate.*Give people the benefit of the doubt. Don't give in to gossip or rumors. Draw your own opinion in person. Never use the phone-line system. Always confront people in person with issues at hand and never bring in a third party person unless required as safety measure.

, It's not important the number of friends you have. What you consider is the quality of that friendship. Having 3 friends that treat you well is better than having 20 ""friends"" who disrespect you and others.

, That doesn't always require schooling and books either. We often learn more about people by observation and listening. We can learn new skills through hands on. Also, feed the mind. Inform yourself of history, politics, religion, psychology, geography, science, art, cooking.. Many different things. You can learn much of history, psychology, and sociology from that lonely old man in the coffee shop. Never feel ""because I'm a girl/guy"" that you shouldn't learn these things. Girls can learn mechanics, guys can learn about cooking and about other things that seem female related. In fact, wise guys would benefit in 'understanding' the female reproductive system.

, Your friends don't have to be the ""popular ones"" or the ""attractive ones"". They don't have to be the top athletes etc.

, If you wouldn't like something done to you, don't do that to them. Always be honest- No need for lies. Don't cheat on anything. That's the same as a lie. Who can ever trust cheaters and liars?

, Your friend can be that lonely child that gets picked on or that child in special ed or that old lady you pass each day. Everyone is your friend until they become your enemy. Strangers are potential friends.

, Things are just things. People are not just about the car they drive or the job they hold. To know others true self is to get to know them - quality time. All of the toys mean nothing in the end. What is here today can be gone tomorrow.

, Remember others are less fortunate than you are. We all have something to give of our time. Some of that knowledge you hold can benefit others and in turn improve our world. NO MAN IS AN ISLAND UNTO HIMSELF

, That's how ""cliques"" are formed.

, If you can get access to the internet or your parents allow you, get involved with sites such as Facebook, YouTube, Myspace, Twitter, Minecraft, etc. To keep up with friends and to make new ones too.

Be proud of your type!",How to Be a Fabulous Diva," It is always important to keep yourself nice and fresh and have good hygiene. Take a shower every day while using a sweet smelling body wash. After exiting the shower, top yourself off with some lotion so that your skin can stay soft.;
, Hair is one thing that everyone looks at; wear it naturally, however, you wish to, but make sure it looks as if you walked out of the salon. The nicer it is the more compliments, but the tackier it is, the more gossip. Wash your hair every day or every other day. If you are African-American wash once a week or whatever works for you. Educate yourself on what works best for your hair. If you need to, use products that add shine, volume, and most of all can stay. Always comb and brush your hair.


Work with your natural hair texture. For example, if you got waves or curls, invest in a curl-defining mousse or cream to keep them pretty and to prevent the frizz. Or if your hair is naturally straight, use a straightener in the morning and a shine spray to keep it from becoming limp and lifeless.

, You should always wear clothes that fit you. Not too big, not too small, not too long, and not too short. If you have a slim figure, wear jeans or even if you have a curvy figure wear long skirts. And always make sure that your clothes are clean.

, Try rings, necklaces, bracelets, (etc.) to bring the best in you out. But don't try to put on too much or it will look tacky.

, The first thing people look at is your face, which means you should have great skin. Buy a body lotion for your arms and hands. Wash you face with a mild wash, tone it, and moisturize it. If you have acne try seeing a doctor if results do not show within 3 months. Don't forget to drink at least 8 glasses of water (64oz.) a day to help your skin glow and to get rid of toxins. Exfoliate at least twice a week.

, Make sure that they are healthy. If not, people will be turned off easily. If you want to hide it then get them done at a salon. A nice French manicure or whatever helps you find your inner diva.

, Last but not least, you want to keep your insides as well as your outsides clean. Eat lots of fruits and veggies. Drink water very often too. And work out 3-5 times a week for 30-90 minutes. This is very important and the golden rule to looking great.

, Don't be afraid to get bold with it! Go to the store and buy makeup items (such as mascara, foundation, lip liner, eyeliner, blush, etc.) that you are willing to wear. Each day, wear your makeup differently. For example, one day go for a natural look with lip gloss, and the next day some sparkly eyeshadow. Whatever you decide to do, keep it looking gorgeous.

, 7-10 hours is best. Lack of sleep will cause dark circles, laziness, weight gain and an ugly look for you.

, A true Diva always looks her best and this can be accomplished with a single item. Lip gloss instantly makes your whole face look wide awake and makes you look good without needing a lot of makeup. Carry lip gloss and apply frequently during the day to maintain your great Diva style.

, If you can sing, sign up for a talent show. If you can model, start taking some pics. Great at dancing? YouTube, here you come! All true divas have a wondrous talent worth showing.

, You gotta strut your stuff, learn to stand up for yourself and never let any haters bring you down.

, All divas are worth thinking about. Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, and Jessica Simpson have manners. You know, ""please"", ""thank you"", ""no thank you"", ""yes please"", ""ma'am"", ""sir"". Stay classy in what you say.

, You have to take some pride, and show your personality. But remember to be polite to others. Don't talk back to your teacher or parents. If you have sass, when you walk down the hall at school or some place public, everyone should be looking at you.

, Look up Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Denise Richards, Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Ariana Grande. These divas are all talented, confident, gorgeous and beautiful, but they all look totally different from one another. They don't have the same faces, bodies, skin,"

Sneakers are a great way to showcase your individualism while maintaining your comfort level. Also, ballet flats are pretty and come in all kinds of colors and designs.


If you do have to wear a style of uniform shoes, dress them up with colored laces or interesting socks.
Funky tights can also make your outfit look interesting.;
, While there may not be a whole lot you can do about changing the clothes that you wear during school time, you can change your hair. Experiment with different hairstyles that flatter your face or express yourself in cool ways.


A new haircut is another great way to change up your style.
You could try experimenting with wash-in wash out-or semi-permanent colors as long as they are not colors that are too bright, as they may be in violation of your school’s rules.
Style it with barrettes, clips, bows or headbands.
Experiment with different parts in your hair. Try parting it in the middle as opposed to on the side or vice versa.
Wear your hair up in a cool bun. You can experiment with different types of buns like sock buns, messy buns, or top knots.

, Wearing a watch, bracelet, necklace, or interesting earrings can be a great way jazz up your outfit and express your individuality. Seek out pieces that others may not have so you can differentiate yourself. Make sure to not violate the dress code.


You may want to wear items that are specific to your cultural heritage to express that aspect of your identity.

, Wearing a cardigan or jacket can be a nice way to transform your look into something unique and different from your classmates. Experiment with different colors, as long as they are permitted by your dress code, as well as different lengths and fabrics.


Monogramming a cardigan is a nice way to personalize your outfit and make it special.
You can also drape your cardigan on your back and tie the arms around your chest to make your look more preppy.

, Spruce up your outfit with earmuffs, a scarf, a vest, or gloves. This can be a fun way to stay warm while being stylish and unique.

, Changing the style of your belt can change up your whole outfit. Experiment with different materials like something metallic, velvet or patent leather. You can also use your own belt using crochet, macramé or weaving fabric from clothes you no longer wear.

, This is a great way differentiate yourself from your classmates but also adhere to the dress code. There are many cost effective options for these items that you can purchase online or in stores.


If you already have to wear a tie as part of your school uniform, find out if you can switch up the color or pattern. Perhaps you could add a logo or your initials.

, Select a bag with a cool pattern, color, or fabric to differentiate yourself. You can also personalize your bag by adding tags, pins and stickers.


For instance, you can really make yourself standout with a bookbag in a bright color like red or yellow.

, You can express your individuality through the type of binders, notebooks and pens you choose. Choose folders and notebooks with your favorite band or cute animals. Many companies have cool school supplies and there are plenty of options to purchase non conventional items. Make your ID stand out. If you have to wear a school tag all day, add cute pins or stickers to lanyards or your school ID card.

, You can use makeup to express your individuality and the right makeup can make you look attractive even in the most boring outfit. There are tons of makeup blogs and YouTube makeup artists out there to help you craft the perfect look.


Wearing bright lipsticks can be a cool way to stand out even in a neutral outfit.
Eyeshadows can also be a fun way to dress yourself up.
Check your school’s policy before wearing makeup that is too extravagant. There may be rules against wearing certain colors.

, Though you may not be able to change the uniform that you wear, you can choose the quality of the clothes. Buy clothing that is good quality and wash it following the directions on the tag to prolong their wear. Use detergent designed to keep your uniform looking better for longer.

, Expressing yourself can be achieved in many ways outside of clothing and accessories. Challenge yourself to self express in ways that extend beyond your body. Art can be a great way to achieve this goal.


You can try painting, drawing, coloring or any other mechanism to express yourself artistically.
Take an art class at your school to further develop your skills.
Try out pottery. Your school may offer pottery classes or there may be local pottery classes in the area that you can try.
Photography is another great way to be artistic. Capture moments that are beautiful to you with a camera or even with your smartphone. You can download apps on your phone to add interesting filters and edit the photos artistically.

, Music can be a great way for you be creative and to also enjoy the creativity of others. It can also serve as an outlet if you are dealing with anything in your personal life, positive or negative.


Listen to a new album by your favorite artist or branch out and listen to music you haven’t listened to in the past.
Learn to play a new instrument. There are many schools that offer classes on playing a new instrument as well as videos online to instruct you, as well.
Songwriting can also be a way to be expressive as well. You can write songs that express what’s going on in your life at the time or to discuss important topics.

, Writing can help you to get your feelings out on paper. Take some time to write a poem every once in awhile or perhaps a short story. You can also write down your daily thoughts in a diary or journal.


Writing letters to friends, family, or your significant other can also be a way to express yourself.

, Express yourself through using your body beyond your clothes. Playing a sport like soccer or baseball can allow you to express yourself physically and show and develop your strength.


Exercise can help you become even more skilled at a particular sport.

, Expressing yourself can also include just talking to people. Take more time to develop your relationships with family and friends, and to perhaps forge new ones.


Hang out with new friends and listen to music or paint together. You can be creative with others, too.

, Another way to express yourself and to be unique is through showcasing your culinary talents. Take some time to look up some easy recipes to begin developing or honing your cooking skills. As your skills progress, you can begin creating your own delicious recipes to share with others.

, The first thing you need to do is obtain a copy of your school dress code and read through it. That way you won’t be at risk of breaking any rules if you try to add an individual touch to your school uniform If you have any questions about the dress code, as a teacher or administrator.
Discuss the dress code with your parents and ask them for advice. They may be able to suggest ways to perk up your school outfits.

, Perhaps you notice someone wears a cool pair of earrings that really makes their overall look standout. You may notice that someone else got a great haircut that they get complimented on often. Consider doing something similar to tweak your own look while making sure that it is flattering to you personally.


Don’t copy the style of others in your school, but instead use their creativity to inspire your own.
Also make note of any ways that you see your classmates bend the rules of the dress code. Perhaps there is slight flexibility on some of the rules if you see your classmates consistently bending them.

, Perhaps you are required to wear a certain color pant or shirt, but there are no restrictions on shoes and jewelry. Understanding the flexibility of the dress code will help you find ways to showcase your own unique style.


Sometimes your school dress code may not be very specific on certain details. For example, while certain styles may be restricted, certain colors may not be.

, Many schools have separate sets of rules for girls and boys and take time to understand the rules that apply to you.


Be aware that certain sets of rules may be sexist. Many schools have much more restrictive rules for girls than for boys which is not okay. Talk to your parent or an adult that you trust about these rules and consider what you can do about them. , There are certain restrictions by law in many countries that your school cannot make. Some examples in the United States in particular include banning Muslim girls from wearing headscarves, requiring boys to cut their hair, or banning traditional tribal wear from graduation ceremonies. Learn more about the laws in your own country to ensure that your dress code does not violate them.

, Individuality and self expression are undoubtedly important, but so is your education. If you know that wearing a shirt that exposes your stomach or a shirt with an explicit message on it can result in suspension, it is best to not wear these things to school. No clothing is worth sacrificing your education. As long as the dress code does not violate your rights, you should try to abide by the rules.

Be graceful.,
AS for sports, just make sure you drink plenty of water to keep off red faces and sweat, and try your hardest.

Make sure your belongings are neat.,
Always be nice and generous.,
Concentrate in School.",How to Be a Ladylike Seventh Grader," Swearing a lot or talking really loudly in an accent people can hardly make out is most definitely unattractive, and not very lady like. Speaking well is quite an art. Find a good tone so that people can hear you without straining their eardrums or covering their ears. A medium tone is best. Speak very clearly and enunciate your words.;
, It may be hard to cut out, but swearing is one of the worst things you could do if you're trying to be ladylike. Try making a deal with your friends about not swearing for a day. Just think about proving to everyone you have the will power and self control to actually control and think about what comes out of your mouth. If you're a person who swears loads, this is not a ladylike thing. Definitely say things like ""shoot"" and ""idiot"". Try not to use bad words like ""crap"" They're not okay. Try to make very calm and civil comebacks, not the regular old stuff. It'll take practice, but it's a huge step towards being ladylike.

, You don't have to wear pink dresses or skirts with ruffles to be lady like, you may be surprised to learn. Just make sure all of your clothes are clean, suit you, and still fit. Really smart, well fitted pants or jeans, clean, fresh looking shirts, that kind of thing. Don't wear pants that show your underwear-if you need to, wear a belt. And don't wear tops that show to much of your stomach or are low cut. Just be stylish but safe.

, Nice outfits-jeans and shirts that suit you, skirts and tank tops, that kind of thing, leggings are nice too. Pair things up with a pair of shoes that fit and go with the outfit, and maybe a simple, plain chain and bracelet. Earrings can be a little long if you want-but nothing that is too violent.

, Sounds complicated but it's not. You could also try wearing a really light and clean top over a long sleeved white top. If the top you're wearing over it is very pretty and gives off the ""baby doll"" theme, you'll get the perfect, ladylike look. Experiment and play around.

,, Try not to curl or straighten your hair unless it's a special occasion. Your hair can be any length, it doesn't have to be very long.

, As for hairstyles, you can do anything. Side ponytails, braids, buns, anything. Just make sure the style won't come out during PE or anything, and that you won't have to keep adjusting it. Add a white, pink, or gold ribbon for a nice effect, and matching hair clips. The headbands with little bows on the side are very lady like too, and sweet.

, This is a difficult step, but also a crucial one. Being graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe. Just make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders rolled back and your back straight. Don't swagger, or swing your hips. It looks exaggerated and weird. Don't swing your arms either - keep them by your side.

,, Don't take huge bites either - just normal ones. Avoid eating anything that could get messy and sticky. Don't slouch when you're sitting in a chair-press your back against it and press your feet against the floor. Avoid folding your arms too-it gives off a ""Get lost"" vibe, and can make you look unsure about who you are and where you stand. Try not to put your hands in your pockets too much either. Just practice keeping them by your sides. It feels awkward, but actually looks completely normal.

, Label your things and look after them to make sure they don't get lost or damaged. Buy some nice pencils and pens-a nice, fancy pen or a cute colored pencil. Make sure you always have enough of everything-constantly asking to borrow things isn't very lady like.

, Having a selfish and nasty attitude towards others will drag you very far away from being lady like. Always have a smile on your face, and be willing to let people borrow things from you. Be nice to everyone, even people who you think are losers, because nobody is a loser and everyone is a human being. Everyone deserves a chance, so make sure you give it to them. Don't exclude people from games, gifts, or secrets, keep your promises and don't gossip. When someone gossips about someone else, politely tell them you find gossiping rather mean and would prefer not to. Don't be mean or hot headed-always keep your cool.

, It's important to be looked on as intelligent and keen at school. Try hard in every single, solitary subject and class you take, and always hand in homework. Don't talk during class-you have loads of time for that later. Don't pass notes either-it gets very embarrassing if you're caught. Ask questions and participate in class discussions. Try to get involved with the school and its' activities, too. Reading up on background information about a topic you're studying is good too, and can actually be interesting. Help others if they're struggling, and don't suck up to your teachers. Just try hard, be punctual in everything and share your knowledge.

Never be snooty to those less privileged than you.,
Expect, but do not demand, to be complimented: Smile nicely, and say ""thank you.""",How to Act Spoiled," Yes, a boy/girl can be the parents' ""little prince/princess"" Outside of one's own home it is harder to impress people. Avoid being helpless, putting on a ""baby voice"", pouting and making puppy eyes, or downplaying your ability to do work that may get your parents to serve you, but may appear a bit socially awkward. Don't act as if you are incapable of taking care of yourself in public/social situations.



Avoid making snobs your friends: Faking something you are not -- attracts fakes to you, as a leading faker yourself. People that are your friends when you are faking are just friends of the fake you. Make friends that are not very impressed by expensive or brand named stuff. Avoid clichés based on snobbery.;
, You should be extremely clean: Keep your hair perfectly combed/brushed; fret over keeping your nails and cuticles soft, dirt-free and neat. So you must clean up to seem as if you have others to do menial or dirty work. Expect and ask others to get and bring food and drink to you, and say ""Thank you"" and share to seem to have plenty. Brush your teeth and bathe/shower. Avoid excessive use of perfume/cologne, despite popularity of body-spray go light on it. Of course, being grubby isn't classy and isn't conducive to getting people to serve you, as you're acting spoiled. Never have gross, greasy hair.

, Spend less on trendy fad pieces. Do not wear the usual popular logo clothes and accessories. Spoiled kids don't need to wear logos to prove that they can afford expensive tastes. This is why you may see them in ripped jeans while wearing impressive jewelry.

, While it is preferable to wear well-made designer clothing, any clothing that you wear should be of good quality brands, well ironed, and clean. Prefer pink, tan, white or baby blue colors. Avoid black because it tends to fade in the wash and end up looking cheap.

, Buy somethings because they look simple and ""designer"".



Develop a dressy image; it's everything. Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy/posh. T shirts and sweatpants will not make it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or some designer ones. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some ""look like designer"" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Mossimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work.







, Excellent presentation is half the battle. Wear accessories which flatter your self image, and never wear anything you feel unclassy in. It is important to remember that modesty/refinement is key in earning the respect of others. A bit of cleavage may be fashionable, but classy gentlemen will appreciate public modesty more than street walker light exposure.



Wear quality but simple jewelry. Gold has a wealthy aura. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look.






You may buy inexpensive accessories but try to find pieces that look simple, but not cheap. Stay away from overly clingy fabrics, last year's trends, and obvious knockoffs. (Knockoffs are okay, if they look authentic).

, However, not much is needed. Look for ways to get enough money. Post ads on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples' lawns or rake leaves, but avoid being seen by friends from more elegant neighborhoods see you doing so. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or charming your aunts and uncles out of gift cards or cash.


With the money you have collected (anywhere from about $250-$2,000) you need to go shopping. Perhaps, go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Armani Exchange, Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the brand-name store (check tips for a minor addition to this section).







, You do not need to copy outfits exactly, but let yourself be inspired.



Be preppy, too. Wear Lacoste polos, Tommy Hilfiger sweaters, Calvin Klein jeans and Burberry scarves. Don't try to show-off that you wear expensive clothes. Rich people don't show others what they wear. Most of them buy designer clothes because they like them, not just for the label. Also, buy a Louis Vuitton purse. If you cannot afford it, buy a cheaper one. Avoid flimsy knock-offs, that look low in quality.

, Convince your mum to dress elegantly. Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress like a trendy-golfer or yacht owner. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfiger/Nautica polos and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford these, just convince them to always look elegant.



Get parents to help dress up the house. So, when friends come over, you have your ordinary house looking 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or of you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, your parents' best pictures -- and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pastel or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should have no clutter/mess kicking around; so sort out extras/junk into laundry-baskets, to stack and stash them out of sight in a closet.







Display what fine dining and etiquette mean. As clichéd as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like Béchamel and Beaujolais. And learn good table manners -- otherwise you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read and follow etiquette books.







Be generous with little things, mints, simple treats. Be pleasant, somewhat coy but approachable.

,



Be above physical conflict: Never let anyone bully you. If someone is bullying you in any matter, you do not put up with it. It is disgusting behavior, and you don't let anyone walk all over you.







Have a few possible peacemaking comments to respond with kindly, if someone is insulting you. If you cannot think of anything, the insults will come depending on the person. Always be nice to other people, unless you have something to say that will control them in a simple way.







Be polite and non-flustered. You mustn't be mean, because nobody likes a snobby, rich person. Rich kids are often trained (though unwillingly) in manners, and it shows. Learn some basic table manners for lunches at restaurants with friends. Never be rude to waitstaff, manicurists, sales clerks, etc. as this makes you look like you are not accustomed to being waited on by others. Rich kids often have personal trainers, tutors, drivers, and nannies, and are taught by their parents to be kind to those who serve them.







, It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word phrase every day like: ""aberrant (nutty or abnormal) behavior""; ""she is culpable"" (to blame); ""that is capricious (uncalled for)"", but don't say the meaning that is given here in parentheses. Having a vocabulary like this increases apparent elegance, charm and wit, which can be considered a must in higher circles.


Frequent bookstores and cafés: Being seen browsing a trendy book shows a sign of class. Having coffee or tea at hand also makes you look classy.







, Don't throw big, crazy parties; throw intimate gatherings, inviting only your better, classy friends. This way, you will save money but still get the reputation of throwing parties. In addition, your invitations will become more of a commodity in that people will hear about your exclusive parties and not automatically be able to go.


Don't be picky about every little aspect of everything. Rich girls can afford to be picky (or 'selective' as they would probably say), but if you complain about every bit of things, you just seem pretentious and annoying. Choose a few items that you really are selective about. For example, most wealthy people don't mind wearing clothes from Gap because everyone knows they can afford designer clothes. However, for example, many rich girls will never use cheap make-up. Most wear very little makeup preferring the natural look. They will say it will ruin the skin and they are right. They also will not be stingy in the matter of footwear, because better quality footwear molds to the feet for the most comfort, and they are the higher quality. Be picky about things that matter.







, People will respect you. Good posture is always a must.

, Be healthy, not into fad diets or other unhealthy junk food eating attitudes.

, Don't make comments like ""Her sweater is so cheap"". A rich girl who is well raised (not tacky) and would never say that, and this way if it is discovered that you're family is not wealthy, people will be more sympathetic.



Suggest that you are rich, but do not lie about it outrageously. Don't say that your dad is a partner in a law firm, that you have a driver and a summer home when you do not.







Don't talk about money. Seriously, it's tacky. Don't say ""This sweater cost $200"". It makes it sound like that is a big event for you and just sounds arrogant.







Never boast about your new styles. Wear them. Friends will compliment any new trappings without pointing them out rudely. If they don't notice, most likely they don't really care, and wouldn't be impressed anyway. So, they can be real friends.







, Don't act embarrassed or too amazed or impressed by yourself."

, Look unique, however,don't be to the point of looking tacky. If you have a patterned shirt, wear a normal bottom and so on. Mix in some trendy but still classic items like skinny jeans, thin knitted headbands etc..

, 4-6 people (including yourself) is best, and is even better if all of you are closely-knit. Never be in the kind of clique that is mean, snobbish, and gossips. Instead, be that the kind that is warm and inviting to everyone else.

, Even though you have a clique, at least make 5-7 friends outside the clique.

, Divas love to have fun! Be optimistic, it is much more fun that way.

, Brush it once a day, wash it at least twice a week, but don't dry it out and use good shampoo and conditioner.

, Weigh yourself once a month. Check your BMI every four months. Be sure it's for kids because adult ones are different. If you need to or just want to lose a few pounds. If your BMI says you're underweight, talk to a doctor about gaining weight. Some people are just naturally thin without any problems but some need to put on more weight. Always make sure you stay in a healthy weight that's OK for you. Eat at least three servings of fruit and three serving of vegetables a day and drink 32-48 oz of water. Exercise at least 60 minutes five days a week.

, Divas don't go around with stinky breath and gross hair. Keep your mouth clean and take a shower when needed. Brush your teeth after every meal (carry a mini toothpaste and toothbrush with you), wash your face when you wake up, before bed and after sports. Carry deodorant with you in case you get stinky.

, Always say excuse me when you need to use the restroom\burp\pass gas, and don't make fun of people who don't deserve it.

, Whatever it is, just do it! However, don't overdo it or you will be known as a show off, unless that's what you want.

, That is you and some friends, however many your parents allow over. Always make sure your parents are okay with it though. Sleepovers are great too.

Stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves (mentally disabled, animals, children, etc.). Be wary of those who appear to enjoy bickering. If someone is rude to you, either ignore him or her completely or, once you have calmed down and are thinking clearly, explain how you perceived their actions and work towards a resolution. You can also treat them politely while still maintaining your personal stance - be polite but make it clear without being intentionally hurtful or nasty that you don't appreciate what they are doing. Never stoop to their level, and do not be hasty to make judgments of other people. Surround yourself with positive, polite people who encourage and live your classy, intelligent lifestyle.;
, Being in the loop, fashion-wise, is a must. Try to read more fashion magazines to learn what kinds of clothing go well together and how to put together a classy outfit. Be sure to create your own fashion and have your own style, because it's not right to wear something that isn't you. It's often better to have a basic personal style than to always be chasing the latest ""fad"" look.


Have good taste in clothing: Be modest in clothing and avoid clothing of bad taste. Extremely low necklines, too short skirts, belly-baring tops and revealing clothing can make a girl look like she does not respect her body and herself. Shirts with inappropriate sayings, logos or sexual innuendos can make a girl look like she's desperate for attention. Classy ladies are not desperate for attention.

, Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe or shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use it sparingly. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing. Never have greasy hair. It is gross and trashy.


Take care of your skin. Skin should be well-cared for and clear of imperfections. Wash your face everyday and remember to wear sunscreen or shade hats. Try to give yourself a facial mask once a week.

, Other people may find the habit annoying or manly.

, This shows politeness. If you talk loudly, it will seem that you're desperate for attention. Being loud in public isn't just obnoxious, it is also inconsiderate to the people around you. Listen to what people have to say and always make eye contact.

, Having good posture is an important, and rare, trait. It can also improve your overall health.

, It's fun to attend a party, but leave immature and irresponsible behavior out of the equation. If you're at a party, be sure to socialize, but speak calmly and don't monopolize all the attention. If you drink, keep drinking minimal and in your tolerance level. Drunk ladies are not classy ladies. If you are underage, DO NOT DRINK.

, Classy ladies don't talk about sexual immorality and other trashy topics. Rather, they may talk about intellectual topics (books, art, politics/current events) or fashion and travel.


Increase your vocabulary, and stay away from slang terms. Never swear or say racist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted comments. This will only make you appear ugly and rude.

, Classy people are friendly people, those who always brighten their faces with a smile. It's an inexpensive way to improve your looks.


Be nice. If you're classy and want to be liked, you have to be nice. It's much better to be liked by people, so being nice and treating others well certainly helps. Being snobby isn't very classy, since it is an inherently rude quality, and classy people are not rude.
Always be kind and friendly to the people serving you (waiters, etc.). If you really want to know who is well brought up and classy, look at how they treat those with a lower social status, rather than how they respond to their equals or superiors.

, Loose waves with a hair band or even a ponytail are very appropriate in today's society.

, Parents will appreciate a girl who cares more about her education and her work ethic than her nails. This will reflect how you are viewed by those in authority.


Be responsible. Classy girls leave their surroundings in a condition at least as good as they found them. Unless they are in a restaurant with wait staff whose job it is to do the clearing up, classy people insist on taking care of their own trash and baggage, not expecting others to pick up after them. And when others do favors for them, while stuck-up or spoiled people assume it's only to be expected and ignore others' assistance, truly classy people are quick to notice and to express their gratitude and their appreciation.
Be socially aware. You must be courteous, but do not bend over backwards to please others. If you do, you may find yourself being taken advantage of in the future. Limit your time and availability and draw boundaries with others so that they are aware of your limits.

, The classy lady listens more than she speaks. Having a strong vocabulary is important, but do not use a word unless you are certain of its meaning. Use words to express yourself lucidly. Also, do not correct others when they use improper grammar. Differences in background, family life, and education cause people to speak differently, and people often use slang for effect. More than this, it is irritating and degrading to be corrected by a know-it-all.

, Intelligence is key. You don't have to be a bookworm to be intelligent and you don't have to show off, but ignorance of current events is not becoming of a classy girl. Brush up on as many subjects as possible, because it will make you seem well-informed.

, Most people will agree that using swear words casually exhibits an inconsistent state of character. You will be much more impressive and impacting toward others when you use curse words less often, or remove them from your vocabulary entirely.

, Avoid passive-aggressive thinking; this is likely to trip you up eventually. Being calmly assertive demonstrates maturity, thoughtfulness, and confidence. Class requires balance, and assertiveness is a prime example of this concept.

, For example:


Blue eyes: Orange (complementary), Dark Blue, Dark Purple Light Green, Grey, white, Black, Turquoise (analogous) Blue-Purple (analogous),Dark Red. Colors to avoid are: bright red, lime green, hot pink, brown, baby blue, any tints (colors visibly mixed with white)
Brown eyes: Any Pink, Charcoal, any very dark color, Yellow (it brings out undertones in the eyes, despite it's undignified reputation) Green (also, undertones). Colors to avoid: none, brown is neutral, and so goes with everything.
Green eyes: Purple (it really does bring out the color of your eyes), Dark red (green's complementary color), dark blue, black, Brown, off-white. Colors to avoid: Grey, since it weighs down the natural tones in your iris, muting the color. However, if your eyes are bright green or blue green, gray brings it out quite nicely. Yellow, bright red (compliments can be jarring when both of the colors are vivid), bright white (too John Travolta), orange, and green (which drowns out your eye color).
Skin Tones: Ruddy Complexion blue-toned/pink after exertion/freckled): Cool colors (blue, purple, green, and all the analogous colors between them including Red-purple) Black, Grey. Colors to avoid: Yellow, and the corresponding analogous colors, any red (sorry)and White. Wear dark orange or red-orange at your discretion. Sallow (yellow toned/ tanning rather than freckling) any warm or neutral colors. Avoid yellow, but golds can look nice if you are African-American or have a darker complexion, you can wear almost any color. Golds are especially beautiful. If you have red hair: Golds, beiges, corals, purples, very dark or light greens (just avoid the ""Christmas green"" color) dark blues.

, Noting what is currently in fashion, try to settle on a few key items that will bring you the most value for the expenditure. For example, this might be a handbag or purse, a pair of jeans or a scarf. The other items can be from cheaper sources, glammed up by one or two expensive pieces.

, Smaller usually works better. At the end of the day, empty all of your change into this jar.


Go to the bank and request a few ""penny pack."" This are paper packs that you can roll up change into and exchange for bills. Get some in every denomination to have on hand.
Once your change jar gets full, empty it out and see how many packs you can make. Any excess change should go back into the jar. Take your packs back to the bank and exchange them. You may suddenly have 10 to 15 dollars you didn't realize you had in the first place.

, Don't overeat, don't brown bag it and have an excuse ready if your parents ask what you ate for lunch.


Do not skip lunch. It is unhealthy to starve yourself and people might incorrectly assume you have an eating disorder.

, That way you can get the things you want.

, Any form of income coming in is a source of savings for you.

, Plan on charging $5 an hour, more if there is more than one kid. If you can, get certified in CPR and take a babysitting class at the YMCA. Some parents are reluctant to let teenagers alone with their kids unless they have taken these classes.

, If babysitting isn't your thing, try a lawn mowing service or get a paper route. Some papers are delivered in the afternoon, so with those you would not need to worry about getting up early to deliver papers.

, Chores such as cleaning other people's bedrooms, cleaning the toilet, preparing meals, etc. can all be a potential source of income if you negotiate nicely and explain that you have savings goals.

, This can be a good way of bringing in extra income. If you're good at your schoolwork or certain subjects, set up a small tutoring service. Get references from teachers at first, and as you build up a client base, ask your clients for references too, so that you can build your business.


Tutor younger children over the summertime.

, Pet-sitting and dog-walking are two great ways to earn an income while caring for furry friends. Many people need this help, often at the last minute, so make it clear that you're always available to help out. If you don't know the people, have a parent come along with you when you seal the deal first.

, Go to a local consignment shop or sell them online. Ask your parents for permission and assistance with online selling; there are potential hazards to doing this that someone older should be keeping an eye on for you.


Pull out the phone book. Look under ""Secondhand Stores,"" ""Resale Shops,"" ""Consignment Stores,"" and ""Thrift Shops."" Get out a phone with a bunch of minutes on it, and go down the list and ask if they purchase used clothes. You probably will have the best success with consignment shops, but keep in mind that they usually take 50% of the price you sell it at for themselves, paid only upon sale.
Sell in season clothes that are in good condition only.

, If you don't feel like making the effort to do this, you can always donate your old clothes to Purple Heart, The Salvation Army, or another charity group that will put your unwanted items to good use. Or, you can donate your slightly used clothes to Plato's Closet. While donating, check out what is for sale in the store; you never know what bargain finds you might come across.

, And keep taking back your old ones for sale; that way, it keeps going and going. Yes, you may have to sell a lot of items to make enough to buy one new one, but it is a necessary task for a cash-strapped teen.

, Before you try on anything that is full-priced, see if there are items that are on special already. Try to see such items as hidden gems if they're not quite perfect––are there sewing or decorative changes that you can make to these clothes to improve them? If so, they might be just the thing you're looking for. Moreover, if you are taking clothes or accessories from the clearance section, you may be able to purchase more than one item.

, Such online sources are usually much cheaper, and can be more than 75% cheaper than buying it from the store itself. The downside is someone may have worn it first, for it to be so cheap, but a lot of the time the stuff is brand-new things that people bought and forgot to return before the refund date, or maybe got as a gift and didn't want it. Maybe they are just throwing out old clothes or they have grown out of it - Whatever way they've decided to sell, it could be yours. Try looking on the 'Buy it Now' section rather than bidding for it, and be sure it ships to your area. You could do that too - unwanted old clothes that other people might want? Sell them on ebay!

, If you look hard enough, you can find occasional expensive brands for a fraction of the usual price.

, If your teeth are crooked, get braces. This is simple hygiene. Ladies' teeth shouldn't rot out of their mouths.

, Your makeup should be classic and unoffensive. Men truly are attracted to women whose faces they can actually see! This means wearing only mascara with matte lipstick - not gloss - and bronzer.

, Most guys think acting like jerks to girls or talking about sexual things with them will attract them. Be a gentleman; hold the door open for her, pull out her seat, and help her if she needs it. There is not surviving code of chivalry, but here's the gist: Respect women. Defend your friends. Solve things peacefully.

, Don't slack off in school. Do your homework, pay attention, and answer questions if you know the answers. Guys usually think acting out in class is funny. It just makes them look bad. Being smart is also not doing drugs or drinking. That is definitely not classy. Stay away from all that stuff. Pick the right friends.

, Become more well-informed. A good vocabulary is crucial to sounding intelligent and being intelligent. Read from both sides of the argument.

, Don't use slang or curse. That just shows lack of intelligence.

, Bragging is not classy in any way. Girls will respect you and hold you high if you are one to listen. It gives you a bit of a mysterious side. Talk about intelligent subjects.

, Instruments, art, athletics, and theatre arts are all things that should be taken into consideration. Don't play an instrument? Pick up something like piano or guitar, or another respected instrument.

, A classy man smokes only the finest cigars. Do not abuse this privilege. Smoke only during special occasions with your close friends and never to impress a woman.

, At the very least,don't get drunk.

, No matter what, you can't please everyone. Some guys may try to pick a fight with you because you're different. Take the high road and just walk away. It's that easy. Fighting does not make you a man, it makes you a child.

, Hooking up is not classy. You should only do that kind of stuff with your girlfriend. Don't push her to do anything. Just because you are dating doesn't mean she wants to have sex with you. Also, if you and your girlfriend part ways, don't talk bad about her. Don't tell everyone she was a bad kisser, a mooch, etc. If you want to be really classy, don't do that at all, wait till marriage.

, It isn't classy in any way to pick out someone's imperfections. Some things in others' lives are influenced by their family background or heritage. No one wants to be criticized by a snob.

, Act like you are interested in what everyone has to say, and soon you will be living it out. Everyone deserves a listen some time or another.

Keep your shoes and clothes clean.",How to Act Like a Rich Girl," You can have the most expensive clothes and accessories, but they mean nothing if you don’t have confidence. Try listening to your favorite music before you go into a social situation, smile and stand up straight, and make eye contact with people. This will let people know you’re confident and friendly, and you’ll look like a million bucks.


To relax, breath in through your nose for four seconds, and out through your nose for four seconds.Before going into a situation where you need a boost of confidence, think about a time in your past that you had a great success. Maybe your sports team won a big game, or you got an A on a difficult test or paper. Then think about how that made you feel, and the confident way in which you spoke and acted afterwards when telling friends or family. Carry that same confident attitude into your current situation.;
, Wealthy people are often raised to be well-mannered. It may seem simple, but just remembering to say “please” and “thank you” in many social situations goes a long way. You can follow rules for proper table manners and other etiquette, but the best thing you can do is simply be kind to others. When in doubt, remember, “common good over individual gain.""In other words, speak and act in such a way that puts others before yourself.


Even if you disagree with someone, a polite way to respond is to show that you’ve been listening by beginning with “I see what you mean, but…” rather than just “I disagree.” , One of the first things other people may notice about you is the way you speak. Well-mannered and respected people use clear, intelligent language with a large vocabulary. Enunciate your words when you speak and read more to build your vocabulary.


Learn a new word every day easily with a word-a-day calendar or online dictionary., Read the front page of a newspaper or an online news site every day. Even if you don’t discuss current events with your friends, developing an awareness of the world outside your community is a sign of education and worldliness.


Use a news roundup website or app, or follow your favorite news sources on social media, to make keeping up with current events easy., Knowledge and education are hallmarks of the wealthy. No matter where you are in life, focus on further education—whether that’s finishing high school or a GED, completing a 2- or 4-year college degree, or going back to school for a Masters or PhD graduate program. Pay attention in class and put in the work it takes to excel in different subjects. Education not only makes you appear wealthy; it is the first step to actually earning money later in life.


If you have trouble focusing on school work, buy some cute new planners and notebooks to help you manage your time and homework. Then reward yourself for good grades with a new outfit, a manicure, or something else you’d love to have.

, Rich people often have many hobbies and social circles for each activity. You can easily do this too, often with little to no money. Try joining new clubs or classes, or sports that rich people often play, like golf, tennis, polo, sailing, or crew. You’ll meet new friends, learn a new skill, and gain confidence in something you might never have thought you’d be good at.


If you can’t join a new club or sport, start collecting something. It can be anything! Collecting makes for an enjoyable, and often inexpensive, way to easily become an expert on whatever it is you collect, which is impressive to other people and gives you something to talk about., Rich people climb the social ladder by volunteering their time to worthy causes. They meet new people and do something good for their communities. You can join a group like Girl Scouts, Habitat for Humanity, or Big Brothers Big Sisters, or pitch in to volunteer for a local organization to achieve the same respect and social standing as a rich person., Get your haircut regularly, and style it in a way that’s flattering on you and easy to maintain. For example, a sleek ponytail looks great on round faces, while oval-shaped faces are suited well to blunt bangs and straight hair.Go to a salon to get your hair done, especially if you’re dyeing it. Your hair will look much more chic when you get it done by a professional.

, Rich girls often look like they have flawless skin. Follow a skincare routine, like a three-step set of cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. Eat plenty of fruits, veggies, and nuts so that your skin glows and looks healthy from the inside out.


An easy way to make your skin look amazing is simply to get a good amount of sleep! Aim for 8-9 hours a night. Even if it’s slightly more or less than this, stick to the same number of hours each night and try going to sleep and waking up at about the same times, even on weekends., If you like wearing makeup, keep it simple and classy. It can add extra polish to a regular outfit and upgrades your look. But when it comes to makeup, less is more! A little foundation, mascara, and eyeliner is often all you need to enhance your natural beauty.


Find a foundation that matches your skin tone, and blend it evenly into your face, without caking it on. If you use blush, just the smallest amount dabbed on to the roundest part of your cheek works best. With eyeliner, just the thinnest line possible along your upper eyelid makes for a classy look that still defines your eyes nicely.

, Just like makeup, jewelry can really step up your outfit. But multiple rings, bracelets, and dangly earrings worn at the same time is overkill. Keep it simple and classy with one or two nice pieces of jewelry that complement your outfit for an elegant look.


You don’t have to break the bank to wear some nice jewelry. Small hoops or studs for your ears work with any outfit. A pearl necklace is a classic rich girl look, and you can find imitation pearls at reasonable prices. A gold chain with a charm is another classic that looks as good with jeans and a t-shirt as it does with a little black dress.

, Rich girls can afford professional in-office whitening treatments from their dentists, but if you want to achieve the same look of shining white teeth, you can do it for less at home with whitening strips, toothpaste, and mouthwash.

, Even if you can't afford a manicure every weekend, make sure your nails are clipped, filed, and buffed, and your polish is fresh. Use a topcoat over your nail color to make it last longer.

, You don’t need to buy the designer labels that rich girls wear to have an expensive-looking, put-together outfit. Shopping at outlets is a great way to find stylish clothes that won't cost as much.


Base your wardrobe on classic separates that you can mix and match, using neutral colors. Then you can spice them up with a colorful trendy item or two. When trends change, your reliable basics will still be with you.
Try following the “one-third rule.” Buy one-third of the clothes that you usually do, but spend three times as much on the item of clothing. Instead of having several cheap pairs of pants that all don’t fit you quite right, spend that money on one perfectly-fitting pair that you can wear everywhere., No matter the quality of your clothes and shoes, they will look much more elegant if kept in good condition. Polishing shoes and cleaning, ironing, and lint-rolling clothes will make you look your best. People are impressed with accessories that look good, no matter the brand."

Be yourself.",How to Act Like a Celebrity1," The most important part of acting like a celebrity is confidence. Most celebrities you can name all have one thing in common: they are very charismatic. Charisma usually comes from confidence. Being secure and feeling sure of yourself will go a long way for your popularity.To boost your confidence, make a list of your talents, accomplishments, and positive personality traits. Write down specific examples on a sheet of paper.Tape the paper somewhere visible that you'll see every day, like your desk or the inside of your bedroom door. Try to take the time to read off at least a few of these things to yourself each time you see the list.
Use your positive qualities to create self-affirmations. Think or say to yourself things like: ""I am smart,"" ""I am kind,"" and/or ""I am beautiful"" whenever you start to doubt yourself.
Try to be more outgoing. Don't expect other people to talk to you first. Strike up conversations with strangers when waiting in line. Don't be afraid to introduce yourself to new people.;
, Having confidence in yourself is often a difficult skill to master. Even celebrities and well-accomplished people can struggle with having enough confidence. When you're trying to act like a celebrity, it's important to look confident even if you don't feel that way.



Maintain good posture. Other people tend to interpret good posture as confidence. Always sit and stand with your back straight and your shoulders back. Try to distribute your weight evenly and avoid hunching over.Keep negative thoughts and words in check. Try your best to avoid being critical of yourself and others.Don't gossip behind other people's backs.
Make and maintain eye contact when speaking to others. Avoiding eye contact or looking away too quickly will make you seem nervous or even dishonest. In contrast, holding eye contact will be interpreted as a sign of confidence.Try to do little things to help out other people. This can be as simple as holding the door for someone or buying a stranger a coffee.Try to give genuine compliments more often!
Many of these tricks will actually have you feeling more confident as you try your best to look it., As a ""celebrity,"" you want to look happy with your life. Smiling also makes you feel more confident and helps to boost your charisma.


If you're worried that your natural smile isn't flattering, try improving it. Stand in front of a mirror and practice different ways to smile.

, Try to look glamorous and put together no matter how casual a photo may be. Do your best to relax your muscles to avoid looking tense. If you're relaxed, your pose will seem natural and effortless.The pose that will have you looking your best will be unique to you, so try practicing in front of a full length mirror to find the right one. Here are a few classic poses you can master:


If you want to accentuate your legs and show off a pair of cute shoes, go for a ""knee pop."" Simply stand with one leg straight and the other bent slightly at the knee. Because this pose photographs well from multiple angles, it's a great one to pick when you're not sure exactly how the camera lines up with your body.
Another versatile type of pose is the ""hand on hip."" Simply stand with one hand on your hip with your shoulders dropped and relaxed. You will look elegant without being too posed. If you don't mind your pose looking obvious, try the same stance with both hands on either hip. Instead of relaxing your shoulders, square them off and stand straight.
If you're going for a flirty, youthful look, the ""kick back"" may be right for you. Stand sideways in relation to the camera with just your face aimed towards it. Lift one leg up at the knee as high as you can go while still keeping your torso balanced and straight. Be sure to occupy your hands with something like holding your purse and/or playing with your hair., Many celebrities are known for their philanthropy, donating large amounts of money or starting charities of their own. Even though you probably don't have that kind of cash, there are plenty of other ways you can emulate their charitableness. Volunteer for a local organization, such as a homeless shelter or an animal rescue. You can also organize a fundraiser at your school for a cause that's important to you.

, Celebrities, by definition, receive a lot of public attention. Try to find positive ways of garnering attention from those around you.


Develop a performing talent. Most celebrities found their fame through one of the visible performing arts, such as music, theatre, or modeling. Pick one or more of these that you're interested in and become more involved in it.
Be the first to volunteer when someone asks for help. When teachers or other students need people to work at an event, give them your time.
At social events when everyone else is waiting for someone to get things started, be that person. Be the first one on the dance floor. Organize social events. Do that awkward first round of karaoke.

, Most celebrities don't try to act any certain way. They became celebrities by doing what they love, whether that's acting, singing, or some other high-profile career. People love celebrities who are down-to-earth and authentic. While there's plenty you can do to act more like a celebrity, don't lose sight of your true self.

Maintain a healthy lifestyle.,
Surround yourself with a group of friends.,
Dress your best but wear what's comfortable.,
Wear oversized sunglasses.,
Remember that it takes a full team of professionals to keep a celebrity looking great.",How to Act Like a Celebrity2," Your overall health has a major impact on how you look. Many celebrities, especially performers who must rely heavily on their looks, follow strict diet and exercise programs.To stay healthy, you should aim for a half hour or more of physical activity a day that combines aerobic activity with strength training.

Eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, leafy green vegetables, and lean protein.Stay hydrated by drinking about eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid each day.Avoid potentially dangerous fad diets. Many celebrities are proponents of things called ""detox"" or ""cleanse"" diets that claim to flush out ""toxins"" from your body.These fad diets typically combine fasting with some type of fruit, vegetable, herb, or supplement. Despite their popularity, there is little evidence that these diets work, and they can cause serious side effects.Although many celebrities are known to indulge heavily in certain vices, such as drugs and alcohol, you should not try to imitate them. Many of these celebrities ""burn out"" or even die very young. You don't want to ruin your health, especially before you've made your mark on the world.

, Many celebrities have a posse, squad, or entourage they are rarely seen without. If this is something you want to go for, try doing everything with a group of your close friends. Encourage them to do things like coordinate outfits or match hairstyles. The most important thing about a squad is that each of you will always be there to have each other's back.

, This doesn't mean you should run out and spend a lot of money on expensive clothes. Instead, simply put some effort into planning your outfits. The simplest way to look more put-together is to simply wear clothing that fits properly. Likewise, wearing clothing that you feel comfortable in will help you to feel more relaxed and confident.

Try emulating your favorite celebrities' style. Pay attention to what they wear and how they do their makeup. Is it outrageous or classy? Do they have a signature color or favorite type of jacket? You may choose to copy a certain outfit completely or simply take inspiration from it.
Try making your own style look like it belongs to a celebrity's. Instead of taking cues from someone else, simply make yours stand out a little more. Is there a jacket or pair of shoes you save for special occasions? Wear them more often. Are you the simple T-shirt and jeans type? Make sure your clothes are always clean and looking new.
Underdress while shopping. Clerks at high-end retailers are more likely to assume that someone shopping in gym clothes is a celebrity over a person in elegant garb. This is because celebrities are less likely to feel the need to flaunt their status., Many celebrities wear large sunglasses for two main reasons: Sunglasses hide tired eyes, making flawless makeup less necessary.

Large sunglasses also work to obfuscate their features, making them less recognizable. By wearing a pair yourself, however, you will not only look more like a celebrity but also raise the possibility of actually being one., Almost every press photo is showing off the result.

Don't feel discouraged if you can't look as flawless as your favorite singer. In everyday life, even he or she won't look nearly as good as that red carpet appearance.

Celebrities also often employ professional chefs, personal trainers, and assistants to manage their everyday lives. If you feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with all these tasks, remember that your favorite celebrities would have trouble doing it by themselves, too.

All you need is a few friends and the right attitude.Just be sure you can explain yourself if you get found out!

, Try to get people of all ages to join in, not just your school friends. Try asking older siblings, parents, and even teachers. This will make your stunt more believable.


If an adult raises objections, explain that this prank isn't mean-spirited and that you aren't going to cause trouble. You can even turn this into a project for a sociology or psychology class.

, A crowded mall will work best. You'll need enough people around for this to work, but if it's too busy there's less of a chance anyone will notice you. A Saturday afternoon will work well as long as gift-giving holidays aren't around the corner.


If your town is small enough that other people may recognize you, it's best to try this trick at a mall in a different city.

, Start the prank out with a few of your ""fans"" taking pictures with you.Don't take photos with more than one or two people at a time, since a group photo will just look like a bunch of friends having fun. Instead, have them take turns. If strangers not in on the prank start approaching you for pictures, play along.


If you're a guy, ask your young female ""followers"" to jump up and down excitedly. This will really help to sell it.

, If you start out with (or end up drawing) a big enough crowd, other people will start to wonder who you are. Some are likely to ask anyone near them what's going on. If one of your ""fans"" is nearby, he or she can tell them about your celebrity status and mention what you're known for.


Come up with a story beforehand and tell your ""fans"" to be consistent. Decide what name to use, either your real name or an alias. Pick something that you can be ""famous"" for while being a little vague. If you want to be an actor, you could have been ""in"" a new hit movie without mentioning who you played.If you're trying to pass as a pop artist, pick a popular song by a new artist most people will not be familiar with or simply make up your own.
If you look enough like a real celebrity and are feeling cheeky, pretend to be him or her instead.

, Have a majority of your ""fans"" create as big a crowd as possible near you. When people see a crowd, many will instinctually join in.

As your crowd draws more and more people, you will seem and feel more and more like a real celebrity., Keep a straight face and try to act like this is a normal experience for you. Wearing shades will help, whether you're indoors or outside. If you're at a mall, browse and make purchases like you would usually do. Try to cover as much of the area as possible for maximum effect. Otherwise, just relax and enjoy the show.


Be sure to have one of your ""fans"" film the whole thing. You will probably miss a lot of great reactions while you focus on keeping your cool. The video footage will let you watch what you missed in addition to serving as a memento.

It can already be tricky to fall asleep on the night before the first day of school, so to up your chances of actually getting to sleep, you should make sure to start going to bed earlier and earlier and waking up earlier and earlier at least a few weeks in advance, so your body is ready to go to bed and wake up around the time you would normally do so for school before that first day.


Start by going to bed half an hour earlier and waking up half an hour earlier each night and take it from there.
Though getting into a solid pattern a few weeks before can be a big help, it's also important to be in a calm mental state the night before that first day, so you can easily fall asleep. Avoid intense conversations, last-minute decisions, or even arguments after dinner, take it easy on the caffeine, and do something relaxing to wind down before bed, such as reading a book or drinking herbal tea.;
, Try jogging, yoga, swimming, visiting the gym or mixing it up. Do a little something every day. This will help keep your energy levels up and shape you up for the upcoming school year. You don't need to exercise to get a super skinny look; you should do it to feel happy and healthy in your own skin. Don't be one of those girls who tries to lose a ton of weight over the summer unless that's something you really want to do.


Get one of your friends to be your exercise buddy over the summer. This can help you have fun and stay motivated while getting in shape.

, If you have acne, use a high quality facial wash. Wash your face daily. This will eliminate acne, leaving skin pimple-free the first day of school. Avoid harsh chemicals that over-dry and cause redness. Companies offer formulas for oily, combination, normal and dry skins. Use what your skin needs and not what your friends are using.


If you have combination skin, look for something that won't dry out your normal areas when you wash the oily areas.
Go for high-quality brands: Neutrogena, Nivea, L'Oreal, Mary Kay or Clean & Clear.
Drink plenty of water. It's not only good for your skin; it also hydrates your body. It flushes toxins and helps stop food cravings.

, Picking out your outfit in advance will help you feel excited about that first day and will eliminate any last-minute stress you encounter when getting ready on that first day. You don't want to be late for school because you can't decide between three different outfits, do you? Instead, choose an outfit that is flattering and comfortable and lay it out the night before.


Try out different jewelry and accessories along with your chosen outfit to find the look that suits you best.
Depending on where you live, don't dive into fall looks for your first few weeks of school, since it will still be too warm. Wear lightweight and summery styles. Shop for a few summer items to get you through the warm weather when things go on sale at the end of the summer.
Just make sure to check the forecast at least a few days in advance. That first day may be unusually cold or unusually hot, so it's important to be prepared. You can choose a look with layers, so you can control how hot or cold you feel throughout the day.

, Though packing up your school supplies and anything else you need for that first day may not help you look amazing, it will help you get into a relaxed and positive mental state before you walk out the front door of your home. You want to feel prepared and at ease and not have to deal with rifling through your desk to find that homework assignment ten minutes before that first bell rings.


Plus, if you have to run around and look for your supplies the morning of that first day, it'll be harder to maintain that put-together look.

, If you want to go to school with a fresh coat of nail polish on your nails (if your school allows it), then you should either get a manicure or just do your nails yourself the day before the first day. Many girls think they'll have time to do it the morning of, and they just end up making themselves late or smearing their polish as soon as they leave the house.


If you're not the nail polish type, then just file or trim your nails the day before so they are nice and even for that first day.

, Give yourself plenty of time to get ready and get out the door. Remember, there will be lots of kids being taken to school by parents on the first day, so leave early to avoid the extra traffic. Though you'll probably be ready well before you have to leave, getting up early will help you feel calm and relaxed and ready to start that first day; if you're rushing up to the last minute and even forget something, then you won't be in the right mental state for starting your school year.


Try to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep, or however much sleep you need to feel rested.
Spritz yourself with a light perfume or use a scented moisturizer if that's what you normally do. You can use a combination but don't overdo it.

, Though you may think you don't have time to eat breakfast before your first day, or you may not normally eat too much breakfast, it's important to eat a healthy, balanced meal to give you the energy you need to get through that first long day of school. Plan to eat a good mix of healthy carbs, lean protein, and fruits and vegetables. This can keep you from feeling tired or crashing later.


Some examples of healthy meals include oatmeal and berries with a small yogurt, an omelet with spinach and lean ham and a piece of toast, and a whole wheat muffin and a fruit salad. Just make sure you're eating the kinds of foods you normally eat so you're accustomed to them.
You can eat your breakfast as soon as you get up, so you don't have to scarf it down and have some time to digest your food before school starts. But if you'd rather get ready and then eat, it's up to you. Just make sure not to get any food all over your first-day outfit, if you do that!

, Though some people like to take a shower the night before, if you're a morning shower type person, then taking a shower can help you feel clean and ready to start that first day. Showering with cooler water can help you wake up a bit. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner, use soap and body wash on your skin, and use a loofah to exfoliate that skin and get rid of any dead skin.


Make sure to give yourself more than enough time to dry your hair, if you don't normally let it dry naturally.
The most important thing is to do what you normally do. You don't want to try a new shampoo or soap on the morning before that first day because you don't know how your body will react to it.
Brush your teeth either before or after you take a shower. You can also wait and brush them after you have breakfast, but don't forget!

, You should get dressed before you do your hair so you don't mess it up if you try to put a shirt or dress over your head afterwards. Just brush your hair, blow-dry it, add a bit of mousse or gel, or do whatever it is you normally do to get your hair ready. Make sure you know what you're going to do with your hair at least a few days before; you don't want to waste time experimenting with different styles on that first day.


If you really want to look amazing on that first day, then you should try to get a haircut about a week before. That will give your hair enough time to settle into the new look but will still keep your hair feeling fresh. Just make sure you're really ready for a change if you want to dramatically change that cut before school starts!

, If you're a girl who is used to wearing makeup or who is ready to start, then you can apply some light makeup, as long as you don't overdo it for that first day. Just a bit of foundation, cover-up for blemishes, light lipstick, eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara should be enough to make your features come alive. If you like, you can also add a bit of blush to the apples of your cheeks for extra color.


If you do want to wear makeup, then try out your look at least a few days before so you're not disappointed when you put on makeup before that first day. You can ask a friend or an older sibling for an opinion, too.
You can also bring your makeup with you to school so you can touch it up if there's time.
Also, if it's going to be an extra hot day, you may want to minimize the makeup use a bit, because that'll make it more likely that your makeup will run a bit as you sweat.
Of course, just make sure your school allows it before you wear any makeup!

, In order to look amazing on that first day, you have to have an amazing attitude to tie your look together. Smile at people, be friendly, and get excited to see familiar faces as well as to meet new people; if you're cliquish or closed-off, then it won't help you give off a friendly, positive vibe. If you're open and happy to be there, more great opportunities and friendships will come your way.


Also, don't put too much pressure on yourself to have the most amazing first day of school ever. If you do that, then you'll be bound to be disappointed. Just focus on staying in the moment and you'll be guaranteed to have a great day!
Having open, confident body language can also help you look amazing. Stand tall instead of slouching, look straight ahead or at the people talking to you, and don't cross your arms over your chest or fidget too much, and you will give off a friendly, approachable vibe.

Get at least 5 new outfits for the first week of school.,
Paint your nails!,
Do your eyebrows.,
You really want to smell great at all times so make sure you get a great smelling perfume that you are most certain nobody else has.,
Change your hairstyle!,
Smile!,
Have clean and clear skin.,
Have a daily routine like, wash, exfoliate, then clean and polish nails, and then soak and scrub for feet for soft feeling skin.

",How to Look Awesome when You Go Back to School," Make sure you pick your favorite outfit on the first day!;
, If you bite your nails this would be good for you because the taste of nail polish doesn't taste all that good. Let them grow because short stubby dirty nails gross people out more then dazzle them.

, Try to do them often so its not so much of a hassle. You can also apply ice so they don't hurt as much

, It really makes you stand out. Try finding a perfume that matches your personality. Also get antiperspirant rather then deodorant because deodorant only makes your sweat not smell and antiperspirant stops your sweating all together. Make sure you wear lip gloss, chap stick to keep those lips plump and smelling great. I recommend lip smackers(also has great body wash!)

, If you wore your hair down last year wear it up this year or get braids! Maybe even highlights! Try a website to where you can upload your picture to see what different hairstyles look like on you.

, Make sure you brush your teeth twice a day and only drink soda as a treat. Floss and use mouth wash! Whitening strips are good too.

, Your skin is usually the first thing people look at besides teeth! Try to rinse your face with a beauty bar daily, and also try this scrub: mix four tablespoons plain yogurt with two tablespoons grated orange peel. Massage mixture into face for three minutes. This will help get rid of oil on your face, grease and dead skin cells while smelling great at the same time!

Be confident.",How to Have a Back to School Makeover," Your hair? Your attitude? Sometimes it's really hard to determine what you need to work on. Ask yourself. Still don't know? Ask for a second opinion, and a third and possibly a fourth. The more the better!;
, Fashion is all about having fun with your looks and expressing yourself. You don't have to wear designer clothes to be fashionable. Try to create a diverse wardrobe, consisting of clothes that are your style, not someone else's. Be a fashion creator, not a fashion follower.

, Add some colourful necklaces, funky bracelets, earrings, etc. Also give yourself some cool hairdos. You don't have to dye your whole head pink! Just put your hair in French braids with some cool hair ties! Still keep in the rules though! Being in trouble is not cool.

, Mix things up! Mix vintage with trendy items; designer items with less expensive items, girly items with boyish items; and anything else you can come up with! Don't wear one brand head-to-toe. Be fashion forward, but don't be a trend-chaser!

, That way, you'll get used to the new clothes. Remember, it's all about your style, not Teen Vogue's. Try thrift and vintage. You'll look completely unique.

, That really boost your confidence! However, don't feel pressured to wear thongs just because your friends are. Same goes with bras. If you're not ready for one, don't go out and buy a C cup bra just because your friends are chesty. This will make you seem desperate.

, It doesn't have to match everything. It can be completely random. It'll be your signature. It doesn't have to be designer. You can find great purses at cheap prices at Marshalls and T.J Maxx.

, They don't have to match. Chunky bracelets and necklaces are great with plain t-shirts, and it's always nice to have a necklace/bracelet that goes with anything. Claire's and H&M are great places for weird, funky things.

, They should be comfortable, and, once again, they don't have to exactly match every outfit. Wear those polka dot flats with that striped top. People will admire your confidence. And if not, who cares?

, The same haircut won't necessarily look good on a straight-haired girl and a curly-haired girl. You don't need to dye your hair, but if you want, it's totally fine to do it on your own as long as you follow directions completely. Getting help is also beneficial, especially during your first haircut.

, Layers, side bangs, blond highlights, whatever. Make sure that style is right for your hair!

, Don't wear ponytail everyday! Messy buns, side swept bangs, French braids and the low ponytail are all hot hairstyles. Or you can just wear your hair down!

, Eat a healthy diet, drink lots of water, and work out in order to be healthy. You don't have to be skinny to get friends, and you don't have to gain weight if you're unnaturally skinny, either, unless your doctor tells you it's unhealthy.

, A coat of mascara, a swipe of lip gloss, and some natural makeup is probably all you need. Don't pile it on unless you want to look like a circus clown! However, a bit of eyeshadow or eyeliner is good. If it's your style do it, just use your own discretion. And make sure to put it on after gym during passing period (about 5 minutes) and hurry to get back to class

, Learn to do a handstand, become a better artist- whatever you feel like doing.

, People can sense insecurity and it's a major turn off. You should also be outgoing! People like to be around outgoing people. However, you don't have to be wild and crazy! Also, be nice to others. If you're always mean to people, they won't want to be around you. However, if you're really nice all the time, some people will take this to their advantage. Don't let those kind of people use you.

School is ALWAYS first.,
Notes are important.,
Respect your teachers.,
Keep a planner.,
Set aside a good chunk of time to study and do homework.","How to Balance Schoolwork, Homework, and Still Be a Gorgeous Socialite1"," In the classroom you should be focused on the lesson, not on your crush. The second you get out of class you can relax a little. Just don't get carried away and be late for your next class.;
, Take notes in class especially when the teacher is verbally reviewing and teaching and they aren't giving out study guides or handouts. Because once that teacher repeats it twice, it usually disappears into thin air and you'll never see or hear it again. (UNTIL YOU GET THE TEST.) So remember to TAKE NOTES!

, When it comes down to that extra point you need to get an ""A"" you may not realize it, but they look at whether you are respectful and serious about class in addition to if you deserve the extra point.

, Your planner will be the key to organization in high school so make sure you use one. Write down homework assignments, test and quiz dates, fundraisers, school holidays, or whatever you need to remember. If you feel that your planner lacks enough space, try a composition book. You can buy ones with cool designs and prints nowadays and if you are really creative you can buy colored or printed duct tape to cover it, some colored permanent markers to draw designs, and some adorable stickers at a craft store to make your planner, and the rest of your supplies, your own!

, Homework helps you review what you've done in class for that day. To help you study, use index cards. Ant to make studying just a tad more fun, pick up some neon colored ones. They help keep you focused and keep you a little more organized. Lets say you are studying chapter 3 but you have four sections to study. Just make each section a different color and in a quick second you can refer to a certain color to study that section.

Don't do anything to ruin your reputation.,
Be nice!,
Be confident but not too confident.,
Learn to be comfortable around guys.,
Get connected.","How to Balance Schoolwork, Homework, and Still Be a Gorgeous Socialite2"," That means no smoking, drugs, sex, dressing slutty and wild, using foul language constantly and dancing inappropriately. All of these things look trashy and gross on a young lady and it makes you popular in a very BAD way.

, No matter what your personality is, you can't have a blooming social life without being nice. You don't have to compliment people all the time because too many compliments lead to them thinking you want what they have. If it's a guy, too many compliments makes him uncomfortable and makes you desperate. Instead, be subtle. Leave people guessing if it was a compliment or just a statement. Something like,""Omg, your purse reminds me of this super cute sun dress I saw at Forever 21. Nice!"" Or you can say something like, ""nice bag"" and keep it simple.

, You don't want to be mistaken as cocky so be careful with that. But people are automatically drawn to confidence. Find something awesome about yourself, something that makes up you, and flaunt it.

, You don't have to be a whore, just be comfortable around them. You have to master the art of flirting too. Learn how to turn it on and off and turn it up a notch and down a notch. If you play your cards right you can have a date to the dance at the last moment just cause you are connected. So keep that in mind.

, Make sure you have, well, everybody's phone numbers. The jocks, the nerds, the tech kids, everyone! you never know when you might need a last minute tutor or want to know from someone when the next football game is. Befriend people on Facebook, Instagram, Kik, Twitter, Tumblr, ooVoo, Pinterest or whatever social network you fancy.

Always look your best in public.,
Learn how to apply makeup.,
Stay Clean!,
Stay groomed.,
Smile!,
Have good morals.","How to Balance Schoolwork, Homework, and Still Be a Gorgeous Socialite3"," You don't wanna run into someone at the store when looking a mess. Don't focus too much on your appearance.

, Visit the makeup counter, Test out products at Ultra, and watch YouTube tutorials and how to's. You'd be amazed at how many tips you learn. But work on perfecting your application technique until you are happy with it. If you don't know, ask a sister, an honest bff or someone who will tell you the truth. Avoid lipstick unless you are a senior. The reason is, people won't take you serious if you are a freshman wearing bright red lipstick. Seniors can get away with it because they are practically college students. Otherwise, stick to colored lip gloss or colored lip balm.

, Shower at least once a day but I would really recommend taking one at night and one in the morning so you'll be fresh for bed and fresh for school. Use deodorant and if you are a heavy sweater, use antiperspirant to stop sweating or reduce it.

, Shave or wax when needed and you should go have your eyebrows done on a regular basis. You can have them waxed, threaded, shaved, or plucked professionally. Just be sure to tell them how you want it. Go thicker instead of thinner because thinner makes you look older. If you are a freshman and you look younger than your age, you should probably go thinner if you want to look older. OR you can just let them do your brows according to your face shape. Keep your nails clean and cut. Keep them painted for that extra flare but if they are painted, make sure they look nice. Nice solid colors are practical. If you have extra fuzz on your upper lip, don't shave it! it just makes your face irritable and the hair grows back thicker and rough. Instead get it waxed. When you let a professional do it, from personal experience, it hurts much less. But if you can't get out to a salon or spa then go to your local drugstore and buy a waxing kit for your FACE. A kit for your legs or bikini area will irritate your face by making red splotches pop up and that is NOT pretty.

, Its the best beauty aspect you can have. If your teeth aren't exactly straight, you can make up for that if you keep them white and healthy. If you are uncomfortable with your teeth just smile without your teeth. I have a gorgeous bff who has spaced out teeth so she smiles with her mouth closed and she doesn't look any less stunning doing so! Another option is braces. If your parents willing to put up the extra cash then you should get them.

, Be nice to people because beauty is not pretty on a mean person. Boost people up instead of putting them down and don't talk about people behind their back because word tends to get around fast in a high school.

Have an inspiration.,
Get your hair done how you want.,
If you wear glasses or contacts, update your look.,
Buy some clothes.,
Accessorize.,
Makeup is a great way for girls to enhance their features and feel confident.,
Check out some really cool magazines.",How to Go Back to School in Style," Grab some magazines, watch TV, browse the internet, etc. Find clothing styles you like, haircuts you like, music you like, lifestyles you like, whatever. Make a collage, a list, or a checklist of what you need. If you don't want to choose an inspiration, then you can skip this step and choose a totally different style.;
, Bring in a totally cute haircut from a magazine or online or do it how you want it done at home(just don't cut your hair by yourself. Feel free to really change your look, or only go for a small change. You don't have to dye your hair or get it all chopped off to have a new look. Simply parting it a different way or getting fringes or side bangs can actually be very effective. Don't be afraid to try new things!

, Go from glasses to contacts or contacts to glasses. If you decide to wear contacts, try getting one that changes the colour of your eyes if you want to. If you wear glasses, get a new frame for your glasses if you can afford it. If you wear plastic glasses, get metal glasses! If you wear metal glasses, change them to plastic glasses!

, Try wearing some that match your inspiration(if you chose one). It's good to shop to add to your wardrobe, but incorporate some of the things you already have with any new items. Be creative with your look. Here are a few ideas for clothing that you can buy in case you don't have an inspiration or just need some guidelines:


a stylish jacket (try buying one with a bit of faux fur on it)
graphic tees
baggy jeans
skinny jeans
sneakers(try the brands Nike, Jordan, or Adidas)
tights
cute skirts
ruffled shirts

, Again, you don't have to buy something that's extremely expensive, like a designer bag, just buy purses and jewelry that are of good quality that you can wear over and over again.

, Just don't wear too much. A little concealer, blush, mascara, eyeshadow, light amount of eyeliner and lip gloss can go a long way! Just find what works for you and use it. (See warnings)

, Check them to see what's in and what's out. Perhaps read a fashion magazine like Elle(note that some of the clothes and commercials in there can get a little bit inappropriate). Try to find an outfit that reflects your personality and wear accessories that stand out and make you feel confident. It's good to wear bright coloured clothing that will get you noticed.

Personality.",How to Choose the Perfect Outfit For The First Day Of School," Wearing something that gives people a new and refreshed feeling, and that's exactly what the first day of school is about. Don't just go for something that everybody is wearing at the moment because it is ""in fashion"", choose something that really expresses your personality so people can see what you're like looking only at your outfit. Here are some ideas:


If you are someone who is shy but friendly, choose a pale color like lilac, pale yellow, baby blue, or baby/light pink.






If you are an outgoing, sunny person, choose a bright color like hot pink, bright sunshine-y yellow, or orange.






If you are more of a hippie, go with what you like to wear. The hippie style is one that is very reflective of your personality.






If you want to show your more serious side, wear a dark top. Try avoiding black, because it isn't the most bright color for school and it can give people the wrong impression. If black is not your really your thing, you could try wearing navy blue, dark green, or a dark purple.





;
, Wearing a skirt shows your girly side; shorts show that you're confident, fun, and outgoing; and casual jeans show that you are, well, relaxed! Wearing what you feel comfortable in is a great rule of thumb, because you want to show who YOU are, not who someone else might be.

, It's always a good idea to wear accessories. It adds an extra piece to your ensemble, and can really make the outfit. Just be cautious of overdoing it, because after all, it's school, not a fashion show.

, Remember, your personality is key. Do what you like to do with your hair, whether you straighten it, curl it, put it in a bun, or let it hang loose! Even throw it in a ponytail or braid. Whatever shows your inside and unique personality! But if a bad hair day comes up, put it in a messy bun and pin up your bangs (if you have any). Then just spray it with hairspray to let it hold. It looks super cute and will cover up any parts you want to hide.

, This will make it easier when picking your clothes. But don't forget, its your personality. Be creative! Wear closed or open-toed shoes, anything that you think would look nice and match your clothes.

, When you go to school, never go overboard on makeup. Just wear a little bit of what you think brings out your best features. This could be mascara, lip-gloss, eyeshadow, eye liner, cover-up, or any combination of these. But remember, don't put too much cover up on, or your face might end up looking orange. Just keep makeup minimal and pick colors that express yourself.

, Give yourself a pep talk before your first day (and everyday for that matter) of school so that your confidence is on fire. Be proud and start your day off like that and nothing can go wrong. Style isn't just about how you look, it's about how you feel. Love yourself and fashion will love you back.

Make your uniform cool.,
Pick a nice pair of shoes.,
Use an oversized bag/purse as a backpack if you can fit all your things inside.,
If you must have a backpack, make sure it shows your personality.,
Try some arm candy.,
Put on some dainty rings to call some subtle attention to your hands.,
Ok, now we talk school supplies.,
Customize your locker by cutting out a huge collage of pictures from magazines and taping them to the walls of you locker for a free, super attention grabbing affect that will being conversation starters, and show everyone what you love.,
Make sure you are stocked with an emergency kit for bad hair days, makeup fixes, etc so you have no fear if a random zit appears or you have cat hair all over your new black skirt.,
Switching up your hairstyles will keep people guessing what your natural hair really is, which is very interesting.,
Make sure to keep makeup simple, but super pretty, Bronzer, blush, powder, foundation, concealer, and highlighter are must haves for a stunningly fresh face.,
For the eyes, try natural colors like golds, bronzes, silver, pinks, and other earth tones to compliment your eyes.,
When it comes to clothes, keep your personal style and have fun with fashion!

,
When it comes to groups, try to pick the one with less drama, because otherwise you might make a few enemies...unless that's what you want?

",How to Create Yourself in High School," Little badges, pins, scarves, jewelry, hair, and makeup can really enhance the look. .;
, Try a pretty pair of flats, unique sandals, or a cute new pair of boots.

, If not :) just stick to the traditional backpack for everyday use.

, From pretty colors, textures, to fun keychains, make it scream you!

, Layer on the stretchy bracelets, loose bangles, and fun watches for a hint of casual glam for school. This attention to your arms is both elegant and sexy but perfect for a school setting.

, With a variety of cute rings, make sure you also paint your nails in a hot color to finish the look off for that wow affect.

, Try a store with a great selection like Target and stock up on fresh notebooks, pencils, pens, sticky notes, etc to help start you off in the new year feeling organized, refreshed, and ready to go. Try not to hold on to supplies form last year, that stuff is usually really gross and ready to meet the trash can. To help you feel ready to clean that slate for a new you, try getting as much glossy, new materials as you can afford.

, this is an amazing idea for sparking someones attention or simply reminding yourself of everything there is to love on a bad day. Inspiration much? Also add a cute little white board inside along with pictures of friends and family and some loose magnets for hanging up papers.

, So, try a lint roller, tissues, powder, hair bands, wipes, blotting papers, lip gloss, a hairbrush, and breath mints.

, So, try loose waves on Monday, pin straight with body on Tuesday, fishtail braid on Wednesday, dressy bun on Thursday, and some type of french braid style on Friday, If you aren't good at doing complex styles, turn to a friend or youtube video before school starts so you will know what o do by the time school rolls around.

, You can use all these products, just in moderation so it doesn't look caked on or frankly stupid.

, Also use black mascara (I recommend splurging on a mascara before you head back into school so your lashes will look incredible). Also use an eye liner only if you are good at it. I know it sounds harsh, but it you don't know how to use eye liner, skip it and don't use it. You will look crazy if you pile on uneven, weird amounts on liner in all the wrong places.

Wear new clothes.,
Start a beauty routine.,
Get ready to go!,
Relax!,
Choose your wardrobe.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Prepare.,
Take it easy.",How to Be Beautiful for the First Day of School," You might want to go shopping for clothes, be that your own choice of clothing items or new school uniform clothing. Try new things that look awesome on your body. A clean pair of new jeans may help too if jeans suit you and you are allowed to wear them at school.;
, If you didn't take a shower the night before school, do it now...or, when it's appropriate! The most important thing you want to remember is that hot water deprives you of the moisture your face needs; so if you insist on taking a hot shower, apply lotion after you get out. Shave your legs, if you will be wearing Capri pants, a skirt without pantyhose or tights, or shorts. Brush your teeth while still in a towel and then groom your hair. Before you decide to blow dry your hair, apply spray or a leave in hair product that helps protect it from heat. (Remember it's always good to change up your hair once in a while.) Brush those pearly whites and apply chap stick, especially if you have sensitive skin. Now it's time to dress up. Once you do, make sure your nails are clean and free from cracks. For an easy fix, apply clear nail polish.

, Make sure you have your handbag and you touch up anything you still need to do. Keep extra make up in your bag. Look in the mirror and tell yourself how great you look! Leave the house with a smile and feel confident doing so. Remember when you get to school no one likes to see a frown on your face, even if you have had a bad day; so smile - by doing so you will attract positive attention!

, Just because school is right around the corner and you can't get rid of that pool water smell does not mean you have to hide under the covers. Do not rush through these steps like there is no tomorrow! Take your time and relax for best results.

, Instead of going on one gigantic shopping trip at the end of the summer, try going on little small ones throughout it. That way, you can take your time and won't regret that you rushed through the store in a matter of hours. Also, try not to get 'outfits' but just items of clothing you can mix and match. Chances are, if you get outfits, then your wardrobe will be the same thing every week. Get at least 5 new shirts, and 2 new bottoms. Then once you are done with determining your wardrobe, pick out your outfits for the first week of school. Try to wear your favorite outfit on the first day. Also, one good thing to do is to wear only some new clothes. Maybe a new shirt, with your favorite skirt. And a new bracelet, but with the cute necklace you have loved forever! That way, you will feel comfortable wearing what you love but also looking great in some new threads!

, However much you clean your teeth, groom your hair and choose your effort with great care, there may still be people who don't think you look beautiful. As long as you feel beautiful, it doesn't matter. Don't set yourself unrealistic goals. It will make you more stressed and will end up making you disappointed and sad. Do the things you know you can change and love yourself now; not later.

, On the night before school, don't clean your room; it can create stress for you easily. Lay out your outfit on your dresser, take a bath, and wash your hair with a nice relaxing soap and shampoo. Go to bed between 8 and 9 o'clock. Put a glass of water beside your bed and read a book in bed; whatever calms your nerves before the big day. You can also get your nails done and get a facial. The morning of the first day, wake up 1-2 hours before you leave. Do everything you need to do to remain clean and refreshed throughout the day. Try to choose a hairstyle that won't require constant maintenance or will make you feel unattractive or uncomfortable.

, It's just school; not a fashion show. Don't be afraid to wear your favorite pair of ripped jeans (just not too ripped). Remember you will do fine! There will always be at least a few people who will look like they just crawled out of bed. Don't think about it too much, because everyone is nervous and worried about the first day.

One of the cutest things you can do is wear a ribbon to school.,
Take care of your hair.,
Get a polo or blouse that compliments your figure.,
Wear socks that coordinate with your uniform but give you a pop of personality.,


",How to Dress Fashionably in a School Uniform," If you have acne, try to keep your skin as dirt-free as possible and never cake on your makeup. Wash your face before you put on your makeup. Don't over wash your face because that strips your face of natural oils that make your face smooth. If you want to use tanning lotion, be sure to test it out on a small patch of unseen skin to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction or that it turns you orange. It's best to wait 2-3 days before applying all over.;
, If you have strict rules about this, get a French manicure. It looks natural but is gorgeous! If a French manicure is out of the question, clear nail varnish is a sneaky alternative. Nail biting isn't a good thing to do and it will ruin your nails. You can buy top coats that are specially formulated for people that have this bad habit, ones that taste really bitter as soon as you bite your nails.

, Body odor and bad breath are huge turnoffs! Always carry some mint gum and deodorant along with showering daily. Foot powder is also available from most pharmacies should your feet need freshening.

, Wear a cute necklace or a ring that is eye-catching. Keep it fun and funky and true to your personal style. If you aren't allowed jewelry or have to keep it to a minimum, ex. you can only wear studs/sleepers and a watch but nothing else, make sure that what you do wear makes a statement. Keep in mind that excess jewelry might be confiscated, so don't go overboard. Another cute jewelry item is an anklet. These look really cute as a simple accent. Don't overload your ankles with these! The thinner your layers of anklets, the longer you legs will look. The more layers of anklets you have, the shorter your legs will look. Whenever you're at markets or on vacation, keep an eye out for pretty anklets, like silver ones or ones with colors that pop out.

, Keep in mind that many schools have strict rules about footwear (ex. they have to be black, leather, closed-in, lace-up, etc.). Mary-Janes are usually a fail-safe option for a quirky-cute look. If your school requires you to wear lace ups, choose cute combat boots or converse. Don't wear shoes that are uncomfortable to walk in, as you may need to walk a bunch between classes.

, Wrap it around a bun or tie it in a bow on top of a ponytail. Either way, it's an attractive look! Thin ribbons look best in bright colors and the thicker ribbons are great in any color or pattern. You could also wear a Chanel ribbon. These come in black and white and look super stylish, but you have to buy a Chanel product as they are part of the packaging. Be creative with the ribbons you put in your hair, but try not to copy someone else. Choose ribbons that coordinate with your hair color. For example, if you have blonde hair: white, blue, and pink. If you have brown hair: red, periwinkle, green, and pink. Red hair: green, pink, and blue. Black hair: white, royal blue, and colorful patterns.

, Try not to use heat on it every day. If you do, make sure you use heat protectant and also use a good shampoo and conditioner. Make sure you don't wear clips too often, as these can give you headaches or damage your hair. One alternative to hair elastics are called Twist bands. They're really pretty and don't do nearly as much damage like regular hair ties can. Don't over dye your hair because the process will strip away the natural oils of your hair. To stand out, you might highlight your hair with color streaks. Also, don't wear the same hairdo everyday because it can damage your hair and cause unnatural oil accumulation.

, Pay attention to any rules in your uniform policy on tight fitting clothes.

, If your uniform has patterns, make sure to wear solid colored socks so that you don't have clashing patterns going on. If you are wearing solid color socks, make sure they are not the focal point of your outfit. If you are wearing black shoes, choose more neutral colored socks. If you need a pop of color, choose your favorite! If your uniform lacks a pattern or print, you can choose patterned socks. To look less out of place, consider choosing socks that match your school colors or uniform colors.

A Long Sleeve Cardigan.,
A comfortable pair of sweatpants.,
Two pairs of jeans - your classic skinnies, and flare jeans.,
Sneakers.,
Sunglasses.,
Finally, a watch.",How to Dress Like a Casual Trendsetter for School," Look for graphic tees with animals and your favourite musical artists on them. Animals such as wolves or cheetahs are neat because they show bravery, and birds are nice because they show freedom. I would also pick a shirt with some sort of positive slogan too, such as 'love', or 'peace'. Some good places to get these are: http://www.junkfoodclothing.com/, Urban Outfitters, or a skate brand, such as Element or Billabong. Try not to get tees that advertise brands too much because they go out of style fast. Also, try Gap for basics, like layering tanks, and Delia's for more patterned, fun T-shirts.;
, These you can go crazy with because a person never has enough tanks. Be careful with price, however; don't over pay. And some tank essentials might be a floral lace tank, a neon sporty tank, and/or a white, blouse-like spaghetti strap tank.

, These will never go out of style. Get a simple one that's not too 'worn' looking, because you are going to do that yourself. Make sure your jean jacket is a size too big, because you don't want to outgrow it too fast. Also, don't worry about spending too much, because you don't want to get a cheap jacket that will fall apart fast. A good place to look might be H&M, or American Eagle.

, This can be in grey, tan or brown, but make sure it is comfortable. This will serve a purpose for those not-quite-nice-enough days.

, Make sure they have an adjustable waist and thick fleece inside. Yes, the baggy type with the closed bottoms.

, Obviously, buy as many as you need, and in any wash that suits you best.

, Converse hightops, Keds, Vans, and colorful flats are popular.

, Heart shaped, 'nerd' style, and aviators are all very popular.

, Though almost everyone has a cell phone to check the time with now, these are still classy. Popular are G-shocks, and very colorful fun watches.

Bring a close, trustworthy friend with you on your shopping trip.,
Buy Some T-Shirts.,
Buy Some Jeans.,

Buy Pairs of Leggings.,
Buy Pairs of Fashionable Shoes.,

Get Some Hygiene Supplies.,
Last Thing To Buy - Some Essentials.,
Be Confident That You Look Good, and Believe in Your Inner Beauty.",How to Back to School Shop for an Elementary School Student," Buying sixteen shirts and twelve pairs of jeans won't make any great-looking outfits. In fact, buying more accessories leads to making more impressive outfits, so remember to keep an eye out for this.;
, Remember to not go over the set budget. This will give you great financial skills for the future. Make sure to ""okay"" this said budget with your parents/guardians. Make sure it is not too low, though.

, This will allow you to get a taste of other people's styles, but also stick with yours. And a true friend will tell you if you look fantastic or not.

, Great brands are American Eagle, Aeropostale, Abercrombie and Fitch, etc. Make sure these shirts fit your body shape, and make you look good. Make sure to enforce your favorite styles in these shirts. V-Necks and Scoop Necks are great suggestions!

, Boot-cut or skinny - jeans look great with everything! Boot-cut looks great with stylish flats and skinny looks great with casual tennis shoes and posh boots. Try to lean towards light colors in boot cut jeans and dark colors in skinny jeans, unless they are tapered.

, I recommend two jean skirts, one dark and one light. They look amazing when layered, and boys often like it when girls show a little bit of a feminine side.

, These are to go with your skirts. Make sure the legging colors are solid, as they make you look more mature, and definitely make sure they match your skirts. They should still stand out, so don't wear white on white or black on black.

, Colorful Converse look amazing with skinny jeans! High-Top or Low-Top, black or blue, they all look amazing and are great for running. Also, stylish boots look good with skinny jeans! I recommend silver or black flats with boot-cut jeans, skirts, and leggings. Shoes make the outfit, as they say, so make sure they match!

, This is the most important part. Get some beautiful headbands or flower clips for your hair. Buy some eye-stopping jewelry too; Claire's is a great place for cheap but nice-looking jewelry. Dress scarves, earth-colored belts, nice sweaters/jackets, and magnificent hats look good too! You may want to buy a small make-up bag too, which is referred to the next step.

, Unnoticeable Make-Up makes you look better, and can go unnoticed for a whole day! Get some moisturizing chapstick (make sure you buy it from a good brand). Buy some shiny, nontoxic lip gloss in light shade. Apply thoroughly and lightly, and make sure you apply after the chapstick. Finally, spray some good-smelling, mature perfume over you, but make sure it is light and not excessive! You want yourself to smell good, not intoxicating!

, As you grow, hygiene becomes more important. No one wants to be around or likes a sweaty, bad-smelling kid. If you want to attract your crush, you have to have good hygiene. Buy some gentle soap for you showers, as you should take every day, and some antiperspirant deodorant, as you should apply every day.

, Moisturizing lotion make your skin look soft and feel soft...and feel good. Facial cleanser is good too, because it prevents acne and other skin blemishes. Also, since you should brush your teeth every day, you should get whitening toothpaste and refreshing mouthwash.

, If you go to school thinking, ""What will my friends think?"" then that's completely wrong. You have to believe in yourself. If you think it looks good, then it looks good. Total friends will never make fun of your clothes. If you can't shake it, shop for some confidence.

When you start school, or at the start of a new semester/term, follow these steps to ensure you have all the right clothes and can make enough outfits.,
The most important thing to do is keep your head up.,
Throw open your wardrobe doors and look at your clothes with an open mind.,
Get a parent to look at your decisions.,
Look at the 'Things you'll need' list at the bottom of this page.,
Once you have acquired your clothes and have a plentiful smart wardrobe, you can identify missing pieces by thinking up outfits.,
Make sure that all your smart clothes make multiple outfits with your other smart clothes.,
Now look at the dress code.,
As school progresses, try adding your favourite items from the home clothes section of your wardrobe to your smart outfits.",How to Dress For a School with a Formal Dress Code,";
, Don't let all these formal wears alter your perception of style - if you're a goth, you can be a smart goth! You can also be a smart tomboy, and a smart fashionista. Get your head on straight. Just because you have to brush up a little for school doesn't mean you have to lose your individual style.

, If it helps, pull them all off the hangers and lay them out on the bed or floor. Separate them into two piles: school suitable, and not school suitable. Then put them back in the wardrobe in this way - suitable on the left, non-suitable on the right. This creates a clear division between your school and home clothes and also lets you see how many suitable clothes you have - so you know what else you need to get!

, It helps to get an adult's perspective on your 'suitable' clothes as it'll be adults at school telling you off! They may disagree with some of the things you have chosen as school wear. Don't argue with them and start shouting, just take on board what they have to say.

, Copy down the things you don't have. Look in catalogues, websites and stores to find the items you need and work out a total cost. If it's too high, then work out a budget, and find clothes that will fit in it! An alternative is to discuss a budget with parents - maybe you could go halfway. They probably won't mind because these clothes are allowing you to be smart at school. They're EDUCATIONAL!

, If there's an item that you need to complete several different outfits, (eg blue shoes or a pink cardigan), then make sure you get it!

, The more outfits you can make form one piece, the more variation you can have. It's no good buying a certain smart skirt if it only goes with one of your pairs of shoes, or only matches non-suitable tops. You need to have enough outfits to look different everyday, and only have to repeat outfits once every few weeks. Otherwise people recognise your outfits and think you're boring.

, Identify things it doesn't specify. It may say specifically no flip-flops or no jeans - BUT that doesn't mean you can't wear strappy sandals (flat ones for school, don't be a tart!); or coloured denim. White and black jeans are easy to disguise as non-denim, as long as they don't have holes in and you wear them with smart boots or shoes, however you do need to be careful about this as some schools ban denim completely, so check if this is the case before you wear them. Similarly, no hoodies means no hoodies - but hooded tops and jackets are allowed and create the same look. Vest tops banned? You can still wear them!! Just make sure to always keep your cardigan or jacket on over the top!

, For example, a good smart outfit would be flat ballet pumps, a mid-length skirt, a blouse and a jacket. Once the teachers are satisfied you're a smart dresser, replace the blouse with a t-shirt with a cool design on, like a comic book character or slogan. Or, swap the pumps for ox-style converses. Wear a funky belt. In this way, you build up the confidence of your tutors by dressing by the rules, then introduce your own thing gradually to make sure you retain your individual style. Chances are, they won't look twice! You'll get away with it!

Think of who you want to hang out with... examples, do you want to be a jock?,
Start analyzing yourself.,
Get to know yourself as a person.,
Start to change before summer comes.,
Start to change once summer begins.",How to Come Back to School as a Whole New you," Do you want to be a skater punk? Do you want to be a prep? or the people who always do well in school?;
, Do you look like the part you're trying to become? What needs changing; a new hair-do, new make-up, a new hair color, a tan, a few work-out sessions?

, What are some of your traits; flirty, nice, mean, bad , girlie, tomboyish? Once you know yourself you can be your new best friend.

, A few days before school ends start talking to your friends about your ""interests"" such as... ""Yeah, my mom is bringing me to the Winnipeg skate parks. It's going to be sick!"" ""My mother and father are totally getting me a whole new summer wardrobe! I am, like, so excited!"" ""My mom's signing me up for a multiple sport camp. You know, football, swimming, soccer... all that fun stuff.""

, If you want to be a skater, start to skate. If you are a jock, learn to throw and catch a football, run long distances and get in shape. If you want to be a prep buy a lot of preppy clothes.

Wear the right clothes.,
Do your makeup right.,
Wear your hair for dancing.,
Find your confidence.",How to Be a Party Girl1," Party girls always keep their looks on point, no matter how wild their nights get. The basic party girl uniform is a cute dress and a nice pair of heels.


Dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable. You want to wear something that's easy to move in and that makes you feel confident.
You'll probably be dancing, so you need clothes you can move in. Don't wear clothes that are too tight or restricting.
Pack a pair of flats in your purse. Many women in general carry an extra pair of comfortable shoes in their bags,but for party girls they are essential. No matter how skilled you are at dancing in heels, your feet will be hurting by the end of the night. Give them a break.
If you must wear pants, make sure they're cute (and preferably tight) and match the dress code of wherever you plan on partying. You don't want the embarrassment of being turned away at the door because your venue of choice has a ban on jeans.;
, The typical party girl wears a lot of makeup. If that's the look you like, go for it. Just make sure to wear makeup with staying power that isn't prone to sweating off. For long-lasting makeup, start with a moisturizing primer and top everything off with a translucent powder.Right now, the party girl look is all about smoky, heavy eye makeup.If you want to follow this trend, pack on the dark eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara.

, This means that your hair should be in a manageable style that stays in place. You don't want it coming undone while you dance.


If you want to wear your long hair down for part of the night, try pulling it back in a ponytail when you dance.
For a classier look, you can also try a bun or some other type of updo. Just make sure your hair is secure before you go out.
If it starts to come undone halfway through the night, it's better to just take your hair down completely.

, A party girl will enjoy partying most when she's self-confident and happy with herself. Self-confidence will boost your charisma and make you the life of the party.



Build your self-confidence, be confident and develop your self-esteem.
Even if you don't feel confident, do your best to pretend. If you aren't naturally outgoing, challenge yourself to change that. If you have a habit of self-deprecation, work on curbing that.
Surprisingly, maintaining good posture goes a long way towards boosting confidence. Keep your back straight and your shoulders dropped. Posture like this will have you both looking and feeling more confident than you would slouching."

Find the right party.,
Have a squad.,
Arrive fashionably late.,
Dance all night.,
Know how to hold your booze.",How to Be a Party Girl2," A fun-loving party girl will be discriminating about which parties she chooses to go to. Choose ones you know will be packed. A near-empty house party is no fun. Try to hit up the popular clubs in your city on a regular basis.

, Squads, posses, or ""girl gangs"" are all the rage right now.While you and your friends may not be celebrities, you can always form a hip group of your own. Going out with a large group of other girls makes socializing much easier. When you're with a bunch of friends, you'll always have someone to talk to. Are you self-conscious about getting on the dance floor? Just ask some of your girlfriends to join you!

, If you're going to a party, don't arrive when the invitation says it starts. Ten to twenty minutes later than that is the minimum for looking cool, but holding off for an hour or more may be more appropriate. Regardless, you don't want to be one of the only people there.


Peak hours for nightclubs are usually around 11 pm or midnight until closing. This is the window you'll want to arrive during if you want to have a wild time.
If you have trouble getting into trendy clubs at peak hours, showing up early may be for the best. That way, when the place fills up you'll already be there and ready to have fun., If you can't dance, watch the others and copy them. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. Just let the music move you and keep your movements minimal until you feel more confident. If you're already a great dancer, weave lots of dancing into your party nights out. Dancing is liberating, energizing and a good excuse to work around the floor and connect with many people. Dance with your friends or anyone on the floor you'd like to dance with.

, Most party girls are known for their heavy drinking, but this doesn't mean you have to follow suit. If you're drinking, drink just enough to have fun and be a little more outgoing. Don't drink so much that your speech slurs or you have problems staying upright in your heels. Remember this: Vomiting and talking to the wall are neither sexy nor fun.


Learn to pace yourself. Alcohol tolerance is different for every person. If you're new to alcohol, it's best to practice with a few friends in a controlled environment like your house. You don't want to find out what your limits are at a crowded, chaotic club. Know when to stop and know when to say no.
If you're not drinking, or at least drinking at a slower pace than everyone else, do your best to hide it. Always have a drink in your hand; it just doesn't have to be alcoholic. Instead of sipping water from a cooler cup, have it in a glass, preferably with a slice of lime. This will help you keep from standing out, which may make people pressure you into drinking more than you want to.
Consider caffeine instead. Energy drinks are popular in the party scene and will help you to keep dancing all night.However, don't overdo them, since they tend to be loaded with sugar.

"
"
Learn how to introduce yourself.,
Practice small talk.,
Network.,
Have some fun with the party boys.,
Leave the party when the time is right.",How to Be a Party Girl3," If you're looking to make new friends or find a special someone, partying can be a good way to meet new people. Don't be afraid to talk to random strangers in a club. Most people are there to socialize.

, When you're out having a good time, you'll be meeting a lot of new people. Small talk lets you break the ice with someone you'd like to know better. It's also a great way to pass time when there's a long line for the bathroom. Some topics that make good small talk include:


Your opinion about the music the DJ is playing.
How the other person found out about the venue or knows the host.
What you plan on doing for an upcoming holiday, or how you spent a recent one.
Compliment some aspect of the other person's outfit.

, Make yourself the indispensable go-to girl for news, information, shared friends and help. Exchange numbers and business cards with people you meet.


Find the VIPs and the well-connected in your circle. Make it your goal to become known to them and spend time sharing news and ideas with them.

, However, be careful about who you get to know intimately. Clubs can be great places to meet people, but they don't always attract a reputable crowd.


Do not ever make out with a friend's date. This is a grave violation of the girl code.
Avoid the bad boys. They aren't worth the trouble.
Never get drunk to build up the courage to find someone. Your drunk self has extremely poor taste and isn't likely to know what's best for you.
If you already have a boyfriend, don't ruin things by making out with someone else. It's perfectly fine to party without him while in a relationship. Just don't break his trust.

, You don't want to close down an empty bar. When you see the crowd start to thin, it's a good idea to bail. Be sure to say goodbye to everyone you've spent time with. Before you leave, make sure you have the contact information of anyone you'd like to hang out with more. The worst feeling is meeting someone great only realizing the next day that you forgot to exchange numbers.

"
"
Party with friends.,
Practice safe sex.,
Drink responsibly.,
Don't do illegal drugs.",How to Be a Party Girl4," Your squad is there to help you have fun, but being part of the group also means looking out for one another. Watch each other's backs and drinks.


When a girlfriend starts to get a little too drunk, cut her off. She may be upset with you, but she'll thank you in the morning.
If a creepy guy won't leave your girlfriend alone, tell him to take a hike.
Make sure each of you gets home safely when the night is over. If you live in a place without good public transportation, having a designated driver can literally save your life.

, Party girls are all about fun. Sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies are decidedly not fun. Making out with a guy you just met can be fun, but be careful who you decide to sleep with.


Always make sure your partner wears a condom. Be sure that it's not a ""natural"" or ""lambskin"" condom, as these do not protect against HIV.
Remember that sex always carries some risk. Condoms can always break. There is no such thing as completely safe sex, only safer sex., Most party girls drink alcohol as part of having fun, but you shouldn't overdo it. Don't drink past your limits. You don't want a fun night on the town to ruin your health.


Avoid drinking if you are under the legal age to buy alcohol. Don't give in to peer pressure even if all of your friends drink.
Never drive drunk.

, Drugs can be a big part of many party scenes, and some party girls like to partake. These substances can be harmful by themselves, but they may also include unknown and deadly impurities. Don't take any pills offered to you at a party.

"
"
Have a good source of income.,
Be kind to your bartenders.,
Don't overdo the partying.",How to Be a Party Girl5," Party clothes, club covers, alcohol, and cabs home get expensive. Many famous party girls are actresses and heiresses. You may not need that kind of money, but you'll still need to make a decent living.


Be sure to work in a profession that meshes well with partying. If you're a doctor or nurse, you can't party while you're on-call.
Likewise, don't let partying sink your career. Don't go out partying all night when you have an important meeting in the morning.

, Not only will these people be responsible for preparing your fancy drinks, they'll be good allies in helping you meet more people and stay in touch with the ""people who matter.""


Tip well. Nothing spreads a bad reputation like being a cheap party girl. Make sure if someone is buying for you, that they also tip well. Bad tipping can make you guilty by association. If you're with a bad tipper, throw in some extra cash if you can.

, A party girl needs her beauty sleep to be refreshed for the rest of her life - and the next party. As with all good things, they come to end and a successful party girl knows when to call it quits. Don't let too much partying ruin your health.

Roll up your sleeves.,
Unbutton your top button.,
Mix and match different uniform items.",How to Be Cool at School in Uniform1," This is a simple trick that allows you to show off your jewelry while also having a practical effect. During the warmer months, it's an easy way to look cool and keep cool. Just make sure you have some cute jewelry to show off, too.;
, As long as it doesn't reveal too much, unbuttoning your top button will make you look relaxed, like you don't let things bother you. Whether you're a guy or a girl, as long as it doesn't get you into trouble, it's a harmless and easy way to look less strict.


Be conscious of how much skin is being revealed. If your top button is already low, you might be showing too much if you unbutton it.

, Some schools offer different outfits to serve as uniforms for different days of the week. Don't be afraid to mix and match different articles from each outfit.


For girls, you can try wearing tights with your skirt in the colder months.
For guys, wear a different tie or sport coat with your uniform."
"
Be confident.,
Keep cool under pressure.,
Smile.,
Be nice.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Be Cool at School in Uniform2," Confidence and self-acceptance shows that you truly believe in yourself and the things you can accomplish, which other people will clearly be able to see.Nothing says ""cool"" like a lot of confidence in the way you are and the way you're dressed. Even if you don't alter your uniform or your appearance in any way, your confidence alone will stand out to others.

, If a teacher puts you on the spot, don't sweat. Simply ask the teacher to rephrase the question if you don't understand, or politely apologize and ask them to repeat the question.


If you don't understand, don't fumble. Try saying, ""I'm sorry, I don't completely understand what you're asking. Can you rephrase the question?""
If you don't know the answer, don't try to make one up. Admit that you don't know, and try to seek the answer. You can say something like, ""I wasn't sure about that part of the assignment. What part of our texts/reading can I find the answer?"" Or ask a question directly related to the assignment.

, Even if you're a little unsure of yourself, smiling shows your overall happiness with yourself and your appearance. Putting on a happy face doesn't just make you more likeable; it makes you healthier.Always smile to your friends and teachers, and be polite and bright.


It would be a good idea to keep your teeth white and free of anything stuck in between. Brush your teeth daily and check your smile after you eat things.

, You may have your group of friends, but it's important to be nice to others around you, as well. Bullying is never cool, and can cause damage to your own reputation as well as the victim's personal health and wellbeing.

, If somebody is bullying you, it's important to stand up for yourself. Whatever the reason, don't be ashamed of the way you look or the way you are. If you can be confident and happy with who you are, the people bullying you won't look so cool-- and you'll look even cooler.


When you stand up for yourself, remember that fighting is not the same thing. Fighting can get you into a lot of trouble and it can hurt people. ß

Cut your hair.,
Maintain your personal hygiene.,
Paint your fingernails (for girls).,
Trim your facial hair (for guys).",How to Be Cool at School in Uniform3," While schools may be able to monitor your uniform, there's less regulation when it comes to your physical appearance. Neon colors and distracting cuts may be outlawed, but there's no harm in changing your hair natural hair color or getting a style cut. Keeping your hair maintained and trimmed makes you look more polished and cool.This can be useful for both guys and girls. Take a look at some celebrities your age and get hair styling ideas from them.

, Make sure your shower every day and keep everything clean, including under your fingernails. Keep your fingernails trimmed and maintained. Try using perfume or cologne to enhance the aroma around you.

, Try not to let it chip. If you use a base coat and a top coat, it makes your nail color last longer without chipping.


Keep reapplying a top coat every day or every other day to keep the paint from chipping.

, If you're old enough to grow it, facial hair can be a cool way to stand out. Don't let it grow to shaggy or overgrown. Keep it maintained and trimmed for a polish, clean look.


Untrimmed facial hair could be in violation of the dress code and uniform policy. If a teacher sees your mane unkempt, they could ask you to shave at school."
"
Choose a color scheme.,
Buy new jewelry sticking with your color scheme.,
Shop for additional clothing items.,
Wear a hat.",How to Be Cool at School in Uniform4," Usually a school uniform has the same colors as the school athletic programs and mascot. These can be a variety of combinations of colors. Take a look at a color wheel and see what colors best complement each other. Complementary colors are any two colors which are directly opposite each other.Green is complementary to blue and yellow.
Purple is complementary to red and blue.

, No matter how dull your uniform or school colors may be, you can always brighten things up with jewelry.For girls, you can focus on earrings, bracelets and necklaces. For guys, you can stick with rings, watches and subtle chains.


Be careful not to go overboard. Even if you buy a lot of jewelry, you don't have to wear it all at once. Use different pieces and vary them throughout the week.

, Just because you're stuck wearing a uniform doesn't mean you can't add to it (sometimes). Try purchasing a new jacket or cardigan.Adding scarves or accessorizing your belts could stand out as well.

, Even if your school doesn't allow hats to be worn in the building, you can still look cool before and after school with a hat. Guys can sport a backwards baseball cap while girls flex a visor or stylish cap. The same works for sunglasses.


Just make sure you have a place to put the hat and sunglasses while class is in session so they don't get taken away. Invest in a cute bag or backpack to carry your things.

Get a copy of your school’s dress code and read it carefully, and look for loopholes.,
Go through the clothes you have now and see what you have that fits within the guidelines of the dress code that you will actually wear.,
Pay attention to little things in the dress code that aren't restricted.,
Also, most dress codes require that you wear the uniform, but do not specify that you must only wear the uniform.,
Shop at your favorite stores or designers.,
Choose shoes that make news.,
Accessorize.,
Push the envelope.,
Your hair doesn't have to be boring!",How to Dress Like an Individual at a School With a Dress Code," Make sure you fully understand the dress code, and ask an administrator for clarification if necessary. You don't want to buy something and then find out you can't wear it to school.;
, It helps to organize your closet by what you are and aren't allowed to wear to school. This way, when you wake up in the morning, you don't have to shuffle through all the clothes you aren't allowed to wear in order to find what you need for school that day.

, For example, you may have to wear shirts that have collars and sleeves. While that certainly limits you, it doesn’t say anything about pockets vs. no pockets or button fronts v.s. polo shirts. Find something you are comfortable in that fits within the dress code. In this example, if you don't like polo shirts, get button fronts. Sleeves can usually be any length as long as they’re there. No matter how restrictive your dress code, you’ll likely have some choices.

, That means, even if you have to wear uniform pants etc, there's nothing that can stop you from pulling a colorful skirt or skort over them. Try wearing multiple layers of shirts, pants and skirts, or jackets over the uniform. If worst comes to worst, you can still pull the extra clothes off.

, Just because your clothes have to be conservative doesn’t mean you can’t still buy the brands you like to wear. In fact, many designers now make clothes specifically to meet the growing dress-code and uniform markets. If you need polos, then buy them at A&F or Urban Outfitters. Have fun with it! But you don't have to shop at expensive clothing stores if you don't want to.

, Shoes are often hard to define in dress codes, so you may be able to get away with some extra creativity on your feet. For example, some dress codes say that shoes have to be closed-toed. This doesn't mean sneakers or loafers only. If your school doesn't have any strict regulations on shoes, get something fashionable that stands out. If your school is strict or brown/black shoes are a must, then slowly add little things. Try a colorful shoelace, or try gluing little rhinestones on and see if you can get away with it.

, Dress code or no dress code, you can use accessories to express your individuality and style. The stricter your dress code, the more important accessories may be.


Belts: Often belts have to be leather and the buckle size is restricted, but there may not be color guidelines or belt buckle type guidelines. Get bright colors or patterns that attract attention. Did your mom already buy you a drab brown belt? Glue glitter on the buckle or otherwise embellish it. Butterfly buttons look really cute too. If you can't add anything or don't want to, you can just use a black belt with a vintage buckle.
Jewelry: If there aren't any jewelry restrictions, wear bracelets, necklaces, earrings, or rings that stand out and make you feel special. Adding funky and bold jewelry will make you stand out without pushing the clothes. Then you can look really original. Be careful, bracelets make a lot of noise on desks.
Hair: Many dress codes provide few restrictions on hair. While you probably can’t dye your hair crazy colours, you can put bows or headbands of different bright colors, as well as pigtails, braids, or anything colorful or unique that the dress code can't restrict.
Scarves: Especially in the winter, a colorful scarf can give your uniform/dress code cute and colorful

, Maybe your dress code has some ""grey areas,"" or maybe parts of it aren’t enforced. See what you can get away with. What’s the worst that could happen? You'll just have to take it off.


Never say never: If you see something you want to wear at school, don't be pessimistic by saying it's not permitted at school. Take it and go with it - at the worst case, you can put it in your bag.
Bags: You can always express yourself by your bag. There is no such thing - usually - as limits for bags. Go wild and buy some crazy and unique bags. If there are limits even for bags - you can always put pins and such onto it.

, Look online for hair tutorials and ideas. Crazy styles can be fun, and there is rarely a rule that says you can't!

If you have medium hair, tie it up with a colorful band with a headband or let it flow, be confident.,
Wear headbands.

,
Rock that uniform with a great attitude!

,
Have great posture.,
Keep your clothes in good condition.,
Get enough sleep.,
Stay in school.",How to Customize a School Uniform," Many schools with uniforms do not allow direct modification of the uniforms, but will allow accessories and small additions. If you are unsure of what exactly you can and cannot do, check with the office beforehand.;
, Personality is the biggest factor in how you'd like to change your uniform. Pick your style and stick with it.

, Tasteful pins are a good non-permanent addition to your jacket or sweater. Adding new buttons to your jackets and shirts is a small but individual touch. Adding colorful ribbon to the edges of your clothing (or the top of your socks) is also a small but effective way to alter your uniform. Iron-on patches are great, but only if they are allowed. If you are not sure about permanently affixing something to your uniform, use safety pins and pin the patches on.

, This is probably the easiest way to change up a boring look. Adding things like hair clips, clip in extensions, jewelry, makeup, nail polish, and socks can change the whole look of an outfit.

, Make some out of bright duct tape, find beads, search through your house or art class for anything that's cool.

, This is where you can go crazy, if your school allows additions. A bright pink trench coat? Why not! Bright blue leggings? Go for it! If you don't have shoes that you are assigned, choose shoes that really show off who you are. Preppy folks can wear moccasins or Mary Jane shoes, punky/emo students look great in converse high tops or plaid slip-ons. Backpacks are another great way to show off your personal style.

,, Sew labels, logos or patches onto the bag to improve a standard school bag.

, Let them tell you what's wrong and then fix it if you have to. If it looks good, teachers won't write you up they will actually commend you on your style. If they give you detention carefully show them your loophole and get off with a warning.

, Although you cannot change the school uniform policy, you can change how you interpret it. There are a variety of blazers, slacks, skirts and button down shirts out there. Find one that you feel comfortable in, but still complies with school policy.

, If the colors are blue, white and black, but you have been wearing a white shirt, blue skirt and black shoes every day of your school life, go wild! If you have no money and your parents are tightening their purse strings, customize your clothes. On a white shirt sew on black and blue felt patches and make a black, white and blue felt tie by braiding yarn and tying it like a tie!

, Cool socks , shoes, undershirts, and belts can look great on guys. Part your hair differently, or gel it too.

, Just check it washes out first!

,
Long hair should be tied up high up or let down with a headband for a preppy look.
The tomboy short hair should be with a headband or clip. Also nice if plain.

,,, Always stand straight for better clothing posture.

, Iron your clothes

, This will keep your skin looking its best and your spirits high.

, You're not there to be a fashion statement, remember to study hard.

Give the right impression.",How to Be a Social Butterfly," When it comes to changing our personalities, it has to be more than just something we want. We have to need it. We have to reach a point where we can no longer function the current way we are. Think of why you want to be a social butterfly and concentrate on it. Digest it. Turn it over in your brain. Now get set on changing it.


This will be a 'light bulb' moment. You won't see a change in your behavior overnight, but you will see a change in your mindset. You can't run before you walk! You won't realize you're a social butterfly until you're in the middle of a party one day, sitting back and thinking ""Huh? When did this happen?"";
, Once you're set on the idea of becoming the life of the party, don't think, ""Okay. Scott's party this Friday? I'm gonna wow everyone there."" That's not how it works. That just sets you up for failure and will ultimately end up in you going home, wrapping yourself up in your covers, and not coming out until you get hungry. Set small goals. 5 minutes of wowing the crowd, not the entire night.


It totally depends on where you are on the social butterfly spectrum. Some people can't even go to parties without being miserable while others will mingle, but only with the people they're comfortable with. Wherever you are, aim for a little more. When you get that little bit more, aim higher.

, You know what you want to do and you know to take it slow. Now how do you do it? Well, you start by removing fear and anxiety when it comes to social situations. Here's a few things to keep in mind:


Everyone's worried about getting embarrassed or rejected. If they say they're not, they're probably lying. At the very least they used to be not so carefree! Find a social butterfly you know and ask them about this. They'll tell you of their social anxieties, too!
You won't die. Unless you start a conversation with the next unabomber and inadvertently insult his cat, you'll be fine. In fact, the odds of something legitimately bad happening are slim to none.
At the end of the day, we all go home worried about how we came off; we're not thinking about anyone else. So if you're preoccupied with what others think of you, know that they're too absorbed in their own image to be thinking about yours!

, Sometimes when people get into social situations that they don't know how to handle, their personalities change. They compensate for how they feel inside by coming off full of themselves, brash, and sometimes just plain mean. If you find yourself thinking, ""I have to impress these people to get them to like me,"" kick it down a notch.


Really, being yourself is the best thing you can do. Everyone (and you're aiming for everyone) wants to be around people that are natural, at ease, and not trying too hard. If your presence says, ""Here I am, world! This is me,"" people can't argue with that.

, Sometimes people get caught up in the ""anything you can do, I can do better"" phrase. Straight facts: that does not make for good conversation! You should be confident, most definitely. Confidence is very attractive. But you can't go asking for attention or patting your own back. It's gotta be given to you!


Accept compliments gracefully. When someone gives you one, the best thing you can say? ""Thank you."" Imagine that. So simple. Give them gracefully, too.
Go slower. Generally, confident people move a bit slower and talk a bit slower.The idea here is that unconfident people think they'll be cut off at any moment and try not to take up so much of other people's time. So slow down! You'll project confidence.

, To change your personality is nothing to shake a stick at. To get over this giant hill, you'll need some serious positive thinking. Luckily, you have complete control! You can become a social butterfly and you will. The only thing stopping you is you.


A big old part of thinking positively is liking yourself. When you like yourself, the rest of life gets a lot cheerier. Your social worth is the same as everyone else's -- it's just a matter of realizing it.

, Now that we're past the abstract, master-your-own-mind stuff, onto the meat and potatoes of it all. If you want to be a social ninja, reading people is imperative. There a dozen cues you can find at anytime to know how to act around a person. When you can spot 'em, the whole process of socializing gets a lot easier.


Don't only read their body language, tone, and visual cues, but take in how they interact with others. Do they have a large personal bubble? Do they value humor and joking around or are they more quiet and intellectual? If you can emulate it, do so. Fitting into every social circle is just a matter of interacting how the group expects.

, For different groups, there may be different expectations for body language and eye contact. But for most humans, there are good rules of thumb: be open and make eye contact most of the time. You want to appear confident and relaxed, not stressed out and menacing.


In some circles, though not all, flirting is an integral part of being a social butterfly. Everyone likes being flirted with and it's a simple way to establish a bond. When someone touches us, we automatically feel closer to them. If you want to work your way in, start flirting!

, You probably have your friends and odds are they're all a little similar. To be that butterfly, you'll need to branch out! You'll gain new skills, meet new people, and learn to interact with others that aren't as like you. So instead of being in a play, work backstage. Instead of swimming, take a scuba course. Instead of playing chess, join the cricket team. Just a little out of your comfort zone for starters!


If it intrigues you, consider taking an acting class. Being forced to play a role and getting used to that feeling makes it a lot easier to fake being a social butterfly. There will be times when you don't feel like being social, but you can find a character within you who does. And if you fake it for long enough, it eventually becomes habit!

, Most people are totally tuned out to the world. It's how ""stop and smell the roses"" gained its meaning. Instead, get in the moment. Observe. Do it right now: think about what you're feeling (in the touch sense), hearing, smelling, tasting, and seeing. What did you notice that you didn't 10 seconds ago?


This will help when interacting with people. You'll have more to say and you'll pick up on people's more subtle reactions. You'll be able to ask more interesting questions and since no one else is noticing, you'll be particularly impressive.

, When you do get out there, the only way you can truly be a butterfly is to flit around every circle. You can't sit with the jocks and look down on the band kids. You can't associate with the hipsters and turn your nose up at the preps. You gotta be open to everyone. Otherwise you're a butterfly without wings. You're a social caterpillar.


Being a social butterfly is sort of different than being popular. That's because being popular does not mean you are well-liked by everyone! The Plastics in Mean Girls were popular, but they weren't liked. So while you should definitely make friends with the popular kids (even if you're out of school!), make friends with everyone else, too.

, You'll need to get used to being where the people are and having everyone know your name, so might as well start now. Run for class president. Organize a new club. Seek out some public recognition. The more people who know you, the easier it'll be to socialize at all those parties you're going to!


Seek out a position of leadership anywhere. It could be at school, at your job, or at one of your extracurricular activities. When you hold the reigns, people will be coming to you. Imagine being a butterfly that the flowers come to themselves!

, You remember how we talked about how accepting compliments is best done with a simple ""Thank you?"" Well, turns out that's right for most social interactions! Walking up to someone and saying, ""Hi. I don't believe we've met,"" is an incredibly direct, confident, effective way of starting a conversation. Humans just want to make it harder for some reason!


Sometimes you've gotta do the approaching because other people just aren't gutsy enough. Like you used to be! They're all nervous to initiate social interaction. Just walking up to someone, looking them in the eye, smiling, and saying, ""Hi, my name is...,"" can get the ball rolling. A handshake doesn't hurt.
When you have three minutes with a person, seize it. At the bus stop? Talk to the guy next to you about his bag. In line at the checkout? Ask the lady how her day is going. The little things count just as much!

, Surprisingly enough, it doesn't have to be painful if you don't want it to be. And it doesn't just have to be about the weather! Small talk can be fun and fulfilling when the right topic and the right person rolls around. If you have even five minutes with a person, start chatting. Totally not threatening too!


While Brits are okay with talking about the weather, you may want to avoid it across the pond. Since that may or may not be out of the question, talk about whatever is in front of you. Long line at the store? A holiday coming up? The bus is late? Or maybe you don't know what to order at the coffee shop! Don't think of it as making meaningless chatter—think of it as brightening someone else's otherwise boring day.
This skill will help you fill awkward silences. So the next time you're sitting by that girl in class that you've spoken to a few times, that project you're working on together next quarter won't be so awkward.

, You're naturally going to find it easier to talk to some people over others. Those you have the most in common with will be the ones you gravitate to. While it's fine to spend a lot of time with these people, go out of your way to talk to everyone else. You can only get better with practice!


This is easiest if you can find common ground. Do you share a class? A hobby? A boss? Everyone likes being paid attention to. When you have 5 minutes to kill, fight the urge to go poke your best friend and walk up to that girl you've been meaning to chat with.

, The best face to put on when you're talking to someone is your interested face. Ever talked to someone who just doesn't seem to give a damn about a word you say? It's the worst. Now have you ever talked to someone who made you seem like the only person in the room? Bingo.


Along with smiling and devoting them your entire attention both verbally and non-verbally, ask them questions. When something comes up, get the details. It's the fastest way to gravitate the conversation to a point where you both feel it was meaningful.

, Those people you don't know so well will be a bit hard to talk to in the beginning. If the idea of making small talk with virtual strangers or meager acquaintances sounds painful, you're gonna need to get over that! It's what social butterflies do. The easiest way to get over that hump is to think of them as people you've known your entire life. What's keeping you from going, ""Hey! How you doing?"" Nothing, that's what.


When we've known people our entire lives, we drop the façade. We are ourselves. When that pretty girl or guy you like walks in the room, you think, "" How's my hair?"" and when your childhood neighbor walks in, you find a Cheetos on your pants, give it a quick once-over for dust and hair, shove it in your mouth and say, ""Yo."" While you might not want to go that far, you can see where being around someone who's relaxed and themselves is super calming.

Some people might be freaked out by this. The introverts, those with massive trust issues, they might not take to your super comfortable approach. So before you go about asking them how the family is, gauge your relationship and their demeanor. Better safe than sorry.



, You're a people machine. Now that you're ready to get your feet wet in every social situation, do so. Go to parties where you only know a few people. Hit up an art museum and follow it up with a tractor pull. Go to a wine tasting with your bowling team and then meet up with coworkers for pool and karaoke. Get out there!


Keep as many social circles going at once as you can. If you stop making the effort, you may stop being invited. So Tuesday night you'll spend with your chess buddies, Thursday is reserved for your Italian cooking classmates, and Saturday is for your college gang.

, Want to flit around talking to everyone you've ever met? Throw a party! When it's on your turf, you have complete control. You can spend 8 minutes talking with one group, go grab a plate of finger foods, get sidetracked by another, eventually make it to the dining room, get roped into a toast, and end up on the patio with another. And when your friends meet your other friends, they can make connections, too!


One of the hardest parts about being a social butterfly is spreading yourself too thin. You'll have so many friends it'll be hard to pay them all enough attention. A party is a good way to get everyone you like involved simultaneously. Just be prepared for clean up duty!

, This is good advice for everyone. Even hermits. If you want to feel your best and look your best, it's important to shower, brush your teeth, wear deodorant, etc. People tend to judge a book by its cover, so don't start off on the wrong foot by stinking up the room.

, We humans want the simplest way to size up everything we see. Unfortunately, because of that, a lot of judging happens. If you walk into a high school wearing all black, too much eyeliner, and carrying around a backpack that says ""I Pray to Hell"", you might not make it onto the cheer squad. So to fit in with every group, wherever you are, don't subscribe to a label. It's the only way to fit in with everyone.


The most obvious way to do this is with your clothes. Have your own style. Don't avoid trends, but don't actively seek them out. And when it comes to your actions, do a little of everything! Be the person whose president of the environmental club, plays volleyball, and still makes time to practice the French horn.

, In case no one has told you, life is generally easier for pretty people. It's another of the same: humans want a quick way to judge things, and being pretty is equivalent to being good. It's not right, but it's kind of how it is. Since it probably won't change anytime soon, to be accepted more easily, putting effort into your appearance will take you a long way.


This doesn't mean dolling yourself up to the 9s. It means wearing clothes that are ironed, sort of match, doing your hair, and maybe throwing on some chapstick. The nines are appropriate once in a while, but 5s and 6s will get you through the day to day.

, Try as Oscar the Grouch might, he probably won't make a ton of friends and be accepted in the majority of circles. He's just so negative. Be the person you want people to see! Be open, communicative, and fun to be around. When you're received well, it's a lot easier to keep going.


The simplest thing you can do is make yourself approachable. Put your phone down, for goodness sake! Look up and around your world. Uncross your arms and look engaged in the moment. How else will people come in and out?

Slip on interesting earrings.,
Layer bracelets for more visual interest.,
Choose a statement necklace that fits your neckline.,
Wear an eye-catching watch that complements your uniform colors.",How to Accessorize Your School Uniform1," Earrings can draw attention to your face and are a fun way to differentiate your uniform’s look. Experiment with different styles, such as studs, chandelier-style earrings, hoops or geometric earrings. You can also play with different materials, such as metals or acrylics, or different colors, to find the perfect combination that suits you.Select earrings that match your personality. If you are loud and love to make jokes, maybe bright color hoops, such as neon pink, would suit you.
If you’re a romantic, perhaps lace-appliqué earrings would best showcase who you are.;
, Layer lots of thin bracelets in different metals to add texture to your look. Wearing multiple chunky jewelry pieces can make your appearance seem sloppy. Opt for thin bracelets you can mix and match in silver, gold and bronze tones.A three-quarter sleeve uniform top could be matched with a thin gold finger bracelet and lots of bangles for a pretty and unexpected look.

, Wear a statement necklace with a shape that mimics that of your uniform neckline. If your school uniform has a blouse with a round collar, for example, try a statement necklace with a rounded shape. Whether you prefer a statement necklace that is thick, very colorful, or both, opt for just one rather than layering several, which can be distracting.A navy V-neck sweater could look nice with a V-shaped statement necklace in gold.
A khaki uniform dress with a square collar might look nice with a bib necklace in olive green.

, Use the face or strap of a watch to highlight a color in your uniform. This will make the whole look cohesive but also more interesting. Or, if your uniform colors are very drab, add some pop by selecting a watch in a fun color you love.If your uniform skirt is a green, blue and red plaid, you could wear a watch with a red strap to highlight that tone.
If your uniform is white and tan, you could choose a watch with a purple face to provide interest and contrast.

Switch up the frames of your glasses.,
Express yourself with a tie.,
Carry an interesting bag.,
Try a cool belt buckle.",How to Accessorize Your School Uniform2," Choose glasses in a new shape or fun color to differentiate your look. Frames are a great way to express yourself, as they come in a variety of shapes, such as square, cat eye or round. They also come in all the colors of the rainbow, as well as interesting patterns, such as tortoise shell. Make your uniform look more interesting by choosing glasses with some personality.For example, a cat eye frame in a tortoise shell color could be flirty and interesting.
Square glasses with navy frames could highlight navy in your uniform.

, Make yourself feel more unique by choosing a tie with a print of your favorite hobby or even favorite color. Often school uniforms are formal, and some may even require you to wear a tie. This is a great way to show your style even within a strict dress code.If you’re into baseball, you could pick a tie with bats and balls printed on it.
If you love the color orange, choose a tangerine or peach color tie for a formal look that goes with your uniform.
A tie bar is also an interesting way to add flair to your look.

, Select a bag with cool features like fringe, a unique print, or cool material. You can even decorate your bag by drawing on it or adding patches or glitter. Often school handbooks have stricter rules about what you can wear but more lax rules for things like bags that you carry with you but are not a part of your clothing.You could add patches of your favorite band to your book bag, for example.
If you like to dress up, you could carry a patent leather purse in a jewel tone, such as purple or teal.

, Choose a belt buckle that reflects your style or a unique interest of yours. Since many school uniforms require belts, a belt with a surprising buckle is a fun, everyday way to express your style.


If you’re into comic books, you could get a belt with a batman buckle.
If you like a feminine look, you could choose a belt in a thin leather with a gold buckle.

"
"
Play with headbands.,
Wear a scarf.,
Secure your hair with an interesting clip.,
Try wearing hats.",How to Accessorize Your School Uniform3," Choose a headband that lies flat against the head for the most wearable look. You can use a headband to pick up a color you like in your uniform or even add a little sparkle to your look. Experiment with prints and different widths to find a headband that you like.A headband can be particularly interesting if you have short hair, like a pixie cut.
Try wearing a headband with your hair up or down to see which look you like best.

, Play with scarves in different materials and prints to add interest to your school uniform. You can style them in a Parisian way tied around your neck, around the handle of a bag to add some color, or around your hair like a headband. Silk, cotton and linen are all versatile materials to consider.If you like an edgy, modern look when you’re not at school, you could choose a geometric scarf in a bright print.
If you a like a softer look, try a floral scarf in pastel colors.

, Use a hair clip instead of a plain hair band to dress up your uniform and express yourself. You could choose a clip with a motif you like or a clip covered in printed fabric for some color.If you’re dreaming of the beach, you could choose a pearlescent clip in the shape of a seashell.
If you love dogs, try a clip with a paw-and-bone print.
You can use the clip to secure your hair in a ponytail or try using one to clip your bangs out of your face.

, Any hat indoors is a bold choice, so opt for a sophisticated hat to elevate your uniform. Avoid extravagant or large hats, such as a sombrero, which will seem like a costume. For a feminine look, you could try a small fascinator in black or navy, or if you like a throwback, don a fedora in a color that matches your uniform.If allowed, you could try a more casual style, such as a baseball cap, in a more sophisticated fabric, such as a gray flannel.

"
"
Switch to a new style.,
Play with color in a traditional style.,
Embrace patterns for a funky look.,
Bedazzle or bejewel your shoes.",How to Accessorize Your School Uniform4," Embrace a new style of shoe, such as a different height or toe, to add interest to your look. If you usually wear wedges, you could try a neat ballet flat. If you usually wear an open-toed sandal, try a short boot to switch things up.

, If the style of shoe you can wear is restricted by the dress code, wear a fun color for a new twist. Burgundy, forest green and cobalt are all subdued enough to satisfy many school dress codes while still setting you apart.


If shoe color is highly restricted, try swapping in some different laces for a new look.

, Try shoes with a floral, geometric, or other pattern to liven up your uniform. Since most uniforms are in flat, neutral colors, embracing a pattern on your feet can add color and interest to your look. Plus, since shoes are not a huge accessory, even loud or busy patterns are often very wearable.Try a polka-dotted kitten heel for a retro spin on your uniform, for example.
You could try a ballet flat in a blue floral pattern to go with a navy uniform, for example.

, You can add some sparkle to your shoes by gluing on glitter or using a bedazzler to add gems and grommets. This is a fun and playful look that sets your shoes apart, even if they have to meet various other rules. You could try bedazzling just the toe, or adding glitter to only the heel as a creative accent."

School work - All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.",How to Look Like a Model at School (Middle Schoolers)," Both of them will damage your teeth, health, happiness and overall body. Sometimes they can even cost you your life. They are never, ever the solution. If you want to lose weight, do it the healthy way - not over a toilet. See your doctor and come up with a healthy eating plan, or do three sets of cardio exercise (like dancing/jogging/cycling) and two weight training sessions per week. Yoga and Pilates are wonderful stress-relievers, and tone your body at the same time.;
, Smell beautiful, nobody likes B.O.! Use a nice scented body gel and matching lotion after your shower, if possible. For example, use citrus gel, citrus lotion, citrus deodorant/anti-perspiration and citrus perfume. Floral and musk are also delicious. Brush your teeth twice a day, mouthwash and floss once a day.

, When have you ever seen a model with bad hair? Make sure it's never greasy, dry or damaged. Apply an intensive conditioner weekly. Get your hair trimmed every three to six weeks to avoid split ends.

, Models always have a perfect, zit-free complexion. Get into the habit, it works wonders! Buy products to suit your skin type, and always purchase natural ones. Dry - creamy cleanser/moisturizing toner/rich moisturiser. Oily - wash off cleanser/toner/oil-free moisturiser. Combination - foaming cleanser/toner/ oil-free moisturizer for day and slightly richer moisturiser for night-time. Apply a face mask and pore strips (if you have blackheads) once a week. If you have spots, deal with them. Take a zinc supplement, drink lots of water and apply a topical spot treatment twice a week. If you have acne, go to your local doctors. They will be able to prescribe medication for it, such as Accutane.

, High-street makes great outfits if you know what cut and colour suits you. If you have a uniform, try personalizing with badges, patches, coats, bags etc IF ALLOWED. Things like hairbands or sparkly hair clips can also make you stand out.

, It's best to have matching sets of jewellery, (i.e. all silver or all gold). If you've gone for gold, go easy on the number of chains and rings you wear, as if you overload them it generally looks common. At school, if you aren't allowed to wear jewellery, a small pair of studs and a pretty watch work well.

, If allowed, be natural. A small amount of mascara, eyeliner, lip gloss, natural blush and concealer and/or tinted moisturiser (if needed) go a long way. Same with nails - if allowed, paint natural colours like clear, french polish, light pinks or light blues. Get a manicure once a month or do one yourself weekly. Pedicure your toes too, even if you think no one will see them!

, No one likes an insecure, bullying whiner. It doesn't win you any model points, either. Smiling is better than any amount of good-looks. Don't dump your life-long friends just because they aren't deemed 'cool' enough. You want to be popular, right? Be a good, kind, generous friend. Listen to other people's problems and give sincere compliments. Popularity isn't about being the most fashionable, mean, and gossiped-about person in school.

, Yeah well, all play and no work makes Jack fail all his finals, too. You may not be great at Maths or English, but TRY! Always do your homework, be punctual, polite and listen to what your teacher has to say. Your teachers will appreciate the effort! Find a healthy balance between school-work and socialising.

",How to Design a Vintage Style/Rockabilly School Uniform," Talk to him/her about your idea of a new uniform before you go ahead and do anything! You could get into serious trouble for doing something without their approval. Make an appointment and bring your design portfolio if you already have one. Talk to them about the kind of style you like and ask them what style they like and decide on both. Also, find a colour scheme that you both like.;
, If you can't afford it, maybe ask for a sketchbook for your birthday or Christmas present. Use your portfolio like a scrapbook diary for your inspiration and ideas - drawing up design pages, dress patterns, rough sketches, magazine cutouts, collages, photos...anything.

, Vintage clothing is any clothing that resembles the 1920s - 1960s time period. For example, you choose the 1950s. Take careful note of the particular kind of style, popular fabrics and the trends. Keep in mind that the fashion style depends on the country - American 1950s was very different compared to French 1950s. Scribble down any other information of what was considered fashionable in that time period - and it's a smart idea to do some rough sketches.

, Don't forget to compare them with the current uniform. If you're lucky, you may even get to see real samples of the old uniform...When you do, scribble down the colors, so you have some inspiration.

, Don't forget to bring a notebook and a pen so you can write down the fabric used, sewing technique - see how you can reference it to your fashionable time period. Draw the uniform and annotate it. Make sure your annotations are meaningful.

, Alternatively, copy a still life object. For example, you choose a flower. Draw that flower in a variety of different ways. Do a couple of pencil studies and don't forget to do some colour studies too. And then after that, draw a stylized version of that object.

, Look at the different fabrics. Do you want the fabric to be patterned, tie-dyed or a solid block of colour? Touch it. Do you like the feel? Take note of the cost. Is it expensive? Will it be a crisp white linen? Cotton? Polyester? Rayon? What colour will it be? White? Red? Green? Blue? Navy?

, Be as creative as you like - but keep within that colour scheme that you and your principal decided on. Fill up the entire page. The pages should have a 1950s flavour about them or a sense of whatever time period you have researched.

, If you can, use an artist's colour wheel, as it will really help you in working out what colours go well together.

, Make sure each annotation is meaningful - ask yourself questions. Does it enhance the sense of style - yes or no? Does it match the time period? Does it have line? Have you used a good colour range? What motifs are you using? Where are you going to put the motifs? What silhouette does it have? Which body shape does it best fit?

,, If you are terrible at sewing with a machine, either hire a sewing machine (if you can afford it)and teach yourself how to use it. Or, borrow one from someone who knows how to sew - and get them to teach you how to use it. Know how to set it up, know the different settings, types of stitches.

, Yes, I said sew it! Many fashion designers do this, believe it or not. Make adjustments if you need to.

, But if they don't like your uniform, keep drawing new designs and keep sewing doll-sized uniform replicas until they are satisfied.

, Send the word around school.

, Wear a little bit of powder foundation that matches your skin color. Only use liquid foundation for zits, but before you do make sure it is a special kind that can go on acne and not irritate it. Wear little eyeliner and mascara. Makeup is mostly made to enhance the color of your eyes not put so much stuff on them that it takes attention away form you eyes. Remember, you aren't 25, so don't act like it. You're young, enjoy it while you can. Don't try to grow up too fast.

, EVERYONE HAS ACNE. It's part of growing up. You can buy some stuff at your local drugstore to make it less noticeable or frequent. I know you've heard this a million times but NEVER touch or pick at your face. All it does is irritate your skin and leave scars.

, Try to style your hair every day. To make your hair look feminine and pretty straighten or curl your hair. Add a clip or braid, something.

, Don't ever buy too big or small clothes. It's not attractive or sexy. When you are buying clothes always try them on before you pay. Why? Well, the shirt or pants may look really cute on the rack but maybe not on you. There's no harm done in trying them on. Just remember to wear clothes that easily come on and off so you can change easily.

, If you wear shoes that are too tight or hurt your feet, STOP WEARING THEM! All you are going to do is get blisters and feel very uncomfortable all day. Who wants that? If you just have to have them but they're not in your size, then either wait until the shipment comes in or look for something else. Trust me, your feet will thank you!

, That's pretty much self explanatory. Guys love happy nice girls! So if you're nice and smile a lot then guys will love you!

, NO ONE LIKES UGLY TEETH! If your teeth are yellow, then buy some teeth whitener! If your teeth aren't straight then talk to your parents about braces. If you can't afford them, then try to save up or at least make them as clean as possible.

, Weight is a touchy subject, especially for girls, but you are beautiful in your own skin. Don't compare yourself to other girls. Everyone is built differently in their own unique way. If you do want to lose some weight then start jogging over the summer. NEVER STARVE YOURSELF, TAKE PILLS, OR MAKE YOURSELF VOMIT!!!!! It is so unhealthy and unattractive. The pills are unnatural and unsafe. Starving yourself makes you look too skinny and hurts your body. When you starve yourself, your body starts to eat up its stored fat and then it starts to eat ITSELF! Making yourself vomit is so unsanitary and gross. All of that stomach acid that goes through your mouth ends up rotting your teeth. That is VERY unattractive. Eat right and exercise daily and I promise that you'll start to see and feel the results!

Ladies, time to shave.","How to Look Confident, Cool, and Smart for Middle School"," One week before school starts brush your teeth and floss at least once a day for one to two minutes.;
, Take a bath every day! About around this time your body is becoming into a teenager so use deodorant, mouth wash, wash your hair & body, and if you really want to smell nice use A LITTLE BIT of body spray/perfume/cologne.

, Wear right fitting clothes! Nothing too big, nothing too small. And wear the appropriate under-garments and make sure nobody can see them. Follow your school's dress code!

, The night before the first day of school paint your nails. Or tie-dye blank white t-shirts. Or make unique beaded bracelets and necklaces. Do something that shows your personality so you don’t look like everybody else. Be yourself no matter what!

, You don’t have to wear high-heels or dresses to middle school. Don't worry about being best-dressed. Wear something nice,but also nothing you would to the park. Like jeans and a cute top. Or tennis shoes and a sparkly headband. And also check the weather and dress according to that. Don't wear rain boots on a clear sky!

, It's trashy,weird-looking,and nobody likes it. If you are going to wear make-up ask an adult or an older (trusted!) girl (who wears make-up)to help you. And if you can't find either of them then go online to find out how to apply make-up.

, At this age you're trying to find out who you are. But don't try to be someone you aren't.

, This is not the kind of diet to lose weight. Just eat healthy and get more exercise. Like instead of an elevator take the stairs, or try walking instead of riding in car if possible. It will make you feel good and it gives you more energy.

, For the new year think about getting a new hairstyle! Like a new cut, new color, highlights, low lights, unnatural colors, feather hair extensions, getting bangs and/or choppy layers, anything you could think of! But get the new cut ONE WEEK BEFORE school starts, so just in case you don't like it it'll have grown out just a bit.

, Around this time in life you will have to shave your legs, under arms, eyebrows and bikini line. (optional) arms, feet, back, and stomach. If you don’t prefer shaving you can also try waxing, laser hair removal,check with doctor what style you should choose.

Be kind to people.",How to Dress Pastel Goth in Middle School," Hair is one of the most important factors of the pastel goth look. If your parents say it is okay to dye your hair. go ahead ! Do not dye your own hair though, make sure a parent or a hairdresser does it.


Having wild hair (even black or pure white) can make it difficult to get jobs or get into universities. On that note, you will want to make your hair very simple, either just normal or with blunt-low cut bangs. To make your hair appear softer, try putting hair oil on the ends and conditioning often.
Common hair colors for pastel goth are: Any pastel, Pastel Purple, Black, or Natural.
You may also want to spend some extra time working out hair styles that work for you. Keeping your hair in a style is a lot classier and more fashionable than leaving it down or in a ponytail.;
, Clothing is basically what makes the pastel goth. If you don't get the clothing right, you will be regarded as a scene kid, a regular goth, a hipster or just plain normal. To make sure that doesn't happen, colors and pieces to avoid wearing are listed in the tips section.


Stock up on the following: oversized tops/sweaters/cardigans, button up formal shirts, one nice tuxedo shirt, striped clothing, plain pants, plain v-necks, plain dresses, Peter Pan collar shirts, any collared shirts, high waisted pants/skirts/shorts and floral pattern clothing.

You may want to avoid red clothing, as other people will pinpoint you as scene or hipster if you wear it. Try going for a violet or sky blue top instead.
Wear the right shoes. Shoes are a huge part of the pastel goth look. You may see lots of pictures of pastel goths wearing high heels, but this is not appropriate for middle school and could result in expulsion or suspension from school on your part.
Doc Martens has great shoes, which fit to your feet and come in many styles and colours. For example, you could try their boots.

Mary Janes, Combat Boots, Uniform Type Shoes, Short Doc Martens, Ballet Flats, Leather Shoes and many other shoes from shoe companies are great choices for footwear. Make sure that your footwear is comfortable and appropriate. You will want to avoid shoes with spikes and embellishments; they are more scene and goth than pastel.

, Accessories are important to finish off the pastel look. Many people overdo them, so remember to understate all accessories.


A rule of thumb is to never wear more than 4 accessories at once.
Good accessories are hair bands, flower crowns, bows, metal link bracelets, charm bracelets, small leather purse, and a nice necklace. Please be sure to make all jewelry appropriate, and never wear any large earrings.

,, Pastel goths are supposed to be innocent and intelligent. Make sure to keep your grades up in school; if they go down, your parents might blame this on your pastel Gothicism.


Sarcasm is allowed, but only a very small amount, which is to be said very jokingly.

Be yourself!",How to Look Cute and Dress Nicely for Middle School (Girls)," Take a shower using a scented bath gel and a soft sponge. Use warm water and really get clean. You should always be clean and smell nice when you go to school, be sure to use deodorant every morning. While you're in the shower, shave your armpits and legs (if you're allowed to), and wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Use a washcloth with some soap or shower gel and scrub your body. Brush and part your hair in the shower, so it dries nicely. Try to take a shower every other day or every day, but since it is not good to wash your hair every day, you may want to use a shower cap every other day if you choose to shower every day. After you shower, you can put in de-tangler or leave-in conditioner if your hair gets frizzy.;
, Wash your face using a facial cleanser and use a lightweight moisturizer afterwards. Facial cleanser or a bar of facial soap helps to remove dirt, oil, and makeup from the face, making your skin less prone to acne. Make sure you aren't allergic to any of the products you're using.

, Brush your teeth every day and night using a good toothpaste, and remember to use mouthwash to keep your breath fresh and your teeth white! Try to stay away from products like whitening gels and strips - these products eat the enamel of your teeth, and can be very harmful to your gums. If you have used whitening toothpaste in the past, start using an enamel protecting toothpaste like Pronamel. Keep on lip balm to keep your smile flawless. If you have braces, make sure you clean your teeth extra-well. That way, even though you don't have a perfect smile, you won't have food particles stuck on your teeth.

, Now that you're getting older and sweating more, wear deodorant. Also, consider putting on a light spritz of sweet smelling perfume.

, When you pick out your outfit, always try it on and look in the mirror to see how it looks; if it doesn't look nice on you, try a different outfit that fits your body or goes well against your skin tone. If an outfit looks and feels good on you, don't try on another. Keep in mind, you are going to be in school, so choose something comfy and modest, but cute. Be daring and try new styles. If you never wore skirts in elementary school, try wearing one for a day to see if you like it. You might be surprised. Shorts will always be in style, so be sure to have a few.


Don't wear see-through shirts. Sometimes if you wear a white or light-coloured shirt your bra will show through. Try to wear a tank top or cami underneath to avoid that.
Don't try to look immodest; you're only in middle school, so wearing skimpy clothing will only give people the wrong idea. Dress modestly to avoid ending up in the principal's office. If you're wearing a low-cut shirt, for example, put a bandeau or a tank top underneath to cover up some of your skin.

, Accessories are really fun, and they add some extra style and flair to an otherwise boring outfit. They can compliment your outfit or bring out an accent color. Try wearing some as bracelets, bangles, charms, rings, earrings, necklaces, etc. and see what you think.

, Blow dry, curl, scrunch, braid, or straighten your hair. Don't forget to use a special spray so your hair doesn't get damaged from all the heat. If you have thick hair or dry hair, use a detangler or leave-in conditioner to calm your hair down. Finish off with a nice smelling hairspray to keep the frizz away. To add some extra flair, add a hair accessory such as a pretty barrette, headband, clip, flower, etc.


Style your hair differently. For example, instead of the basic ponytail, go for a French braid. If you want to be really adventurous, get an entirely new haircut, or even just side bangs. You might want to try side bangs first because they are a whole different look, but if you don't like them, you can always clip them back so they're not noticeable.

, Just because you're in middle school does not automatically mean that you should start wearing makeup. If you wear makeup, use it lightly. Make sure you look natural. In middle school, a bit of mascara and some lip balm goes a very long way. Paint your nails and pluck your eyebrows,only if you think it is necessary.

, A smile makes every outfit better. Having the ""look"" does not matter if you aren't happy with yourself. Try to be different, but don't forget that everyone will respect you if you respect yourself. It makes you the best you possibly can be, being pretty and happy. Don't lose confidence and don't let people bring you down, because some people are just haters; don't worry about them.

, Make sure you put body lotion on your face, arms, and legs. This will keep your skin clear, soft, and healthy looking.

, You need confidence! If confidence means make-up, try not to over-do it. Remember, be yourself! An original is always worth more than a copy. You'll realize that others will start to complement you more than usual if your just your self!

, Make sure you put on deodorant and brush your teeth before you do, so that there aren't any stains.

, Less is more. Eye shadow in a light or subtle color is ideal. Also some eye liner and mascara looks really good with a light shade of sparkly lip gloss.

, If your dress is somewhat plain, you can wear a long necklace and bangles. Also, remember to bring a little purse or bag so you have somewhere to store the essentials: money, mints or gum, touch up makeup, a cell phone, and feminine products (if you need them.)

, Make sure the scent matches the body lotion. If not, it may smell funny, and that turns some guys off.

Be yourself!",How to Be Attractive As a Sixth Grade Girl," Take a shower or bathe daily, and wash your hair at least 3 times a week (more or less, depending on hair type). Wash your face, preferably with a face wash designed to fight acne, or a witch hazel toner. Your face will start to be more oily, so be sure to wash with soap and warm water every day, two times (preferably in the morning and before you go to bed). Also, moisturize your legs and arms, too - nobody enjoys seeing all that dry, wrinkled skin, but they do like seeing the flat, perfect skin.;
, Ask your hair stylist for an easy-to-maintain hairstyle that suits your face shape and is out of your face. The trims will help your hair not to get split ends. Plus, it will grow faster. Also, if you take a thin-toothed comb and brush from your roots frequently, your hair will become shinier.

After brushing, you should floss and use mouthwash. During the day, keep mints and mint-flavored gum in handy. This will keep your breath fresh.

Most sixth grade girls like miniskirts, jeans, graphic t-shirts, oversize sweaters/sweatshirts/jackets matched with skinny jeans, etc. Feel free to experiment, though.

Decide whether you want to follow fashion trends or create your own.,
Keep things simple.,
Check out what others are wearing around you.,
Be aware that style isn't just about copying others.,
Go shopping at the mall.,
Hit the trendy stores.,
Consider thrift and charity stores too.,
Set goals on what you want to get for each trip.,
Make sure that any clothing you end up choosing complements you and your personal style.,
Decide which accessories will work with your clothes.,
Don't spend fifty dollars on a necklace.,
Don't overdo the accessories.,
Dress as befits who you are.,
Reflect some of your personality in your clothing.",How to Be Stylish in Middle School," Either approach is fine. Also, have a good sense of what looks good on you, so as to avoid fashion mistakes.


To keep up with the latest styles, read teen mags, like Teen Vogue, Tiger Beat, and Seventeen.
Browsing online ""look books"" is an awesome way of getting some much-needed inspiration if you're missing it.;
, Perhaps plaid, or a small burst of sequins. Something like a pair of capris and a loose sweater, with a tank top underneath. Simple and stylish.

, It's fine to be inspired by what the others are wearing, and even to find out where that boy or girl is purchasing their clothing from. The main thing is to be sure that what you're fancying on another person is going to look good on you too.


Don't be afraid to ask another boy or girl which stores they get their clothes from. It's a compliment. If they don't know, don't care or don't want to tell you, just say something like ""No worries, I just wanted to compliment you on your good taste"".
If you want to take part in hot trends at your school, that's cool. However, once again, if the clothing doesn't suit you, don't feel obliged to fit yourself to it.

, Don't go overboard trying to look like someone else. If you see something different that you truly like, then buy it. Don't waste your time getting clothing to please others. Part of fashion is about making yourself happy because you're worth it.

, You can go with friends if liked but don't take them along if you feel that all they do is distract you or try to convince you to get clothing different from that which you like. If they're good at giving honest advice though, they may be helpful.

, Find out what clothing is on display and considered currently trendy by browsing various different stores. Having an overview of what's in fashion can help you to get a better idea of what you like best. This means not buying the first things you see––the items will still be there when you go back after thinking about it.

, Nice, one-off pieces can be found for little money in such stores and these can really add to your look. Many such stores color code the clothing, making it easy for you to find pieces in your favorite colors. A touch of unique is good for your fashion style.

, For example: ""I want to get a new skirt, two pairs of jeans, and a white lace sweater today"". Having specific items in mind will help you to focus solely on what you really want to get, instead of getting distracted on things you don't need or already have in your closet.

, Choose colors that look good on you and that fit well. Remember that fashion is not worth discomfort, especially not at school.

, If you do, it'll suck when you see a cute bangle, or when you spot a sweet handbag, and can't afford it.

, For girls, accessorize with assorted bangles, necklaces and pendants, bright earrings, and casual but cute clothes but do not wear bangles on both arms, or rings on every finger. Don't wear every single piece of jewelry you own. For boys, hats, belts, arm bands, rings and earrings are cool accessories, as preferred.

, Wear things that reflect who you are, not the girl or boy in class that you think dresses fabulously. Do not try to be something you're not. Rock your personality with a style you're comfortable with. Just be yourself.

, For example, if you're a quiet, unassuming person, try a cute plaid skirt with a button-up. If you're a talkative type, try a colorful neon rainbow, or if you're a punk rocker, try some pink and black skirts and hoodies. Take one day of the week, and wear something nicer or something you didn't give justice before.

Wear clothes with patterns that go down your body (especially your legs) and not across.,
Choose your colors and patterns wisely.",How to Dress Specifically for Your Shape in Middle School," One way to define a woman's body type is to analyze how her curves connect her bust, waist, and hips. There are four general body types:


Apple - top-heavy; 14% of women; bust three or more inches bigger than hips; if you have this body type, emphasize your tight legs and butt, draw attention away from your waist and shoulders/arms (wear long sleeves or loose, long tops), and draw attention to your bust and neck (e.g. v-necks).
Straight/rectangular - 46% of women; waist is about the same as hips and waist, more like a cylinder; if you have this body type, you can ""pinch"" your waist and exaggerate curves to avoid looking lanky or boyish. Go for ruffles and frills to add texture and volume (and femininity) to your figure. Steer clear of baggy jeans and track clothes if you don't want to look boyish.
Pear - bottom-heavy; 20% of women; hips significantly larger than bust; if this is your body type, there are things you can do to make your hips and butt look slimmer, but some women might want to make their butts bigger!
Hourglass - 8% of women; equal hip and bust measurements with a narrow waist; if you're one of the lucky few with this body type, dress to flatter - not flatten - your beautiful curves.;
, If you have a straight shape, this is a must because it'll create the illusion of curves. If you have a pear or hourglass shape, this will accentuate your existing curves.


Dresses or tops that wrap around your waist and cross over your chest are only a good idea if you have an ample bust; otherwise it can make your bust look disproportionately tiny (if you're pear-shaped) or your chest and shoulders look flat and square (if you're straight-shaped) .

Flared pants can make your legs look very thick, perhaps bowl-legged, in comparison to your upper body.Wear clothes with patterns that go down your body (especially your legs) and not across.4Shape your bust.
If you have an ""apple"" or ""hourglass"" shape, you probably have an ample bust; your main concern should be to wear a supportive bra so that your chest looks perky, not droopy. Book yourself a professional bra fitting; it's life-changing and will make your chest look fantastic! Stock up on V-neck dresses and tops - they're super flattering on big-busted girls.

If you don't want to draw attention to your chest, stay away from necklaces and wear chunky bangles instead. You should also wear plain colors around your bust and go for patterned and colorful bottoms instead.
If you have a straight or pear shape, wearing a push-up bra to add curves up top might not be a bad idea. If you have a flat stomach and aren't shy about showing it, cropped tops will make your chest look a little bigger in relation to your waist.
Choose your colors and patterns wisely. If there are any curves, handles, or lumps that you'd prefer to hide, wear solid dark colors (black, navy, dark purple) over them. Wear bright colors or patterns on your hot spots to draw attention away from your trouble spots!Ads by Google

Just wear a little eyeliner, some mascara, lipgloss and concealer (but only if you need it) to highlight your best features and make you feel more confident. For special occasions, like a school dance, wear a little bit of eyeshadow a touch of blusher and maybe a brighter lipstick. It makes you look special and not too over the top.

Get close to one or two of the guys in your desired group. Becoming friends with guys is so much easier then you think. But just remember that guys aren't everything.

If you feel good in the clothes, you probably look good too! Everyone has his or her favorites and you should stick to yours. That being said, try to avoid looking sloppy. Holes can be trendy if they’re in fashionable areas like your knees or thighs, but don’t wear clothes with tons of stains on them. That isn’t attractive.


Remember to try to match. Some fashion experts say that you shouldn’t wear an outfit with more than three colors. A lot of schools have uniforms, but you can find your own style within this uniform. For example, maybe you can wear corduroys and a flannel shirt if you're a boy to satisfy the uniform and still wear a particular style.

, If you prefer not to wear clothes that you feel comfortable in or you want to find a new style, try to find the latest fashion trend that you think would suit you. Maybe that’s wearing a certain style of shirt, maybe it’s stylish summer dresses or sleek skintight pants. Use the internet to look up the latest fashion trends and find one that works for you. You also can find someone who you think dresses really well at school and emulate what they do. If other people think that person is hot, you could do worse than following their lead.

, There are many perfumes to try, choose one that you feel defines you. Don’t put too much of it on – if you can smell it on yourself while you’re walking around then that is probably a bad sign. Just put enough on so that you have your signature scent.

, Wear tasteful earrings, necklaces, or rings if jewelry suits you. However, if you don't want to deal with having jewelry on you all day at school and in class, try getting a cute bag.

Cleanse morning and night, as greasy complexions and spots are not very cute. If you have a spot or two, no worries – just apply concealer.

Instead, choose a location that gets a lot of foot traffic, so more people will know you're in business. Local parks and beaches are good options, especially on a nice day.


You can also ask your church or a local grocery store if they’ll give you permission to set up your stand by their entrance. Make sure you ask permission before setting up your stand on private property.
Make a schedule of local events. If there are street festivals or sporting events, set up your stand nearby.Think of where people will be warmest and thirstiest.

, Nothing draws people in like a big smile and a sunny personality. Talk to people walking by and ask them to buy lemonade from you. You’ll be surprised by how many new customers you can bring in just by being friendly!


Encourage customers to return by telling them when you’ll be back: “I’ll be here again tomorrow at noon! Come visit!”

, If a sunny personality can bring people in, a messy stand can drive them away. Make sure you pour your lemonade without spilling and getting everything sticky. Keep your napkins in neat piles, and gather your straws together in a cup so they don't roll all over the place. Your cups should be in one or two neat stacks. Make sure you don't stack them high enough to topple over, though!

, While a lemonade stand is a classic draw, your customers might be more eager to visit you if you can offer more than just one thing. On a hot day, some people might prefer an ice cold bottle of water, so have a cooler full of those to sell. You might also sell snacks, so your customers have something to wash down with their lemonade!


You might make your own snacks to increase your profits. Cookies, brownies, or lemon bars are all great homemade options to go with your lemonade.
Some people might prefer salty snacks rather than sweet ones. Individual baggies of pretzels, potato chips, or peanuts could cut through the sweetness of the lemonade.
Keep fresh fruit on hand for healthier alternatives. Apples, oranges, or sliced watermelon would all be delicious with cold lemonade on a hot day.

, Make sure you're charging a fair price for everything you sell. If you're in a hot-spot where there are a bunch of thirsty people, charge about .75 or a dollar per glass of lemonade.

Make good deals for your customers, such as "" Buy 2 Get 1 Free!"" You may be losing money for the price of one lemonade, but you will attract more parents with children!
Keep a tip box or jar on hand to earn extra money, as well.

, Even though you're trying to make some money with your stand, you need to have some yourself to break any large bills you might get. You don't have to accept any bills larger than $20, but have some $10s, $5s, $1s, and quarters available. It would be terrible to lose a sale because you couldn't give a customer change for a $20!


Keep an envelope at hand to hold your change and the money your customers give you. Make sure you don’t lose it!

, Running a lemonade stand can be a good lesson in business and finances. Keep track of how much money you're making by recording each of your sales.


Divide a lined sheet of paper into 5 columns, and name them ""Day,"" ""# of Cups Sold,"" ""Price per Cup"" ""Tips,"" and ""Total.""
For every sale you make, fill out that information.
At the end of the week, add up all the numbers in the ""Total"" column to find out how much money you earned.

, You might have made some money selling lemonade, but don't forget that you had to invest money to start your stand, too! You need to figure out if you made back the money you spent in the beginning. Hopefully, you made some profit!


Write down the cost of each item you had to buy for this business. This includes the lemonade ingredients, your cups/straws/napkins, advertisements and decorations, and so on.
Add up how much money you invested in the business.
Subtract how much money you invested from the amount of money you earned through sales. If that amount is negative, you lost some money this week. If the amount is positive, that's how much profit you made!

, When it is time to close up, pick up all your trash––as in empty cups, used napkins, or lemon shavings. When people see you clean up, it will make them see you are neat and tidy, encouraging them to want to come next time., Lemonade made from actual lemons is healthier and tastes brighter than the powdered kind. Many customers will respond to advertisements of ""fresh"" or ""homemade"" lemonade. However, powdered lemonade is cheaper and easier to make. It's also a processed food that's not as healthy as the fresh product. Weigh the pros and cons of each type and decide which one you want to choose.

, If you choose the powdered option, you have it easy! Making powdered lemonade is a quick and simple process.


Buy lemonade powder from the grocery store.
Follow the instructions on the packaging to mix it with water. Mix it thoroughly until all the powder has dissolved.
Taste the lemonade to see if it's too strong (add more water) or too weak (add more powder).
When you're happy with your lemonade, you're ready to sell it!

, If you choose fresh lemonade, you have to do a little more work, but you’ll have a delicious, healthier product. Start by gathering all your ingredients. The following will make about a gallon of lemonade:


8 lemons
2 cups of sugar
1 cup of hot water
1 gallon of cold water

, Adding sugar to hot water makes the sugar dissolve more, so you won't have grains of sugar floating around in your lemonade. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.

, When you roll your lemons before squeezing them, they tend to release more juice. Put each lemon down on a table, then press the heel of your palm into it. Roll it back and forth against the surface until you feel it starting to lose its firmness.


When you're finished rolling, cut each lemon in half.

, Each whole lemon should give you about 1/4 cup of juice. You should end up with 2 cups of juice. If you have less than that, squeeze more lemons until you have 2 cups.


Squeeze each lemon half over a bowl, letting the juice drip down into the container. Cradle one hand under the lemon to catch any seeds or pulp that you don't want to end up in your lemonade.
You can poke the inside of the lemon with a fork to make it give up more juice.

, Pour your hot water and sugar mixture, your lemon juice, and your gallon of cold water into a pitcher that's big enough to hold all that liquid. Stir it all together until it's mixed well. Refrigerate it to cool it down. You're ready to serve your fresh lemonade!

, If you add your ice directly to the pitcher of lemonade, the ice will melt over the course of the day. You'll end up with watered down lemonade.


Instead, refrigerate your lemonade before selling it. Just have a bag or cooler of ice by your lemonade stand so customers can add fresh ice to their drinks when they buy them.

, Once you have your lemonade base, you can make little adjustments to give your customers an option of different lemonade flavors.

Make strawberry lemonade: chop 2 cups of strawberries and toss them with 1/2 cup of sugar. Let it sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes, then drain the ""syrup"" away from the berries. Add 1 tablespoon of syrup for each glass of lemonade.You can repeat those steps with any berry to make raspberry, blueberry, or whatever kind of lemonade you want!
Put sliced watermelon in a blender, and mix the resulting water into your lemonade for watermelon lemonade.Be creative! Experiment with as many flavors as you can think of over the summer!

, Make sure to maintain a safe distance, though. Leave enough room for a couple of adults and a stroller to fit comfortably between your stand and the road. Having a friend or family member to help you is good, as one of you could get more lemons or ice while the other one manages the stand.

, Dress up your stand with bright colors, balloons and posters. A beach umbrella will keep the sun off of you and provide a vibrant visual cue for potential customers. Also, set up a sign down the road closer to a busy street to tell people that there is lemonade.

, Spark interest by continually changing your offerings. Serve Kool-Aid, teas, mineral water, healthful smoothies, and other drinks, but keep it simple. Offer lemonade and only one other drink each day. Other options include limeade, orangeade and ice pops.

,, This is optional. Either set them as free or half of the original price.

, Create signs to hold and wave and put a sign on your stand. A banner is always an option, but keep the look clean and uncluttered. It is best to have many looks and change the looks from one day to the next.

, Have a little cup full of quarters so you can give back change when needed. Everything should be priced in multiples of a quarter.

Shower every night or morning.,
Wash your face and neck with a facial cleanser.,
After showering, use a good body lotion that fits your skin type.,
To look fresh and clean, it's important to groom yourself in that manner.,
Makeup should never be caked on.,
Clothing should be clean cut and never dirty.,
Use a body mist in a clean scent.,Have a good clean attitude about life; always be happy and bubbly!",How to Look Clean and Fresh for School," Use a fresh clean scented body wash and not anything too musky or overpowering. Make sure to wash your hair thoroughly and use a lightweight shampoo that best suits your hair type. Condition 3-4 times a week so your hair does not get oily. Afterwards, brush your hair with a wide tooth comb so you don't split your hair. Avoid using a lot of products in your hair. It can make your hair look greasy and even oily.;
, Make sure it's right for your skin type and that you're not allergic to anything in it.

, Avoid anything scented because it usually irritates the skin. Use a facial moisturizer for your face. I stress this so much because body lotion is so much greasier than facial lotion. Facial lotion could prevent breakouts and oily skin better than body lotion.

, Brush your teeth twice every day with a minty fresh toothpaste. Painting your nails is another way to express yourself! Think outside the box when you choose your color! Hair should either be tied up and hanging with bangs,or you can leave it open with layers. For a preppy clean look use a bow to tie your hair. It also gives any outfit a clean finish.

, Bare Minerals or any other mineral cover up is perfect for a fresh faced look, but don't cover your whole face, only the parts where you have any blemishes or dark circles. A little brown eyeliner and light mascara is enough makeup. If you must use a little blush on the cheeks, it is up to you.

, Colors are usually pastel and light. Jeans and a pretty top with cute ballet flats are perfect for a clean look.

, Only use a little perfume,otherwise it's overpowering for school.

Space down and write 3-4 sentences about your funding needs/profit.",How to Make a Business Plan (for Kids)," A business plan outlines how your business will make money and what products or services you will offer. Writing a business plan can help you plan out your business so that you aren't just blindly working. It can also help you determine the costs of setting up and running your business so that they don't come up unexpectedly. A business will also show others (and yourself) that you are really serious about starting a business., Think about what special skills you have and also consider businesses that your neighborhood or town might need. You’ll also need to think about how much free time you have to devote to your business.


Are you currently busy with school or is it summertime? Think about when the work for your business will be done.Consider business ideas that are seasonal. For example, if it’s near Christmas, consider ideas that cater to that, like a gift wrapping service or making gift baskets.
Are you in the middle of a very hot summer? This might be a perfect time to launch a neighborhood lemonade stand.

, As you make your list, think about what each of these ideas offers – a product or a service. Are you creating something that you will sell? Or are you performing a specific action that you want to charge money for?Examples of product-driven businesses: baking cookies, building birdhouses, making gift baskets, creating greeting cards, selling candy, making doggie treats.Examples of service-driven businesses: lawn care, car washing, computer repair, pet sitting, babysitting, cleaning houses, dog walking, and teaching computer skills to older people., Are you great with technology and love working with computers? Starting a computer repair service or a device set-up service would be great for you.


Are you an animal lover? Consider offering pet sitting services.
Maybe you’re crafty and enjoy making handmade jewelry or gift baskets. These are great products to sell., Once you’ve got your idea, you’ll need to come up with a name for your business. A good business name should describe what your business offers and be easy for people to remember.


Make sure your business name is easy to pronounce, as well.
Clever and unique business names work well, just remember that the name needs to relate to what your business entails.

, You also need to be able to explain it easily to others, so get your business idea down in words. Describe what you will be offering and why your business is a good idea.List any specific objectives and goals for your business, as well.
Write out what you think makes your product/service unique., If you do need additional help to run your business, you will want to keep that expense as low as possible.


If you have a sibling that wants to help out, that would be a good place to start.
You will be splitting your profits, so you will need to decide how much and when your employees will be paid.

, Write down how much each supply item on your list costs and total those numbers up. This is your projected start-up cost.If the start-up cost is beyond your current means, talk to your parents or other family members about investing in your business.


You could also ask your parents if they’d consider donating some of your future allowance as seed money for your business.
If you bring them a solid business plan, they will be more likely to help you.

, For instance, if you are starting a lawn care business, you will need to plan for ongoing expenses like gasoline to fuel your lawn care tools. If you have any employees to pay, that cost also needs to be factored into your ongoing expenses.


By adding up your ongoing expenses, you will have a pretty good idea of what it will cost to keep your business running.Another example – if you’re making cookies to sell, you will need to total up how much the ingredients cost and how often you’ll need to buy them.

, In order to make a profit, you will need to charge more for your product than it costs you to make it. For instance, if you want to sell cookies by the dozen, you’ll need to figure out how much it costs you to make a dozen cookies.


Let’s say that when you add up the cost of the ingredients, it costs you $3.50 to make a dozen chocolate chip cookies. You will want to charge more than that for each dozen in order to make a profit.
You should also factor in how much time it takes you to make your product/perform your service.You can then work out prices based upon how much you want to make. You should also factor in time that you aren't being paid (such as advertising your business or walking to a customer's home).
For example, if it takes you a half hour to make the chocolate chip cookies mentioned above and another half hour to sell them, you will need to charge an amount that represents the amount of time you spent preparing them. This additional time is your ""wage"" for preparing them.
You can work out your hourly wage by dividing your pay for a project or product (minus your expenses) by the amount of time spent working.
In this case, if you charged $9.50 for the dozen cookies, you would be making $6 for the hour that you spent making and selling them.
Subtract your expenses from your revenue to get your profit amount., For instance, if you’re launching a pet sitting business, some of your customer types would be people that travel for work, people that work long hours, and people that go on vacation.You should also consider your market area. Unless you have a car (or your parents' help), market area is relatively small. This may include only areas that you can safely walk or bike to.
These customer types are called customer profiles. Once you have your customer profiles, you will have a better idea of how to market your business to them.
Different customer profiles sometimes require entirely different marketing strategies.

, Is anyone else in your neighborhood or town offering similar products/services to yours?If so, you will be competing with them for the same customers. What are they charging and how does it compare to what you plan to charge? How will your product/service be better than theirs? Why should people choose your business over theirs?You can market most effectively once you know these specific details about your competitors.
Offering lower prices or providing higher quality products/services are two ways you can compete with them.
For example, if you start a lawn care business, you will be competing with established lawn care businesses. You can build a customer base by offering better service and encouraging customer recommendations.

, Will you be advertising by handing out or posting flyers? If so, where? Will you promote your business on social media? Email marketing? Will you market products door-to-door? Will you have your own website?Remember to keep your customer profiles in mind when choosing your marketing strategies.
For instance, if you’re starting a pet sitting business, you could post flyers at veterinary offices and pet stores, and also hand deliver flyers to people in your neighborhood with pets.

, These are handy and professional to have, and these days you can order them online for a very low cost. You can even make your own by buying printable business card paper, which always comes with templates to help you get started with designing.

, This will be the first page. Write the business name at the top of the paper, then write a business description a few spaces down. All you need for this is a short paragraph that describes your business idea, objectives and goals.If you’ve created a business logo, put it on the cover sheet, as well. Aim for 5-6 sentences.


Write the business name in large letters, or use a large font, and make it bold. It’s the most important thing on the page.
The description paragraph can be in a normal size or standard 12 point font.

, Write 1-2 sentences that describe who the business owner is (you) and the management team (your employees, if you have any). Then write 2-3 sentences about your company’s history. Since your company is brand new, your history will cover how you came up with your business idea and why it’s important.Owner/Management example: “Kelly’s Doggy Daycare is owned by Kelly Klein. She has several years of experience pet-sitting and truly loves working with and caring for dogs of all kinds.”
Business History example: ""Kelly noticed that most of her neighbors were dog owners who worked long hours every day. Occasionally, they took vacations and/or experienced family emergencies, which could take them away from their pets for days at a time.""
""With her love for dogs, Kelly knew she could provide a pet care service that her neighbors would benefit from, and that’s how Kelly’s Doggy Daycare was born.""

, The plan will cover four topics: your product/service, your business objectives, market/competitor information and funding requirements/profit. Try to write 3-4 sentences for each topic.


You don’t need to get incredibly detailed – summarize and highlight the most important information for each.
Example for product/service: ""Kelly’s Doggy Daycare will provide hands-on pet care for today’s busy pet owner. The business will offer day rates along with in-house extended stay pet sitting. Walking services are included at no charge with every appointment.""

, Discuss the basic goals for your business. Example: ""Kelly’s Doggy Daycare will strive to provide the best and most affordable pet sitting services in the area.""


""It’s her mission to put your mind at ease when you have to be away from your pets. Kelly will make sure your pets are loved and cared for in your absence.""
""An email summary of every pet sitting appointment will always be sent to you via email during your absence or upon your return.""

, Talk about what types of customers you envision. Discuss your competition, if any, and your planned marketing strategies.Example: “Kelly’s Doggy Daycare caters to today’s busy adults. These are businesspeople who work long hours every day and/or travel regularly for work, family vacationers, and anyone who finds themselves in need of last minute pet care.""
""The business has one competitor, Sam’s Sitting Service, but Kelly offers lower pricing and in-house extended stay care.""
""She plans to post flyers about the new business in her neighborhood to promote it. She will also be going door-to-door to introduce herself and inform neighbors of her services.”

, List the supplies you will need to start, any expenses you expect, and what you plan to charge for your product/service.Example: ""Kelly will need very few supplies to launch the business – a bag of doggie treats, 1 dog leash for a small dog and 1 dog leash for a large dog.""
""Ongoing expenses will be the replenishment of doggie treats and occasionally dog toys and/or dog blankets. The rate is $5.00 for each hour of pet care provided. The rate for in-house extended care is $25 per day.""
""Customers will need to provide their own pet food or reimburse Kelly for any food she has to purchase during pet care. Profit for each hour is approximately $3.50 after expenses.""
""Profit for each day of extended care is approximately $18.50 after expenses.""

Sell your dollar store items at a flea market or garage sale.",How to Resell Dollar Store Goods," Seasonal goods such as Halloween masks or Christmas wreaths can be purchased at a very low cost from the dollar store, especially if you purchase them shortly after the holiday has passed. Buy seasonal items the day after a holiday, store them in your basement and then resell them at the beginning of the holiday season next year., You can find electronics for very cheap prices at the dollar store, including items like headphones, DVDs, and home entertainment products. If you see a good deal on one of these electronic items, buy it and resell it online or at a flea market.


Buy headphones to resell. Headphones in the under $50 category can be found at dollar stores. Read headphone reviews, learn about current models, and see if you can find any good deals on headphones in the under $50 price category.If you find any, you should be able to make a good profit by reselling them online.
Find DVDs to resell. People love old movies and you can find many old DVDs at dollar stores for a bargain. Find titles that have a cult following or are nostalgic favorites for particular generations, and then resell them online., Dollar stores have great deals on books.If you collect all of the books in a series or work to collect all of the books from a particular author, you can then resell the collections online. Fans of the series or author will pay significantly more for a complete collection., Cosmetics, shampoos, and other personal products that have been discontinued can still be found at dollar stores. If there is a niche market for a discontinued cosmetic or shampoo with a nice scent, you can purchase the discontinued products and resell them to this niche market online.Test out the market for discontinued items before buying too many of them. Try reselling a couple of the items online to gauge demand. Check to see how many people view your item on an auction site and how fast it sells. If it sells quickly, buy some more from the dollar store and repeat.

, Party supplies are pretty cheap but if you collect all of the relevant supplies for a particular party theme, you can resell the set. You may have to visit multiple dollar stores in order to find the items for the party theme.For example, if you collect all of the party supplies for a zombie birthday party, you can then resell it as a complete set online or at a flea market.

, Start by searching on auction sites, such as eBay, to see what the product or similar products in your category are selling for. For example, try to find the price range for your particular brand of electronic headphones as well as the larger price range for headphones in general. If you can find the price for your particular brand of headphones, take note of both the highest and the lowest price listed for the item. With this knowledge of the price range, you can start thinking about how much you will ask for your item.


If your item is in better condition or has something different from the others on the list, you may be able to price it in the higher price range.
If the item is pretty much the same as the other items listed, you may want to set it at an average price.

, Looking through the online listings for your item on the auction site, such as eBay, you should see how much people have actually paid for the item. Taking this price into consideration, think about how much you could sell your particular item for.


If you are using eBay, scroll down to the ‘show only’ options on the left side of the page, towards the bottom of the listings page. Click on ‘sold listings’ and then review the items in your category (e.g., headphones) that have sold. Reviewing the prices of sold items, determine what you think you could sell your dollar store item for online.
If you cannot find your item on eBay or other auction sites, try searching for similar items. For example, if you found a particular brand of faux wood headphones at your local dollar store but cannot find the same brand on eBay, see if there is a similar pair of faux wood headphones.

, Taking into consideration the current price range for your product category (e.g., headphones) and the prices that your particular item has sold for, set a price for your item.


Price your items competitively. Taking into consideration both how much you paid for the item at the dollar store and the current price range for the item on eBay, try to set a competitive price that will get the item sold quickly and efficiently.If you are using eBay, you can set a reserve price which is the lowest that you would be willing to sell your item for online.On eBay, you can use a fixed price which means that there will not be any bidding on your item. It will be sold, or not, at the fixed price you set., You can resell dollar store items on online auction sites such as eBay, eBid, Bonanza, Webstore.com, or OnlineAuction.com. If you choose this approach, you will need to choose the best auction site for your selling goals. You should look at which sites have the lowest selling fees, listing options, and selling features.


Auction sites sometimes have a seller verification fee but this feature can also be found for free on some sites. In addition, fees may be charged for the final value of the item sold, as well as, for listing the items and relisting them if they do not sell.
eBay allows you to list your first 50 items free but then charges a fee. Sites like eBid and Bonanza allow you to list your items for free.

, A big part of e-commerce, including selling dollar store items, is the quality of the images you use to sell items. You will want to use the best camera you own and shoot the product against a white backdrop. If you have a whiteboard, you should use it. However, you can also shoot the product against a white wall or a white desk. Pay attention to the light in the room and try to avoid making shadows over the product you are selling.Take five photographs of each item. Be sure to take photographs of unique features, labels, tags, and details. If there is an oddity or discoloration, you should also take a photo of it so that consumers know what they are getting. Your consumers will appreciate your thoroughness and objectivity., You will need to decide upon a title, price, description, illustration (e.g., photo), as well as payment and shipping information. Try to use a simple title that adequately lets people know what you are selling. The price should be competitive with similar items listed on the auction site you are using. The description and illustration should allow consumers to get a good sense of what you are selling online. Use the following principles:Measure your items and offer exact measurements for online buyers.
Show clarity and objectivity. If an item is damaged, you need to tell your consumers exactly how it is damaged. If the packaging is torn, you need tell the consumer.

, With your price, photograph, and full listing information, you can now list your dollar store items on the auction site of your choice. To be successful in this venture, you will need to be well organized, take good photographs, and offer good descriptions.Organize small items into larger lots. For example, if you have a bunch of balloons and some zombie masks from the dollar store, put them together with some other items to make a zombie party theme kit. Individually, the dollar store items may not sell. When grouped together as a set, they should attract good bids.You can try selling your items on eBay.


, If one of your dollar store items sells, you should try to ship it to the customer as soon as possible. This will help develop trust between you and your customers, which will allow you to sell more dollar store items online. Use the shipping method that you listed on the auction site and ship the item out as soon as possible.


Pack the items well so that there is less chance of damage during shipping.

, If you have some items that you were unable to sell online, you can always set up a booth at a garage sale. Alternately, if you end up with some dollar store items that did not sell online, you can always organize a spring cleaning garage sale. Try to sell your items at a competitive price that still allows you to make a decent profit.

, Who would pay me for the help? And, how much would they pay?” Answer as specifically as possible; for example, instead of saying “people who want their kids to have better grades,” say “families who make over $100,000 a year, and want their kids to get all A’s, would eagerly pay me $50 an hour to help their kids learn my favorite subject.” Check out CraigsList to see roughly who’s paying for what kind of help.

Brainstorm, and gather money and make plans to form your unique, niche business: Find one that you can concentrate on based upon the needs and preferences of a special niche group -- your own specialized business.,
Save some capital and begin to invest.,
Decide who is your target group for your product/service for whom you can fulfill a need.,
Build a sufficient amount of the preferred and most needed stock.,
Advertise as much as you can.,
Make sure miscellaneous things, such as pricing, selling location, etc.,
Create a name, slogan, and any other necessary things of the like.,
Find something worthwhile to do while waiting for customers to come in.,
Keep complete records, such as making receipts, as the purpose is to make sure you don't get confused by thinking you made $5000 when you only made $150 (after expenses).",How to Begin a Business in a Special Niche," That is the opposite of a department store or general store. You are in need of a captive audience, for example: for people who love a certain kind of product. The idea and money are just one important step in your quest.;
, A good starting point of saving weekly or monthly for gathering materials (for some necessary things) could be $50/£50/€50. Begin your business savings account right now. You don't need your best idea or a fortune to begin thinking, planning and saving.

, A few examples could be: 12 & Under tutoring, small electronic cases for all ages, or gifts for teens (or for Valentine's Day for a seasonal business).

, If you have a service with no need to make a product, then skip this. The sole purpose of this step is to make sure when you do get customers, you aren't filling out orders for ""backorders"" in the wee hours of the morning.

, Do it in places such as: at school (if applicable to you, and your school has no anti-selling code), pin up ads in places like sandwich shops, grocery stores, laundries, etc. This way you may have a stable flow of customers.

, are set up. Don't guess. Find out what you need.

, Be as artistic, and creative as you can, as this will attract more people.

, Make sure to be patient as the customers may be slow to come in. With many businesses it is ""feast or famine"": you have no customers for an hour(s) -- but then suddenly for a few minutes or hours you are crowded, then they're all gone, again. That can be frustrating and confusing.

, Make sure to keep track of what gets spent, too: including for what, why and to whom. Legitimate costs are used to figure your profit or loss on the business for income taxes and for showing where money went/came from.


One good accounting trick is to keep a separate checking account with entries for every purchase or expense that you make and all income should be deposited in your business account. Be sure to get an account with the large size business checks with detailed stubs for itemizing your bank transactions, and be sure that the account will return all cancelled checks and all of your itemized deposit slips.

If you pay cash for items -- then do this as recommended by a professional record expert, a CPA, Certified Public Accountant: You can and should write a business check ""to yourself"" and write a comment on it for what that cash was used, when, where (on the check).
Then endorse and deposit that check in your business account. That creates a very clear and effective double entry record, but it will not add or subtract money because it is both ""a debit and a credit"" (plus and minus, zero effect). Yet, that creates a paper trail for any cash to show when and how you spent money.

Keep track of your sales and experiment a bit.",How to Compete with Other Lemonade Stands," All businesses use market research before beginning a new business or providing a new product. You will need to do this to find out whether your idea of a lemonade stand will be worthwhile and to determine your competition. After all, you are planning to open the best lemonade stand.Take a survey. Ask friends and family what they think of the idea first. Then expand your survey to include how much they would spend on lemonade, what kind of lemonade they like and the best place to set up a stand.
Get information on the cost of a lemonade stand. You will need to determine if you will purchase a pre-made stand or build one yourself. It can be as easy as a used table with a tablecloth or something fancier. Research what others are doing and use the internet to find ways to build one. You want your stand to ""stand out"" from the others.
Check out your competition. Walk or ride your bike around to see if there are other lemonade stands. Observe to see what they're selling and how you can improve on what they are doing.;
, As they say, location, location, location. You will need to do some observation to find out the best place to set your stand up. If you choose the correct location, your business will be very successful. People don’t look up lemonade stands in the phone book, so you have to make sure they can see you.


Determine foot traffic. Watch to see if there are people that walk where you are planning on setting up your stand. Many of your customers will be other kids, so you will want to find a spot that kids play near so they will spot you easily.
Decide if you will stay in your yard or near your apartment. If you're lucky, you have an area right near your home. A yard serves well, or an apartment area.
Check to see if it's okay to set up your stand near a playground area if there is one near you. Kids love a cold glass of lemonade when they're playing.
Other options. If your home doesn't give you enough customers, consider a spot near a store or at your parents' place of business. Of course you'll have to check with your parents to get help. You'll have to get permission from the business before you set up shop.

, The price you set for a cup of lemonade should depend on three things: the cost of your supplies, the amount people are willing to pay, and the prices offered by competing lemonade stands. You may need a little help with this step. Determine the best recipe. You want the best lemonade in the area. Find several good recipes and try them out with your friends and family. Think outside the box. Maybe you want to try flavored lemonade using strawberries or blueberries. Be creative. If you’re trying to compete with other stands, it’s going to be important to offer something that sets your lemonade stand apart from the others. There are many recipes online. Make a list. A detailed list of all the ingredients and supplies you will need is important. You may need an adult to help you do your pricing. Look for sales and coupons in your local newspaper, and consider buying larger quantities of supplies to get the best deal. Remember, you want a good product for a good price in order to compete with others.
Determine what other lemonade stands are charging. You can find out what people are willing to pay by experimenting with the price you charge for a cup of lemonade, but the easiest way to set your price is to see what other stands are charging, and then charge about the same or a little less (maybe even a little more if you offer something better than they do). If you can offer the same quality at a lower price, you’ll get more customers. More customers means more profit.

, So you’ve got the best lemonade in town, but what if other stands have lemonade that’s just as tasty? Set your stand apart from the crowd by providing something a little different.


Develop a special talent. Do you have a special talent, like juggling or telling jokes? Use your talents to make a name for yourself, and customers will buy from you just to see ""the kid who juggles the lemons"" or ""the girl who tells a joke with each cup of lemonade.""
Think about your community. You might also donate a portion of your profits to charity. Not only is this a nice thing to do, but customers may also be impressed with your generosity and social responsibility., Competition means advertising. You want to get customers to come to your stand, so you need to find creative ways to let people know where you are. Your best advertising will be your location and word-of-mouth from satisfied customers.


Write up signs to stick to trees or posts in your neighborhood, especially if your stand is just off a main road. Make sure the signs are colorful and easy to read.
Ask a friend to stick a couple brightly colored signs on himself or herself and have him or her ride a bicycle around the neighborhood, advertising your lemonade stand.
Place a large colorful sign on your stand. You want to attract the most customers, so you want to be seen. Include what you're selling and the prices.

, Your stand will probably rely almost entirely on people who stop in while driving or walking by, so you want your stand to look as clean and attractive as possible or they won’t stop. Most importantly, keep your stand and the area around it neat and sparkling clean.


Have everything ready. Before you open for business, check to see if you have everything you’ll need. If you aren’t very close to a source for ice, use a cooler to have ice easily accessible.
Provide a trash can for cups and napkins. You may consider purchasing cups that are recyclable, and then provide a recycling bin. Customers will be impressed with your ""green"" thinking.
Make your lemonade stand bright and colorful. Color attracts attention! It’s easy to decorate paper cups to give your customers that little “extra” fun when they buy from you. Add some color to your stand with helium balloons or other decorations. Be creative., To be competitive, you'll need to provide the best customer service of all the lemonade stands.


Be accommodating. If a customer doesn’t like the lemonade for some reason, listen to them to find out why, apologize, fix the problem, and offer them a free cup or refund. Unsatisfied customers may become your best customers if you impress them with your desire to ""make things right.""
Be prepared. Your customers don’t want to have to wait for their refreshing beverage, so always have enough lemonade and other supplies ready. Make sure you can quickly and accurately make change for customers.

, When they come to your stand, chat with them while they’re there (if they want to chat), and thank them for their business. Make it a point to remember repeat customers’ names, and greet them by name or title (Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.).


Think about offering a special price to returning customers.
Offer a free cup of lemonade to very young children if the parent is purchasing.
Be sure to thank them for their business. Again, this will help your business grow.

, No matter how badly your day may be going, you always want to look like you love selling lemonade and that the lemonade business is booming. Customers don’t want to hear about your problems, they want the best lemonade.


Keep a neat, clean appearance. Make sure you have clean hands at all times. You may want to keep a bottle of hand sanitizer near by.
Serve with a smile. If business is good, and you have a line of customers, apologize for the wait and show that you’re working hard to serve people.

, If you make great lemonade, people will come back for it and choose your stand over others. To make your own lemonade, you can ask your parents how, or you can find tons of recipes on the Internet.Listen to your customers’ comments or complaints once you start selling. Adjust your recipe if needed. You are trying to provide the most refreshing lemonade to your customers.
Make sure you give people enough ice to keep the lemonade cold, and don’t serve lemonade that’s been sitting out for too long. It's best to serve it fresh and cold.

, You can learn a lot from running a lemonade stand, and the more you learn the more money your stand will make.


If you’re not selling much lemonade, figure out why. Some factors, such as the weather, you can’t change, but others, such as price and type of lemonade, you can.
Use some trial-and-error to make your stand the best it can be, and learn from your mistakes—when life gives you lemons make lemonade.
The best lemonade stand will have customers coming back for more.

",How to Decorate a Funky Female Teen's Room," Choose what color you want your room to be. It's best to match the colors of the walls to the colors on your bedspread/comforter, as you can't match the comforter to the walls. This is important, because the stuff in your room with have to more or less coordinate with your walls. You can either paint your whole room one color, or paint different walls different colors. Bold colors like fuchsia, lime green, orange, and bright blue are funky and will spice up your room.;

If you can find them, there are chairs shaped as shoes and other cool things that will definitely make your room remembered.

Take time to declutter and get rid of knickknacks.,
Add green plants.",How to Create a Ninja Bedroom1," Natural light, earthy tones, and natural materials like wood are all applicable to zen principles. This creates a cohesive look to your room and sets the tone for the rest of your decorating to be influenced by Japanese, martial arts, and ninja décor. , Simplicity is key in the art of zen. Not to mention, ninjas don’t have personal affects. Find places to stash your mementos out of sight so your enemies won’t think you are too soft.

, Zen décor often includes green plants, which have a calming effect and purify your air. Bonzai trees or hanging terrariums are especially popular. Choose plants that are low maintenance, so if you are gone on a mission for several days your plants can survive. "

Start collecting cute, Parisian trinkets.",How to Create a Paris Chic Teen Bedroom," When it comes to creating a Parisian-style room, it’s all about contrasting lighter colors against black. Therefore, opt for a lighter wall color that will contrast with black furniture and accent pieces. A light color, such as pink or blue, is a great choice.You can create the same contrast by doing black walls with colorful bedding and accent pieces, but proceed with caution. Black walls can make a room look dark, small, and dreary, so it needs to be done very well!;
, This is useful if you aren’t able to paint your walls, such as in a college dorm or a rented apartment. Do a Google search to easily find removable wall art. Amazon is a great resource. Choose something like the iconic Eiffel Tower, a scene from a French café, French script, or all of the above. There are hundreds of options, and luckily they aren’t very expensive!


Hanging posters can add a bit of fun to plain walls as well.

, You can be creative with these. A faux fur rug can add a dash of glamor to your room, while a patterned rug can add an element of high fashion fun. A solid colored rug will let your Paris-themed accent pieces stand out, but a floral rug can add a soft, romantic touch to your bedroom. Be creative and choose a rug that fits the specific Parisian vibe you are going for!


These rugs will also help make your room much more cozy, especially if you have hard floors.

, This will be the centerpiece of your bedroom, so it’s important to find one you really love. Upholstered headboards look girly and romantic, while wrought iron beds look delicate and chic. If you’re unable to buy a new bed, don’t worry— the perfect bedding can turn any bed into a cozy little piece of Paris.


If your walls are painted a sweet pastel color, top your bed with a black and white patterned, or a plain white, comforter. This will create a beautiful contrast.
If your walls are a stark white or black, choose a colored comforter. Just make sure that, somehow, your bedding and your walls create a nice contrast between solid neutrals and color.

, You can certainly be creative with this. If you have a plain wooden night stand, paint it the same color as your walls for a pop of color that ties the room together. A delicate, wrought-iron side table can mimic the look of a Parisian café table, and would look ultra-sophisticated in your Parisian room.


If you don’t want to purchase a new Paris-inspired side table and aren’t able to repaint the one you have, consider draping a beautiful fabric over the side table, like a tablecloth. Voila— a perfect Parisian night table.

, Vanities are glamorous and sophisticated, and tie in perfectly with a Parisian themed room. You can find these online at stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, but don’t be afraid to scout Goodwill, garage sales, and vintage stores as well. With a coat of paint and a little TLC, you can bring a cheap, rickety vanity back to life.


Set your makeup and perfume bottles on your vanity. This way the vanity serves a purpose and provides a spot for you to get ready, but looks chic and Parisian at the same time!

, Real flowers can make your bedroom smell delicious, but fake flowers look great and last forever. Roses are all over Paris in the springtime, and they will make your bedroom look stylish and elegant. Peonies, daffodils, irises, and tulips are also Parisian flowers, and would look great in a Paris-themed bedroom., Don’t underestimate how much the perfect curtains can transform a room. Choose something soft and romantic, like a sheer fabric or one with ruffles or lace. These add a touch of elegance to your Parisian room, while also blocking the light so you can get your beauty sleep.

, You can find Paris-themed accent pillows at various home décor stores, like Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Pottery Barn, WalMart, and Target. These are cheap accent pieces that can really bring together your Parisian theme. Opt for a mix of colored pillows and black and white pillows of different shapes and sizes. Romantic pillows like lips and hearts look great, especially mixed with pillows of French phases and images. Throw in a couple of black and white striped or polka-dotted pillows, and your bed will be looking very Parisian., This is the cherry on top of a Parisian bedroom. Not only do chandeliers add soft light to your bedroom, but they are a classic and stylish fixture. You can find miniature chandeliers meant specifically for bedrooms on various home décor websites. Just make sure that the bottom of the chandelier is no lower than seven feet, so adults avoid bumping their heads!, A fashion bust to hang your jewelry on will make your room look very high-fashion and classy. Hanging little twinkling lights along the perimeter of your ceiling will cast a soft, romantic glow over your whole room, a la the “City of Lights.” Hanging a small clock on your wall set to Paris time is a sweet accent that will make your bedroom feel like a little French nook. Get creative! Your room is your oasis, and it should be exactly as you like.

Try to clean your room every week.",How to A List Your Bedroom," Have around 4 pillows on each side of your bed. If it's a double bed, then have a brightly coloured throw at the end for a glam look. You do not have to use those pillows to sleep on as it will probably hurt your neck. If you do want to use a couple of pillows, use thinner ones that won't hurt your neck.;
, Mirrors are great for that a-list feel. Big venetian glass mirrors on the wall are perfect. And you'll feel as though the room is bigger.

, Unlighted, scented candles are brilliant. Never light candles in your bedroom unless you have short one which you will need to throw away straight away. Try to use your candles more for decoration than well, candles!

, If you don't want a light shade then have a fancy light, like a chandelier or something like that.

, Have say, cream duvets and peach pillows rather than yellows and pinks and reds, as you will not open your eyes in the morning and feel like seeing bright colours. Instead go for bright ornaments as this will make them stand out and they still keep your room calm and quiet.

,, It doesn't have to be a real plant-just some fake flowers are great for an a-lister.

, Include a calendar and other important stuff like that, Your friends won't envy you if you have a messy room"

Consider repainting your room!,
Replace wall décor.,
Install blackout curtains.",How to Create a Ninja Bedroom2," Depending on the current color of your bedroom, you may want to repaint it a darker or neutral color. This will set the tone for the whole room. A bright color would be inappropriate for a ninja themed bedroom. The neutral color is also assists is creating a zen-like state for your room.

, Use martial arts, Japanese works, or natural themes as inspiration for your new wall décor.


Paint a mural of Japan or nature so your inner ninja feels more at home.
Use Japanese character appliques or traditional wood works for fun yet tasteful décor.
If you want a more modern look, use posters from famous Japanese movies.

, This will help keep the room nice and dark when you want it to be. That’s crucial for the ninja life. Ninjas need to be able to hide in the cover of darkness. Make sure the curtains are easily retractable, so you can still use your bedroom to study or do other work that requires light!

"
"
Add weapons as décor or for display.,
Buy a new bedspread.,
Create hiding places.",How to Create a Ninja Bedroom3," Make sure you obtain permission from your parents, and double check that you do not purchase anything illegal.


Ninja stars, bows and arrows, a staff, darts, or nunchucks are all appropriate options. Consider using fake weapons as a safer and more cost effective alternative.

, This can be Japanese themed, inspired by nature, or dark in color. All would be appropriate for a ninja bedroom. Avoid bright colors when possible and keep it a natural fabric to remain zen.

, Ninjas are all about stealth, and they need places to hide their secret documents or other items. This is also a good way to store the personal affects and knick-knacks you cleared away.


Use an old book and cut out the center so you can hide small items inside without anyone knowing. Try to make sure it is an uninteresting book that no one will pick up and flip through unknowingly.
Hide items behind the books in your bookcase. This is best done behind particularly tall books that you don't read often.

Clean up.,
Get rid of everything that you don't need.,
Dress up your walls.,
Rearrange your furniture or buy new furniture.,
Change your bed cover.,
Buy new curtains or blinds.,
Get some preppy decorations You don't want a really plain room, so dress it up a little.,
Buy a cute pillow and monogram it with your initials.,
Pay attention to detail.",How to Create a Preppy Bedroom (for Girls)," No prep would have a filthy room, so start cleaning up. Your room may not appear dirty at first glance, but don't make that mistake. Check inside your drawers - are they organized and clean? Is your carpet vacuumed with no stains -make sure to clean in all those nooks and crannies? Are your windows well washed? Start with the basics - vacuuming, cleaning mirrors and windows, dusting, then go on to organizing your wardrobe and drawers.;
, If your room is cluttered with lots of stuff that you haven't touched since you were two, you aren't going to be able to pull off the preppy look. Do a thorough check of your room and ask yourself: do you need all of your clothes? Do you read those books? Check everything, and then check again.


Give away stuff to good causes like Goodwill or Salvation Army rather than throwing them out - your old stuff will be new stuff for other people. Ask your parents to get you some cardboard boxes to make ""Donate"" boxes then ask them to deliver it for you. Just get it out of your room.

, Consider painting your walls or buying some wallpaper. Try to use pastels or a flowery print. You can simply repaint your room the same colour and touch it up if you like it the way it is, but if you're looking for something new, paint your room a nice, light colour. If you're looking for wallpaper, try some light florals or gingham too, or go for stripes. If you can't paint your room consider a nice painting to make a plain wall look classy.


You can have a feature wall - one wall painted a different colour, where you hang up pictures and things that are special to you.

, If you can't buy any new furniture, move your original furniture around to create more space. For example: if your bed is right next to your wardrobe, your room is going to look really cluttered. If you can actually buy new furniture, choose carefully. White is a good colour for a set of drawers or a table or bookshelf, but make sure it is elegant. Another option is dark wood for furniture.

, If you have had the same bed cover since you were five, then it is time for a change. Try not to go for anything too bright or too busy; go for the more classy, elegant look. Colours and patterns do really matter, try to keep it pastel and try to match it with paint or wallpaper. However, if you aren't too sure what to pick, here are some suggestions:


White is always a good color when it's paired up with another, light color. Think white and navy blue, white, sea foam green and Girl baby pink or hot pink, white and lime green, white and soft yellow, etc.
Try to use lighter colors, to make the room seem more airy and open.
Make sure that whatever furniture or accessories you get match the rest of your room. For example if you have a pink and white bedspread, try to buy night/ or table lamps that match the bedspread.
Black and white is also a very classy combination. It looks especially elegant with dark turquoise or pastel yellow.

, This step isn't essential, however, if you can buy some new curtains, make sure you choose something that will match the rest of your room - a heavy clash in colours is not preppy. As always, make sure that it isn't too busy or bright - make it stylish and classy.

, Make sure you stick to the preppy theme, for example: a nice looking lamp to go on your desk, a few cushions, maybe a matching rug.

, Get a Steiff teddy bear and put it on bed. Have a displayed picture of your dog in a silver frame. Display at least one picture of a horse. Display some copies of Teen Vogue. If you take ballet, horse riding or tennis lessons-make sure your room displays those passions. Hang a map of Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket. Framed Posters of England or France are good too.

, Make sure everything matches. Think cute.

I’d like to give you the gift of arranging your room so that you have a comfortable and fun place to sleep and study. Do you have any ideas on how you’d like your room arranged?”;
, Look online and in catalogs to gather ideas. Clip and save the ideas you like the most. When you go back through the ideas you saved, it will help you to decide on must-have pieces, and if you want to use a theme to build your design around.Ask your daughter: “What colors do you like the most? Would you like a theme to your room?”
Some examples of themes you can use are: beach, retro, musical, literary, or floral. Browsing theme ideas is a good way to get started, but a theme isn’t necessary. You may choose to design around one or more focal points, or you may stick to a general style or color palette to incorporate throughout the arrangement., The range of what you could spend will vary substantially based on your situation and preferences. Taking existing items from your home to rearrange your daughter’s room could cost nothing, and DIY makeovers can be very low cost. On the other hand - depending on the brand and type - new bedroom furniture sets alone can cost thousands of dollars. How much you need and how much you are willing to spend will be major factors in estimating your costs.Some examples of things you may consider purchasing: bed frame, headboard, mattress, bedding, pillows, desk, chair, night tables, accent furniture, lighting, flooring, paint, shelving, window treatments, and décor. Also consider storage bins, dressers, and office supply items for organizing school supplies.

, Create a list or spreadsheet of the items you want to purchase. Check online, in local stores and/or catalogs to determine an acceptable cost range to you for each type of item. If you plan to hire a professional remodeler for painting, flooring, or other services, shop around for quotes. Then calculate the total. Add 10 to 15 percent to your total to account for unexpected expenses.The average cost of materials for a bedroom makeover including updated painting, decorating, and lighting is $383-446 for materials. This cost does not include hired labor or furniture.Invest in important room features like furniture that will be used often, or focal points. Be more thrifty with purely cosmetic purchases and figure those in last.

, If you want a complete bedroom revamping with structural changes such as flooring, windows, doors and/or walls, use a remodeling costs calculator online. A cost calculator can consider prices in your specific location and give you a ballpark idea of expenditure.

, Take measurements of the floor space and any furniture you plan to keep in the room. Write down the room dimensions and the width and height of each piece of furniture.



Measure the walls, floor area, height, and perimeter of the room.

, Draw the dimensions in pencil on a piece of graph paper. Mark windows and outlets. Pencil in furniture lightly so you can easily erase and move them as you plan the arrangement.Before purchasing any new furniture, find out its measurements to see if it will work with your existing floorplan.

, You will probably want to look at ceiling or hanging lighting, as well as supplemental lighting like lamps and possibly a lighted mirror.Bring your room measurements when shopping so an expert can advise you on how much lighting you need to fill the space.Avoid lamp shades that are overly opaque, as they will provide dimmer light and less functional value.

, If the room is large, you can place the bed opposite from the door as a focal point. If the room is smaller, place it against the wall so that it does not obstruct the path to other zones. Avoid placing the bed under a drafty window. Other items to consider for the sleeping zone are: pillows and bedding, a headboard, and night stands with lamps.When choosing a pillow, you can test different pillows up against a wall to see how they feel. For bedding, the higher the thread count, the more soft and durable it will be.Avoid silk or velvet headboards, as they can discolor quickly.The ideal depth for night stands is 25” or less., The study zone should have a desk, a comfortable chair, good lighting, and basic school supplies. One or more letter trays are a helpful way to temporarily set paperwork aside for filing later.For small spaces, a corner desk with a chair that can be pushed underneath will work well.

, Organizing a closet will optimize the space you already have for storage. Bins and other closet organizers can make the most of a small space. Add a second clothing rack low in the closet for pants and shirts; this will double the hanging space. Make sure to allocate a place for shoes, and you may want to designate hanging space for belts, scarves and other fashion accessories.Mounting a pegboard inside the closet door creates an extra place to hang fashion accessories., Consider adding a place she can get ready for school: a vanity area with a desk, chair, lighting and mirror. Or, the desk and study area can double as a makeup vanity.Come up with other zones as space allows, geared towards your daughter’s specific tastes.For example, she may like a reading zone with a comfortable recliner, or she may prefer a bean bag chair and plush rug for sitting and talking on the phone. If she plays an instrument, create a zone for that.

, A desk should be full of drawers for storageand can be supplemented with a hutch on top for storing extra supplies.You can purchase an ottoman that doubles as a covered storage bin, and a bed with built-in storage underneath.


Keep traffic flow in mind – leave about a 3 foot path of walking room. To do this, try to have every piece offer some type of functional purpose. Keep your eye out for multi-purpose pieces, and you will begin to recognize them as you shop. There are even ironing boards that also function as a floor mirror! , Vertical shelving doesn’t use up much floor space but offers a place to display photos, trophies, and collectibles.Floating shelves are an economical and space-saving way to hold items like lightweight books, DVDs and CDs.

, If possible, work on designating, organizing and labeling bins with your daughter. Decide together where the bins should go.Devise a system for organizing school paperwork, such as a box of accordion folders., Window treatments may be drapes, blinds, or other aesthetic window coverings. Hold window treatments up to the light in the store or showroom to see how the light comes through them. Pleat the material in your hand if you can and see how it drapes.Blinds will need mounting brackets and the tools to install them. Curtains will need brackets, relevant hand tools, and a decorative hanging rod.
Remember to buy appropriate hardware to install window treatments.

, Offer to let your daughter select items with the project’s budget in mind. Involving her in these decisions will give her a sense of pride in the design, and it’s also a great way for you two to bond!For example, let her choose bed linens, window treatments, and/or upholstered furniture pieces. Have her compare the cost of each item she selects to the budget to help her understand decision-making that considers finances.

, Discuss her ideas and use this process as a way of learning to compromise with each other in a positive way. If her favorite color is hot pink, for example, use it for accents like throw pillows or picture frames, rather than more permanent items like furniture. If she disagrees, convey to her the importance of longevity when it comes to purchasing decisions.If she has her heart set on hot pink walls, for example, try offering to allow her to one accent wall in her favorite color. A single wall is easier to paint over over than an entire room.

, Your teen can express her own unique creativity by decorating boxes or making pictures for the wall. Painting one wall or part of a wall with chalkboard paint gives your teen a place to express herself with quotes, song lyrics, drawings, etc. A corkboard for pinning photos and inspiration can be dressed up with a frame painted in metallic or your daughter’s favorite color., The options for hanging décor are endless. You can hang photos, beads, unneeded CDs, plaques, paintings, and more. Use your imagination and consider your daughter’s personality and likes when selecting decoration.If you hang gauzy fabric from the ceiling around the bed, you can create the illusion of a bed canopy.You can even add strings of lights behind the draped fabric for a beautiful effect - just follow the safety instructions for the lights., A bulletin board is a great place for her to hang invitations, appointment reminders, and pictures. If you buy a board that comes with a chalkboard or dry erase board, you can leave each other messages and hang it on her door.

, Paint takes less preparation than wallpaper and tends to be less expensive; wall paper is considerably more difficult to remove. However, wallpaper can be purchased in washable styles and may be more durable. You can also opt to use paint on certain walls and wall coverings on others.If you are painting over a dark color, apply primer first. If the wall is damaged, fix imperfections with spackle and let it dry for 24 hours before painting.

, This could range from quotes to other decals. You can shop a wide variety of inspirational quotes in wall decal form online, or head to your local home improvement store and look for decal designs. These can be cheaper and less permanent than paint or wall coverings.


Check the label or the manufacturer’s website for information on maintenance and longevity of the wall decals. Most people have no wall damage or problems with removing interior wall decals., Area rugs are more practical than installing new flooring. Work with your floor plan and choose an area rug that is a minimum of 6” and no more than 2’ away from the wall.Bold patterns can make a small room look larger, and can even make the area rug the focal point of the room.

, From light switch covers to larger scale details, adding aesthetic details to the décor can make a huge difference. Blank walls can be pretty and useful if you interlock ribbons and attach them to the walls: it creates a pattern where your daughter can also put up pictures and postcards. The items she hangs there can even be changed out easily according to her changing tastes.Some inexpensive but noticeable details: large letters of initials from a craft store; decorative mirrors from a dollar store; hanging a row of slim door mirrors on a wall; mason jars mounted on the wall for storing beauty items; and old drawers repurposed as floating shelves to hang jewelry.

, The only limit to DIY décor is your imagination! Laundry line can hold clothespins with clipped photos. If you find a good deal on plain pillows, why not stamp custom designs on them? You can also make custom patterns on lamp shades with a paper design from your own printer and hole puncher. Bulk fabric can make eye-catching wall art, drawer fronts, or cover a headboard.Pinterest and online interior design blogs have a wealth of DIY décor ideas to get your brainstorming started.

, Give your daughter positive encouragement when she tidies up her own room. If you notice things accumulating, try addressing it with humor rather than reprimand. Teens tend to react better to humor than strict approaches because of the stubbornness that comes with adolescence.Try a quip like, “Were you planning on getting back into the organizing groove soon, or should I get out my galoshes?”

, Often teenagers don’t understand how to keep their room clean and organized. Show her how to achieve this by doing one manageable task at a time.For example, Tuesdays can be vacuuming day, and on Thursdays she can make sure that all of her dirty laundry is in the hamper. Consider letting her choose which day she does specific chores. If you’re met with resistance, you can then remind her, “You chose Tuesdays for vacuuming; it’s important to stick to your word.”

, Set days periodically where you sit down together and go through items that are no longer needed. This time can refresh the good feelings you two shared organizing the room together, and reinforce the importance of upkeep. Use several bins to designate what should be done with each item.For example, items in good condition that are no longer wanted can be given to charity or passed on to a younger sibling. Broken or worn out items can be trashed. Seasonal items can be moved elsewhere for storage.Try asking, “Do you really use this item, or is it just taking up space?”

, Can you refurbish them by painting them? Make sure your room has enough storage for all your clothes and other bits, and if it doesn't, buy a wardrobe or chest of drawers.Try to put it to the side and your tables should be more wood like to make it modern but keep it your own style if you want. Make sure all your furniture colors match, that will look stylish.

, Pick a color or two that you like and paint your walls that color. If you want, buy some funky wallpaper for one wall. This will be your feature wall (it's usually the wall that your headboard will be on). Make sure that the wallpaper isn't too dark and that it has a bold pattern on it, such as damask. If you don't want to use wallpaper, simply paint your room or hire a painter to paint it for you.

, If you like your current bedding, keep it, but if not, buy a new set! Bright, vibrant colors or cool patterns on bedspreads are really modern and funky. Make sure that it all matches your room!

, A good idea is to usually have 2 sources of lighting in your room. You should have a main source of lighting, such as a chandelier, a floor lamp, or a light attached to your ceiling. You should also have a desk lamp so that if you want to keep the lighting low, you can only have your desk lamp on, or it gives you extra light if you need it. Lighting really sets the mood in your room, so keep that it mind!

Spot reduction of fat is not possible to accomplish with diet alone. Eat fewer calories throughout the day, so that your body will use up fat as stored energy. If you do that, you will lose weight in the face too.


Luckily, if you want a slimmer face, your body goes after the fat first in the neck, jaw and face. So if you cut down on calories but do it in a healthy manner, you should have a less full face in no time.
You need to create a caloric deficit. It takes about 3,500 calories burned to lose a single pound. You will burn some calories every day just by living and breathing. You need to burn more than you take in to lose weight. Effective weight loss occurs gradually.
Cutting calories in a healthy manner means eliminating some calories – say 500 a day, through diet or exercise – without completely depriving your body of food. Instead, make healthier food choices or start slow, say by eliminating that morning doughnut from your diet. Not eating at all is medically unsafe. It also could put your body in starvation mode, which will actually reduce your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight.;
, There are many reasons that it’s a good idea to drink a lot of water throughout the day, but one of them is that it will reduce bloating in your face.


The reason water helps reduce face fat is because it flushes toxins out of your body. Thus, it also increases your overall health. It will also improve the look of your skin and hair.Drinking cold water will burn extra calories. Drinking 64 ounces of water per day is a good target to strive for. Keeping the body constantly hydrated will make you feel better, and it should make your face look more slender over time.

, A diet that is low in processed foods and refined flour (like white bread and pasta) will be healthier for you. Instead, try to eat a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits, foods with fiber, fish, and other protein rich foods.


Try not to eat food with a lot of salt (avoid junk food as it’s loaded with salt). Salt encourages your body to retain more water, so it will bloat your face. Sugar is also linked to a fatter face. Processed carbs with a lot of sugar in them are going to cause face bloat. Although people who are underage should not drink alcohol, another negative side effect of alcohol is that it causes the face to bloat by dehydrating the body.Some good food choices include almonds, broccoli, spinach, and salmon., Sometimes food allergies or intolerance are to blame for a fuller face. See a doctor if you think you might have one.


As an example, some people have sensitivity to gluten and would benefit from eating gluten-free foods. Many restaurants and grocery stores are including gluten-free options these days.Some people with irritable bowel syndrome sometimes think their faces are fuller as a result. Gastrointestinal disorders are fairly common, affecting about 15 percent of adults.
It’s also possible that hormones are causing your face to look fuller, such as PMS (or in older women, peri-menopause).

, You can exercise your face to make it look slimmer. This works by strengthening facial muscles, reducing saggy skin in the face.


Try the cheek puff exercise. Simply take a deep breath and hold the air in your cheeks. Then push it to the other cheek. Do this several times throughout the day.
A smile exercise that tightens the cheeks and mouth is to smile and clench your teeth for a few seconds. Don’t squint your eyes. Then pucker your lips. Repeat. Do this on one side, and then switch sides.
Pucker your lips for five seconds. Hold the pucker on the right, then switch to the left side of your face. If you have an expressive face and use your facial muscles a lot – even just by smiling and laughing a lot – your face will look more slender.

, If you do so, you will also see changes to your face. Exercise is also good for your health overall.


This might mean just walking for 30 minutes most days a week. Or you could try a circuit training program 3-5 days a week. Any exercise is going to help boost your metabolism, reduce overall fat, and slim your face.
Make sure that you don’t make the mistake of thinking you can eat junk food because exercise will take care of it. Losing weight is mostly diet, although exercise will definitely strengthen the body and improve health.

, The body needs sleep to be healthy. There are many studies that correlate lack of sleep with weight gain.


A fatigued body may bloat and also cause the facial muscles to sag. This can make the face look larger than normal.
A good rule of thumb is to try to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Try to have a regular sleeping schedule.

, From blowing balloons to hot towel treatments, there are many ideas out there that are said to slim the face.


Blowing balloons will tone your cheeks because it exercises the muscles in them. Just blow a balloon and release the air in it, and do this 10 times. You should notice a difference in 5 days.Try putting hot towels on your face because some believe steam can help you reduce cheek fat. The face will sweat and release some fat stored in your face. Just put the towel into warm water, and then apply it to your face. Some think steam can help slim your face by removing toxins from it.Chew sugar-free gum for at least 20 minutes twice a day. This actually works as a facial exercise that will cut calories and tone your face. You could also try a facial massage using ginseng or wheat germ oil to stimulate blood circulation in the face. Start at your chin, moving upwards in a circular motion with your palms.

, There are different makeup tricks you can use to create the illusion of a slimmer face.


Apply a bronzing powder in the hollows of your cheeks or on the sides of your nose. Adding blush to the tops of your cheeks also can make the face look less full.
With the powder, draw a line along your cheekbones, blending the powder in from your ear to the corner of your mouth. Just above it, apply blush. Choose a bronzer that is two shades darker than your skin tone. This way you can use it to add more shape to your face, making it appear slimmer., If you use makeup to put more emphasis on your eyes, your face is likely going to look slimmer.

When your lips are full, it can make your face look rounder. So if you're worried about that, play up your eyes. Put mascara, eyeliner, and eye shadow on them, and leave your lips plain or only put a plain gloss on them.
The shape of the eyebrows is really important to making your face look slim. If your eyebrows are higher and more shaped, this can make your overall face look thinner. Many beauty salons will wax and shape your eyebrows for you if you're not sure how to do it right.

, Many Hollywood stars use contouring to alter the shape of their faces, such as creating stronger cheekbones or slimmer noses.

To slim the nose, take a darker powder than your skin tone, and apply a thin line of it on each side of your nose. Then, use a brush to blend it along each edge. Use a highlighter to apply it above the eyebrows, and draw a line with it down the center of your nose. Blend it into your skin with a brush.
To contour the face, take a contouring powder, also darker than your skin tone, and draw it on your cheeks, angling down your cheeks. Smudge it in so it doesn't look like a harsh line. Use powder that is two shades darker than your skin. Contouring allows you to alter the shape and lines of your face., Another trick that you can use with makeup to slenderize the face is to add an element of illumination to it.Take sheer highlighting powder. Using a makeup brush, put it under your eyes, and down the middle of your nose.
You should use the illumination technique in conjunction with bronzing powder or contouring. Some believe it will make your face look slimmer because of the contrast with the bronzing powder.

, Not all hairstyles are created equal. Depending on your face shape, a hairstyle can make your face look rounder or slimmer.If your hair is long, don’t grow it past your chest, and have a hairstylist create some soft layers to frame your face.You want to create some curves in the hair around the face by the cheekbones and eyes, avoiding straight lines in the hair. Bangs will probably make your face look fuller if they are cut straight across.
You should avoid blunt cut bobs and instead go for a longer shaggier look with layers. Pulling the hair straight back will make your face look rounder by showcasing your temple. A high vertical bun gives the illusion of a slimmer and longer face.

, These can go so wrong, and they may look unnatural. However, it’s obvious that older people sometimes explore them to get rid of fat in the face.


Fat suctioning procedures or face lifts can remove excess fat or skin. Some people opt for cheek implants to give the face a different appearance.
Think long and hard before exploring any of these options. Be happy with your natural looks. Find comfort in your own skin. There are many stories of people who undergo cosmetic surgeries they live to regret. Underage people should try natural ways of slimming the face instead, such as using makeup tricks or, better yet, a healthier diet. Cosmetic surgeries can be dangerous and expensive.

Keep your eyes open.",How to Look Older (Teenage Girls)," In elementary and maybe even middle school, it was acceptable to wear sneakers with practically every outfit you owned. Now that you are a teenager, wearing nicer shoes (flats, heels, or even some types of flip-flops) will help you look your age. Athletic shoes are for exercising and walking-intensive activities, not for everyday wear.;
, Study other people your age (or the age you want to appear) to determine the best type of hairstyle for yourself. Long, stringy, neglected hair will only make you look like a middle school student. Shorter hair usually makes girls appear older, but if you're attached to your long locks, consider getting a few layers, perhaps with some sideswept bangs as well. If you are reluctant to even get a haircut, at least try parting your hair on the side if you don't already.

, If you have braces, there is little you can do besides waiting until your beautiful straight teeth are revealed, but if you need to wear a retainer or have not yet started in braces, consider asking your orthodontist about using Invisalign instead. Whitening your teeth with a whitening toothpaste or a product like Crest Whitestrips will also be helpful. If you do not have braces but need them, take action as soon as possible. You do not want to be stuck with braces in college.

, Remarkably, stabbing pieces of metal through your earlobes will do wonders for your apparent age. If you have not yet done this, what are you waiting for? If your earlobes are already pierced, consider a cartilage piercing.

, Some kinds of eyeglasses make girls appear younger. Consider switching to contacts, or if that is not an option, find some more mature-looking glasses, whether that means buying a pair not emblazoned with little hearts, or simply going frameless.

, Just a bit of mascara and eyeliner can go a long way. Don't go overboard.

, This may seem insignificant, but it makes a big difference. Either get your eyebrows shaped up in a salon or learn how to groom them yourself.

, While you're at it, if you have not started shaving your legs and underarms, now is the time. Not only will you feel and look cleaner, but this is a major step in many girls' journeys to womanhood. Consider hair removal in other areas if necessary or desired.

, Frankly, don't hide your figure. If you are used to covering up, wear slightly more revealing or figure-flattering clothes sometimes. This does not mean replacing all of your clothes with the most provocative styles. To avoid appearing desperate and trashy, emphasize just one feature at a time. For example, if you choose to wear a lower-cut shirt, pair it with classy jeans instead of a micro mini.

, As you get older, you will need to continue updating your appearance. Keep observing other people to determine the keys to looking your age.

Try to take a ten minute walk every day after school. Add a minute every day until you’re walking for an hour every day. If you don’t have a safe place to take a walk, try climbing stairs instead. Walk up and down the stairs five times on the first day, and then add one more flight of stairs every day until you can go up and down twenty times without stopping., If you can’t stand to miss your favorite show, do jumping jacks during the commercials. Or make a game for yourself where you have to do 5 burpees every time a character does x, y, or z., Even if track or cross country running isn’t your thing, there are lots of ways to get in cardio exercise as a teenager. Check out your school or rec league’s basketball, swimming, soccer, lacrosse, or hockey teams.


Rec leagues often practice less frequently than school teams, so this may be a good way for you to fit in some exercise if you can’t commit all of the required time to a school sport.
If you struggle with endurance, try a sport where you tend to run in short bursts, such as tennis, softball, or baseball.

, If you’re not into team sports, you can skateboard, rollerblade, ride a bike, swim laps, or shoot hoops in your driveway. Anything that gets you moving and elevates your heart rate will help you get in shape., If you can have an afterschool or summer job, look for one that lets you move around. Camp counselors and daycare workers chase kids and play games with them all day long. Waiting tables at a busy restaurant can keep you on the move. Think about starting your own lawn care company, raking your neighbor’s leaves in the fall, shoveling snow in the winter, and weeding their gardens in the spring and summer. Some moving companies will hire teens part time in their busy season, or you could stock groceries at your local supermarket. , Most teenagers don’t have access to a gym, so you may have to make do with what you have at home. Lots of strength training exercises don’t require a gym or any special equipment. You can do push-ups, planks, crunches, or sit-ups in your own home.It’s a good idea to do body-weight exercises (like push-ups or sit-ups) before you move on to using weights. This will help you build muscle mass before you dive in and lift weights.You can also use everyday objects for weightlifting. For example, save old milk jugs, and fill them up with water for homemade dumbbells.
You can also keep an eye on Craiglist or at yard sales to see if you can score some simple weight lifting equipment to keep in your room, garage, or basement. Sometimes you can find these items for pretty cheap.

, If you’re on a sports team, you may have access to your school’s gym, or your school may allow all students to use the gym during certain hours. Talk to a coach or athletic director about open gym time when you can use the school’s equipment. Alternatively, if your parents belong to a gym or YMCA, find out what a family membership would cost., Lots of schools offer a weightlifting class, club, or team, or there may be one designed specifically for teens and young adults at your local gym or YMCA. This can be a great way to get some encouragement, training, and always have a spotter on hand., Strength training almost always requires a buddy. Spotters can stand nearby to prevent you from dropping the barbell on your chest if you’re weight lifting, or they can keep an eye on your technique for you., It’s going to take some time for your body to get used to strength training, so don’t rush it. Start with very small weights and only a few reps, and build up. Rushing in can very easily cause you to injure yourself.Remember that because you’re a teenager, your body is still growing and changing. That means it’s easy for you to injure your bones, joints, muscles, and tendons if you’re not especially careful with strength training.

, Research the correct way to do each kind of lifting, and start with small enough weights than you can master the technique before adding weight. Using the wrong technique can injure you, which won’t help you get in shape in the long run., Practice strength training about three times a week. Never lift weights on back-to-back days; your muscles need time to recuperate, and you will injure yourself if you overdo it. You can alternate your cardio days with your strength training days., The number of calories you need will depend on how old you are, how much you weigh, and how active you are. Here are some general guidelines:


Teenage boys ages 11-13 need an average of 1,800 to 2,600 calories per day.
Teenage boys ages 14-18 need an average of 2,200 to 3,200 calories per day.
Teenage girls ages 11-13 need an average of 1,800 to 2,200 calories per day.
Teenage girls ages 14-18 need an average of 1,800 to 2,400 calories per day.Teens involved in strenuous sports need more calories than the average teen. Check out the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ recommendations at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/downloads/calreqtips.pdf.

, Complex carbohydrates give you energy and help with digestion. Whether you want to lose weight, stay in shape, or bulk up, you should be eating plenty of complex carbs (about 50-60% of your diet.) The best sources of complex carbs are: fruits (which are especially good for busy, on-the-go teens, because fruits like apples, oranges, pears, and bananas are so portable)
starchy vegetables (such as potatoes and corn)
green vegetables
whole grains
beans
legumes (such as peas, soy, and peanuts). , Less than 30% of your diet should be fats, but you have to stick to the good kind. (Don’t be fooled by fast food and sweets. Those kind of fats aren’t good for you.) Fats help absorb important vitamins, including A, D, E, and K, all of which you need to stay fit and healthy.


The best fats are unsaturated. They are found in foods such as olives, peanuts, cashews, avocado, walnuts, salmon, and anchovies.
Busy teens may want to ask their parents to stock up on packets of nuts as a great portable snack full of lots of good fat.
Particularly if you’re trying to bulk up, you may want to include some saturated fats (like milk and red meat) in your diet. Though too many can lead to heart disease, they’re generally okay in moderation. If you’re trying to lose weight, you may want to stay away from this kind of fat.ITrans fats are the bad ones. They are found in most commercially sold baked goods, fried foods, and box mixes. Stay away from these, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. , They increase bone health, which is really important if you’re trying to get in shape. If you’re trying to bulk up, switch to whole-fat milk instead of low-fat. Low-fat or skim milk is a better option if you’re trying to lose weight.Mozzarella cheese sticks are a great snack if you’re in a hurry. Yogurt is also pretty portable and even comes in squeeze-tubes now.

, This is crucial if you’re trying to get stronger or if you participate in sports. Protein helps you build muscle. Legumes, chicken, turkey, and fish are good options., Stick with water over juice, soda, or even sports drinks (which tend to be quite sugary). You’ll need lots of water (about 8 to 10 glasses if you’re over 13) in order to stay hydrated if you’re trying to get in shape."

This spot is easy to hide with inconspicuous clothing simply by wearing normal tops cut a little higher. During cooler months, you can look stylish in turtlenecks.


Sometimes it's hard to tell how a piece of clothing will fall on your body. If you're specifically looking for a top to hide stretch marks, be sure to try it on first before buying.

, Stretch marks are also very common at the armpit and upper arms, especially if you exercise or build up muscle in that area. Avoid tank tops and spaghetti straps, which would draw attention to your stretch marks.


When trying on tops with short sleeves, be sure to raise your arm up high in front of a mirror. Sleeves that may look fine with your arms at your sides may ride up, exposing your stretch marks.

, In cooler weather, wear scarves and shawls to cover your stretch marks. Avoid wearing jewelry over bare skin near your stretch marks. The shine from the jewelry will draw eyes to the problem area.

If you think that wild, curly hair is pretty, then go for it. Don't be afraid to be yourself and set your own standards.


Remember that true beauty comes from the inside, and uniqueness is also beautiful. If you've only believed that beauty was physical before, redefine this idea and contemplate the possibilities.
At the same time, try to set realistic expectations. For example, instead of drastically trying to change your figure, skin color, or hair, try to accept the way you look first. Take good care of your hair and skin and focus on the parts you do like about yourself (such as your eyes or your curly hair).;
, Sometimes, people can be their own worst critics. Take a moment and treat yourself like a friend -- would you be as harsh on yourself? What are your best qualities (both inside and out)?


Maybe you value certain features about yourself because they are inherited from a loved one. Accept yourself as you are, and recognize that you are not perfect -- but no one is, it's human.
Appreciate your uniqueness, develop the qualities you want that you have control over (such as your personality, intelligence, and health), and trust that your beauty will grow day by day.

, Even the prettiest girl can lose friends if she is mean, manipulative, or uncaring. At the same time, the plainest girl can find many friends if she is kind, fair, and thoughtful. This section will give you a few tips on how to let your inner beauty shine through.

, A scowl or frown can make anyone look unpleasant and intimidating. A friendly smile, however, can make any face look brighter and approachable.

, Make sure to say ""please,"" when asking for something, and ""thank you,"" when you get it. Also, if you need to get past someone, say ""excuse me.""

, If you notice your friend or classmate looking sad, ask them what's wrong or if they'd like to talk about it. If they do start to talk, listen to them attentively. Even if their problems are not ones you may be able to connect with, they will recognize that you care. They will see this as a beautiful quality about you.


You can also show that you care by volunteering at homes for the elderly, soup kitchens, or animal shelters.

, The more positive and supportive you are, the better you will feel about yourself. You may even stop focusing on your flaws (such as that annoying pimple that keeps popping up) and start seeing the good things about yourself. Here are some ways you can be more positive:


If something doesn't turn out the way you liked, try to find something good about the situation. You can also consider what you can do to improve the situation next time. Oftentimes, the lesson you take away will be more valuable than a favorable outcome. By focusing on the benefits, you can strengthen your perspective.
In unforeseeable circumstances, see if you can adapt to the situation and make the most out of it. For instance, if it rains on the day of the picnic you spent all week planning, see if you can bring it inside. You could even set up a movie or bring out a few board games to play with your friends.
If your friend is really excited about something, try to share their excitement. You can also ask them questions about it to show that you are interested.
If your friend is really good at something, try to encourage her/him. For example, if your friend is good at drawing, tell her/him that their drawing is really good and that you really like their style.

, Putting someone down will never make you feel better about yourself or accomplish anything worthwhile. In reality, the more you make fun of others, the worse you will feel about yourself. Sometimes, the bullying might even come back to you. You could really hurt someone, and make them feel really bad about themselves.


Instead, ask yourself what it is that would make you consider bullying or participating in it -- are there internal issues you may need to work through? Are you trying to feel accepted by the bully? Is the person being bullied or their actions symbolic of something or someone that you dislike? Perhaps they reflect a quality about yourself that you neglect or wish could be better.

, Even if you don't get good grades or score the most goals on your team, people will notice if you try hard. They will appreciate your efforts and look up to you. Developing your intelligence will also open many doors (such as opportunities) for you.


Try to do well in school. Find a subject that you really like or are passionate about, and try to do the best you can in it. You might even get people asking you for help in that subject. Even if there is a subject that is not your strength, give it attention. You may be noticed for your diligence and/or find people that want to help you or work together.

, If you like to draw, then consider taking some art classes. If you like to sing and dance, consider trying out for the school play. Building an arsenal of skills will help you cultivate who you are as a person.

, Look around the familiar and see if you notice anything new or different today - was there something you weren't aware of before? Try to explore different places, cultures, topics, and look for similarities and differences. Being curious and building your knowledge is not only a fun thing to do, but you will find a treasure trove of intrigue that will connect you with others in ways you would never imagine possible.


Read more. Read the news (both domestic and worldwide) and see what you can learn. Read literature, poetry, or non-fiction, and take a dive into someone else's life or ideas.
Listen to what other people have to say. Listen to the radio, podcasts, and listen more closely to the people around you. Every person has knowledge that they can offer that can help you grow.
Ask questions. ""Why"" is one of the best questions and can often help you find the heart of the issue in many cases. Don't be afraid to ask questions, because questions (when asked correctly) can also make another person feel important. Furthermore, it will make you look and feel confident, but also help you gain knowledge.

, Don't brag about the things you are good at, but don't try to hide your talents either. When you walk, try to keep your chin up, your back straight, and your shoulders tilted back.

, Staying clean will not only help you look your best, but it will also help you feel better too. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Brush your teeth twice a day. If you wear braces, you might want to brush your teeth after your eat something. Consider bringing a toothbrush and toothpaste with you to school. Also, take care of your teeth by flossing.
Take a bath or shower once a day. Try not to do this more than once a day, because it will dry out your skin. This will help you stay healthy; it will also help you feel fresh.
Wear deodorant to keep body odor down. This may also help increase your self-confidence. You don't have to smell like a rose to feel good about yourself. A fresh, natural scent is okay too.
Consider using perfume. Use on wrists, elbows, neck, and upper body. Try to use only one spritz because otherwise you will smell to strong! Natural fragrances are good, and refreshing or sweet are too. Just use whatever is right for you!

, Plan on sleeping eight to nine hours a night. Your body will be healthier, and your skin and hair will look better too. You may also find your mood to be lighter, and that you are feeling less stressed., Things like pizza, french fries, candy, chips, and hot dogs aren't great for your health. They can cause weight gain, wreck havoc on your skin, and influence your mood. They also lack the nutrients your body needs. Foods like fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and lean meats, however, are packed with nutrients and vitamins. They are not only good for your body, but for your skin and hair as well. Try to include more of these in your diet and see how it affects you on a long-term basis.


You could also try doing exercises​​ to become more toned, especially abdominal-benefiting ones! This will not only make you feel the sports-happy-rush, but you will start to feel generally better with yourself.
It is perfectly fine to treat yourself to something sweet, such as a chocolate or cookie, every once in a while.
Oftentimes, this lifestyle change can be difficult if you are accustomed to a certain diet. Junk food can be addictive and even inhibit the desire to change what you eat.Adjust slowly starting with things you can tolerate, or find creative ways to incorporate the foods that are difficult for you. For instance, you can often throw various greens into a smoothie and completely mask the taste with complementary fruits.
If you are determined, consider setting small goals to start. For example, you can make it a goal to experiment with a new vegetable, nut, or fruit each week to figure out what it is you like or different things you can do with it. Another idea is trying to substitute a healthy snack for an unhealthy snack for 5 days a week within a month.

, Most popular sodas have a lot of sugar, and even most juices have substantial sugar.Coffee is actually dehydrating and can significantly affect your skin, so much so that estheticians have suggested drinking two cups of water for every 1 cup of coffee on top of your daily 8. Even tea can be dehydrating, though not as much as coffee. Aside from minimizing calories, drinking more water produces numerous other benefits, including (but not limited to): better skin (flushing out toxins and helping blood flow), lowering stress (which can be caused by dehydration), and giving you more energy (also a side-effect of dehydration).Drinking less soda and coffee may require time, as the two can be habit-forming. Start off with a few cups of water a day, and increase over time. Consider adding ice and/or fresh lemon to make it taste more refreshing. You can also infuse water with fruits or cucumber to get that extra taste you are looking for.
If you prefer carbonation, you can consider sparkling water without additives. While it is a mild acid (like juice) and can erode the teeth over time, there is no evidence at this time that it can be harmful otherwise., Exercise is not just for those who want to lose weight; it also helps reduce stress and increase the hormones responsible for causing happiness. Even if you have a small frame, taking a long walk every once in a while will help keep you in shape.


This may require a lifestyle change, which always takes time to adjust. Feel free to go at your own pace, and start by thinking about what you enjoy. If you've always wanted to try a yoga class, check your local listings to see if any of them offer a free trial or discounted trial period. Simply dance around to your favorite song at home, because why not?
Involving a friend is often helpful. For instance, you can substitute your weekly coffee catch-up sessions with a leisurely stroll around a local track. Check deal listings and find one or two new activities to explore with a friend or two periodically, or until you find something that you like.
Setting weekly goals or having a set day and time per week can really help your efforts. Consider adding and marking it off a calendar, since this will give you a sense of accomplishment.

, Every body shape is beautiful, but if your figure really bothers you and makes you unhappy, there are a few things you can try to lose some weight. Keep in mind, however, that losing weight will take some time. Don't overwork yourself just to lose your weight faster. You will get very sick instead.


Eat well, but eat healthy. Do not starve yourself or skip meals. Instead, try to eat normal-sized, healthy meals. These will include things such as fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and lean meats. Try to avoid eating unhealthy foods, such as sweets and fast food.
Skip on the sugary drinks, and drink more water. These are easy calories to lose as you get used to it over time. Also avoid drinks that may be dehydrating, such as coffee.
Exercise a few times a week. Try swimming, jogging, or doing some sit-ups. If you haven't exercised before, or have not done it in a while, start with small, easy sessions first.
Get enough sleep. Try to get to bed early, and get around eight or nine hours. Studies have shown that going to bed late and not sleeping enough is tied to weight gain (and stress).
Consider enrolling in a weight-loss program or bootcamp. It might be more fun and motivating to do it with other people.

, Try not to use body wash or hand soap; they are too harsh and will dry your skin out. You also don't want to wash your face too often, even if it is very oily. This will also cause your skin to dry out. When your skin becomes too dry, it will start producing extra oils to make up for it.

, Soak a cotton ball with some toner, and sweep it across your face, focusing on the nose, forehead, chin, and cheeks. Avoid the sensitive area around your eyes. Follow up with some moisturizer. If you have oily skin, try to find a light-weight or gel-based moisturizer.


The toner will help restore your skin's natural pH. It will also help tighten your pores.
Moisturizer will hydrate your skin. It will make it appear smoother and less flakey.

, This doesn't mean that you have to avoid the sun. Instead, try wearing sunscreen each time you go out. If you don't like wearing sunscreen on your face, try using some foundation or moisturizer that has SPF 15.

, Everyone gets them at some point in their lives. Some people get them sooner than others. If you find yourself burdened with acne, there are a few things you can do to make it less severe:


Try not to pick or pop your pimples. This will cause them to bleed, and you may get scars.
Wash your face twice a day. This will help get rid of acne-causing bacteria. If you wear makeup, be sure to wash it off before you go to bed.
Buy some pimple cream from the drug store. Keep in mind that these creams may take some time to work. Don't use more than directed; this won't make the pimples disappear faster.
Ask your parents if you can see a dermatologist if you have severe acne. Most pimple creams will do the job, but some people might need something stronger. A dermatologist may help you find the right product, or give you a prescription.
Consider covering some pimples up with concealer. Everyone gets pimples, but if they really lower your confidence, you can dab on a little concealer over them to make them less noticeable.

, There are many types of hair, and therefore, there are various solutions for various hair types. If your hair looks frizzy, matte, or just not that great, take a look at your shampoo and conditioner bottles. Are you using a shampoo that matches your hair type? If not, try to get a shampoo that says it's for your hair type (such as curly, dry, colored, and so forth), and see if that helps.


If you have dry hair, look for products that say ""hydrating"" or ""moisturizing."" Try not to wash your hair every day. Instead, wash it every two to three days.If you have oily hair, look for a clarifying shampoo, or something that says its meant for oily hair.

It will make your hair appear thicker and give it extra body.
If you dye your hair, get a shampoo that says it's for ""colored hair."" It will help your dye job last longer. It will also take care of your hair and help keep it soft; most hair dyes are very harsh and drying on hair.

Wet hair is very stretchy, and snaps easily., Curly hair can be beautiful, but it can also get frizzy and unruly. It tangles easily and gets in your face when you are trying to work.

, There is no way to permanently seal the split ends together; however, you can temporarily seal them with a split end mending cream. Simply apply some of the cream to your split ends.

Also, try to use less heat-styling (such as straightening or curling). If you must straighten or curl your hair, be sure to use a heat protecting spray.

Find out what type of face shape you have. This can help you determine what sort of haircut might look best on you.

, Steve Urkel,a fictional U.S. television character in the 90s, was famously dressed in unpopular fashion at the time. However, in 2011, his style would have been considered the epitome of cool. Similarly, following the history of a single style alone can be very telling. Bell bottoms were initially from the 1800s, re-introduced as high fashion in Europe the mid-60s, and went mainstream in the US and Europe in the 70s. There was a revival in a varied form in the 90s, which is now known as ""boot-cut"",though styles similar to the 70s have been seen in recent years. Furthermore, boho-chic (bohemian) styles popular in the 60s-70s have also come into popularity again in recent years. Style can also be seasonal -- with lighter and brighter colors trending in the Spring-Summer, and medium to darker hues in the Fall-Winter (this is applicable across clothes, hair, and makeup).


Ultimately, trends recycle, reuse, and rotate. What's popular now, may not be tomorrow, and vice versa -- but at the same time, style can live on eternally in the world of high fashion and couture. For example, Alexander McQueen is worshipped in the fashion realm, but considered gothic. Even if a style is not recognized where you live, it may be celebrated across the globe. Such as steampunk, which has been gaining momentum within Japanese subcultures in recent years.At the end of the day, clothes are also a practical means to an end. This is something visionaries such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have accepted in an effort to be more efficient -- they wore/wear the same thing everyday.Some people do unfortunately tend to use looks as a way to gage a person. Forgive those people since they may not know any better, whether they were raised that way or influenced by societal cues, but also notice if you have these thoughts and feelings. Focus on yourself and what you like. Even if it is not preferable to others, it is always respectable. More importantly, it will allow you to learn more about yourself.

, You can still dress goth, skater, scene, or emo and still look pretty. You can even try on some vintage dresses for a chic, feminine look. If you are adopting a new style that may not be widely accepted it may take time for you to feel comfortable and confident.


Consider talking to your guardian(s) and friends about your interests first. If they do not support you, know that there are people that would (there are many examples of dads supporting their son's choicesfor instance). If you are not ready yet and you want to put it off until a later time, that's OK too -- it's never too early or too late (consider Baddiewinkle) to express yourself through your personal style. Know that there are always other people that share the same interests as you, they just may not be accessible to you yet.

, For instance, as a high-schooler, Kyemah McEntyre became an internet sensation by going forth and creating her phenomenal vision of an African-inspired prom dress despite being bullied.Style can be a means to change perception and/or perspective, and not everyone is receptive to change or something different in any situation (including those closest to you). Accept that there will be challenges along the way, and try to find people, or a community of like-minded people, that will support you.

, Even not caring is a style (the Parisians, for instance, are famously known for their love of effortless-chic). Choose a style that you feel comfortable in. If you don't feel comfortable in your outfit, don't wear it. Part of looking pretty is feeling comfortable and confident in your clothes.


Note: The steps below may not be applicable to all styles, so if the suggestion is not inline with what you actually like, go with your personal preference, whether that's grunge, baggy clothes (which were popular in the 90's and always comfortable), minimalist, or you simply don't care.

, You definitely do not have to be thin to be pretty -- remember, beauty varies from person-to-person and country-to-country. Curvy girls and large girls can be some of the most beautiful and fabulous people you ever meet. Models, such as Robyn Lawley and Ashley Graham, continue to defy current standards while building their own. Also, keep in mind that your body is still changing. Many teenage girls experience changes in weight. Also, know that a friendly smile is most attractive.

, Dirt, stains, and tears can detract from any outfit, no matter how well put together it is. Most shirts need to be washed after being worn once or twice. Pants and skirts can be worn a few times before needing to be washed.


If something gets torn, try to mend it by stitching it together.
If something is stained, you will need to use a stain remover on it before putting it into the laundry., Know how to make unflattering outfits flattering. Loose, flowing tops can look graceful and pretty, but they can also get in the way. If you have one, try securing it around your waist with a cute belt. A tank top may look cute, but it may also make your shoulders look too big or too small for your tastes. If this happens, try throwing a cardigan over it for a quick, chic look.


You can also learn more about how to Dress for Your Body Type.

, Make sure that you are buying your size. Tight-fitting clothes can be uncomfortable and difficult to breathe in, while baggy clothes can be difficult to move around in. If you find something that you really like, but you can't find your size, ask the cashier if you can order the outfit in your size. You can also get it altered, or find creative temporary ways to alter them yourself. Pants should fit comfortably around your waist. The shoulder width of a shirt should match your own shoulder width. You should feel comfortable in whatever you wear.


Some stores sell jeans that come have short, normal, and long leg lengths. If you are really short or really tall, this is something you could consider.
Just because your friends were low-waist jeans does not mean that you have to. If you find high-waist jeans more comfortable, and if they look great on you, then go for it.

, A cute belt or a simple necklace can take your outfit to the next level. It can make it look as though you spent a lot of time putting your outfit together., Every face is pretty in its own way, but makeup can help bring out certain features, such as the eyes or lips. It may also help you feel good about yourself. This section will give you some basic makeup tips for a more natural look. You don't have to do all of them, however; you can just wear some lip gloss or mascara.


Instead of trying to cover up the parts of your face that you don't like, try to focus on parts that you do like. This may help you feel less stressed about your looks. For example, if you don't like your nose, don't worry about trying to change it. Instead, focus your makeup on a part of your face that you do like, such as your eyes or lips.On the other hand, if you enjoy experimenting with makeup or want to create more dramatic looks to highlight your style, go for it. You should do what feels best for you, regardless of what other people may say. The tips below are not a one-size fits all solution. Only you know what works best for you.

, Foundation can be a little heavy for daily wear, but a tinted moisturizer is a great way to even out your skin tone while keeping it fresh and moisturized. You can apply foundation with your fingers, a makeup sponge, or a foundation brush—just be sure to blend it in, especially around the sides of your face and along your jawline.


Make sure that your foundation matches your skin tone, even if you are not happy with your skin color. If you use a shade that is too light or too dark, your makeup won't look very natural.
If you spend a lot of time out in the sun, consider getting something with 15 SPF in it.
Consider using some concealer to hide blemishes. Pimples are a part of growing up, but they can be embarrassing. If you have a pimple that really bothers you, don't pop it. Instead, dab a little concealer over it. Blend the concealer with a makeup brush into the rest of your skin, and then set it with some loose setting powder., Use a powder brush to dust on some blush or onto the apples of your cheeks and across your forehead. This will give you a healthy glow. You can also add color to your lips with some lip gloss or lip balm. This is also a great way to keep your lips looking smooth. Consider adding lipstick on special occasions.

, You can use mascara just by itself to enhance your eyes, or you can use it with some eyeliner and eyeshadow. If you have light-colored hair, use a dark brown eyeliner or mascara. If you have dark-colored hair, you can get away with a darker color, such as black or charcoal. For the eyeshadow, try to stick with neutral colors, such as browns and creams. Save the brighter colors for special events.

, Most perfumes are too strong for daily wear. If you want to smell like a flower or cupcakes, try getting some body spray. It is much lighter and less expensive, but it still smells great. Don't over-do it, however; one or two squirts is enough.

, Just because you wear glasses doesn't mean that you have to skip out on the makeup. If you like wearing makeup, there are a few things you can do to make your eyes stand out even more. Here are some tips:Put some concealer or light-colored eyeshadow on the inner corner of your eyes. Be sure to blend it well. This will help get rid of any shadows cast by the glasses.
Define your eyebrows. You don't have to pluck them, but try to keep them well-groomed by combing over them with a brow brush.
Go easy on the eyeshadow. Glasses tend to cast lots of shadow on your eyes already. If you like to wear eyeshadow, try using lighter or softer colors. You can also use neutral colors as well. You might want to skip on the dark colors; however.
Do some winged eyeliner. The will help make your eyes appear even larger. You can also use a little bit of eye liner on your lower lash line.
Try adding some mascara. This will help define your eyes.

, Sleeping with your makeup on can be extremely detrimental in the long-term, aging you as much as 10 years if done every day for a month."

Add one fun, unique element to the room.",How to Transform a Child's Room Into a Teenager's Room," Before you start moving anything around in the room, you should put together a mood board or an inspiration board. A mood board can be a collection of images from different sources, such as magazines, the internet, or even hand drawn sketches, that inspire you. You may structure the mood board around a theme, such as “punk rock” or around a certain color scheme or pattern. A mood board can be a great way to get inspired and form a clear sense of the style of the room.It may be helpful to also look online at design blogs that showcase teen bedrooms and style ideas. You may find a certain look or style based on images of existing bedrooms or a combination of two different approaches.
Try to integrate your hobbies and interests into the design of the room. If you are into a certain sport, like skateboarding for example, you may try to include skateboard images in the room. If your favorite color is blue, you may include different shades of blue in the room.It’s important that you and your parents agree on the overall style of the room and have a unified sense of how the room will look. Though your parents may be helping you to transform the room, you will ultimately need to live in it and you should have a major say in the design choices for the room.;
, Once you have decided on a theme or a certain style for the room, you should draw a rough floorplan of how you would like to rearrange the room. This could be a rough sketch of where key items, like the bed, the desk and the bureau are going to be placed in the room.You should also consider if there is enough storage in the floorplan for your clothing, your personal items, and your school books, and that there is a designated work space, especially if you tend to do your homework in your room.
Making a floorplan can also help you get a better sense of how to best utilize the space, such as ensuring the bed is in a spot that gets lots of sunlight or the desk is in a spot where there are limited distractions or close to a window.

, One of the biggest design choices you will make is paint wall colors, as paint can make a big statement in a room. Use paint swatches from your local paint store to decide what colors may look good in the room or fit with your theme. Make sure you try out the colors on the wall before you buy enough for the entire room to avoid choosing the wrong color.If you are trying to create a relaxing space, you may suggest neutral tones like white, gray, or beige. You can then add pops of color with accessories and furniture.
If you’re going for a more bold look, you may want to consider interesting contrast colors like yellow and black or red and gray. If your are into art and drawing, you may create a blackboard wall in the room, where one wall is painted with blackboard paint that can be drawn on with chalk., Another big design element is lighting, as lighting can make a big impact in a room. Maybe you prefer ambient lighting in the form of cafe lights or an overhead light with a dimmer option.You may also decide to include a desk lamp if you tend to study or read in your room and do not want to have to strain your eyes.

, Go through the furniture in your room and consider what you’d like to keep and what you’d like to sell or donate. Remember that you can update your existing furniture with fresh paint or new drawer knobs. Updating furniture can be a fun way to personalize your room.


Once you decide which furniture you’re keeping and which furniture you’re replacing, you should arrange a donation run with your parents to get rid of the furniture you do not want or post the items online to try to sell them.
You may also want to take a look around the rest of the house for other furniture or items that may fit in your new room. If there is a pile of old furniture in the attic or the basement, dig through it for any furniture that may suit your room makeover.

, Based on your floorplan and your mood board, you should be able to make a list of all the new furniture items and accessories you need to buy for your new room. If you are on a budget, you may try to find certain items online or at garage sales. You may also go to discount furniture stores and shops that sell affordable accessories.


Your shopping list may include big items like a bed or a desk, and accessories like new bedding, pillows, storage options like shelving, and frames for photographs or posters. You may want to enlist the help of a parent when you go shopping, especially if you do not drive and need to get around in a bigger car to pick up the necessary furniture and accessories.

, Once you’ve decided on your paint colors, you should prepare the room for painting. This means taking all the furniture out of the room so it is empty and the walls are easy to access. Cover any remaining furniture or items in the room with sheets so they do not get splashed with paint. You should then cover the corners and edges of the walls with painter paint so the paint only gets on the walls and not the ceilings, moldings, or the floor.


Before you paint the walls with your chosen wall color(s), you will need to prime the walls with primer paint. Once the primer paint dries, you can apply one to two coats of your chosen wall colors.
You may want to throw a paint party with a few friends and work on painting the walls together. Reward your helpers with pizza and your undying gratitude for helping to make the painting process go by much faster.

, Allow the wall paint to dry completely, usually overnight or a couple of days depending on how many coats of paint you have applied, and then move in the lighting and the furniture. String cafe lights along the ceiling if you decided on a more ambient look or set an overhead light on a timer. You should make sure you have a good desk lamp for when you do homework or read.


As well, you should ask your parents or a friend to help you move your furniture into your room, including your bed, your desk, and your bureau. If you decided to replace your bedding so it’s more age appropriate, you should switch out the bedding to see how it fits with the rest of the room.
Make sure your storage options, such as wall shelving or storage lockers, also fit well in the room and are convenient for you to use. Usually, the more storage options you have in a room, the better.

, Adding personal details like photographs, posters, and other visual mementos can really make your room feel special and unique to you. Consider hanging up photographs of friends and family in your room, or a picture of a person you admire or respect. You may also hang an inspirational saying or a funny quote that you love.You can frame and hang these pictures in simple frames on one wall to create a fun visual display or blow up on photograph to create a statement piece. Try to focus on images that have some meaning or value to you as you may be staring at them day in and day out.

, If you are looking to create personal touches on a budget, try a small DIY project like a terrarium or a fun project with washi tape. There are many DIY blogs online with lists of easy projects that you can do on a limited budget.Enlist the help of your friends or a parent and do a DIY project together. This can be a fun way to hang out and also create unique accessories for your new room.

, Though you may be tempted to throw away every item from childhood in your quest to have a teen appropriate room, consider saving certain sentimental or prized items like childhood medals or trophies. You may have an item given to you by a loved one that you treasure or an accessory gifted to you by a friend that you value for sentimental reasons. Including these unique items in your new room can make your room feel every more unique and specific to you.

, To really elevate your room make over, you may want to consider adding in one fun and interesting element to your room, such as paper lanterns, a great mural on one wall, or a cool vintage sign from a flea market. Statement pieces that are singular and special can really make your room feel more grown up but still interesting and particular to you.Avoid adding in too many unique elements in your room makeover, as too many big, fun statement pieces can make the room feel chaotic or overwhelming. Stick to one unique element so the room feels cozy and interesting, but not overdone or cluttered.

",How to Have a Great Summer Wardrobe (for Tweens and Teens)," March is still a little wintry in some places, but April is a great time in the Northern hemisphere, choose, October if that's the second month of spring where you live. Still some spring clothes but definitely enough summer, May and June are too late, all the cool summer clothes will be out in May and June, unless you live somewhere that those aren't summer months. So April is a good time. Go with your Mom and a friend. You might think why a mom? Your Mom was once your age too. Whether she is a good mom, fashionable or not, she knows what looks good on you. If your mom isn't fashionable, your friend will know something.;
, Two is not enough. Go to a mall or whatever with lots of variety. It might be a good idea to set a limit of money. If you want to have a good summer wardrobe, don't underestimate the amount of money to spend. Check online to see what you like, and add it up on a calculator. Go $10-$20 above what you calculated, and then cut back on what you want. There are five main steps to picking something out—knowing the store, what size you are, what color(s) look good on you, if you really like it, and will you really wear it.

, Around the following is a good number of things:


Tops:

4 Flattering T-shirts perhaps with embellishment, and with a bright summery look. Look for florals or linen fabrics.


Tank tops: make sure to have some simple and some fun ones. For summer breezy florals are always nice, lace is always springy, keep the fabric light, and your colors fun! It's summer, relax.

5 Crossovers between dressy-and-casual (Check out places like Anthropologie, or J crew for nice cross overs, find good deals at TJ Maxx)
2 Short sleeved or quarter-length sweaters (just in case)


Bottoms:

Pairs of Khaki and Denim shorts!
If you're into them, a lightly colored pair of cargo capris might be in now. (Try an army green, inspired by Balmain's new collection)
A denim mini (not too short or ripped up, you don't want to look trashy)


Swimwear:

Have one or two swimsuits. It's nice to have one bikini and a one piece or tankini.



, Something thin is good. Terry cloth works also.

, after you have gotten your outfits.

, Black, brown, pink, red, and navy are good. White gets dirty too easily.

, Make sure to visit all the most popular stores in your area. You might even find some cute stuff at boutiques! Never underestimate them!

, Before any purchase and after choosing your clothes, see how many outfits you can create from only one store. The first store should have three tops and three bottoms. Get casual clothes first, and then eventually fancier clothing. If you have three or more outfits, you are good. If you have less, keep looking.

, Get cute jewelry, headbands, and shoes to make the outfits cuter. After all, accessories can really make the outfit. Match them with certain outfits. You should have two necklaces that can go with two outfits. Get two funky necklaces. Get three headbands—one plain color that matches what you have gotten, one cool, but not funky like metallic or one with sequins, and one funky with polka dots or another cool design. Make sure everything you have matches. You only need one or two bags, and you can go your own way with these.

",How to Keep Your Closet Tidy," Empty your closet by taking all of your clothes/shoes out of it. It sounds like a lot of work but trust me this is the best way to get started. You may turn some music on to keep yourself going if that helps.;
, We don’t often realize how much dust and dirt can be inside our closet even though it is mostly closed. So, clean inside of your closet with an old piece of cloth for a good start. Use air freshener to get rid of the damp.

, You might have summer and winter clothes kept altogether in the same closet. So, separate them. If you are living in a city/state where the weather is mostly warm, keep your winter clothes on your top shelf/drawer which you can’t reach easily and that is out of your sight. Do the opposite for cold weather.

,, If you are a size 4 now and think you might get back into size 2, don’t mix all the sizes together.

, Keep all your whites together and as you go for darker colors arrange them accordingly. You will be amazed to find out how many of black pants and white shirts you own and don’t use them all- rather you keep buying more. Therefore, ordering them by categories will make your job easier every time you want to get ready to be somewhere and when you think you need a new white shirt whereas you already have one.

, Hangers are the best way to keep your closet tidy and so put most of your clothes in hangers. Later if you are in hurry, you can just pull the hanger out and wear what you want instead of searching it from a pile of clothes and making a mess.

, For particular outfits which are not used frequently but we keep them anyhow; like wedding dress and suits, they need extra care. You can put them in suit-covers. This way they can be better protected while being unused in the closet.

, For clothes like loose knits such as scarves or sweaters, do not put them in hangers as they might go out of shape by doing so. Keep your sweaters folded while keep socks, stockings and under garments in drawers.

, You will be surprised that you might have some clothes in your closet which you haven’t worn in a long time and don’t wish to wear them anytime in future. They might be out of fashion or not of your current size. So, no point storing them and it’s time to donate these clothes either to Salvation Army or for a garage sale or to someone who can make use of it. Make a list of clothes that you plan to donate and stack them in a box/bag. If you have emotional attachment with any clothes, take pictures wearing them and post it inside your closet or in an album before you store or donate.

, If you have shoes in your closet, make sure you keep them separated from clothes and of course according the types of shoes. For boots, it’s better to store them with winter outfits. You should also allow some room for your hats, bags and belts. Make sure they don’t take too much space while being neat.

, Making the bed always makes a messy room look cleaner!

, That can be done later. Now put the things where they go!

, Hang clothes up, fold clothes and place shoes neatly at the bottom. Take this opportunity to throw away old clothes and organize your closet.

, Six items per shelf is more than enough.

, Clear away unnecessary papers and just have a laptop/computer, mouse mat, and keyboard. It looks really pretty and effective if you also add about 3 folders, a globe, a big book and a small cuddly toy. Also you can get funky flowers that could make a better replacement for the cuddly toy!

, Have you picked? Once you have, take that many items out from under the bed and put them where they go. Repeat this step until you have completed the task. If you begin to feel like you're getting nowhere with this then make the number higher and continue with this strategy!

, Then get some polish and wipe it down. You might want to do this with dressers/chest of drawers as well.

, Enjoy your newly cleaned room!

Cardigans can go over a variety of tops, but they also create an outfit when you put them over a simple tanktop.You can pair blazers and cardigans with almost any outfit, but have enough to choose from throughout the week. Two or three blazers will be good, while you should invest in 3-4 different styles of cardigans.

, Simple t-shirts and sweatpants are perfect for those lazy days around the house. If the t-shirt is stylish enough, you can wear it as part of an outfit. You should have at least one t-shirt for every day of the week, and own about 3-4 pairs of sweatpants for lounging.


Stylish t-shirts include v-neck and flowy tees, and they can come in solid colors or with logos. Try not to get offensive or obscene language on them.

, Even if it's not your style, a little black dress will come in handy when you need to dress up or go on a date.At least one dress is important, but if you like the style, there are many different colors and designs to choose.


Sundresses, if they're your style, are nice for warm sunny days or beach days.

, White dress shirts can be dressy for presentations at school, or they can be casual when paired with some jeans.You should have at least one white dress shirt for professional or business reasons.


If you're going for the casual look, you might not want to button the shirt all the way to the top. You can also roll the sleeves up to be less dressy.

, Denim jeans are must-haves for a night out, and they can go with just about any top. You can wear jeans a couple times in between washes, so 3-4 jeans in different styles would work well. You should own at least one boot-cut and one skinny-leg pair, while having at least one dark-wash and one light-wash pair.Buying jeans can be expensive, but you don't want to be stingy with the quality. If you buy cheaper jeans, they'll be more likely to rip and you might have to buy new ones more often. A good pair of jeans can last you a few years.

, Shorts are important for the warmer days when you don't want to wear long heavy jeans. Skirts can be worn any time depending on what kind of style you prefer. Shorter skirts are available in the summertime, while maxi-skirts can be worn in the winter. If you get 2-3 skirts, you can mix and match during the week.


You should have a variety of shorts and skirts to choose from, and at least one for every day of the week. Denim shorts can last longer than non-denim, but you want to make sure you're comfortable for the hot summer days.

, Pajamas are comfortable at night, but they come in many different styles. Choose what's comfortable for you to get the most rest, and purchase as needed.


Undergarments can be an expensive shopping experience, but it's important to purchase well-fitting items and buy them as needed. You'll notice an immediate difference when you switch from old, worn out underwear that doesn't fit you.

, Depending on where you live, this might be a long trench coat or something heavier like a warm winter parka. This is important for winter wear when the months get a little chillier. A lighter trench coat can come in handy for southern-wear, while a parka would be nice for those northern winter nights.

, Shoes are important for function as well as fashion. You should have at least one pair of shoes for every occasion. Try to have shoes in different colors to match different outfits, primarily focusing on black, grays, browns and tans.High-heeled shoes may seem like an essential shoe style to own, but don't spend too much time shopping for them. High heels should be purchased as needed and as you like them, because they often only fit a limited style or wardrobe.

, Unless you have a pair of tennis shoes that you bought fairly recently, it's important to buy a new pair to keep your feet from hurting. Runners and sneakers should be replaced every 3 months if you exercise regularly, or 6 months to a year if it's just casual.Nike, Adidas and New Balance are popular runners for working out, and they're stylish for casual wear.

, Dress shoes will come in handy during the presentations you might have to deliver in class. These should usually be slick, black, and low-heels or pumps. Shiny pumps can go with almost any dress or skirt.


Pair dress shoes with your little black dress for a nice night out to dinner, or pair them with a white dress shirt for a more business professional look.

, Flats are important for easy slip-on shoes when you're wearing jeans or leggings. Ballet shoes or other closed-toe designs are most popular, but you want to make sure they're comfortable. Some flats can dig into your feet after pro-longed wear.


TOMS is a good brand for flats, and for every pair of shoes you purchase with them, they donate a pair to someone in need., Everyone should have a pair of flip flops or sandals for the warm sunny days, whether you're going to the beach or not. If you're an active person, sandals with a strap in the back secures your feet better than standard flip-flops.

, Galoshes or rainboots can be cute and fashionable when they're not just plain yellow or black. You can buy any style or pattern, and they're great at keeping your legs and feet dry in the rain!


Pair rainboots with leggings or jeans and you'll be more comfortable than anyone else wearing tennis shoes through the rain. Having a cute design enhances your outfit, but you don't have to necessarily match or own multiple pairs.

, Purses and handbags are great accessories to any outfit, and they're practical as well as fashionable. You can either get one big purse that matches any outfit, or you can buy a variety of purses and switch them out if you want. Make sure whatever purse you choose has no open ends for pickpockets and can be completely enclosed.Tote bags are great for the beach, as well as going on short overnight trips. It's good to have one tote bag available in your storage, if you don't use it every day.
Wristlet or clutch purses are great for nights out that you don't want to carry a big purse. Also, they fit in larger purses if you don't want to take out the contents.
Backpacks can be stylish and are not just used for school. You can carry a variety of things including a change of clothes, and the bag can be fashionable with a cute design, as well.

, Belts can be practical and fashionable, and they come in a variety of different styles. It's good to have 2-3 belts, and you can get them in different colors.


It would be good to have one thin belt, one medium belt and one thick belt for each of your outfits.
You can stick with the standard black, brown and gray color scheme to match more outfits, or you can get a variety of colors that match with specific clothing items.

, Scarves can be fashionable in almost any season. In the winter, you should stick to heavy scarves in earthy colors like black, tan and gray. Summer scarves should be lighter material and can have multiple colors or designs.Infinity scarves seem to never go out of style, but it's important to have standard scarves as well. It would be good to have 1-2 winter scarves for warmth, and 3-4 summer scarves to mix and match with the rest of your spring and summer styles.

, Jewelry boxes can come in many different styles and storage containers. Some people get a wide box and open it for jewelry storage, and others just hang jewelry from nails in the wall or on a ""jewelry tree."" It's important to have storage for jewelry, but you should also make sure that storage space is filled with essential jewelry items:


Pearls are great as necklaces, earrings and bracelets.
Cuffed bracelets can go with almost any outfit. For these, you should stick with gold or silver if you're going with metal. Thicker cuffs or leather bracelets can also be worn in black or brown.
Rhinestone earrings or diamond studs should always be available as these simple-yet-classy fundamentals can subtly enhance your entire outfit.
Necklaces can be purchased to match one sole outfit, or you can get a couple simple necklaces that can go with any outfit. Have at least one silver and one gold necklace that will match the rest of your jewelry.

, Depending on the occasion, it's important to have several go-to outfits already picked out. With each outfit you already have in mind, you can easily alter it or tune it up with the other fundamental items you have.


If you're going to the beach, you can easily slide your favorite sundress over your bathing suit with your flip-flops or sandals. If you want to accessorize, your pearls could come in handy--as long as you're not afraid to lose them in the water.
Keep your pumps ready for dressing up for a fancy dinner. Pumps always look nice with a little black dress and gold jewelry for these special occasions.

, While accessorizing your outfit, it's important to match jewelry to your entire outfit.It's okay to have gold or silver jewelry with black or brown accessories, but try not to mix gold and silver jewelry pieces together.


Pay attention to little things like your belt buckle. If you're wearing all silver but your belt buckle is gold, it may be hard to notice but something may seem off.

, Even if it's warm outside, layers can look good in any season. Wear a tank-top or camisole underneath a crop-top or cardigan, and pair it with a cute skirt. Add a scarf and you have a layered look for spring.


Layering doesn't always mean adding more clothing to cover up. It just adds an extra flair to your outfit so it's not boring and simple."

,


Undies: ten to twenty pairs is a good amount. Include boyshorts or briefs for everyday, a few pairs of seamless and one or two prettier pairs.
Bras: one or more sports bras if you do sports, two to four everyday bras in nude, white, black or pastel shades, one strapless bra and one or two push up bras.Try to stay away from darker colors as they can show through tops.
Camisoles. Camis are definitely a major fashion staple in any teen girl's wardrobe. They are great for layering and almost every clothing store has them. Choose neutral colors first - white, black, grey, neutral. Once you have finished your wardrobe, you can go back for colors.
Tank tops. Have a couple of tight or loose tank tops - sugar lips are a great brand.
Socks: Have around ten pairs of everyday ankles socks, a few pairs of trainer liners and a few pairs of knee high or over the knee socks. You may also want some fluffy or slipper socks.

, Own two to five sets of comfortable PJs. Think about the weather and time of year. In summer, some people prefer to wear just a baggy t-shirt or cami, or if you get cold in winter, sleep in a big sweater or hoodie with pyjama pants.

, Every girl should have a nice floral skirt for the summer months. High waisted and low rise shorts are great as well. A pair of dark wash skinny jeans and a pair of embellished jeans will make perfect additions to your wardrobe (have a few pairs). Don't forget leggings! Try to find fancy sweat pants and of course, regular baggy sweats too!


Sweatpants: two to three pairs will be perfect. Make sure they are good quality, have a good fit (not too baggy or tight), and match with at least two of your outfits.
Jeans: Try to buy mostly dark or medium washed jeans as these are the most versatile, but don't be afraid to buy a colored, patterned, faded,embellished or stonewashed pair if you love them.

, For example, have three pairs of jeans, one to two pairs of pants, three to four skirts and two pairs of lounging sweatpants.

, Basically any tops that suit your style will do. Stay away from baggy t-shirts. Flowing tops are nice as are sweaters. Get a variety of colours and styles and don't get into the habit of buying the same shirt in every single colour just because you like it that much.Ten to fifteen tops would be ideal. Aeropostale has a great selection.


Jackets and seasonal wear. This depends on where you live. If you live in the North or Midwest, get one or two ski jackets, one to three everyday coats, one light coat, and one vest. If you reside in the west or south, one heavy jacket, one light coat, and (optional) one vest will do fine.

, For example, have three to four tunics/smart tops, five to six graphic tees/everyday tops, three camis, three long sleeved tees, two lounging tees, 3 cardigans, and four hoodies (zip-ups too).

, Own two to six different dresses, one black dress and about five other dresses. A longer dress looks great on tall girls.Try to get them in different styles and colors that suit you well. Some should be for partying, some less casual, like church.

, For example, have one or two formal, three semi formal, and four to five casual. This includes sundresses.

, You could either hit it or miss it with shoes. Make sure your shoes are cute and match your personality, and do not overload your credit card. Here are some pairs to get you started:


Athletic Shoes: You should have at least one pair of athletic shoes. It also depends on how many sports you play, but you should have at least one pair running shoes. You may also need football or hockey boots if you play.
Sneakers: You will need at least one pair of non-athletic sneakers such as converse, vans or Nike blazers. These are great for the mall, park or a friends house.
Sandals: Have one or two pairs of cute, comfortable sandals, for the beach and for walking. Moccasins are also fabulous.
Boots: This also depends on where you live, but for anybody, have one pair hiking boots. Also, you should have a pair of long black boots, for warm or cold. Black are good, but no bright colors. Uggs are very popular.
Flats: It's good to have a couple of pairs of flats because they go with a lot of outfits. Bright colors or pretty patterns always complete the outfit, and make your whole look change. Have back up always, and maybe a pair of regular blacks or greys in handy.
Heels: Have one or maybe two pairs. One should definitely be in black, and maybe some others in stylish colors, but make sure they match with your dresses/formal clothes.

, Some basics are pearls and faux or real diamonds. Necklaces are pretty and come in a variety of different styles and colours. Try to avoid necklaces and bracelets that say ""Best Friends"" on them. They are nice when little kids wear them, but for teens, they are a little much. They also may make your other friends feel bad. Buy all accessories last because they are meant to accent the outfit.


Scarves: Scarves are good for the winter on in the fall, spring and even the summer. It is good to have bright colors, and cool patterns, rather then the browns and ugly colors. Go with the flow and have fun with them.

, For example, if you live in a hot country, you might want a pair of capris. Or maybe, you might like jeans/pants more than skirts, so you might want three pairs of jeans, three pairs of pants, and one skirt.

, Whenever you enter a store, head to the clearance rack first, even if you see other things that catch your eye. They have the best deals especially at the expensive stores.

, In order to save money, you have to hit the sales just right, especially if you wish to buy things from an expensive store. The easiest way to do this is to subscribe to numerous catalogues and ads. It also keeps you up on the latest trends and styles.

, That includes thrift stores! Some discount stores carry name brands that were unwanted by the store. Everything is brand new and never worn. They also have cute clothes themselves. The best part? They even say how much money you save right on the price tag!

, Even if it's a bargain, it's of no use to you unless you will actually wear it. Stuffing clothes at the back of the wardrobe is a recipe for clutter and wasting money.

Paint the room.",How to Use a Sample Board to Pick the Right Paint Color," Before you pick a single color, you should have a clear idea where you intend to use the paint. In which room(s) do you intend to use the color? Do you intend to use it on multiple walls in the room or just on one accent wall? Are you using it as a trim on your baseboards or on crown molding?


Consider the natural lighting of the room. How many windows exist in the room? Do you want the room to feel light and airy or dark and cozy? For a breezy feel, consider bright white, yellow or light blue. For darker colors, consider navy, gray, or incorporate touches or rich wood shades and mahogany.
Analyze the dimensions of the room. Is this a room with tall windows and ceilings or is space with low ceilings and little natural lighting (like a basement)?;
, If you have no idea which colors to embrace, consider looking at a range of shades available on the color wheel. The color wheel will also let help you find colors that complement each other.


Color theory is a broad term for how colors are organized and work together. It is largely based on the system of the color wheel, which organizes colors around the three primary colors -- red, yellow and blue.Traditionally, colors that are directly across from each other on the color wheel have been considered complementary. You can also use colors that exist in the same area on the color wheel. You can search for color wheels on-line and try out different combinations. Colors that are directly across each other on the color wheel tend to be compatible. For example, sky blue and peach orange are complementary colors. Yellow and purple are also across from each other on the wheel and together they a bold, bright combination.

, You might feel less overwhelmed by all the available paint colors in your local store if you find some similar shades on-line beforehand.


You can generally look at the web sites for all the major paint brands -- like Sherwin Williams or Behr. If you search sites like Pinterest, you will be able to see pictures of how other people have used these colors in their homes.
If you find inspiring images on-line you can collect them on an on-line forum, like a Pinterest board, or you could print them out and compile them in a book.
Keep in mind that all colors on-line might not look exactly the same in person.

, Once you have a rough idea of which colors you want to use, it's time to visit your local paint store. Select 3-4 swatches of colors that you would like to use.


Get samples of the swatches you want to use. This will generally be a smarter idea that buying entire gallons of colors you're not sure you want to use. Most paint stores will give you small samples for around $3.00-$4.00.
If the shade you are using is a very different color from the material of the walls, you might need to apply a primer before the paint. Talk to your consultant at the paint store about whether you should use a primer.

, Nothing will compare to actually seeing the colors of the paint on your physical walls. You can plan to paint squares of the different colors directly on the wall or you can buy sample boards and hang them on your walls to get a sense of what the will look like.

, Depending on the size of your painting project, your needs for other supplies will vary. You will generally need the following items:


Paint rollers and trays
Paint buckets
Primer
Brushes in different sizes
Paint thinner
Painter's tape
Dropcloth or plastic sheeting

, You put this directly on your wall or on a sample canvas. A swatch directly on the wall might be preferable since the color might change slightly based on the material of the canvas.


You can also try out different patterns or stencil sets on the canvas set if you're not certain you want to paint the wall in one solid block.

, If you have used a sample canvas board to paint your swatches, let them dry and then move them around the room. How do they look from different angles?


Pay special attention to changes in lighting. How does the sample look in natural light? How does it change when you turn on a lamp next to it? How does it look when it is cloudy outside or when it is very sunny?

, Unless you are under a quick deadline to paint, you should spend at least a few days judging the samples and figuring out which ones work best for your needs.


Try to keep your furniture arranged normally while you test out the samples. This way, you will be able to genuinely live around the colors and gauge your emotional response to them.

, This might seem like a silly step, but really consider how the color makes you feel. If you are using a bright, bold color, like a red or an orange, does the color make your feel energized or anxious? Do cooler colors like blues and greens make you feel relaxed or sleepy?


Marketers and brand strategists have long used color psychology to attract customers to their brands and maximize profits., How long do you intend to keep the room this color? Who else will spend time in the room aside from you? Is it inviting to guests, children, or overnight visitors?


While it is easy to change the color of a room, it is a time-intensive process to repaint a room. It will be more convenient if you can pick something you know you will want for at least a year and perhaps even longer.

, Once you have weighed all of the different aspects of each sample board, go ahead an pick a color. This is the color you will need to buy at least one gallon of (perhaps two or three depending on the size of the room) in order to complete your project.


Be sure it is a color that the other people sharing the space with you also enjoy.

, You will generally need to set aside a block of a few hours to paint the room. Depending on the size of the room, it could take 2-3 days before you can apply multiple coats. The following steps will help you get your dream color on your walls:


Move all furniture out from the room. You don't want to risk damaging them with paint. Roll up any rugs and remove them, too.
Lay down a drop cloth or plastic sheet to protect your floors from paint damage.
Tape off any sections you don't want to paint. This might include a baseboard in a different color or crown molding that will work as an accent trim.
Wear old clothes and shoes. It is likely you will spill paint on yourself at some point. Wearing old sweatpants, T-shirts, or gym shorts will be best because it can be very difficult (if not impossible) to remove paint stains from clothing.
Prime the room. If your consultant has suggested you use primer on your room before applying paint, you should apply this first. You might need to budget a day or so for it to dry. Use paint rollers and trays for your primer.
Apply the first coat of paint. If you are using a paint roller to cover a large wall, dip it in the paint tray. Don't oversaturate it with paint -- just roll it once or twice in the tray. Apply it upward with a light but even pressure. Allow it to completely dry before applying a second or third coat. Follow the instructions on your paint can.Dispose of paint properly. Never pour it down the drain as this can damage your plumbing. Instead, consider donating any leftover paint to organizations like Habitat for Humanity or other housing-based non-profits. Store it in an airtight container to make sure it it doesn't dry out.

Therefore, whenever you're buying clothes, ask yourself 'Is this similar to something that I already have?/Is there something different I could buy that I don't have yet?' Of course, this doesn't mean you have to buy clothes that don't suit you, or that you can't buy anymore of a particular type of clothing, it just allows you to pause and think about whether this purchase is going to make a good addition to your wardrobe;
,


A good idea would be to write down, at the beginning of each season, what clothes/accessories you want. For example, my winter list could be: a long cardigan, creative recreation shoes, skinny jeans, black & white tee shirt, cropped leather jacket .

, When you're shopping, carry around this list (or memorize it). Make the clothes on your list your number one priority before buying anything else. This is a good way to gradually build up your wardrobe.

, Even if a top looks great, if it doesn't go with anything you own it will be a pretty worthless purchase.

, Going to school replaces going to work, and unfortunately you can't earn money by going to school. Thus, we have a lot less money to spend on clothes and so on, and a higher proportion of our money is eaten up by buying single item

, You do need a couple of high quality 'wardrobe staples' - clothes that are the statement pieces of your outfit, or the foundations upon which you build your outfit on, and these are usually worth spending more money on (see TIPS for examples, male & female)

, Then there are other clothes that are 'basics'. These are things like basic tee shirts, leggings, tank tops and so on. These don't have to be so expensive (no one looks at you and goes 'oh, i wonder what brand of socks he's/she's wearing'), and therefore you can and should buy a wider variety of them. Buy buying cheaper basics you'll have more money left over for the statement pieces

, Look around and see if other shops give you better prices, better choices and better quality. Particularly in this day and age, salespeople can get really pushy trying to sell you clothes, but don't feel compelled to buy something - you should not be under pressure

, You cannot build up your dream wardrobe in a day. It will take time. Start off with a few clothes, a mix of statement pieces and basics, and work upwards and outwards from there. Budget your money carefully, decide beforehand what you want and how much you're willing to spend on it. Have patience and don't pick quantity over quality

, When buying expensive stuff, you don't have to buy it on the day, you can always come back two or three times to look at it before actually buying it. A good rule of thumb is: if you wake up the next morning and that piece of clothing or that bag is the first thing on your mind, then you really do want it and you should go and get it. Otherwise, it might have been a case of a sudden rush of the blood to the head

,


This does not mean dress like a hobo, or wear a chicken costume. It just means that you don't have to jump on the bandwagon every time someone declares something 'hot', 'in', 'so now' (which is usually a multiple times a fortnight).

, You do not 'have to' buy it now. Buying things just because its in fashion even if it doesn't suit you or you don't like it all that much means that you'll end up with no cash and lots of clothes that you don't look good in and don't wear. Bear in mind that though pink and white polka dot leggings may have seemed like a good idea at the time, in retrospect it might not have been such a smart buy

, Remember that the people who declare something as being 'in', are not gods, they're just people with their own opinions. Definitely pay attention to the trends - they're a good way to get ideas, but develop your own version of the trend. Stick to the clothes you look good in, and know what doesn't work for you. That way you'll make sensible choices that you will wear again and again

Clothing is one of the best ways of expressing yourself.",How to Choose What to Wear (Preteen Girls)," Just take a moment to think over what you're going to be doing that day - are you going to school, or just staying at home? Whatever you're doing that day should influence your choice. If it's pouring rain, you don't want to be stuck in shorts all day.;
, Take some time looking at your wardrobe, to see what you have available to wear. If you don't like some of your clothes or they don't fit, try giving them to your local charity or selling them at a garage sale.

, Pick out something you like. It's best to wear something you feel comfortable in. Don't wear what all the girls are wearing just because it's fashionable. Put on something that you want to, and when you are shopping, think about whether you will actually wear this.

, At this age, everyone's body is going through changes. Going up a size or two could mean that you're getting taller or that your hips are widening. If something doesn't fit you - don't stress over it; instead, get it in a bigger size or go to a teen store instead.

, Don't buy 5 inch (12.7 cm) heels or super-short skirts to look more grown up. Have fun with your style and stay true to who you are. If you are into emo/ goth stuff, make sure you don't purchase anything shocking, or with inappropriate logos. No one wants to see a tween wearing a shirt that says ""Come Play Dying"".

, Try adding a few accessories to it. Don't overdo it, though. If you want to wear new accessories, try finding ones that are inexpensive and the kind you like and would fit you. For your hair, try accessories like headbands, barrettes, or flower hair-ties, or wearing it loose/in a plain ponytail.

, If you want to go shopping, go to places that suit you and are in a clean environment. It doesn't have to be a popular store - remember that nobody will know if you buy a great and inexpensive shirt from a small and ""uncool"" store in your area.

, Show people how you feel, with writing on a t-shirt or a funny picture or comfy clothes. However, it's main purpose is to make you feel more confident and truly recognize the gorgeous women that you are inside.

Bella is explained to have a very floral scent.",How to Recreate a Bella Swan Bedroom1," Here's Bella's room as it is described in the book: The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window... The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew.;
, Bella's room is a mint-ish green color. If you can't find that, choose a sage green. Do not make the color too dark or too light.

, Cream may be the best choice, although white lace will work fine as well.

, It doesn't matter which size bed you have, as long as it has an oak headboard, or no headboard at all. Her bedding is not explained in the book, so anything you'd like is fine.


To produce the ""Bella"" look, keep the bedding designs subtle. Bella does not like too much attention, so it is assumed that she would want a calm bedroom: solid colors or floral designs are fine. (In the movies she has light purple bedding and a nice dark purple floral print and pale lavender pillows.)

, In the book, it says that Bella has a ""second-hand computer"" on her desk. Consider having one of those, or any computer. You should also add a lamp, some picture frames, and maybe even a little cactus since Bella loves her hometown of Phoenix, Arizona.

,, Spritz some floral-smelling perfume or air freshener around your room to keep it smelling fresh.

Empty out your closet.,
Sort your clothes.,
Grab a pile.,
Clean your closet.,
Fill your closet.",How to Arrange Your Closet (Teen Girls Only)," Before you can start organizing your clothes, you are going to have to empty everything out. You can empty the whole closet at once, a shelf at a time or just start pulling clothes out of there. Each method has its pros and cons. If you're going to put all of your clothes onto your bed, make sure that there are no clothes already on it as they could get mixed up. Be messy now and your closet will stay messy. However, keep everything tidy now and your closet is sure to be very tidy later.;
, Firstly, you will need to sort your clothes into piles of what they are. For example, put t-shirts in one pile, jeans in another, jumpers in another, etc. This will help you to see exactly what you have and how many items of clothing you have. Who knows, your favourite t-shirt from three years back might not have been stolen by your best friend after all! This will also help with the next steps and make the tidying process a much funner and quicker one.

, Let's take the t-shirt pile, for example. Now split that pile into three sub-piles. One should be the pile you want to keep. The next pile should have all the clothes you want to hand down or give to a charity. The last pile should have all the clothes that you want to throw away.


The keep pile should have everything that you still want. Make sure that everything in this pile fits you properly and don't keep something just because it looked good when you were seven. If it doesn't fit you, it doesn't belong in this pile. Also, make sure you like everything in this pile. When the rest of your clothes go, this is what you're going to be left with.






The give away pile should have clothes that are too small for you. Since you may be giving these to charity, it's best to keep ripped, torn and stained clothes out of this pile. Even if you're going to hand them down, your little sister may not appreciate a ripped up strip of denim that was once your favourite pair of jeans. Clothes that are in good condition but you don't like can also be put in this pile.






The throw away pile should have clothes that are beyond repair. This includes ripped up clothes, stained clothes, torn clothes and ""those DIY projects that went a little wrong"" clothes. All of these clothes will be thrown away. For this reason, anything that can be given to charity should be removed right away. This pile is strictly for clothes beyond repair.







, With some wipes and a duster, clean out the interior of your closet. You don't want to put all of your newly organised clothes in a dirty old closet, do you? If there's any dust or spider webs still in there, get rid of them now. It's much easier to dust, clean and polish before the clothes go in for obvious reasons. If you were looking to paint your closet, now's the time to do that. Make your closet spotless.

, Now that you definitely know what you're keeping and what you're throwing/giving away, you can start re-filling your closet. Put one type of clothing on every shelf. If it's summer, you won't be needing those jumpers any time soon. Put them on the top shelf. If it's winter, keep your summer clothes on the top shelf. Jeans and t-shirts should stay somewhere near the middle as they're pretty much worn all year round. Socks and underwear can stay somewhere near the bottom of the closet. If your closet has a hanging rail and no shelves, keep all your jeans together, all your t-shirts together, all your jumpers together etc.

In a nutshell, Bella's movie bedroom is very different from the one mentioned in the book.

,,, Again, it does not matter what size bed you have, as long as you have some purple bedding. The exact bedding used for the movies is either sold out or discontinued but you may be able to find the charcoal colored version of the bedding used in the movie. However, any purple flowery bedding will work and keep your eyes peeled for bedding that looks similar to Bella's.


Look on trading and auction sites for old bedding being sold in used but great condition.

, This will allow you to add your awards, pictures, magazine/newspaper clippings, ribbons, etc. Anything that means a lot to you and is shown on paper should be pinned up here for a nice accent to your room.

, Bella's desk is large and oak. She has a black Apple Macbook laptop, as well as an old-style lamp. Macbooks can be very expensive if you are looking for a modern style, so check out other retailers and computer companies for a cheaper laptop if you'd like!

, In the movies Bella has white lace curtains with light blue sheer curtains as well. The colors are perfect considering that blue is one of Bella's favorite colors.

, These extra lights will make your room look great!

,,,,,,,,, Don't use pins either, they will damage the walls. Use Blue-Tack or masking tape so you can move things around and not have any trouble if you want to change the theme.

,, What I did, is I had this sheet of paper (it was actually the back of a front cardboard cover of a notebook) and I just wrote all my favorite quotes of MCR on it. You can use different colors, preferably black and red since they stick out and are the MCR dominant colors. Just stick it on your wall somewhere. It looks really cool too. For examples you can go to photobucket and find some.

Start with the walls.,
Paint your favorite quotes on the walls.,
Get the right flooring.,
Furniture.,
Storage.,
Décor.,
Keep your room clean and organized.",How to Make Your Bedroom Taylor Swift/Music Themed," Any well-designed room starts with walls, because they set off the whole feel of the room. Pick a Taylor-ish color. Calm blue, bright purple, soft pink, or even white. Just make it Taylor-ish. Some stores have scanners where you can scan a picture and it color matches the paint with the closest color. So, you can scan your ""Red"" booklet to get a pretty red or the ""Mine"" lithograph to get the pretty green shade. Mix some glitter in the paint can to add some dazzling features.;
, Try ""I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"", ""This love is difficult, but it's real"", ""You're beautiful, every little piece love"" ""Loving him was red"", and/or ""I'm captivated by you baby, like a fireworks show"". If you like you can add little drawings like a butterfly to the quote. It makes the whole quote stand out.

, Taylor LOVES hardwood floors so that's the best option. If you can't or don't want hardwood floors, a simple, classy white carpet is best. But if you DO go for wood floors, get a pretty rug. Maybe involving birds/butterflies/hearts; Taylor loves that kind of stuff.

, Taylor had a canopy bed with pink/purple velour weaved through the top rungs. Try that. Bedspread: she had a quilt with a bunch of random patches, all in deep shades of red, purple, green, blue, etc. Or on eBay they have custom bedding with her picture on it. And for throw pillows, go with butterflies, sparkly things, or even pillows shaped like iPods/music notes. Have a nice desk, and with a good bookshelf built in you can display all your Taylor merchandise, teddy bears, CDs, books...etc. If you want something besides a dresser, try a stand-up wardrobe. Very classy. She had a stand-up light that had 4 colored lights attached to it available at Walmart.

, Lots of stores have adorable containers made of fabric bins with things like sparkly butterflies and ""love"" written on them. They are adorable. Try to find some of those to store books, homework, or even socks/underwear! You should have a nightstand to hold nail polish, deodorant, perfume (your Wonderstruck, Wonderstruck Enchanted or Taylor by Taylor Swift collection if you have any!) and makeup. Nightstands come in many beautiful varieties, such as Victorian, Western, or simple wood. They are all very Taylor-esque. You can even find tables that have wooden violin-shaped bases. That would fit with the music theme. Your garbage can can have music-note stickers all over it. Have a big shelf on your wall to hold your prized possessions, or even Taylor's Barbie dolls. If you have a broken guitar, take the body without the neck and glue some thick wooden doilies on the bottom for an awesome table. Make sure you use wood glue, and perhaps decorate/paint it. Get creative!

, This is going to take some time! First, string a neat-looking clothesline across the ceiling, against an empty wall or at the bottom of a long shelf. Get cute plastic clothespins in various colors and buy some of Taylor's greeting cards (In the US: Walmart, Ben Franklin, Kmart, American Greetings, Target; in Canada: Zellers, Carlton Cards, Shoppers Drug Mart) and clip them on the clothesline. Then print out sheet music of Taylor's or any other of your favorite songs/artist's and dip the sheets in a pan of coffee. Then bake in the oven for 3 minutes at low heat. They now look antique. Clip these on the clothesline as well. Make a giant collage on your wall of all of your favorite artists: include posters, clothing/perfume ads they endorse, song lyrics written on paper, and magazine clippings. Buy some of Taylor's Wonderstruck car air-fresheners and hang them on doorknobs, curtain rods and bulletin boards. Invest in some rare posters, and get them framed. Get some shadow boxes--let's say you went to the Speak Now tour, so include one or two of your favorite pictures in the shadow box along with some of the confetti that fell during Love Story, your tickets, a bracelet, and a glow-stick, depending on the size of the shadowbox. Buy her Cover Girl makeup (though they test on animals so if you're against that just be aware) and display it all like a beauty shop would. If you have one of her blankets and don't want it on your bed, pin it on your wall and then use safety pins to pin greeting cards, locker posters, tickets etc if you don't want to try the other ideas mentioned above. Lots of online stores have vintage wire mannequins for $40 or less; buy one of these and display one of her LEI dresses or a concert tee if you have one. Put your cowboy boots on shelves. Hang a birdcage from your ceiling. Spray Wonderstruck, or even Fantasy by Britney Spears (one of her favorite perfumes). Take some glitter and throw it in the air; it will settle on tables, floors and rugs and give the whole room a shimmering look. Buy some music-note wall decals and decals of Taylor's quotes. Remember, if you also happen to like Selena Gomez, Carrie Underwood, Scotty Ms.Creery, Owl City, etc also have things pertaining to them as well, because having ONE solid theme is sort of boring. Buy some inflatable guitars/pianos that they use at birthdays. That will add a fun touch to your room. Display all your real instruments, like violins, guitars, flutes, etc proudly. Buy tins of guitar picks just to spread around and add to the vibe. Get a bulletin board to display all your other interests/pictures of family. Pull out articles on Taylor in magazines and put them in a scrapbook and put this scrapbook on your desk. Use ribbons and blank CDs to weave a CD curtain and put it over your real curtains. Pin some vinyl records to your walls or dangle some from your ceiling. Have paper butterflies on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. All of this will give it a very vintage/classy/country/Taylor/girly/music vibe all in one.

, Don't over-do it. Pick six or seven ideas you REALLY like and go with those.

Go to a store such as Gap, American Eagle or Old Navy for some basic, solid-colored shirts.,
Get some thin tops.,
Have some dresses.,
Have some nice tops and tunics.,
Own some shorts for the summer.,
Have one good-quality, simple denim skirt.,
Have at least one pair of simple, good-quality jeans.,
Have at least one sweater or jacket, and one button-down cardigan in a neutral color such as white or black.,
Shoes.,
Accessorize.,
Now that you've bought all your basics, go ahead and splurge on a few fashion tops or a couple of items that can be added to your basics to follow current trends.",How to Create a Basic Stylish Wardrobe As a Teen Girl," Sometimes you can find a great sale for those. V-necks and crew-necks are useful, but try as many styles as you want. Get short sleeved, long sleeved and maybe one or two three-quarter sleeves. Get them in lots of colors, but black and white are a must.;
, Camisoles or thin tank tops are a must for layering and making your outfit look put-together. Get them mostly in solid colors but a couple of prints are great, too. Tank tops such as scoop neck tanks and racerback tanks are a nice addition to your wardrobe, but don't go overboard with them because they aren't as versatile as the must-have cami.

, These are also a must have. First, you should have a simple black dress. Have about 1-2 more ""formal"" dresses and depending on your personal preference, 3-5 casual dresses.

, Tunics, which are basically extra-long tops or extra-short dresses, are not a basic but it is nice to have one to two tunics to wear with leggings or jeans. They make a nice party outfit. You should have at least 1-2 dressy tops that can be dressed up or down with accessories.

, For summer months, shorts are also a basic. You should have at least 2 pairs of shorts, one preferably denim. Have one knee-length or slightly above and one shorter one.

, If you like, high-waisted skirts go well paired with camis or basic tops and are cute, but not a necessity. Longer, flowy skirts are beautiful and feminine, but also not a necessity.

, They are such a basic! Two or three pairs are preferable.

, You will want to have a thicker coat or raincoat or windbreaker.

, Have one good-quality pair of tennis or running shoes. They are definitely a basic and current trends have them paired with everything, even skirts. Have one pair of sandals or heels, also.

, They are the best part of getting dressed and the most fun part of fashion! Even the simplest wardrobe can be expanded with accessories, so load up on them! Jewelry is first. Have at least one pair of basic, good-quality stud earrings for everyday wear. They don't have to be expensive. Also have two or more dangly earrings. Headbands and clips are nice for hair accessories. A colorful scarf from Old Navy or another store is great to add a pop of color to a plain outfit. If you like, hats are also great and come in a variety of cute styles and colors. Have at least one or two. And have at least one basic handbag/purse that goes well with most of your outfits. It helps to have a smaller purse or clutch for formal events where you don't want to be lugging around all your things.

, When they go out of style or wear out, you can rely on your trusty basic wardrobe to literally keep you covered!

Ask yourself this: what rock bands do you/or your teen like the most?,
You might also like to buy more things associated with that band, like a rucksack or t-shirts, or maybe even bed sheets depending on how much money are you willing to spend.

,
Choose strong, dark colors, no more than two, which will be mainly in ""the rock room""!,
Paint the walls one of these colours!

,
Buy and put up the curtains in the other colour than the one you pained your walls with.

,
Buy the anti-frames, the size of the posters you bought!,
If the teen doesn't already have amazing speakers to listen to ""ROCK"" possibly buy new ones, unless the room is styled for older times then may be some records and a record player?

,
Buy the furniture possibly in one of the colours you chose, black, red, or white!

,
Buy everything else in one of these colours!",How to Decorate a Teen's Rock Bedroom," Find some posters of those bands!;
,, For e.g. black and red, navy blue and black, green and black, black and white, orange and black, whatever you think would be suitable. You might also like to choose a style in which the room will be presented ""goth 1700s"" or ""skater 2000s"".

,,, And put them up on a wall, or walls, depending on how many did you buy. Remember that the more the better!

,,, Bed cases, frames, dvd/cd towers, chandelier! And accessories for e.g. brush, combs, keyboard, mobile phone case, candle holders, candles, vases, flowers(if it's girl's room) and more! Possibly replace everything so it's in one of these colours! Either throw out the old items, put in one of the other rooms, sell online, give away to friends or family, or to charity.

Use shelves.,
Get an open wardrobe.,
Buy a dresser.,
Buy a chest or trunk.,
Put a desk in the child’s room.",How to Create Storage in a Kid's Room with No Closets1," Shelves are a magical thing when you’re low on space. Whether you get bookshelves, modular plywood shelves (for clothes, shoes, and collectibles), or wall-mounted shelving, shelves can significantly expand the amount of space your child has to work with. Even old milk crates or vintage wooden boxes can make cool, fun shelving for your kid.Some shelves are designed for use with small cubby containers. These containers allow your child to maximize the amount of stuff they can fit in the shelving.;
, An open wardrobe provides much of the same benefits and functionality as a freestanding clothing rack, but is sturdier and more permanent-looking than a clothing rack. If you don’t think you’ll want to move your clothing rack, or if you have an ideal place for it (like in the recess of a wall) you should consider an open wardrobe for your kid’s room., A dresser, armoire, chifferobe, or any other piece of furniture with sliding drawers or shelves is a great way to create storage in a kid’s room without closets. Dressers and their variations are usually used to create space for clothing. But depending on the size of the furniture and the number of drawers it has, you might be able to divide part of it into space for clothes and part of it for other belongings like toys and games.Ensure the dresser you select for your kid’s room is not too tall for your child. Many home goods stores offer dressers or armoires specially made for children.

, A chest or trunk is basically a large box. The chest or trunk can sit comfortably at the foot of the bed, against a wall, or in the corner. Place toys or off-season clothing in the chest or trunk. Some of the sturdiest trunks can be found in antique markets, but you can find new ones in home goods stores as well.Don’t just use the inside of the trunk for storage. If you expect your child will rarely use whatever is inside the trunk or chest, place books, toys, or games on top of it.
You could also use a spacious suitcase if it is sturdy enough.

, A desk is a great spot to store books, writing materials, and other school supplies. Encourage your child to place their stapler, pens, paper, and pencils in the desk drawers. Get a desk with multiple drawers to maximize its use as a storage space. Place the desk against the wall so that it’s out of the way."
"
Hang a pegboard.,
Buy a clothes rack.,
Hang a ceiling rack.,
Lean a ladder against the wall.",How to Create Storage in a Kid's Room with No Closets2," A pegboard is a common sight in workrooms and garages. But you could install a pegboard in your child’s room to get things up off the floor. You could attach wire-frame baskets, baseball gloves, scarves, and other small objects and apparel from the pegboard.To hang the pegboard from the wall of your child’s room, nail or screw it in place.

, Clothes racks are freestanding metal frames that provide the horizontally-aligned pole that you’d find in a closet. You can then place your clothing on the clothes rack and never miss a closet. Some clothes racks have two bars connecting one end of the rack to the other. This provides you with two levels to hang your child’s clothes on. Depending on your child’s age, they might only be able to utilize the bottom rack. The best racks have wheels on them so they can be easily moved once assembled.
Clothes racks are available at most home goods stores.

, A ceiling rack consists of two chains hung from the ceiling with a bar slung between them. Place each chain about one foot (33 centimeters) from the wall. They should be separated from each other by a distance not greater than the length of the bar you’ll hang on the chains. After hanging the chains from the ceiling, pull the ends up a few inches or centimeters and connect them to a higher spot on the chain using metal clips (for instance, the kind of clips you’d use to connect a shower curtain).The length of chains you’ll need depends on the height of the ceiling and the height of the child. Ensure that your ceiling-hung rack will sit at a height that enables your child to access the rack.
For a simple ceiling-hung rack, place a curtain rod across the chain.
For a more rustic style ceiling-hung rack, place a relatively straight tree branch across the chains. A birch bark branch looks stylish and chic in any room.
You could substitute sturdy ropes for chains.

, A ladder is basically a series of short racks. Your child could fold pants or other apparel over the rungs of the ladder in order to place them out of the way. Any ladder will work, of course, but he best ladder will lend the room a clean, minimalist look. Instead of getting a big industrial ladder made of metal, try a wooden ladder. That way, you could also paint it to match the interior of your kid’s room. Ensure your child understands proper safety protocol before leaning the ladder against the wall for extra storage. If you suspect they will topple the ladder over or cannot understand basic safety precautions, do not install a ladder in their room.

"
"
Place your child’s bed on a storage platform.,
Raise your child's bed.,
Get a loft.",How to Create Storage in a Kid's Room with No Closets3," A storage platform is like a regular box spring, but conceals a series of large empty storage spaces beneath it. The storage platform sits on a solid box bed frame. It saves you the trouble of needing to find storage bins that fit under your child’s bed, since you can place belongings and clothing directly into the storage spaces under the storage platform., If your kid’s mattress is on the floor, or has a solid bed frame that prevents access to the space beneath the bed, replace it with bed risers. Bed risers or a metal frame that allows access to the space beneath the bed can extend the amount of space your child has in their room. Store off-season clothes, toys, or collectibles in low, elongated storage containers and slide them beneath the bed., The next step up from raising your bed a few inches is raising your bed by a few feet. A loft is a raised bed that allows you to store things beneath it. You can get ready-made lofts from many home goods stores, or you could convert an existing bunk bed into a loft by simply removing the bottom bed frame. Under the loft, you could store bookshelves, a TV, or a desk. "
"
Place shelves at the ground level.,
Hang a shoe organizer behind the door.,
Use clear storage bins.,
Partition the room.",How to Create Storage in a Kid's Room with No Closets4," If you place shelves at a low elevation for your child, you will ensure they can easily access their stored belongings. If the shelves are spaced perfectly adjacent to one another, you could lay a long, flat pillow over them and make a seat or sofa above the shelves. The best place to put shelving like this is in front of a window., A shoe organizer is a product of cloth or plastic with several pockets in neat rows that is designed to hold shoes. Over-the-door shoe organizers are a great place to store extra shoes, but you could also use them to store school supplies, artistic materials, or stuffed animals., Clear storage bins allow you to see what’s inside. If your child has toys or clothes that they use only very rarely, they’ll be able to more easily locate and identify them if they’re stored in clear bins.Instead of (or in addition to) clear bins, you could think about getting clear storage bags. These are less sturdy than storage bins, but can be easily squeezed into spaces (like beneath beds or in a narrow gap between two shelves) where storage bins might not work.
Mark your storage bins. If you don’t have clear storage bins, you should indicate what’s in each storage bag or bin on the exterior. You can write directly on them, or stick a piece of masking tape on the bin and write on the masking tape.

, Partitioning a kid’s room means dividing it into one space for living and playing, and one space for storage. You can effectively partition a kid’s room by using room dividers. These thin, freestanding screens originated in East Asia and usually fold out to reveal three or five vertically-oriented strips. Each strip is composed of a thin sheet of paper pressed between two symmetrical pieces of wood. The wood itself is carved into decorative shapes and designs.Ensure your kid understands not to poke the paper on the screen, or to knock them over.
There’s no right way to partition a room. You could divide the room in half, or separate one third from the rest of it. Experiment with different arrangements to find one that pleases your child.
Another way you could partition the room is by using curtains. This is best achieved by hanging curtains right behind your kid’s bed, at a height just below the ceiling. Store your child’s belongings on shelves or in a dresser behind the bed, and pull the curtain closed in front of them.

",How to Have a Room Like Cat Valentine's from Victorious," Cat is a girl, and so is her room. It's white on the top half, and on the bottom half it's pink textured wood. If your wall isn't textured, paint it all pink or lavender. Brighter colors will not work with this room style.;
, Cat's furniture is white, and her bedspread is pink and orange. You can buy a bedspread like this at Pottery Barn Kids, Sears, Pottery Barn Teens, or Bed, Bath and Beyond. Cat's sheets are pink.

, Cat has a wooden floor, but if you want carpet, go for a darker color as this will tie the room together--like dark pink or purple.

Aria's bed is the main feature of her room. Aria's bed is covered in cushions. Each has a different pattern or picture. One has an image of the Statue of Liberty on it. Aria's bed is pushed against her wall which give it a sofa kind of look, which is more laid-back.;
, Aria has a lot of art work covering her walls. She has a notice board that has a vintage looking frame around it. She also has butterflies stuck to the walls. These can be found in general craft stores, or if you want to make them to suit your own tastes, why not get some material and glue and have a go at making some of your own. It doesn't matter whether you put up your own artwork or bought artwork. As long as you like it. You could even print off pictures of things you like from the internet and stick them on your notice board. Aria also has pictures of her friends stuck onto her notice board, so dig out some pictures of you and your friends and hang them up.

, Aria's bedroom consists of a lot of dark colors. Browns, deep plums and reds. There is also a lot of different textures in the room; from leather chairs, textured metallic wallpaper to different fabric pillows. Mix and match things you like, don't worry if you don't think that they will 'go' together, just be bold.

, Aria reads a lot. She has piles and piles of books near her window and a bookshelf over her bed. Display the books you like, don't put them in boxes or under your bed, put up shelves to store your favorite books.

, Aria's room is mainly lit by small lamps. She has one on her desk, on her set of drawers, and on the shelf above her bed. The lamp light creates a romantic and cosy effect. Try to find small lamps to fit into your bedroom, they are usually quite cheap and can sometimes be found in second-hand stores.

, Aria has lots of candles and ornaments displayed in her room. Most have these have been bought while she was traveling with her family. Display any little items you may have that remind you of good things and bring happy memories. You can buy different colored candles with different scents to give your bedroom a bohemian feel, like Aria's.

, Aria's curtains are thin and ruffled which let a lot of natural light into her room. They also add to the 'romantic' feeling of Aria's room. This type of curtain can be found in most regular curtain shops. If you can't find a design you like you can buy fabric you like and make your own curtains. Doing this would make your room look more one-of-a-kind, just like Aria's. Aria's furniture is mostly dark and wooden. If you have light-wood furniture you can buy paint or wood varnish to make the wood darker. This is a lot cheaper than going out and buying all new furniture.

, Aria has a set of tall drawers for clothing storage. She has a mirror on the top of these drawers where she is seen in episodes doing her make-up before going out.

, If you wish, possibly find posters of them or print out pictures and frame them.

, Paint the room green if it's based outside, for example. If you can't paint your room, buy posters and pictures.E.g to make a room like Ron Weasley's from Harry Potter, put up quidditch pictures everywhere, have orange bedding and put 'magic books' all over the room.

, If the character has a desk, buy one! Or renovate yours. If they have a pink lamp, buy a pink lamp.

,,, If you want to go really far, put a yellow brick road on your carpet leading to your bed. Then have a sign saying 'wizard' by the bed.

, Try putting glow in the dark stars on your ceiling. Find newspaper cuttings in your bedroom with alien stories on them, then stick them on your ceiling. Or make everything look like an alien landscape or as if your inside a UFO craft.

,, Other detective stuff (e.g disguise, newspapers and tech) strewn everywhere will also look good. Put huge fingerprints on your wall using any way you can think of.

, The color doesn't matter (as long as it's not bright pink) but your 'Hermione Granger' room should have a desk. You can put a wand or a quill on it, if you have one, along with a journal. A cute addition would be a small cauldron (easily found at any Halloween site or store) to keep your writing utensils in (A small cauldron on a high table would do, because Hermione doesn't want children touching it). It of course needs a lamp. Leave the rest up to your imagination.

, Baby blue or lavender work, if not white.

, You can frame it, or not. Another item you may want to add is a banner of her house, Gryffindor, or some other wall decorations.

, (Blue only works if you are going for Apartment Life. No neon colors (or darks) however, add a few cute, patterned decorative pillows. Make sure it goes nicely with your wall color.

Be responsible for yourself.,
Take care of yourself.,
Wear clothing that makes you feel like your best version of yourself.,
If you wear makeup, make sure it's not making you break out and definitely wash it off every night before bed-- do not get it on your bed!,
Try new things.,
Always come prepared.,
Don't procrastinate, because you'll spend your life anywhere but the present.",How to Be As Perfect As Possible," It'll help you feel better when you wake up. Gives you a little present from yourself to wake up to! Bonus points if the clothes are clean and ironed;);
, Even if you start with just making your bed every day or just a quick laundry pick-up, even if you just do it real quick as you walk in or just before you walk out! It's refreshing to have your own space that you actually get excited to look at.

, Fill out school, work, the days homework or work assignments are due, appointments, meetings, and time with friends or family. Don't overbook yourself! You shouldn't spend all of your time alone, but it's perfectly okay to have some ""me time"", too. Post the schedule on the fridge, or your bedroom door, or just keep it to yourself in a purse or backpack. It's way too easy to feel overwhelmed when you have to mentally keep track of all your plans. So don't! Just jot it down once you think of it. It doesn't take that much time. You'll thank me in two weeks when your life has already been so much more productive and organized and you're not in over your head.

, You want to put your best into what you're presented in life, and you're where you are for a reason.

, It's so easy and prevents conflict! Unless someone has hurt you (at which point you'd privately and calmly communicate it in a healthy way), you should ask yourself why bothers you. Remember, everyone is going through their own experiences every day and you are not in control of their actions, you're in control of your own. On top of being respectfully nice to the people you know personally, try to compliment someone you do not know very well, offer your talents to someone in need, or do favors for people when you can. You never know what it might mean to them!

, Don't drink if you're underage, and if you aren't underage, don't drink too much. Don't smoke cigarettes at all! Never talk about someone behind their back, or bully them.

, Eat healthy and exercise regularly, but remember that it's not about being super skinny or fit, it's about being healthy. Bathe daily. Brush your teeth twice a day, and floss to have good teeth. Wash your face every morning and night to prevent breakouts. Get your hair trimmed regularly, and clip or file your nails to keep them healthy.

, It doesn't matter if you're not seeing anybody else today or if you're seeing everybody. Wear what you feel the best in.

, It will sink into your pores and stay on your pillow and just be a big mess. Just wash your face twice a day.

, It's always good to try something new. Try saying ""yes"" to something new every once in a while. Try new food, clothes, cultures, or even something like shampoos! You never know until you try.

, You don't want to get in trouble with your boss/teacher for not having your supplies, or run into a problem because you didn't bring something you really needed! Throughout the day, make checklists for what you want to remember to keep you in check about what you need to do. Also, always keep a tab on your supplies! That way, you can make a note on what you need to buy. Download an app like evernote to keep track of your whole life with tabs and tags.

, Just try your best every day, make small and big goals and keep track of them. Do it for yourself, and be realistic! You are worth it. You can feel perfect.

, Can you keep the bed you have?) It is important to realize that the rooms on Zoey 101 are a set, so you many not be able to replicate the lighting and some of the accessories seen on the show. If you are in a dorm at a school, there may be certain limitations on what you can change.

, Strategically place each item so that it looks decorated yet clean.

, Make sure you have a realistic amount of money set for each new item you want to buy. Talk to your parents to come up with a plan.

, The furniture on Zoey 101 is modern, sleek, simple, and well suitable for teenagers. A good place to find items like this is large modular furniture and soft furnishings stores that don't charge a lot. All of the dorms have many pillows, duvets, pictures, and rugs throughout the room.

, Paint two-thirds of the wall lilac/lavender. If you can, paint the bottom of the wall a darker purple. Do that for all the other walls.


Or, choose a funky blue, pink, green or orange. The color has a great effect on the room, so choose one that you think suits you.
Do not use wallpaper or a pattern.

, Either get a double bed or a bunk bed and prop the chosen bed up against any wall you please. Avoid placing under a window. Choices could be:

Now, to add your own personal touch.","How to Have a Room Like Zoey, Lola & Quinns"," In Zoey's room, there are 2 shades of purple. Paint all your walls a light purple colour. As a rough guide the words lavender or lilac should be on the paint can. Then, paint the bottom of the walls a darker purple (Royal Purple or another colour close to it is a good colour). Only paint up about 4 feet (1.2 m), and then stop.;
, Gloss it clearly and put silver handles on each side of the door. Then, buy a whiteboard and write ""______'s Room"" like it does on the TV show. Decorate it with badges, buttons, etc. Also, buy some big butterflies and put them on the back of your door as well as some posters.

, If you want to make the bedroom exactly like Zoey's, buy a silver bunk bed and a silver twin bed. This works perfectly if you have 3 people sleeping in the room. If you don't have 3 people in the room, you probably shouldn't buy an extra bed. If you got a bunk bed, put it in the top left corner against the wall. If you got the twin bed, put it in the bottom right and have it sticking out from the wall.

, Each girl has different sheets/blankets/covers/pillows. Follow the directions below to get exactly what you want!


If you want Zoey's blankets (Zoey sleeps on the single bed), you need to find a comforter that has small white, hot pink, light pink, and orange dots on it. Try to find a couple toss pillows with the same pattern. Grab a couple hot pink toss pillows too. Then, buy a fuzzy orange toss pillow and an orange pillow sham for the pillow you'll actually be sleeping on. Top it all off with a big stuffed animal (Zoey's is a blue octopus).
If you want Lola's blankets (Lola sleeps on the top bunk), you need to find a comforter that has hot pink, light blue, green, purple, and white stripes with big white flowers on it. Then buy a few hot pink toss pillows, light pink toss pillows, light blue toss pillows, and purple toss pillows. Try to find toss pillows with sequins and/or ones that are silky, since Lola has lots of those.
If you want Quinn's blankets (Quinn sleeps on the bottom bunk), you need to find a dark green comforter with big, light green dots as well as tiny blue dots on it. Then you'll need a bunch of light green, dark green, and blue toss pillows.

, They have a cool silver one. If you have a computer/laptop, put it on your desk. Buy a cool silver spinny chair for the desk. The desk goes on the left side of Zoey's bed.

, They have a yellow and green couch that has some green and yellow toss pillows on it. They also have a matching, square, green and yellow storage ottoman. The couch goes to the left of the desk, pressed against a wall.

, Zoey has a silver and black bedside table on the right of her bed. It has a light pink table lamp and a hot pink alarm clock on it. They have a rectangular glass table in front of the couch. They also have a funky glass table on the left of the couch.

, The girls have a few different beanbag chairs. They have a fuzzy orange one and a fuzzy yellow one, and I'm sure that they've had purple, pink, and blue ones too.

, This dresser is green and yellow. There's also a black and yellow dresser pressed against the wall opposite the couch.

,, The girls have long, flowy, orange curtains as well as long, flowy, yellow curtains on their windows. They also have multicoloured beaded curtains over each window.

,,, Buy some in hot pink, yellow, orange, etc.

, They have some pop-art pictures with vibrant colours, as well as posters of bands, and even one of a monkey. Pop-art pictures are very popular in their rooms.

, Fill the dressers with your own stuff. As some ideas, the Zoey 101 girls have some science stuff (Quinn), some makeup, jewelry, CDs, colourful boxes, books, wallets, picture albums, little plants, and some little trinkets covering their dressers.

Don't blend in: Stand Out Dress in your own personal style (go back a step for more info).,
Just love yourself and everyone else will see your awesomeness.

",How to Be Awesome (for Girls)," Practice starting good conversation. Humour makes people comfortable, and will help you form bonds with others. To form closer bonds, you can hold a sleepover or have a party with people you'd like to get to know better. Parental consent comes first, though.;
, Everyone's different and everyone is unique. Also, don't change in order to fit in. If the popular girls are wearing something amazing, that does not mean you have to have the exact same thing to be awesome.

, Don't just sit there and be lazy, stand around with a racket occasionally. Have fun while you're being active or playing sports. Getting active will help keep you healthy. Regular exercise can improve your mood and relieve stress, ultimately making you a happier person.

, Ask for help if you need it. It's okay to get a bad grade once in a while, as long as you tried your best. It is awesome to get good grades, so pay attention in class and put in the effort, especially math! Math and science aren't just subjects for boys.

, Skills take time to develop and effort to master. Different skills and talents are good conversation starters. People will soon be asking you to teach them new skills and vice versa. This can be in any field: gymnastics or sports in general, art, music, trivia, computer programming—you name it. Make sure to choose something you enjoy doing, not something everyone else wants to see you do. You can show off your skills once in a while, but don't be a big show-off otherwise people won't like you anymore.

, Just be their friend, enjoy their company and they'll appreciate you for it. And remember not to gossip or whinge to them; it makes them feel awkward and they'll ignore you.

, You don't have to wear super expensive designer clothes all the time, but be cute. That doesn't mean that you go out of your way to look sleazy; comfortable and stylish is the goal.

, A good way to do that is to mix styles. For example, you can be sporty and girly at the same time, or sophisticated or casual at the same time; run with it. Don't be too wild!

, Make sure your style matches your personality: don't wear clothes or dress in fashions you don't feel comfortable in. Have your own ""signature"" look that no one else has.

Try to think of a quote that inspires you or sums up your personality. It can be funny or insightful. Think about a line from a movie, book, or song that you relate to, or post a silly pun.

, Choose either a portrait-style picture or one that shows you in your element or a beautiful location. If you have a photo of yourself standing in front of a lake in the mountains, that's the one you want to use. Desaturate the picture to give it a vintage feel.


If you're a girl, style yourself wearing a beanie or a floppy hat. Wear your regular glasses or sunglasses (bonus if the frames are round). You want your hair to be loose and wavy if possible, or opt for a popular top-knot and forget the hats. Makes sure your makeup is on point — consider a bold lip color.
If you're a guy, you may want to rock the beanie look as well. Glasses and a beard are a must. Wear a flannel or a vintage t-shirt.

Put your bed in the middle of one of the walls, but not the one with a window.,
Find accent pillows.,
Look for a funky headboard.,
Buy a few sheer curtains for your windows.,
If you use a track for this, it is easier to maneuver that way, but is less 'free-spirit', you can choose.

Many stores have placards with words on them, like 'Peace' , 'Love' and 'Laugh'.,
You can make these as well, it saves money and makes it even more special.

Find a chandelier with jewels or pieces hanging off of it.,
A basic desk may seem counter-productive in this room, but a small white desk looks great here.,
Look for wall accents, like wrought-iron flowers or butterflies.,
Buy a white or 'birch effect' shelf and fill it with junk and keepsakes.,
A few shelves placed throughout the room is also pretty practical...

Know the Instagram hipster uniform.,
Use hashtags and emojis thoughtfully.,
Elevate your selfies.,
Post once a day.",How to Be an Instagram Hipster2," The essential hipster clothing items include: a beanie, Herschel backpack, Pendleton blanket, flannels, hiking boots with wool socks and, of course, skinny jeans.


Don't forget eyewear. Try over-sized plastic frame glasses, Buddy Holly glasses, Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and round sunglasses. Pick vintage items over mainstream labels, and layer with cardigans, sweaters, and jackets.
Women should also invest in leggings, cute vintage dresses, and sun hats or ""floppy hats.""

, Going crazy with the hashtags can help you get more followers at first, but once you've started building a following, try to dial it back. Popular hipster hashtags include #liveauthentic #livefolk #exploremore #fromwhereistand #wildernessculture and #kinfolk. These are hashtags that are used and searched for by other hipsters, and can also get the attention of hipster publications like Folk Magazine and Kinfolk.


See if you can come up with your own hashtags that other people might use, like the #chasinglight hashtag.
Try using a combination of emojis instead of a text caption.

, Never, ever, ever do the ""duck lips"" pose. It's unflattering and definitely not hipster. Get someone else to take your photo whenever possible, as selfies can come off a little narcissistic or desperate.


If you do post a selfie, make sure it's interesting. Try only showing a portion of your face, or using a dramatic filter.

, You don't want to overwhelm your followers with 15 pictures one after the other, but you also want to have a presence in their feed. Choose your best, most striking photos, edit them carefully, and post only one or two each day.


Stretching out posting photos from a short trip has the added bonus of making it appear you are taking a much longer vacation. People will wonder how you pull off traveling all the time –don't you work or have school?
Use a free service Iconosquare or SimplyMeasured to find out the optimal time to post for the most likes, comments, and views.

Make it your own.",How to Be an Instagram Hipster3," Many hipster photos show people outside, enjoying the majesty of the outdoors. Brewing coffee at your campsite, wrapped in a Pendleton blanket; standing on a foggy mountain top; hanging your legs over a precipice; or standing in front of a waterfall, your back to the camera — these are all photos that will inspire FOMO in your followers.


Search for scenic hikes in your area, or check out nearby locations tagged by other Instagram users.

, Have a friend strike a pose in front of some street art, like a brightly painted wall. Center the photo, capturing your friend either from the waist-up or full-body. Make the color pop by adjusting the temperature (or warmth) and increasing the saturation. Skip the filter.


Look for crazy wallpapers to use as the background for portraits, too.
Take a photo of just a hand holding something in front of the wall, such as an ice cream cone or a pineapple.

, Visit a coffee shop with great lighting and take a photo of your latte art, your croissant, and the dog-eared paperback you're reading (make sure you shoot this from directly above the items). Or take a photo of your collection of succulents, carefully moved into a pleasing arrangement.


Try the ""all white shot."" Place something in front of or on a white wall. If you don't have great lighting, lower the temperature or warmth and increase the exposure.
Arrange a collection of similarly colored flowers, or fall leaves that gradually transition from red to yellow. Place them in a line or a grid, then snap and edit so the colors really pop.

, These are all ideas to get you started, but if you are taking picture of things you love and care about, people will respond. Use these suggestions as a springboard for your own amazing photos.


If you're new to photography, sign up for a class and learn about the essentials of taking a good photo, like framing and lighting.

Use foundation if you need it, however most ulzzangs use bb-cream. ALWAYS use foundation or bb-cream that contain spf because ulzzang are generally pale. Remember it's not only the females that wear make-up, the males do too!!

, Most ulzzangs use Photoshop, and/or wear circle lenses to have the effect of larger pupils. Photoshop your images to make your eyes bigger (not to an extreme) and/or change your eye color. This is one of the fundamentals of being a ulzzang. But if you don't need Photoshop, don't use it.

, Some Ulzzang's buy from online shopping stores. Try yesstyle.com, and asianfashion.com for some ideas on what they wear. Or you can look at the online stores most of them run to get a better idea of what they are wearing.

,
Try to make indie friends, tomboy friends and guy friends.",How to Be an Indie Tomboy," You can do almost anything when it comes to hair. Side-swept bangs are really indie and can be tomboyish, too. Just decide what you feel comfortable with and what suits your face shape. Stay natural when it comes to hair colours—its not very tomboyish nor indie to have crazy blue hair with red and neon pink streaks in it.;
, Wear little or no makeup because neither style is big on makeup—they're both natural styles.

, A t-shirt paired with a vest or hoodie worn over is a great example, or wear a babydoll tank top with an unbuttoned shirt over the top. Pastel colours are very nice.

, Baggy pants are very tomboyish but not very indie, so try light or dark-washed skinny jeans—maybe ripped ones, or even high-waisted shorts.

, Fortunately, it's pretty hard to go wrong with shoes. Avoid heels, pink shoes or styles that everybody else wears. Converses in dark colours or red are good unless they are very trendy where you live.

, Pink dangling Hello Kitty earrings don't go well with the indie tomboy style. Long necklaces and scarves are very indie but don't go overboard with these, as too many accessories can make you look preppy and girly.

,, Above all, be yourself and don't try to be someone that you are not!

Keep your opinions closer to your chest.,
Choose actions that you, as an introvert, enjoy, even if people accuse you of ""going to the dark side."",
Be silent as much as you want, but do speak when spoken to and seem friendly: you don't want to give the impression of being rude.",How to Be a Very Cold and Quiet Person," There are times to talk, but if introverts are untrue to their natures and try to appear talkative or even loud and boisterous, such behavior will not help to reveal an introverted personality. Introverts tend to be quietly emotional and romantic (in the literary sense) in their thoughts, soft-spoken and thoughtful.


Learn to pause and think before speaking. Consider whether that comment is really necessary. It is surprising to realize how many fewer words are necessary, and that it is easier to be quiet.;
, Be courteous, but stop choosing actions based on the sole criteria of whether those actions will please others. Learn to set boundaries on your time and availability so that others become aware of your limits.

, Having friends is emotionally healthy, but to reveal and activate your introversion, slowly learn not to be around too many friends more than is minimally necessary.


If there are things that truly need to be said out loud, organize those thoughts so as to say them in the briefest and clearest manner.
In school, a person who normally sits (uncomfortably) in the middle of a big crowd of people, might be more comfortable in the back area of the room, either alone or with fewer people. If it is mandatory to sit at a crowded table, try to choose a seat on the end of the table and not in the center.

, If you have naturally stoic behaviors, begin to accept them and allow them to reveal themselves.

,, When lining up for class or just hanging out with friends, lean against a wall with your arms crossed or in your pockets, one leg halfway up, resting on the wall. This body language reveals a distanced attitude.

, If something seems a little bit amusing, accept yourself if you naturally want to react with a mere grin or smirk. Note, however, that if you smirk as if to criticize others or to indicate that 'that was dumb,' then you will need to be ready to take the consequences from those who may infer that you are disdaining them or their behavior. It is as inappropriate to refuse to accept the honest feelings, actions, or words of others as it is to refuse to accept your own honest feelings, actions, or words.


Being an introvert does not ever include cruelty to others; therefore be very careful not to project a spiteful or even bullying state of mind. So even though it is advisable not to laugh or smile more than you truly want to, the legitimate converse of that maxim is that, even though laughing may make people think you're an extrovert, being yourself is more important than basing your actions on the opinions of others, so laugh if you want to, but not if you don't want to.

, Don't concern yourself with how other people interpret your actions. Even though you are trying to come out as an introvert, there is no reason to stop doing things that you enjoy; even though other people may see your actions as inconsistent with introversion, and it may take them longer to understand the characteristics of your true and newly revealed self.

, Learn to recognize your honest reactions to things (this is where knowing yourself comes in handy), and decide which reactions you want to keep and which ones you want to change. Maybe you totally hate watching the footy (that's soccer in America), yet every now and then you sit down with your family and really get into it. Inconsistency is perhaps the hardest step to hold onto, because others are calling you unpredictable and suggesting that you are a big ball of confusion, but if you work hard, you can get past these false accusations and just be who you want to be, even if it is inconsistent with other actions of yours.

, Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and Alexandre Dumas Pére have all written great books. Books like these will increase your vocabulary and awareness of the world, also. Your friends may rather skip rope or go play football or swim or ice skate. If you must do these activities with them, invest yourself in the activities only as much as you really want to. Even playing on rafts or using a bar to skate don't seem like things an introvert might do, but if you want to do those things, do them. One benefit of being a bit more withdrawn than your peers is that it may make you appear more mysterious. Sometimes that's fun.

, If talking about your opinions and feelings are going to stir up trouble with most others, then don't talk about them except maybe to very close friends and family. Once again, when people do not know your feelings and opinions, they may see you as fascinatingly mysterious.

, Learn to journal and write. Poets do delightfully mysterious things. Poetry is a great way to let your emotions flow.

, If you want to give off any impression at all, it's best to seem mysterious which means you might catch the eye of someone a bit sexy, give a sultry look and then look away, slipping into the shadows. That person will definitely want to chase you!

This can also be a good opportunity to ask for a helping hand when moving time comes.


Don't attempt to move especially large furniture by yourself. If you're going to try to move a big dresser or a bed, you need at least one other person to help you, and preferably more.;
, One easy way to move bulky or cumbersome items easily if they aren't on casters is to put them on sliders or ""furniture feet,"" which allow you to slide the furniture along the ground more easily, without worrying about tipping. These are available at most housewares and home repair stores.


You can also make your own sliders from blankets, frisbees, sheets, towels, or old carpet samples.
Use hard plastic sliders for carpeted floors, and padded sliders for hard wood. Depending on whether you have hard wood floors or carpeting in your room, sliders can be more or less effective. They're not necessary in every case.

, Before you start moving anything around, take some time to declutter your space. Get rid of trash and anything that doesn't belong in your room, including drinking glasses and other kitchen stuff, other people's belongings, and towels and other things.


This might take a while, but it's an essential step and you should let it. If you want to spend a few days going through your desk and your bookshelf, tossing out unwanted old papers and materials, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. Be judicious and cut down on your stuff.
Tidy up your clothes and separate your clean clothes and dirty clothes. You can evaluate whether or not you need and have space for additional organizational space later.
Try to keep only the minimum of things you'll actually need to use regularly, to keep out in your room. Everything else, either get rid of if you have no sentimental attachment to it, or place the objects into storage and keep it out of sight.

, A newly rearranged room should be clean, so it's pretty typical to start by thoroughly cleaning your space, then taking some time to clean under and around the furniture that you moved later. Rearranging, organizing, and cleaning usually all blends together into one big project.


Clean mirrors, vacuum, wash the floor, do a thorough dusting, and clean all the surfaces and interiors of the furniture that you're planning on moving. Start by cleaning high, sweeping out the corners of the room. Do the floor last.
Alternatively, some people may prefer to start a bigger mess and clean up later. Depending on how you like to work, just jump right into reorganizing and get your room messy, then worry about doing the deep clean after you've got everything in place.

, Now that you've got your space uncluttered and clean, start planning where and how you'd like your room organized. Measure your furniture to make sure it will fit in the spaces that you want to move it, before you've done so. Read the next section for tips on reorganizing your furniture.


For some people, it may be helpful to draw a visual layout of how you want your room to look. That way, if you don't like it you can erase it and start over. Measure everything to make sure it fits. You don't want to waste all your energy only to find that things don't fit.
You might consider measuring all the walls and the areas in your room, as well as the furniture, and draw your plan to scale. Or, you can just get moving if you're more of a hands-on thinker.

, Depending on the current orientation of your room and your furniture, it's sometimes easiest to go with an easy axis rotation, shifting things over one ""position"" or one rotation, and not trying to move mountains. If you're looking for a little change, but aren't quite sure how to make it happen, this can be a good, fast, and simple way of doing so.


For example, if your bed is parallel with the door or window, just turn your bed so that's its along the perpendicular wall. An easy left or right turn with the bottom edge of the bed should work.
Pick a corner of each piece of furniture and keep it in the same place. Imagine all the different orientations of the piece, just by rotating it in one or the other direction.

, Some people hate waking up with the sun beating into their eyes, while others like to let the sun ease them into the day. Others may hate the sun in their eyes later in the day, when trying to sit at a desk and work, while others may like evening light. This is totally up to your choice and preference, but it's good to imagine how light comes into your room through the windows and how to orient your furniture around that light.


You might consider marking the strongest light in the morning and evening on the floor or the walls with some painters tape as you're moving stuff around, so you'll be able to remember where the light is, even if it's cloudy or dark.
You can also use the spacing of the windows to dictate how you organize your furniture. You might line up your bed, shelves, or other furniture with the outline of the windows, or the space between the window and the wall.

, Using furniture wisely, you can create and maximize the amount of space in your room by reorganizing, or you can separate a larger room by using furniture to partition off a corner or other space in the room.


If you have a desk or dresser, you an save wall space by putting your desk at the foot of your bed (if the desk doesn't have a back). This is excellent for smaller rooms in which you need to have sleeping and working space.
If you have a larger room, use your desk or some free-standing book shelves to partition off a separate space from your bed and create an office or working area.
Curtains, scarves, tapestries, or drapes can also be a great way of partitioning off your bed or creating other small sitting areas in a bedroom. Hang cloth from the ceiling and the corner of the wall with tacks to experiment with different areas and see what you like best.

, How do you come into and go out of your room? What do you want accessible to you at different positions throughout the room? It's important to consider the practical elements of reorganizing your room, as well as the aesthetic elements. You'll have to have a certain amount of open space so you can move openly, and preparing for that space is just as important as thinking of where you want the furniture.


If you have people come into your room regularly, keep the bed on the opposite side of the room from the entryway door, so you don't have to sit on or around your sleeping space, when you're hanging out.
If you have a rack for shoes, is there space for it near the door? You'll be able to access things easier, the closer they are to where you'll need them.
Where are ""tuckable"" places in the room? Under shelves, your bed, and in closets are great places where you can slide organizers to keep your room free of clutter on the floor, making it easier to get around.

, Be sure to keep all passageways and things that you'll need to access free of obstruction. Can windows be opened, curtains and shades be drawn, and doors be used freely? Make sure that moving your furniture around doesn't affect the function of any of your furniture, forcing you to open a desk drawer so it bangs into your bedpost.

, It's common to position desks and chairs facing the door, with your back to the wall and your face toward where people will likely be entering. This tends to help people feel more at ease and aware of their surroundings, and it makes it very easy to greet anyone who knocks on the door.

, When you start thinking about how to move things around, it's a good opportunity to upgrade the storage options you have available to you, and see whether or not there's an opportunity for consolidating or adding new space savers to your area. Think about whether or not you could incorporate any of the following storage options:


New shelving units
Plastic organizers or tubs
Decorative baskets
Trash bins and clothes hampers
Mason jars on a windowsill

, One easy way to change the color scheme or brighten up your space quickly, easily, and drastically is to just change the curtains to a new color or style. This can alter the light that comes into your room in subtle ways and can also make your space appear new, without having to change much.


You could also just take the curtains down in your room, if you want some more light in your room.

, Before you move anything, it's good to consolidate all the little stuff that might get jostled, broken, or lost while you're moving furniture. Take the same things on your desk or dresser, like lamps, pens, and picture frames, and move them to another room in the house momentarily. To avoid them falling or adding more weight, gather them all in a large bin and take them out of your room.

, In some cases, especially if you've got a crowded room, it's better to take the furniture out and get the room empty, or close to empty, before refiling it in a new way. This will also give you the option of cleaning the floor more thoroughly, underneath your bed, dresser, and other areas that might not have been cleaned since whenever you last rearranged.

, Start by placing the biggest thing in your room, which will usually be your bed, but you might have a large dresser or desk that rivals your bed in size. If something else is in the way, move that a little out so you can move the other furniture in.


Once your first piece is in place, take the thing you just moved out of the way and move it to where you want it. If something else is there, do the same thing you did before and continue this until everything is in its place.
Another way to organize is picking a corner of the room that's farthest from the entry door and building back toward the door from there. This will keep the entryway relatively uncluttered while you're rearranging stuff.

, Once you've got the biggest stuff in place, continue bringing in more stuff and filling in around, according to your new plan. Make sure you like each piece in it's new place before you build around it, so you don't have to start all over, if you don't like something.


If you move your desk in and start loading up the drawers again, it would be annoying if you had to take it all out because you're unsatisfied with the desk, once you get the dresser in place. Don't decorate quite yet, get the big stuff in place first.

, Bring all the little things back into your room and put them where they belong, once you've got the major stuff settled. Do other cleaning, as you see the need for it.


If you think your room needs a whole new bedspread and curtain situation, check out the article Decorate your new room for tips about redecorating.

That means old papers, used pens and pencils, and random things that you can't remember what they are for. If you don't know why it's there, get rid of it.Put books on a bookshelf. Books are big, so they take up a lot of space. This will give you extra room on your desk, and you'll always have a place to put your books when you are finished with them.;
, Once you have cleared off your workspace, wipe it down to get rid of crumbs, dust, any other dirt still around. Check with your parents if you need some kind of special cleaner, like if you desk is made of a certain kind of wood., Read everything you've got, and figure out if you need to keep it or not. If it's something you need to keep, put it in one pile. If not, throw it away.If you have lots of things you don't need, throw them away, not into drawers. If you have lots of drawers, it can be tempting, but that only moves the mess into the draw, not get rid of it.

, These are the things you use regularly, like notebooks, pens, a calculator, or anything else that you might use everyday. You will need to find a space on your desk for them. For everything else, you'll get to decide if you have space on the desk for it, or if it needs to go somewhere else., Once you have figured out what doesn't need to be at your desk, make sure you have a place to put it. Maybe you have some extra shelf space, or a closet. Ask your parents if you don't have a good place in mind. Just make sure you remember where that stuff is, so you can find it when you need it.

, Once you have figure out what should be on your desk, and where to put the stuff you need but not regularly, it is best to throw out everything that is left. This is going to be old papers, used pens, or other garbage that you don't need at your desk., This means the television, electronic devices, or anything else that could cause you to look at something that isn't work. A desk is a space for working, and you don't want your attention focused on other things., This can be a big one showing each month, or a weekly planner. It can be a paper one to hang, or even an electronic one. Make sure you have it somewhere you'll always be able to see it.Put everything on your calendar.

If you wait, you'll just forget.Make sure that stuff you'll need your parents for, like places they'll need to drive you or things that need their permission, get on to their calendars as well., You'll need to be able to see what you're doing at the desk, so make sure you have plenty of light from windows, lamps, and other lights. If you don't have good lights near your desk, get a lamp., Things you write with, pens and pencils, should be together so you know where to look when you need one. Folders and notebooks can go together too to keep all your papers in one place. This will help when you need to find something, because all of your pens or notebooks will be in the same place.For folders and notebooks, keep subjects together too. You don't want to open a folder for math when you're trying to do your science homework.

, Once you have figured out the papers you want to keep, you'll want to organize them by what needs to get done. Put all the stuff you need to do in one pile, to make sure you do it, then put the stuff that is finished into another. Maybe you give the finished stuff to your parents to check, or maybe you'll just put it in your bag to take to school the next day. This will help keep things you have to do together so you remember to do them., Use these to help remind you where things are, and where they should go. You can use a fancy label-maker or just some masking tape with a marker., Of course you're going to need to write things down, but your pens and paper don't need to be plain or boring. Look for pencils with fun erasers, or pens that come in different colors. Even small stacks of post-it notes can be different colors to help you stay organized, or just to look fun and different.


Just make sure you have pens that write in blue or black ink. Many teachers require it. You can have other colors, but make sure that if you need it, you have it.

, To help you keep your stuff in the right place, you'll want some organizers. You'll need places to hold your papers and pens, and small boxes to hold other items like paper clips or rubber bands. Brightly colored folders and cases, even little jewelry boxes, are perfect for keeping stuff together.You don't even have to buy new things. Cut a few cereal boxes in half, they are the perfect size for holding papers, while old cans (cleaned and with the labels taken off, of course) can hold pens and pencils. You can then paint these things, add stickers, or do other things to make them more personal to you., There are a variety of chair designs around, so you'll want something functional, but it can be all kinds of colors, with a different back, or maybe one that wheels or swivels around. Your chair is part of your desk, and while it needs to be functional so you can get work done, that doesn't mean it can't be comfortable or look great.You may want your chair to be adjustable for height. If it's a really good chair, you won't want to have to get rid of it just because you grew slightly, and which makes it less comfortable to sit in., Some bright, new colors can make even an old, beat up desk look brand new. It's especially fun to do it yourself, as now you can really feel like the desk really belongs to you, something you helped create.


If you're feeling really ambitious, and your parents are willing to help, you can think about painting your room a new and different color. You are getting older, and not everything needs to stay the same as when you were a little kid. If you don't want to paint the whole room, think about maybe just the area around your desk., You can decorate more than the outside of the desk. Some paint or stickers on the inside of drawers can make even opening them interesting. If you are really creative, you can use different decorations to help you keep organized as well, like using different colors or symbols for different subjects, rather than writing out names.

, This is your desk, and you can always put items on it that reflect you and stuff you like. These items should be small (you need that room for your work), but can be anything that expresses you, or makes you happy when you look at it. Pictures of you and your friends, trophies for sports and other activities, or even a small stuffed animal help make the desk unique to you.

Everyone has something they want to change about themselves, and that's ok, but don't let it ruin you. Don't give up hope if you can't seem to be happy or confident in yourself. Don't be a wallflower; get out and dance. Don't worry.


Feel okay about stepping out of your comfort zone. Be yourself, and even though you might feel like its fake, it won't be.

, In real life, the outgoing girls are the popular ones, not the ones everyone hates, so be nice, and people will appreciate your social skills. Wave to people you know in the hall, hug your friends, and smile at everybody else. Make small talk with people who you kind of know, but aren't really close too.

, One way to be a happy teen is to have friends and be social. Spend more time with people. Go out to eat, or go spend a day outside in the world meeting new people. Join a sports team or extracurricular activity and make a new friend. Don't be afraid to take chances; if you get yourself out there and take every opportunity you are given, you won't regret it.


Volunteer. It's a great way to help people and to do great things.






Make eye contact and smile. If you look down and frown, no one will want to talk to you and might think something is wrong.







, Follow the trends and always dress nicely and look presentable. Wear clothes that look good on you, and above all, keep it classy.


Make your hair nice everyday! No one likes a messy hairstyle or smelly hair. Style your hair in a way that suits your face. Get you hair trimmed every four-eight weeks, or highlight or cut your hair to go for a new look.







, Use shampoos and conditioners made for your hair type, and shower every other day. Shower with a hydrating body wash. Brush your teeth regularly. Always make sure you shave and put on makeup that suits your face. Get checkups and of course get braces and teeth whitenings.

, Find something you're truly passionate about and people will respect you for it. Think about what you want to do with your life, and live your dream.

, If your parents don't give you an allowance then get a stylish job to save up some cash. Try to pass on the gritty ones such as fast-food restaurants and get something that will make your friends jealous and make working seem cool.

, If you’re bored of your plain, white ceiling fan, try adding some colored Washi tape. Create designs with the tape on the fan for an awesome pop of color whether the fan is off or on.Before adding the tape, make sure to remove the fan blades and clean for dust and dirt.

, Ceilings are often overlooked while decorating, but there’s no reason why yours should be anything but awesome. You can create your own galaxy, right in your own bedroom, using a variety of different materials, including stick on stars, star decals, splatter glow paint and twinkly lights.Double check that whatever materials you’re using glow in the dark. Otherwise, you won’t be able to see your stars while you’re falling asleep.
For maximum impact, position your constellation directly over your bed.

, Changing up your wall color is one of the easiest ways to reinvent your room. But when it comes to painting, try thinking outside the box. Instead of just slapping on the color haphazardly, try one of these tricks to transform your wall space:


Add a statement wall. Statement walls are great because they allow you to experiment with bolder and more interesting colors than you might use if you were painting an entire room. Add a statement or accent wall right behind your bed for a more powerful punch.
Add a pop of color in an unusual place. Paint the back of a door or the inside of a drawer a bright color. This will make for a fun surprise when you open it up to reveal the contents.Experiment with chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint is easy to apply and is a super fun way to decorate and also to ingest some personality into your space. Invite your friends over to draw murals on the wall or to sign their names.
You don't have to paint alone! Invite your friends over for a painting party. The work will go by quicker and every time you hang out in your room, you'll be reminded of how great your friends are for helping you.

, Who says walls have to be painted? Try experimenting with wallpaper for one of your accent walls. If you live in a place that doesn’t allow permanent changes (like paint or wallpaper) look online to find non-permanent wallpaper.Wall decals and wall stickers are also a fun, non-permanent option to give your room some texture and visual interest.

, If you have an old desk or chair that looks a little shabbier than you’d like, try transforming it using DIY methods. Sand it down and paint it another color or try reupholstering it. There are many tutorials online that can take you through the steps to make these affordable and easy changes.

, There are lots of good reasons to change up your furniture arrangement: it helps protect your floors, it allows you to capitalize on seasonal lighting, but most of all, change is good!Changing the furniture in your room will allow you to see your room as a brand new space.


If you have a small room and are looking to gain some additional storage space, try propping your bed up on risers. Risers can be purchased online or in most home goods stores.

, The enemy of organization is clutter. To pare down on clutter, you’re going to need to go through all of your belongings, starting with your clothing. Take stock of what you currently own and give away anything that you don’t wear or need.


Don’t keep something that doesn’t fit just because you think you might fit into it later. Get rid of it, and if you end up gaining or losing weight, buy something new to celebrate when that happens.To more easily track what you use or don’t use, every time you wear something in your closet, turn the hanger around so it’s facing the other way. At the end of the year, give away anything that you haven’t worn.
Add additional lighting to your closet so you can see your outfit options more clearly.Don’t throw the clothes away. Most thrift stores allow you to donate used clothing and there are some that will buy gently used goods from you. If you don’t feel like doing that, try organizing a clothing swap with some of your close friends. You’ll get rid of things you don’t wear anymore and will be able to add a few new (free!) additions to your wardrobe.
Take the door off your closet so you’ll be more likely to hang up your clothes, rather than throwing them directly on the floor., You’ll never feel truly comfortable in your own space if you don’t know where any of your stuff is. Buy containers and label them, so you’ll be able to keep track of your belongings more easily.To organize your jewelry, try hanging or displaying it. This will keep it from tangling and will also serve as a fun decoration for your room.
Try an unorthodox solution for storing your sunglasses, like hanging them from a coat hanger.

, Once your room is arranged and laid out the way you want it, it’s time to add those personal touches. Decorating with photos is great because it’s inexpensive and you’re surrounding yourself with people and places that are meaningful to you.


Use Washi tape to create picture frames. The tape is cheaper than framing the pictures and since it’s not permanent, you can change up the designs and picture placement to fit your mood. Plus, you don’t need to make any holes in your wall!, Art seems like it should be expensive, but there are many affordable options to buying art. Try using sites like Etsy or Ebay or, if you have artistic friends, commission them to create something especially for you.


Hang an oversized map and mark off where you’ve already travelled in the world.Buy used records in a thrift store and frame and display them on your walls.

, Corkboards are very inexpensive and can be purchased online and in most office supply stores. Corkboards are incredibly useful and effective because they allow you to keep track of and display nostalgia that you might otherwise lose.


Try pinning tickets or programs from concerts that you and your friends have been to.
Make sure to position everything on your corkboard neatly so it’s visually interesting and not messy and distracting.

Avoid usual places where siblings will look first:

In your dresser
Under your couch

Use the ladder.,
Install stairs if you want more versatility.,
Add a rail to the ladder or stairs.,
Install a nightlight.",How to Get Up to the Top Bunk of a Bunk Bed1," There are bunk beds of many sizes, shapes, and styles, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find one that fits your room. You should place the bunk bed in a corner of the room, with walls against two sides. In addition, you should keep the bed away from any ceiling fans or hanging light fixtures. Following these tips will make the bunk bed safer., Crawling over a mess on the floor or around the bunk bed can make climbing to the top dangerous. You don’t want to trip over anything on your way up! Be sure to keep toys, furniture, books, clothes, etc. cleared away from the bunk bed., The typically approved method for getting to the top bunk is to use a ladder. Standard models of bunk beds will include a ladder or approved equivalent. Follow all instructions for installation and use. Know that using a ladder incorrectly, or a unapproved method for getting to the top bunk can cause injury or death.Make sure that the bunk bed ladder is bolted down according to the manufacturer’s instructions before you attempt to climb up., All approved bunk beds should have guardrails around the top bunk. The exact construction of these guardrails will vary depending on the manufacturer of your bunk bed. General guidelines suggest that the guardrails should be no less than five inches higher than the bunk’s mattress.If your guardrails have slats, make sure that any openings between them are not so wide that you could become trapped.
There should be an opening at the ladder or stairs that will vary between 22 and 25 inches wide, depending upon your (or your child’s) age.

, Place your feet one at a time on each successive rung of the ladder, and move upwards toward the top bunk. As you reach the top, put your hands on the bed. Once your feet reach the top of your ladder, you should end up in a crawling position. All you have to do then is crawl into bed.


To climb down the ladder, swing your feet onto the top rung. Make sure that you are facing the rungs. Then, move down the rungs of the ladder, moving one foot at a time.
Move slowly and be careful not to catch your foot on a rung as you go up or down., Some bunk beds can have stairs as a method for getting up to the top bunk. These will take up more floor space than a ladder, but can make climbing up and down easier. Use them as you would any other stairs until you reach the top stair, which should meet the top bunk. Then, all you have to do is crawl into bed.Stairs can offer more decorative options. For instance, drawers can be hidden in each stair for extra storage.

, You can make it easier to climb up your bunk bed’s ladder or stairs if you install a hand rail. These may be included with or offered as an option with some models. Once installed, the rail will give you something extra to hold onto as you climb up and down., Climbing up and down from a top bunk is one of the primary dangers associated with bunk beds. It can be especially hard to see what you are doing in the dark. Installing a nightlight near the bunk bed’s ladder, however, can make it much easier to see.Consider installing a night light that automatically turns on and off, so you won’t ever forget to turn it on.

",How to Enhance Your Room (For Teen Girls)," Random pieces of rubbish, dirty clothes and old pieces of food and drinks do not add class to a room and make it look horrible. Even though you may think it will be hard keeping your room tidy, it really isn't hard at all. Its easy. All you have to do is:


Take dirty clothes downstairs to wash regularly. Why not have a laundry bag/basket to keep them in so you have a bundle to clean next time your mum collects the dirty washing?
Have a bin and just throw rubbish in it instead of anywhere in room. And they don't have to look vile either. You could have a really retro, multicolored stripy bin and another cute, candy pink one.
Clear out of all the stuff you don't want anymore but don't just simply throw it in the trash. All those cuddly toys / books / jewelry / DVD's/ CD's /clothes would benefit a local charity shop as it is nearly always guaranteed that someone else would love them instead, and everything you give or sell is for a good cause.
Vacuum regularly and wipe/dust if needed.;
, Offer to your parents to clear out all your stuff for the redecorating session and to paint. Choose a light, soft color or a loud, bright one. Shades which usually look amazing in a teen room are: Light pink, light purple, candy pink, deep purple, light blue, deep blue, light green, light red, light orange or sunny yellow. Choose a color which you know you will love for a long time, as it's not everyday you can repaint a room. Make sure your brushes and paint are good quality and you either move everything out temporarily or cover it with old newspapers and sheets.

Know the risks.,
Climb over the sides.,
Jump to the top bunk.,
Use other furniture for leverage.,
Use a wall and window for support.",How to Get Up to the Top Bunk of a Bunk Bed2," Playing on a bunk bed’s ladder or stairs, climbing onto the top bunk using unapproved methods, and jumping down from the top bunk are all dangerous activities. Be very cautious and attempt these alternative methods at your own risk., If you are tall enough and strong enough, you can scramble to the top bunk by going over the sides of the bed. Step onto the bottom bunk, and then pull and push yourself up to the top bunk using your arms and legs. Just remember that this is dangerous and that it can be painful if you fall., Some people are able to get to the top bunk by standing a few feet away from the bed, running over to it, and vaulting over the rails. This is a very challenging technique, however. It is also very dangerous. Keep in mind that it will be painful if you miss the bed or fall off before you are safely in the bunk. , Generally, it is recommended that you keep the area around a bunk bed clear. However, a less safe method for getting to the top bunk involves stepping onto another piece of furniture (such as a desk, dresser, or bookshelf) before or while climbing up to the bunk. You can push off of its surface to make it easier to launch yourself into the bed.Remember that you or the piece of furniture can fall while you are trying to climb up. To help prevent this, make sure that your furniture is bolted to the wall.

, If there is a windowsill near your bunk bed, you can step into it before climbing to the top bunk. Using the wall for support, launch yourself from the windowsill to the ladder or rails of the bunk bed, and pull yourself into the top bunk."

Escape your life by changing the environment.,
Go for a hike or a walk.,
Experience new sights and sounds by traveling.,
Consider changing your job.,
Consider starting a new career.,
Try bringing changes into your current job.,
Think about moving to a new place or swapping houses with someone.,
Ask your school about exchange programs.,
Consider moving to another city, country, or state.,
Change up your room or home to give it a new look.",How to Escape Your Life2," Sometimes, the same old sights and sounds may start to get to you emotionally. You may feel caged in, or as though you are starting to grow crazy. One thing that may help is to change your environment. They may be as simple as going for a hike, taking a new route to school, or going on a trip. It can be as short as a day or as long as forever. This section will give you some ideas on how you can escape your life by changing the environment you are in.

, Much like traveling, hiking will allow you to experience new sights and sounds. Unlike traveling, hiking takes less commitment. Try visiting a national park or nature reserve. If there aren't any close to you, or if you don't have any way to get to one, try going for a walk around the block or explore a nearby park.

, You can travel as far away as another country or state. You can also take a road trip to a neighboring city. New sights, sounds, scents, and tastes can break up monotonous days. Traveling may also allow you to experiment with a new identity, even if it’s only short term. When you return from your trip, you may feel refreshed and ready to tackle life with more enthusiasm than when you left.If you are planning on going abroad for a long time, ask your boss if you can take a sabbatical, so that you don't have to quite your job. Depending on your profession, you may also be able to ""work from home,"" and submit your assignments over the internet. If you work for a corporate, retail business, ask if you can transfer to a new location temporarily.


, If your job is making you want to escape your life, consider working for another company. It could be that you are unhappy with the way your boss manages things, or the way that the company works. You may be happier working for someone else.

, If you are really unhappy with your job an life, you might want to consider trying another career path. Try taking some classes at a community or state college; they will give you an idea for what other careers might be like. If you find something that you like, try getting a degree or certificate in that area; it will make getting a new job easier. Be sure to research your new career path, as you do not want all your time and effort to go to waste on something that may not be a good fit for you.If going to a community college is not an option for you, try taking some online classes.
If you dislike working for companies, there are always freelance jobs and contracting gigs.

, If leaving your job isn’t an option, ask your manager about ways you can add some variety to your work. It could be as simple as being assigned a different cubical or getting different projects. If your company does events or parties, ask if you can be placed on the planning committee.

, Much like traveling, moving will allow you to experience new sights, sounds, scents, and tastes. The new environment will replace the old one, and might be enough to provide the escape that you need. If moving is not an option, consider swapping houses instead.


If you want to move but cannot afford a new house, consider renting a house with some roommates. You can also rent an apartment or a studio in someone's house.

, If you still attend school, moving to another place may not be an option for you. Many high schools and colleges offer exchange programs. You will be able to study abroad, and accommodation is often provided for you by participating families. If you do not get along with your family or the students in your school, this may be a great escape for you.


Keep in mind, however, that some exchange programs are only available to students taking certain language classes. For example, you may not be able to study abroad unless you are taking French—and France would be the only country you may be able to study in.


, Sometimes, where you live now just isn't the place for you. The people, the lifestyle, even the very air may seem wrong to you. If this is the case, moving elsewhere may be an option for you. Before you make any drastic changes, however, try researching where you would like to move to first, and visit that place for a couple of days or weeks. Stay in a hotel or in a friend's house. If you like the new city, state, or country, start making arrangements to move there.


Always do your research first and visit any potential place you'd like to move to. The last thing you'd want is to get stuck in a place you end up hating.
You don't always have to buy a house when you move; you can rent out an apartment. These are usually cheaper.

, Even something as simple as a new set of bed sheets can change the way your room feels. You can also try moving around the furniture; not only will the physical activity take your mind off of things, but the new set up will give your room a new look. This can help make your life feel a little different from before. It is almost like moving to a new place, without actually moving. Here are some more ideas:


Repaint your room. You can also try adding in some new wall paper. If you are renting your room, try adding some wall decals; they can be peeled off when you are ready to move.
Add some new curtains, rugs, or lamps.
Get some new furniture, or paint the old ones to give them a new, fresh look.
Consider fixing leaky faucets, broken appliances, and burnt out lights. This could help get rid of anxiety.
Too much clutter can make you feel crowded, both physically and emotionally. Consider selling or donating some things that you no longer use.

Know how changing your lifestyle can help.,
Try to eat more healthy food and drink plenty of water.,
Try to get plenty of restful sleep or going to sleep earlier.,
Try exercising to distract yourself.,
Set up a routine.,
Try meditating for 10 to 20 minutes every day.,
Try finding escape through faith.",How to Escape Your Life3," Sometimes, it is not possible to escape life by moving away or changing jobs. However, changing your lifestyle may help you feel as though you are getting a fresh start, and it may give you the energy to tackle life's problems.

, Changing your diet can help you feel as though you are starting a new life—especially if that diet is different from your current one. Try to add more fruits and vegetables to your current diet, and eat less junk food/fast food.


Fruits and vegetables are filled with many important vitamins and nutrients. These will give your body the energy it needs to stay healthy. A healthy body is a happy body.

, If you are already getting a full eight hours of sleep but are still feeling tired the next day, try going to sleep at an earlier time. Not getting enough sleep may leave you feeling tired and emotional, and you may start seeing things as worse than they actually are.

, You may find yourself focusing more on the workout and less on your life. You do not have to go to the gym, however; you can also go for a walk or jog. If you do, try going to a park; the new scenery will help refresh your mind.

, If your life feels chaotic because too many things are spiraling out of your control, you can try to set up a routine. This will give you some semblance of control. Try to wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day and night. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time every day. You can even try scheduling a fun activity on the same day each week. This can be something like watching a movie, going jogging, painting, or heading to the gym.

, This may help you feel less stressed and help you view the more positive things in life. It may also improve your physical health by lowering blood pressure and improving blood circulation.Try imagining the repetition of a sound, word or phrase. Be sure to focus on your breathing; it should be slow and natural. Try not to think about anything else while meditating. If something does come up in your mind, acknowledge it, but do not dwell on it.


Try meditating first thing in the morning; this is usually the easiest time to concentrate. Meditation can also be a great, stress-free way to start your day.
Don’t feel discouraged if you don't feel relaxed after your first meditation session. It may take a few tries. Stay passive and calm, and let it happen with time.
Focusing your mind can be difficult. If this is the case for you, try meditating only a few minutes at a time at first, before working your way up to the a 10 to 20 minute session., If you are a religious person, you can ask your church for help or advice. You may even find that praying to your god or goddess can help. If you are not a religious person, but want to be, read up on some religions that interest you, and try to attend a prayer service. If you are not a religious person, and have no intention of joining any organized religion, try to set aside some time each day or week to reflect on your life and what you would like to change about it. It can be as simple as thinking more positively or staying strong emotionally.

Wear dark clothing that covers a good part of your face or body.,
Be secretive.,
Carry some money.,
Scope out a room when you enter it.,
Don't speak.,
Be mentally strong.,
Look after your health.,
Pretend like you should be doing something more important at the moment.,
Treat everyone with dignity—especially those who are struggling or looked down upon.,
Read books and watch movies with sly characters in them.,
Be serious.",How to Be a Sly Person," Do NOT mask your face, as you will be seen as a strange person. Avoid full masks, but hoodies and sunglasses are all okay!;
, If you have done something, pretend you haven't done it and walk away. If you feel eager to tell someone about it, tell your diary or sole confidante. It might be a blow off if after committing something bad, staying there and watching!


This way, people will know less about you. When they do find things out about you, they might be surprised. (For example, if you never mention that you take piano lessons, people will be surprised if you are caught playing a difficult song in a practice room!)
Do good deeds when no one is watching. If you're doing it in the recipient's presence, try helping them out and then slipping away when their back is turned.
Make a game out of disclosing as few details as possible.

, Scam people off, but don't do it too often. Let people nag around before sharing any of your money. This will show them that they have to ""deserve"" your attention, as they will act more respectful to you.

, Where are the exits? Where is people's attention focused? This way, if you want to slip out, you can do so more easily.

, Being quiet and just listening helps you build upon your shrewdness. Being a quiet and laid back person gives you a strong trait, and will also show people that you are a little bit mysterious. Sly people need a lot of information, and this is a great chance to record what your friends are saying.


Ask questions about the things someone is talking about, in order to keep them talking.
Study the art of listening. Briefly validating someone's feelings or choices will get them to keep talking.

, A person that runs around, trying to please everyone, will never be sly. Do NOT do actions that you feel uncomfortable about. Be the leader or the loner, not the wimp!


Some people won't like you. Shrug it off. That's their problem.

, Part of projecting an image of strength is staying physically and mentally at your best. Keep your body clean, hydrated, and free of pollutants such as cigarettes and alcohol. This suggests that you have a lot of strength and willpower.


Get exercise every day. Try things like jogging, swimming, hiking, or biking. Make it a routine to get an endorphin rush.
Eat well. Find fruits and vegetables that you like eating, as well as whole grains. Moderate intake of sweets and sugary drinks.
Get enough sleep and downtime. Take your relaxation time very seriously. A rested mind is a sharp mind.

, Bearing a thoughtful glance will make people wonder what you are thinking about, as it will give you the same strong trait. If you don't feel interested in what your friends are talking about, do not pretend to either! Give short answers like ""All right."" or ""I don't know.""


People will assume that short answers mean you don't want to talk. If you do want to talk, give longer answers or use nonverbal cues (such as smiling and making eye contact) to let them know you like talking to them. They will come to recognize this as your style.
If you don't have something ""important"" to do, that's okay. Maybe your secret important activity is watching movies with popcorn this evening. Take your free time seriously.

, Pick up the books that someone dropped in the hall, and walk the girl with Down Syndrome to lunch so that she doesn't get bullied. People have respect for those who do good deeds, and they may wonder why you do what they do. A good reputation can make you somewhat untouchable.


The only people to look down upon (if anyone) are the bullies who choose to behave badly.

, Pay attention to their mannerisms and philosophies. Are there aspects you'd like to use for yourself? Is there one who would make a good role model?

, Do not joke around too much, as you will be less aware of what you say. Try to hold your ground, as you talk clear and calmly. Having a sharp look from a time to another will make people respect you.

Understand the room.,
Maximize the space.,
Find a theme.",How to Decorate a Young Girl's Room1," Is it just a bedroom, or does it double as a playroom? How much space is there to work with, both in terms of floor space and wall space? How many windows are there? What are the dimensions of the closet and any furniture you plan to keep? Using a notepad, a tape measure, and a critical eye, all of these questions can be quickly answered to form a rock-solid starting point for redecoration. Good home decor starts with a clear sense of purpose and an eye on working within limits, rather than indulging every fantasy.;
, Now that the dimensions and the purpose of the room have been established, find ways to free up as much space as possible. Extra space opens up extra redecorating options. Even the simple emptiness of empty space its own reward, as empty, temporarily used space is easier to keep organized than cluttered, permanently occupied space.


Closet space can be maximized with hanging organizers and specially designed closet shelving to create more room in the main part of the bedroom. Anything currently boxed inside the closet can be moved to the garage or another storage area, freeing up the bedroom closet for clothes, sports equipment, and other regularly-used items.






As girls grow, their furniture may become impractically small. Anticipate what size of furniture will be useful over the next few years and take into account the extra space you will need.
Striking a parent-daughter deal to get rid of (or permanently store) old toys, clothing, and other items in exchange for redecoration can open up quite a lot of space. Consider staging a garage sale after decorating to move gently used items on to new homes and make a bit of money at the same time. A charity thrift store or clothing drive donation pile is a great way to empty out a chest of drawers or overstuffed closet. Round up everything that is broken or irreparably damaged and toss it for good. Anything you can't bear to part with but no longer use can be boxed up and stored elsewhere.

, With a notepad full of dimensions and a streamlined bedroom, the time to imagine and dream has come. Begin with general ideas about what the room will look like. It is useful to start a scrapbook with pictures and notes describing your ideas or hopes for the room. Your job is to settle on a theme and then decide how to make it work on a budget.


Themes can be very specific, or simple and general. Either way, don't limit your thinking to standard motifs alone. For every girl who wants a pink and lacy room or a fairy princess room, there is a girl who would rather do a rainbow room or a zoo room instead. Everyone involved in the redecoration should be encouraged to give input. The goal is to find a balance between a theme that the girl will enjoy, and a theme that the parents can live with in terms of time and money spent.






Not every theme has to be clear-cut or unified by subject. Consider using a two or three-tone approach utilizing favorite colors, or an approach that emphasizes handsome, useful furnishings rather than decorative objects. Go window shopping together at thrift stores and imagine how the various items you see might guide the theme or tone of the room. Keep short descriptions or photos of interesting items in your scrapbook for reference.
Think outside the box. There are an astonishing number of redecorating ideas in magazines like Martha Stewart Living and online at websites such as HGTV.com. Many of these ideas are quite clever and can be easily customized to fit any theme:

Instead of putting a poster on a blank wall, why not put a cluster of smaller pictures and mirrors in cheap, ornate frames? The frames can be quickly repainted to match the theme of the room.
New pillowcases and other cloth elements can be chosen in specific patterns to gently contrast with the walls and ceiling, making both elements pop a bit more.
Hidden organizers, such as under-the-bed storage and door-hanging pockets, create a quieter, more open environment, while bright and obvious options like a painted cubby shelf or multicolored chest of drawers create a bright and kinetic space.

, There are many ways to floor a bedroom! It all depends on what your teen and you prefer. It's conventional for carpet in the bedroom but it actually depends on the household. Pick a flooring that almost contrasts with the wall but still compliments the room.(e.g. spring green to peach tile).


Get some rugs to brighten up the floorspace. If you have a carpeted floor, this may not be as necessary, but a cool rug or two is never a bad thing to have in your room. If you have hardwood floors, rugs are a really good thing to put beside your bed so that when you get up in the morning your feet don't freeze on the hardwood floor. Remember, choose rugs that express your personality, and have fun with the designs and patterns.

, Do you really want that ABC dresser in your room? No way! Go out and get some new furniture. You'll need a bed (of course), a dresser, a bookcase, a bedside table, and a desk. Try buying all of your furniture in the same color so that your room doesn't look too crazy (unless that's your intention).


Look in thrift stores for bargain furniture finds. Just check there is no insect infestation before dragging it home though; if you're not sure, take a flashlight along and do a close inspection. This is more of an issue in some places than others, so ask your parents for advice.
Consider repainting old furniture for a completely new look that matches your color scheme.
Rearrange your furniture. Make sure you don't make it too cluttered. You need to breathe!

, Keep in mind of the size of the bed! Bedding should not draw your eyes away from the rest of the neat things in the bedroom! If the walls are plain, patterns would work for the bed. Also remember the pillows and placement of the bed! That may matter because of the size and whereabouts of the closet and doors.

, You don't want something lost under a heap of dirty socks and jeans. Make organization fun! Use baskets or trays in the book shelf that have a fun pattern to them!


Have a separate area just for schoolwork. Keep television sets and electronic appliances away from the 'school zone'. Have cups or small rectangular boxes to hold pencils, pens, and markers. Have an area to store backpack/school bag than seeing it in the middle of the living room. Keep a place to store paper or any other necessities she might need.
Make sure you have some storage space. Use space in your closet or make another spot in your room for keeping your stuff out of the way. Buy some storage bins and slide them under your bed. This keeps all of your stuff organized.

, You could also go to the store Bed, Bath and Beyond. Find some wall stickers to put on your wall. I especially suggest circular wall stickers. You could also go to Walmart or another store that is similar to this one and get some inexpensive posters and hang them up on your wall or even your ceiling.

, They can really liven up your decor. Put in stuff that you like and that gives your room personality! Art projects, sketches, whatever you want. If you're the artist type put up your drawings, or paintings. Make it yours; after all, it is your room.


Buy some picture frames with funny pictures on them. Try to get some that describe you so that you can add some extra personality to your room. Then hang them up on your wall. Put them next to each other or put them all across your room.
Add a few mirrors. Mirrors aren't just for girly-girls. If you love makeup, a good mirror will be handy when you're putting your makeup on. You can buy a full-length mirror so that you can see your outfits, too. Buy a mirror that has a cool frame, such as a mosaic with different colors of glass.
Get a cork board. Cork boards are really cool, because you can display photos of your family, you, your friends, your pets, as well as other things like concert tickets and postcards. If your cork board is ugly, paint it a color that goes with your room, but not a very dark color, or put some cool fabric over it. You can also buy cork boards with fabric over them already.
Hang pictures that you like on your walls. You could make your own frames by using cardboard and painting them. Show your creative side by painting or drawing and then framing your work on the wall. Printing pictures from the internet is also an option.

, It can't hurt to ask someone else about what your room looks like. Ask your mom, best friend or even a cousin what they think of your room. Don't rely on their opinions too much though because you want to have personality to your room too. Also if you like a piece of furniture, a wall sticker, a poster, and/or a picture and so on and someone else thinks that it looks ugly, keep it in your room anyway!

"
Shop for the basics.,
Acquire your elements.,
Finish making space.",How to Decorate a Young Girl's Room2," Wall, ceiling, window, and floor elements should come first, if any of them are being changed. Take a trip to the paint store together and look at paint chips. Talk to the workers there about room painting and purchase enough paint to do the job right, plus rollers, pans, edging tape, and anything else that will be necessary for your plan. Acquire curtains, drapes, and other such background elements. They will be useful for visualizing how furnishings will look in the newly decorated room.

, Anything that can be pre-purchased should be purchased now. If new furniture is in order, make sure there is space to store it until it can be placed. Decorative items, including items that are currently in the room and will be re-used in the new room, can be kept together in boxes or bags. Do as much as possible as soon as possible to avoid letting the redecoration process drag on and become a source of stress.


The weekend before you plan to redecorate is an ideal time for this part of the process. Make a shopping day of it. Be sure to plan breaks so that you don't get tired. A few hours in the morning followed by a few hours in the afternoon is a good way to divide up the time, and it also allows you to divide up the trips by location or item size so that you don't get too overwhelmed.






Make any necessary modifications to the items you will be using. Picture frames and wooden furniture purchased on a Saturday can be painted and otherwise decorated on a Sunday. This is a great family project in and of itself, and a chance for everyone to show off their creative selves. Gluing seashells, glitter, or other theme-appropriate elements to some of the objects is a good way to personalize them. Leopard spots or clouds can be made by pressing a brush with black or white paint to a background of gold or sky blue paint, respectively. A flick of the thumb can spatter shiny metallic paint across a dark background for a bright, exciting effect. Drawer knobs can be replaced with a little work and simple hand tools. Have fun and try whatever suits your fancy.

, Clean the room thoroughly a few days before you plan to decorate it, including closet space and the space underneath the bed. Everything that does not have a clear place should be set aside, along with everything else that was set aside before cleaning began (see section 1, step 2 above). Make final decisions on what to sell, what to donate, what to store, and what to trash. Box up anything you will keep but not use, and move it to the garage or another storage space. Leave only furniture, clothes, and regularly-used books and toys in the bedroom.


Keep laundry up-to-date until the day of the redecoration. When that day comes, it will be easy to focus on redecorating since all the preparation was finished beforehand.






This period is also a good time to begin developing a regular schedule for cleaning the room, if one has not already been established.

"
"
Start in the morning by emptying out the room.,
Paint the room.,
Install other foundational elements.,
Move the furniture in.,
Add decorations.,
Fill in the gaps.,
The next day is the day for hauling junk and donations away from the house.",How to Decorate a Young Girl's Room3," Clothes, toys, books, and any furniture that will return to the room should be set aside indoors. Whatever furniture is left should be set aside to be sold or donated. Plan to get rid of it as soon as possible to avoid creating clutter in the garage or workroom. Thoroughly vacuum the room afterward.


If you have no way to transport furniture donations yourself, consider asking a family friend to drop by the next day to help move it out, or renting a truck to haul it away.






If you plan to sell off any furniture, post advertisements for it in the evening after the redecorating is done. That way, people will be able to take it away as soon as possible without disrupting the redecoration process.
Don't forget to take down window coverings if you plan to replace them. It will make the job of painting the room simpler.

, There are a number of basic options for painting a room. The most common method is to open up a can of paint, pour some into the tray, and begin rolling it onto the walls. Aside from the standard practice of painting every wall the same color, one wall can be painted a darker shade than the other three to add depth, or edges and molding can be painted a different color to help make the walls pop. There are other options for painting a room as well; just remember that the more complicated the process, the longer it will take. Generally speaking, a simple approach is best. Remember to open any windows in the room in order to keep it ventilated, and remember to strip off borders with tape to ensure clean lines. Let the paint dry afterwards.

, If you began work in the morning, the paint should be dry enough to continue working before the evening arrives. Once the time is right, make any room accessory changes you have planned. This is the time to install new curtains, drapes, or mini blinds, as well as light fixture shades, ceiling hooks, door handles, and anything else that will go behind the rest of the decorations.

, Generally speaking, a bed is the centerpiece of any bedroom, so start with that. Move the mattress around and decide on a place for it, then bring in the frame and box spring and put it all together. Bring in the rest of the furniture one piece at a time and build up the room's layout gradually. Drawers and bookshelves should remain empty at this stage so that they can be moved easily as the room begins to fill out. This is also the time to place closet organizers and new hangers in the closet, if you purchased any. Beanbags may be comfortable and relaxing to lay or sit on so it may be a good furniture for your room.

, Start with the walls and door. Any pictures, mirrors, cork-boards, or other elements that will be attached to them should be put up now. Help each other hold up items side by side to see how they will look together before hanging them. Use a level to ensure that every element is hanging evenly. Once the walls and door have been decorated, add hanging elements and items that will sit on top of shelves or other furniture. Again, work together and spend plenty of time trying different arrangements until everything looks just right.You may want to buy some silhouette stickers to paste on your wall.

, Return drawers to dressers, and then return clothes to their drawers. (Take time to fold and organize them first.) Put shoes, dresses, and occasional-wear clothes in the closet.Organize your clothes by season then by color. Return books and other shelf items to their shelves, and return toys to their drawers, boxes, or chests. Stereos, TVs, and other electronic equipment should next. Finally, make the bed and add any other accent items, such as throw pillows, that go on top of everything else.

, If a yard sale is in order, have it planned for the next morning as well. With all the extra items out of the house or safely in storage, your redecoration will finally be complete. The longer you wait before taking this final step, the more your donations and yard sale items will start to resemble just another pile of junk.

, Add a splash of life and colour to your desk with a plant. Make sure it is an adequate size and doesn’t require a lot of maintenance. Adding greenery can increase productivity, spark creativity, and reduce stress. A great option are succulents because they don’t take up much space, don’t have pollen, and require little care.


Succulents are a great choice because they won’t require care when you’re not at your desk during the holidays. And they don’t have pollen that can irritate people with allergies.

Dividing a room in half with a new wall containing a hidden door can create a secret space.
Wall off unfinished space to create a hidden hiding place behind the wall.;
, The most important part of a secret room is the doorway. The entrance to your room should not look like a doorway, or people will know that there is a room beyond the door. Doors can be hidden in the woodwork or disguised as a piece of furniture. When building a secret room, the door will make or break your secret.A bookshelf on a hinge and rollers can easily conceal an entryway.
Wood paneling can mask doors although the edge of the door can sometimes give away its location.
Stairs can be built with a hinge to raise up and reveal another set of stairs leading down to a hidden basement room.

, Before attempting to install a secret doorway, make a plan detailing how your finished door will look. When designing your doorway make sure you consider the hardware that will make the door functional.


Consider how to conceal the hinge of the door. A hinge door that opens into the secret space is easier to conceal than a hinge on a door that swings out.
The latch must be secure to keep the door from opening accidentally.
Decide how to open the secret door from the outside. A wire that extends from the latch on the inside to a disguised triggering mechanism outside the door can do the trick.

, Build a door frame using 2x4s Measure the height and width of the doorway and cut 2x4s with a circular saw to frame the outer edge of the doorway. Using a drill and a chisel, create a cutout in the wood to mount the hinges for your door. If using a bookshelf for a doorway, you will need to mount the hinges on the bookshelf as well. Install steel casters on the bottom of the bookshelf to allow it to roll across the floor as it opens.Measure the depth of the bookshelf and align the front face of the bookshelf with the wall to allow it to blend in with the wall.
Align the hinges carefully; measuring the doorway and the door multiple times will ensure that your door will swing smoothly.

, A gate latch on the inside of the secret room is an easy way to conceal the latching mechanism from outside view. A wire can extend through the hidden door to a trigger on the outside of the door.Mount the gate latch to the door frame with the locking pin attached to the door.
Attach a wire to the latch and thread it through a hole drilled in the bookshelf or doorway.
Connect the wire to a book or object that will trigger the latch when pulled. Glue a piece of wood inside a book jacket; connect the wire to the fake book using a screw. Place the book on the shelf to conceal the wire. when the book is pulled the door will open.

, To keep your bookshelf from standing out, add wood trim around the edges flush with the wall. The trim work will help conceal the edges around the shelf and prevent it from looking like an opening."

You’ll better be able to evaluate the perfect spot when you can see the entire space.
Try moving things around in your room if you think you can use an area for your space.;
, Use a window nook, part of your closet, or a spot behind your bed to make your spot. Using an existing spot will save you time and headache.


Don’t overlook corners. It is easy to make a corner into a secret spot. It already has shape without you having to add boundaries.
If it’s big enough, you can even use spots under furniture—like under a desk.

, Just because you don’t have a built in nook near the window or a giant walk in closet with space for your secret spot doesn’t mean you can’t have one. If this is the case, get creative and form one.


Think basic. If you create an elaborate secret spot, it will be too noticeable and soon everyone will be asking questions. Try to use materials already in you room to make your secret spot.
Use a blanket to create a space. Laying a blanket over the back of a chair or off the side of your bed is an easy way to create space. Plus using a blanket in your room is not suspicious to anyone that walks by.

Measure the inner dimensions of the drawer.

Glue small wood blocks along the edges of the drawer to support the false bottom. The size of your blocks will depend on the depth of your false bottom. Anything deeper than two inches may make the drawer look suspiciously modified when opened.
Place the plywood on the supports as a false bottom. You may want to attach a ribbon or small string on the plywood to help you lift the false bottom, although, doing so may give away your secret!

If the space is not already present in the wall, you can easily add a shelf in an existing wall.Cut out a square of drywall between two studs. Studs are usually located 16-18 inches apart. Use a razor knife or drywall saw to cut a square out of the drywall.

Follow property laws to make sure you are not trespassing on someone’s land when creating a secret space outdoors.

, In a heavily wooded area you can use branches and leaves as a natural cover to conceal a location.


Overlap branches with one another to create a natural screen.
Pile leaves and moss on the branches to further obstruct the view.

, Make your secret space harder to spot by layering camouflage netting behind your natural covering.

, If you are planning to visit your secret spot often, use a different path to reach the spot each time you visit. Taking the same path each time will create a walkway that can easily be followed by others.

Fill your secret spot with things to keep you occupied while you’re there. Maybe you want magazines or crafts to fill your time. Think about what you want and be sure to stock up. If you prefer to store items in your secret space, use hangers, hooks, or storage boxes. You could even stack CDs or books to create a small but neat storage area. If you’re trying to store a lot of things, baskets and closet organizers are a great way to store tons of small items. Keep drinks or food in your secret spot if you plan to be there for a few hours. Make it as comfortable as possible for yourself.

Enjoy your space.,

Keep a balance.",How to Make a Secret Place in Your Room3," Don't show your space to anyone or it won't be secret anymore.


If you have siblings, try to lock your door to keep them from your secret space. If that’s not an option, talk to you parents about helping you keep the secret space yours.
If someone does happen to discover your space, talk to them and explain that it is your secret personal area—they will most likely understand.

, Now that you’ve created a secret space, be sure to use it as you intended. You’ve worked hard and now you can sit back and appreciate it.


Keep it clean. If your secret space gets cluttered, it won’t be comfortable. Be sure to keep it clear so that you can relax.
Keep it stocked with refreshments, new magazines, or anything else you might need in your secret space.

, While you may be in a very busy house, try to keep your secret space a spot where you can focus (even if you’re focusing on relaxing).


If you chose a spot with a window, use a lightweight curtain to block out excessive heat or outside noises.
Keep headphones in your secret space to block out the noisiness in the house.
Consider leaving your phone out of your secret spot. If it’s there, keep it on silent.

, Now that you have your secret spot, you can spend a lot of time in it, but don’t become a hermit. Spending all of your time alone is not good for you.


Interacting with family and neighbors keeps you safe, healthy, and happy. If you start spending all of your time alone in your secret space, they may start to worry.
Your secret space is yours and you don’t have to answer any questions about it. They will respect your privacy as long as you continue to be a part of their lives. "

Don't be afraid to say something nice to someone.",How to Be a Proper Young Lady," There is no point in fretting about the fact that you aren't three inches taller, or that your eyes are green and not blue, like you might wish. You need to work with what you have.

Washing once a day is essential. Your face needs to be washed and moisturized once in the morning, and then again in the evening before you go to sleep. Shower often, and remember to shave your legs and under your arms. Be sure to keep a washcloth, body towel, and a floor towel. Make sure you keep your floor towel straight on the floor, and body towel near by, and absolutely keep your washcloth in the shower, then take all 3 out when you are done.



 


Your nails must be well kept. You must not bite them or let nail polish chip. You can't allow them to grow too long and must keep the tops even. To keep them to these standards, file your nails and use nail polish remover whenever any nail polish starts to chip.






Your hair must be well maintained and kept healthy; you should not dye it an unnatural color. If you do decide to dye your hair, never let your roots show. Whatever hairstyle you wear must be neat, clean, and appropriate for the occasion (i.e. hair in an elastic band for gym is more comfortable, but an updo would be more appropriate for a formal.) You do not need to curl or straighten your hair, although you can if you want to. Its important to wash your hair regularly or it can get greasy which is not a good look!






Make-up should be natural during day time events; tinted moisturizer is fantastic, if you have clear skin. A light mineral powder foundation is recommended, if your complexion is blotchy and full of blemishes. A concealer that suits your skin tone is helpful in hiding nasty blemishes, but do not let yourself fall into the 'more is better' trap, because it really isn't; looking like a cake is not getting you any closer to being a proper young lady. Heavy eye make-up should only be worn at night events, as is the case with red or other dark shades of lipstick. However, one should not wear red lipstick with heavy make up; it needs to be one or the other.






Perfume should be carefully chosen; a classic lighter scent should be worn every day; something heavier for going out, but remember to never wear anything that you feel you don't have the confidence to pull off.






Eyebrows are a very expressive feature of your face, and should be well maintained. However, over-plucking is not necessary or advised. Your teeth are also very important and often neglected; be sure to brush and floss them at least twice a day. Using mouthwash is also quite effective.






If you have fair skin, you might want to use sunscreen and preserve your own kind of beauty. Tanning is not only unhealthy, but it can look bad when it starts to peel.






For those who are olive skinned and can achieve a tan after some time in sun, be cautious, unsightly tan lines are almost as bad as a sunburn, and should be avoided.;
, This can be anything from colors to textures of fabric that look stunning on you. Wear clothing appropriate for the occasion. Don't wear anything that isn't clean or neat, that doesn't go well with another piece of clothing you are wearing, or that is excessively embellished. When buying clothes, look for quality. You should also have your own personal style. Understand that 'girly' and 'feminine' are not the same thing. You will look - and feel - much better in a skirt than in pants. Nothing says 'lady' quite like a girl wearing a smart skirt when all her friends are in jeans.

, You never scratch, just rub. And if you're going to burp then either try to hold it in or do it quietly because a lot of people think it's disgusting. Carry a handkerchief, no lady walks around all day sniffing like a child; give your nose a quick blow and move on. As for sweating? People sweat. It's human nature, it can't be controlled. But you might want to carry some body spray, deodorant or perfume so you can get rid of unpleasant odors after exercising. Nobody wants to be close to someone who smells like sweat, no matter if they're a boy or a girl!

If soup is served, it's impolite to slurp. If you have soup don't slurp or sip. Just stick the spoon in your mouth and drink.

, A proper young lady needs to be well read. Jane Austen, George Orwell, Shakespeare, Bronte, Dickens, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf are all good examples of people you should read. Some of the classics can be a trying read, but you must get through them. There are websites with abundant notes on all of these books, so, even if you do not understand them, in time you will.

Try to read at least two different newspapers every other day; knowing what is going on in the world around you from multiple points of view is vital.






Having a wide knowledge of music and art is great; do not limit yourself to what the local radio station blurts out. Be adventurous and go discovering. Listen to classical and renaissance music, as it is very rich in history and culture.






Don't spend too much time online and be careful. If you don't have parental control software installed, ask your parents to do it for you (on both smartphones and PC). That way you are protected.
If you are still in school, keeping up your studies is very important. As much as possible, study things that you like and are good at. But do make sure to do your best at all subjects, and try to be interested in them. Above all, do not pretend to know a great deal about something that you don’t. The truth will come out in the most embarrassing way.







, You should have a code of conduct that you adhere to at all times because being a lady is about what you are and what you believe, as well as how you look. Trust and respect your parents and never complain about them to your friends. Being a ladylike girl means changing your lifestyle and they will be so pleased to help you.


Don't stay out late; you need your sleep and will feel better in the morning. Agree a suitable bedtime with your parents and ask them to make you stick to it, even if you would rather not.
Enjoy dating - but be very clear that you won't be having sex until you get married; a lady doesn't sleep around willy-nilly.
Don't go crazy, take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol

, This will help to make you a more interesting and talented person. Having a passion is very attractive to others. It shows that you are not lazy; you strive to improve yourself, and you are diligent.

, Apart from it being a good thing, your develop your sense of compassion for all kinds of people, and are a role-model for others. Volunteer work and charity are eye-opening ways to understand people, gain skills, and help make a difference.

, Try to enunciate your vowels and consonants; do not use slang or swear. Try to avoid shortening words, and using words that you clearly do not know the meaning of. Pause and think for a split second before opening your mouth, and do not speak too fast or too slowly.


Your diction should be crisp and clear. You have to speak slow, steady, and clearly. You don't want anyone to think you're speaking gibberish. Your speaking voice should be mellifluous and pleasing to the ear. You want to speak with a soft delightful voice. Try to sound as lovely as a beautiful flower.

, Your social skills are of vital importance towards becoming a charming proper young lady. Greet people with a smile, firm (confident) handshake, or kiss depending on what is appropriate for the situation. If you are in the wrong, apologize, and if someone has wronged you, accept their apology. Keep up the correspondence you have with people, RSVP to events on time, reply to letters or emails you receive if it called for it. Do not date for the sake of it, and do not flaunt your exploits for the world to see. Do not lower your moral standards for others. Be strong in who you are. Ask people how they are, and give them the chance to talk about themselves. People love talking about themselves. Listen to what others say, even if you aren't remotely interested. You are going to have to learn how to pay attention. Learning to manipulate a conversation is very important, but once you've learned the skill, you will be saved from many boring/awkward conversations. Please and thank you are incredibly important, and are being more and more forgotten in this world.

, Being healthy will give you a glow that beauty products can't achieve. You should try to get at least eight hours of sleep every night, or more if possible. Exercise, eat healthily, and make sure you get enough fruit and vegetables everyday. Drink plenty of water, as it will do amazing things for your skin. Do not smoke, because it is not sexy, it is not beautiful, but it is a sickening, ugly habit. Do not drink alcohol and have regular check-ups at the doctor to make sure that you are as healthy as can be.

Stay true to yourself.",How to Be a Stereotypical Teen Girl," Wash your face twice every day and make sure it is clean and soft. Many teens have acne and it's perfectly normal and nothing to be ashamed of (after all it's not your fault). See your doctor about a medication for it and slowly, it will improve.;
, Wash every day and shower every other (or as often as you see fit). If you want to, shave your legs and/or armpits and/or any other body parts you choose. Make sure you wash any parts that develop odor and wear deodorant under your arms. Use lotion to keep your skin well hydrated and soft.

, Wear your hair in a cute and stylish hairstyle. A common one is to leave your hair and flip it to the side. But, make sure you research more into it. Not every hairstyle is going to work for you. Take care of it, too! Wash it according to your hair type and use appropriate products. Don't heat style it too much, or it will fry. Be adventurous with your hairdos - after all you hair is your best accessory!

, Wear bright, stylish clothes in colors like pink, teal, blue, green, yellow, etc. Jeans are always in and skirts and shorts are cute as well. Dress according to the weather. Don't wear a big winter coat if it's ninety-three degrees outside, and vice versa.


These are the basic clothes you will need in your wardrobe

V neck, tank and camisole solid colored tops, graphic tops, graphic tank tops
Skinny jeans, boot cut jeans, jeggings, sweatpants
Tights, socks, etc.
Cute cardigans, V neck sweaters, hoodies
UGGS, moccasins, flip flops, slippers, Vans, Converse, etc.
Knitted scarves, beanies and gloves in winter
Cute accessories. See tips for what you need.



, Always coordinate your shoes with the rest of your outfit(otherwise, it just looks silly). Wear shoes YOU can handle. Do not wear five inch stilettos and hurt yourself in them because you want to look like a model. Work your way up with a wedge or something! Wedges are super cute and comfortable for school.

, Eat as healthily as you can, this is the only diet you will need. Enjoy your food and find ways to prepare healthy recipes that you like (it's not good food unless it tastes good, but you might need some time to adjust to new tastes). But don't forget to treat yourself as well: ""You only live once"", so you might as well enjoy that cookie if you really want it. Also, don't become obsessive about your looks: Media and advertisement will always try to tell you that there is something you need to fix with your body but in truth they just want to sell you things. If you can, learn to love what you have and work with it. Everybody's body is different and everybody will have things they'll like more about themselves than other things. Don't fret, physical perfection doesn't exist, so there's no point getting really worked up about it. Just do what makes you feel good, don't let anybody tell you what you should or shouldn't be doing with your body (this includes anyone from your mom, to your classmates to the media). Always remember: Your body, your rules.

, Get a cell phone (if you don't already have one) and text your friends. Attend parties every now and then and hang out with a group of friends over the weekend! Don't be afraid to loosen up a little. But if you feel truly uncomfortable in a situation or you feel pressured to do things you really don't want to: bail. Popularity isn't everything and I'm sure you'd rather have a smaller circle of friends and be happy, than be the most popular girl in school and constantly feel anxious and unsettled.


Always have at least 1 good friend with you and talk about stuff like boys, hair, clothes, makeup and teen stars. Make sure you pick your friends wisely though and always have one or two friends you deeply trust to help you when you need support.

, Teen girls typically LOVE to shop if they have the money. This can be another social thing. Take some friends and ask for their opinions on clothes. They will be honest and can help broaden your stylistic horizons.

,, Don't let people push you around, pursue things that interest you and have a good time. Do things you really enjoy, not just things that you think you should enjoy.

Know when to ask for help, but avoid desperate behavior.",How to Be a Preteen Perfectionist," For example, wear pink, white, green, blue, and purple, and have them in either bright colors or pastels. Avoid black at all costs, only wear it with shoes or with a business suit, and even then, navy blue is best. Wear clothes that look neat and crisp and wear well coordinated outfits, for example blouses, vests, denim, shorts, cardigans, polo shirts, well ironed T shirts, and anything that looks neat and wear lots of of pink. Have one pink thing with every outfit.;
, Try wearing colors like brown, light blue and dark green but avoid black, it gives you a seemingly goth appearance. Try to wear colors like red, blue, green, brown and white.

, There is nothing wrong with enjoying fashion or buying clothing you find attractive, but it is important to stay in control. You can get a few trends, for example, one trendy outfit, or wear clothes that have been trendy for years now, like preppy clothes, skinny jeans, ballet flats, polo shirts, topsiders, or any other trends that have lasted.

, The clothing you wear should enhance your personality, not create or alter it. This advice can be applied to many aspects of life in which you may feel pressured to ""fit in."" You may try to fit in, but don't go to the extremes. Preppy is the best style, as it is clean-cut, neat, an easily adaptable personality, and always in style.

, Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth, floss, and bathe or shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing. Never have greasy hair. It is gross and very trashy. Wear deodorant, perfume, lotion, and shampoo and conditioner. Make sure you never smell no matter what and you are always as clean as can be.

, clear coat on your fingernails; color or french pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, and stop biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish (not bold, like red or blue or black). Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long. Nails should be in neutral colors and medium short in length on girls and trimmed short on boys. You can give your fingernails a French manicure and your toenails a pretty pale pink color. Always have your nails painted. Only occasionally paint your fingernails, and when you do, paint the pale pink, nude, or bubblegum pink. Give yourself a manicure and pedicure every week.

, A good goal to set for yourself is to try to get mostly A's in everything you do at school including homework. That means on every assignment. Never get a B on a test, or anything below 95. Take notes, study for that test, focus, but most of all come to school ready to learn and try not to worry about the social scene too much, after all, that's not what school is for. try to join extra curricular activities but only if you know it will not bring your grades down. Join no more than 2 sports and 2 clubs, and do sports whose seasons will not coincide, for example a fall sport and a spring sport. Make sure you have plenty of time to study and get Straight A's.

, Remember; your a perfectionist not a pushover. Come up with a few comebacks like, ""At least I won't have to work at McDonalds"", or ""Karma will bite you in the butt"", or anything that will get them to silence and think about it. Most bullies don't expect a smart and witty comeback.

, i.e. Go to bed on time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, teach your little brother how to tie his shoes, etc. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's something you should be doing (no matter how badly you don't want to do it), do it! Try to go to bed earlier than your parents say to, for example if your parents want you to go to bed at 9:30, go to bed at 9:15. They will love your effort, and you will get in trouble less.

, Unless what there saying is completely and totally unreasonable,ex: they make you move out when your twelve. But seriously, it's not worth the grounding.

, Don't spend all of your time with your friends. A good rule is that if you spend the time between breakfast and lunch with friends, spend the time between lunch and dinner with family and vice verse. The times after dinner and before breakfast should be spent with family. And if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend you should cut the afternoon in half.

, Tattoos and Body Piercings- Appearances convey a strong message to others; you can be judged by an individual or right before an event that will play a prominent role in your future (e.g. a prospective employer, acquiring a higher position in a reputable company, etc.). Therefore, take careful consideration when deciding if it is a good ideal for you to get visible tattoos or body piercings. Even though a person’s outward appearance does not automatically show his or her true inner qualities, appearances can reflect how a person is willing to be perceived by the world. Also keep in mind that although tattoos and piercings are individual expressions, they can be permanent or difficult (even costly) to remove if you change your mind in the future. If you are in doubt about how tattoos and piercings may impact you in the future, forget about getting them and find other ways to show self expression, such as creating works of art, poetry, hobbies, etc.

, When necessary, voice your opinions appropriately and constructively. This encourages your audience to listen carefully when you speak.

, Only desperate times call for desperate measures. Take a deep breath, be strong, and move through the situation with elegance and grace. You will be the victor for it, no matter the outcome. If things get out of hand and you feel completely overwhelmed, ask for help from a close friend or family member.

Pay attention to the body language of others.,
Be a good listener and wait for your turn to speak.,
Draw your personal boundaries.,
Make your room an awesome sanctuary.",How to Be a Normal Teenager1," It's getting increasingly easy to spend too much time alone. While some solitude can be good, even loners have to come out to work, play or eat sometimes. To act normally and behave in a well-adjusted manner (not too different), it's important to spend time around other people, socializing and learning from them, so you can interact more directly and easily get involved. Just being around a variety of people in a coffee shop, or at a restaurant, or at the movies, can help you learn about others and feel less isolated. This will make you more comfortable in your own skin, which in turn will make you more experienced at opening up and interacting.


Find places where you're likely to run into like-minded people. Love comics? Quit buying them online and hit up your local comic shop. Love to make art? Head to an art class, craft store or the museum. Take a class in one of your interests and talk some with others learning the same topic or skill. Get in a choir or take music lessons. Some churches have music school and sport activities.
Online friends exist in a gray area. They're ""real"" a lot of the time, but our interactions online are much different than our up close, mano-a-mano interactions. Try to balance your time socializing online with at least as much, if not more, face-to-face interactions.;
, Having a pessimistic, excitable, or silly friend is fine, but if being around them makes you uncomfortable, consider whether you should keep them as a friend. They may get themselves and you into unwanted difficulties and disgrace, so to speak. Avoid getting closer or hooked up with hateful, troubled, mean, destructive or violent persons.


If you're good at something, offer up your help to those who may need it. When asked for, give your opinion or assistance.
Don't go looking for trouble; let it come to you (and try to stay out of it).

, When you're around people, keep an eye out for any clues they might give regarding how to behave 'normally' in situations.


Mirror the behavior of others, if it makes you comfortable. When you're in the library and everyone looks very studious, quiet, and absorbed in their work, it's probably not the best time to start cutting up and trying to make jokes. If everyone's dancing at a school dance, it might be normal to dance, but you don't have to. It's normal to feel both ways.
If your neighbor at the lunch table keeps trying to make eye contact and smiles continuously at you, it's probably a good time for a conversation, if you feel open. Try being friendly. Available communicating people often have open posture – shoulders back, head up, not too relaxed. Relaxing but not acting open may be about, instead, acting tired, sleepy, angry, shy or grumpy. Arms and legs crossed may be a sign that they are satisfied to sit alone, not looking to be friendly. Learn to recognize and not act that way in your own interactions.
If people are uncommunicative or closed off to you – head down, arms crossed – they probably don't want to talk. If you press the issue, it's possible that you might make them feel uncomfortable. Learn to recognize this and disengage from the conversation or interaction. Give them some space.

, When you're talking with someone, or with a group of people, try to balance listening and talking in equal measure. You don't have to be the one to contribute the most if you want to be noticed – it's just as important to be an active listener. Look at the person who's talking, nod your head to show that you're listening, and really listen to what is being said.Stay on topic. If everyone in a group is going around telling stories about their weekend, tell a story about your weekend, if you have one. It would be kind of strange to break the spirit of the moment: ""I had to watch my dad eat pickled herring. He eats weird stuff all the time."" Hopefully, that's not really about your weekend! Don't hijack a conversation and take it elsewhere, or else, expect groans and protests at your breaking the line of thought - unless it's time to change the topic!
Listening doesn't mean looking across the room or thinking of what you're going to say until a moment of silence appears in a conversation for you to fill. However, listening means actively receiving and responding to what the other is saying nicely, not just trying to think of what you're going to say next to top that bit. Accept the others' points as worthwhile - even if you've heard it already. Then without a yawn or cut-down say, ""Hey, yeah, - but have you ever ___..."", A teenager is an individual who wants to be seen as mature and experienced as one's peers. Due to this (while you strive to become the best you), it can often be tempting to get pushed or pulled into things you might not be ready for, or even interested in. Smoking, drinking, experimenting with the thrills of asking for dates, actually going on dates (when parents permit), holding hands, hugging, kissing and deciding your approach to love, expressing your new found state of being a teen... Balancing all these aspects is what normal teenagers confront in their everyday lives. While there's not just one ""set"" way to approach each of these aspects, what you should know is that it's your decision - to stand for your values, beliefs and to accept your responsibility to understand the consequences of conduct and behavior in close relationships. It's your life. Make your choices - the right ones - to draw your best boundaries close to your ""heart"".


The closer you set your daily life boundaries to your present norms and accepted ""truths""(where you're coming from), the sooner you can be well adjusted in your way. You'll be able to avoid other way-out freaky or boring stuff and be able to expand and extend your near-boundaries, launching out near your everyday ""unusual-stuff"". ""Keep it real! Keep it simple!"" is easier than going off track or out into the far off unknown.
Wanting to fit in is normal, and it's true that engaging in risky behaviors seems like a way to fit in and get people to ""respect"" you, but why would you compromise your personality and beliefs? If you're not being yourself, it's not you they're respecting, or even noticing.
Keep it cool: Another good boundary to keep in mind is secrecy. It's okay to keep some things to yourself. It's almost too easy to put every event, success and failure, every frustration, anger and joy, up on Facebook as a status update. Does it all really need to be there for everyone to see and ""dis"" you? You give the answer.

, For a teenager, there's nothing more critical than having a space all to your own. Make your room as unique as you are, filled with posters or candles, records or drawings. Fill it with yourself. Paint it whatever color you want and fill it with things you like to look at. Take some time thinking about what would make the ideal room and get permission to make it that way.


If you don't have your own room, find somewhere you feel comfortable that you can spend time in. Take a walk out into the yard or the woods; find a great sitting park bench, or find a table by a window that you love at the library, or spend time in a friend's basement den. Try to find somewhere quiet and available to you where you can find peace.

Have fun with your hair.,
Keep your makeup simple.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside1," Hair can be a great asset when cared for properly but can also detract from your appearance if neglected. Even if you have no time to put it up, make sure it’s brushed and that you have a ponytail holder with you.


Wash your hair regularly. Gently towel-dry it and let it air-dry as often as possible; blow-drying is hard on your hair.
Condition your hair to keep it looking healthy and vibrant. Find a formula that works for you; nothing is one-size-fits-all.;
, Of course you want to minimize flaws and accentuate your best features, but don’t pack it on; unnatural makeup makes you look fake. If you want people to think you are real, then be real and look real.

Don't be afraid to have your own style. If you think throwback basketball jerseys and athletic shorts are cool, you're in good company. If you think rugby shirts and khaki pants look good, you're in safe waters. The important normal constant is that whatever you wear is clean and form-fitting.

, It's a good idea to pay attention to what other kids are wearing, not because you must conform and wear the same thing, but so you can at least have some concept of the average dress wear. Then, if you choose to go in another direction, you'll be aware of what you're doing and not end up wearing plaid grandpa pants and golfing shoes to school because you think it's normal.


You don't have to go to expensive stores to dress normally. Box stores like Target, Walmart, and other outlets usually have sale items that are affordable and current. At thrift stores, try to find the newest cleanest clothes available that are in your size.
In middle school especially, it can seem that all anyone cares about is getting the next ""must have"" clothes trend which are usually expensive and will be forgotten in another six months anyway.

, If you want to look normal, you don't have to do anything fancy with your grooming, however, a little effort will go a long way. Keep yourself clean and well-kept and your confidence will be higher knowing that you're looking your best.



Brush your teeth and floss. Your smile will be friendly and picture-ready with proper dental care. Having healthy teeth can up your confidence significantly.
Take a shower at least every other day, and every day that you exercise. Wash your hair with shampoo and clean your body with soap.
Keep your nails neatly clipped and clean. Normal girls and boys also enjoy painting fingernails sometimes, which is perfectly appropriate if you want. try to keep the paint fresh, and remove it when it starts becoming chipped.
Talk to your parents about when it's appropriate to start wearing make-up, if you want to. Use a small amount of natural coloring to highlight your beauty, if you choose to.

, Your hair is just as important as any other part of your body: it takes some work to keep it healthy and clean. Your hair should be washed at least every 2-3 days to keep it strong and lustrous. Both boys and girls should comb their hair regularly to keep it untangled and healthy.



If you use products, don't go overboard. A little mousse, gel, or hairspray can go a long way. You don't want a crispy frosted flat-top like it's 1996. Aim for a natural look that highlights your normal hair.

Experiment with new haircuts, going for a buzz or growing it out like a rocker if you want. Being a teenager is the one time you can experiment with your personality and your identity.

, When you're young, it seems like you're invincible. You can eat like there's no tomorrow, stay out all night and go through your day like it's nothing, and recover from injuries super-fast. Unfortunately, it won't last. It's important to build the good habits that will ensure your health throughout your teenage years and further on too.


Pay attention to what and how much you're eating. Most teenagers have crazy-high metabolisms due to growth spurts, meaning that you'll be able to eat lots and lots of high-calorie food without gaining extra weight, especially if you're physically active and play sports. When that high metabolism ends, though, or you stop playing sports, it's possible to suddenly gain lots of weight. It's important to develop a love of physical activity early on, so you can build the good habits that will keep you healthy in the long run.
You don't have to be ""one of the jocks"" to enjoy exercise. If you love basketball but don't want to play on the team, go to the park and shoot hoops. Who cares if you miss more than you make? If you don't love playing any competitive sports, try out hiking around the woods and getting into nature, or see if you don't enjoy rock climbing or other solo adventures.

Find hobbies that help you relax.,
Broaden your worldview.,
Try out different ways to express yourself.,
Find like-minded people.,
Make room in your life for school and work.,
Give some thought to the future.",How to Be a Normal Teenager3," As a teen, you should have hobbies and interests to keep you occupied and engaged. School probably won't cut it. try to find extracurricular hobbies that will let you blow off some steam and find enjoyment. Some kind of extracurricular activity can be a great way of meeting other kids your age and socializing without having to meet people yourself.


Many teenagers take sports very seriously. Find out what team sports are offered at your school and consider trying out for the team. If you don't like any of the sports offered, tennis lessons, golf lessons, or other individualized sports might be more appropriate for you. Heck, check out learning how to fence.
Check out clubs at school. Sports aren't even close to being the only way to socialize at school. Foreign language clubs, chess clubs, art clubs, ecology clubs, and all sorts of organizations are available to students for fun and learning outside of school. If you don't like any of the clubs at your school, check out after-school programs at the YMCA, or other youth center in your town, or check out a youth group at a church.Try playing music. Whether in marching band, concert band or by starting your own garage band, music can be a great outlet for teenagers. Studies show that teens who study music learn more efficiently and have a great amount of fun and camaraderie playing.

, As you get older, it's important to learn as much as you can about other people and learn to exercise your empathy skills. A child thinks only of themselves, and an adult is able to think more selflessly, but a teenager is somewhere in the middle. It can be tough.


Mission trips and exchange programs can be excellent and effective experiences for many teenagers if such opportunities are available. Likewise, getting a part-time job and learning to work for your keep is an important growing-up step that you can learn in the summer time, or on the weekends after school.
Read as much as you can, about as much diverse topics that you can. Travel from the comfort of a chair by checking out novels, travelogues, sci-fi, fantasy, whatever you like reading. Read some things that are challenging and some things that are easy. Read all the time. Read everything.

, Being a teen is a time of experimenting, trying on new identities until you learn which one fits you the best. In a given year, you might switch back and forth between thinking you want to be a doctor and loving your position on the soccer team to wanting nothing but to write poetry and hang out with painters and paint your fingernails black. That's ok! That's normal!



Try out being an art kid. Take some art classes and learn the fundamentals to see you if you'd like to spend your days in the studio, creating strange masterpieces.

Try out the exciting world of mystery. Lots of teenagers take solace in the dark clothes and powerful vibes of a mysterious person. While it might seem ""weird,"" it's pretty normal.

Embrace your inner athlete. Jocks don't have to be the villains from high school drama movies. Be a well-adjusted athlete who takes sporting seriously. Make it your ""thing.""

, Find a community of people you like and people who are like you and get to know them well. Hang out in school and outside of school. Support each other and lift each other up.


Emphasize forging a few strong relationships over lots of meaningless ones. It's not worth having 800 Facebook friends if you can't talk to any of them in real life.
Alternatively, it's also a good idea to meet lots of people who you don't necessarily have a lot in common with. If you're a sporty athlete, hang out with some of the art kids every now and then to see what you have in common. try to make all sorts of different friends.

, Having fun is important, but taking your responsibilities seriously is just as important a part of growing up. Save enough time in your busy teenage schedule to complete your schoolwork and work as hard as possible at doing well. Even if you think you're sure what you want to do in life, and that plan doesn't involve algebra-trigonometry, give it your best shot. You never know how you might regret blowing off that welding class, or zoning out during sewing down the road.


Make sure you take excellent notes. Notes force you to pay attention, improve your memory and provide you with a helpful study guide.
Do your homework. Don't slack off on it, because believe it or not, it really does help you learn. Pay attention in class and ask questions to stay engaged. Respect your teachers and try to make the best of it.

, Where do you want to be in ten years? In twenty? What do you want to do with your life? Tough questions for anybody, and uncomfortable questions for most, especially teenagers. But it's something you're going to have to struggle with. The more you struggle with it, the better you'll prepare yourself for your teenage years, and the more normal you'll be. It's something everyone struggles with before transitioning into adulthood.


If you want to go to college, start researching affordable places you might attend that seem to be full of people like you, or places that offer the kinds of specialties you'd like to study. Many teens who struggle to make friends or fit in during high school really come into stride during college.
It's also normal and perfectly fine to have no idea what you want to do with your life. Don't worry about it too much. That's perfectly normal. When people ask, tell them that you're just trying to get through your teens first.

Exercise!,
Maintain your personal hygiene.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside2," Find a way to sweat — yes, really sweat — for 30 minutes at least 3 to 5 times every week. Take a dance class; go jogging or biking; join a hiking club; play tennis, racket ball, soccer, or basketball; walk laps around the block. Do something. It will improve not only your fitness, but also your outlook on life and the world.


Being fit is always more attractive than not being fit. And don't think you have to be a skinny model to be fit; fitness is about being able to move, breathe, and keep up during a physical activity.
Exercise is also a secret potion for happiness and well-being, and being happy always makes you more attractive.

, No one likes to be around someone who looks or smells bad. Every morning and night, brush your teeth for 2 minutes. Don't forget to floss; most cavities occur between teeth that are hard to clean with a brush. Wash your hands after using the bathroom, keep your nails clean, shower with soap, and wear antiperspirant.


A lack of hygiene is a huge red flag for interpersonal relationships; after, if you aren’t willing to take care of yourself, why should anyone else be?

"
"
Wear clean clothes.,
Choose classy, modest styles.,
Wear practical shoes.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside3," To be honest, most of your clothes can be worn a few times before being washed, but always remember this rule of thumb: if you don't want it on your nose, don't wear it.


Pants are not as noticeable as shirts (pretty much all jeans look alike) and can be worn more times in a row than anything else. Just be sure they stay relatively clean and don’t lose their shape; jeans can become stretched out after just a few uses.

, Many fashions promote revealing styles that are tight-fitting, attention-grabbing, low-cut, etc. Dressing up every once in a while is part of being young and beautiful, but for everyday stuff, your best bet is attractive, modest, flattering clothes that don’t draw undue attention to your body.


If you have a nice figure, it will be obvious in modest clothes.
If attracting a boyfriend is one of your goals, you may be surprised to find out how many men actually prefer it when things are left to the imagination. More importantly, a lot of the guys who want to see women in ridiculous little outfits aren’t the ones you want to be attracting in the first place.

, Don't be that girl who has to sit out of the soccer game because she can't play in her mini-skirt and wedges; it’s much more attractive to be comfortable and to participate. High heels should be reserved for special dress-up occasions. Low heels or pumps can work in many situations if they’re sturdy and comfy. The rest of the time, wear cute athletic shoes, sensible leather lace-ups, or whatever else fits the bill for everyday life.

"
"
Leave the past behind.,
Be confident.,
Appreciate your uniqueness.,
Maintain your integrity.,
Keep a journal.,
Set goals for yourself.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside4," Whatever has happened before, it's over now. Accept the lessons you've learned, and try to move on. Remember: if you think about it every day, you're still allowing it to control you.


Seek professional help, if necessary. A counselor or therapist can help you overcome self-confidence issues and be your best self.

, Even if you're feeling really down about yourself, act confident. You don't have to pretend to be something you're not, but don't announce to the world you're upset. Stay calm and collected. You will be respected if you show your feelings, but in a confident way.

, You are a beautiful individual with your own personality and talents. Only by appreciating your potential will you be able to nurture your gifts and offer something to the world.

, Don't do anything you might regret later or you’ll lose your self-respect. Not only that, but secrets have a way of getting out -- and when they do, people’s negative judgments of you might poison your own sense of self. Be honest and ethical and, most importantly, have a little backbone!


Stand up for what’s right. If someone puts you down, be your own knight in shining armor; no one has a right to treat you with disrespect. Do the same if someone else is being abused. Don’t be afraid to stand up -- even if it means standing alone; remember, it only takes one person to make a huge difference.
Respect yourself and your body. Think twice about drinking liquor, smoking cigarettes, and eating bad food. Illegal drugs should be avoided. And be careful if/when you engage in sexual activity.

, Write in it as often as you can and you’ll soon discover that it’s worth the time: it’ll not only give you a chance to reflect on your relationships and experiences, but also help you consider who you are and who you want to be. While you’re at it, keep a record of the good things in your life. You may be surprised how blessed you really are.


If you think it's nerdy or uncool, don't worry; it can be private and no one needs to know you keep it.

, Ride the momentum of all this soul-searching into a better future. Start with one or two goals (ex. lose 10 pounds, make the volleyball team, make the 'A' honour roll, save money and buy new clothes, etc.) and, once you’ve made headway on them, set a few more. Make a habit of knowing what you want and getting it.


It may help to make a new sheet of paper for each goal and write why you want to do it, how you'll make this happen, and when you’ll have it done by.

"
"
Try new things.,
Educate yourself as much as possible.,
Devote 15 to 30 minutes of every day to developing a special talent.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside5," Whenever the opportunity arises to do something interesting that you’ve never tried before, seize it! If you get invited to go skiing, accept. If a new ethnic restaurant opens in your area, give it a shot. Experiencing new and different activities will not only make you a more balanced person, but also get you in the habit of becoming a life-long learner.

, Although getting a traditional education should be a first priority, also remember that life is full of learning experiences; you don't have to be in a classroom to acquire knowledge.


Do your best at school. People look up to smart, active people in the community.
Don't be afraid to ask for help from teachers and other students. There's no such thing as a stupid question; that's how you learn!
Read! Read bestsellers, classic literature, how-to manuals, self-help books, and pieces you don’t necessarily agree with. Always carry around a book to read so that you can fill your heart and mind with good things and great ideas.

, This could be playing an instrument, painting, welding, tutoring, cooking, or building miniature wooden space hamsters; the important thing is to have fun while becoming really good at something. Doing this will build your self-confidence and create opportunities to have fun with friends and your future partner.

"
"
Make an extra effort to get to know the people in your world.,
Recognize true beauty.",How to Be a Normal Good Looking Girl from Inside and Outside6," Learn to enjoy finding out about others by talking to them -- and not just about yourself. The better you understand others, the better you’ll understand yourself.

, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone is beautiful in their own way. Be supportive of other people’s processes; everyone needs help at some point in their life -- and when it’s your turn, people will happily repay your kindness.


Don’t put others down, tell them they're stupid or ugly, or call attention to their flaws. Everyone has flaws, but by learning to recognize the positive things in others, you’ll be able to appreciate and develop them in yourself.

"
"
Make introductions.,
Say please and thank you.,

Leave your elbows off of the table.,
Cut your food into bite-sized portions.,
Only grab for things on the table that are within your reach.,
Remember to use your napkin.,
Make proper thanks.",How to Be a Lady," If you are talking to one person and another person approaches, introduce the person you were initially talking to the person who has just arrived.


In the business world, the order in which introductions are made depends on a person’s level of “importance;"" in other words, on his or her level of seniority within the company. In such an example, you would first introduce the person of higher importance to the person of lesser importance, and then vice versa. Remember that the client is always of the highest seniority, regardless of his or her title.
Add a thoughtful detail about the person you are introducing, when possible. Rather than just stating the person’s name, also introduce his or her title, or how you know this person.;
, While this may sound like an etiquette cliché, forgetting to say these things (even by accident) will not go unnoticed, and comes across as very rude.


Say thank you anytime somebody does you a favor, however big or small; it will show him or her that you appreciated it.
Always thank a host/hostess after attending a party or other special occasion at his or her home. Consider sending a “thank you” text, phone call, or email the following day.
Always thank people for gifts they have given you. You may want to consider writing the person a note thanking them.
Don’t abuse the words “please” and “thank you.” Using them excessively will devoid them of their meaning, and make you appear weak. For example, if a waiter pulls your chair out for you, unfolds your napkin, and then pours you a glass of water, then thank him/her one time at the very end of the action, rather than once after each gesture.
Add details when thanking others. Rather than just saying “Thanks” to a friend for talking you through an issue, say “Thank you for being so understanding. It really means a lot to me.” This will come across as more sincere.

, Being polite doesn’t mean being passive and letting others take advantage of you. It is important to learn how to politely tell people no.


If somebody offers you alcohol or a cigarette and you are not interested, then kindly thank the person and refuse. Giving in against your will sends the impression that you are easily impressionable.
Similarly, if a man is attempting to “pick you up” or is getting physically aggressive with you, then stand up for yourself and tell him to back off. If necessary, call or ask for help.

, A lady is eloquent and can carry a conversation. This requires being well-read and staying up-to-date on the current events of the world. While this doesn’t necessarily require formal education, attaining the highest possible level of education that you can will be to your benefit.


If you are not enrolled in school, then find alternative ways to educate yourself. Read plenty of books (both fiction and non-fiction), read the news, and attend seminars and/or discussions.
Thanks to the internet, most people have free access to an endless array of scholarly articles on various topics at the touch of a button.
Many college campuses allow people to sit in on lectures without receiving academic credits. Be sure to clear this with the institute before dropping in on classes, however.

, Standing and sitting up straight are signs of a true lady. As an added bonus, having good posture is better for your back, and will help strengthen up your core! It will take some training to get used to this, especially if you are accustomed to slouching.

, Being a lady isn't just about looking or behaving properly on the outside; it involves being a good person on the inside.


When talking to another person, give him or her your undivided attention. It is polite, and will make for a more stimulating conversation for both parties.
Don't interrupt or talk over others.
Offer your help to those in need. This can be as simple an act as helping an elderly person carry his or her groceries, or a more generous act like volunteering at a homeless or animal shelter.

, A true lady doesn't just sit there quietly and let the world pass her by. She engages with other people, carries stimulating conversations, and is a subtle flirt.


If you don't know how to be charming, start off by smiling more at people when you talk to them, and complimenting people more. Make your compliments personal; for example, instead of complimenting a person's shoes, tell them that you think they have impeccable sense of fashion.

, Being a lady requires having self-control and will power, and each of these activities is an example of overindulgence.

, When you are a guest in somebody else's home, allow the host/hostess to tell you where to sit, where to leave your purse, whether or not to take off your shoes, and so on.


Remember that some people are more protective over their home environment than others. Use your best judgment to determine how to behave.

, It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, offering to hold the door open for other people is respectful and friendly.

, Avoiding lashing out at others if you are annoyed, angry, or upset. Remain poised, and handle the situation rationally and calmly. This will prevent you from doing or saying things in the heat of the moment that you will regret later.

, This will keep you looking and smelling your best, and more importantly, prevent infections and other illnesses.


Shower daily. If you don't want to wash your hair everyday, then wear a shower cap and rinse your body with soap and water.
Brush your teeth every morning and evening. Brushing in between meals can further improve the health and appearance of your teeth and gums.
Wear deodorant. Smelling your best is just as important as looking your best.
Maintain your waxing, shaving, and/or tweezing regimen. Getting rid of unwanted body hair can instantly make you look and feel more attractive and leave you with smooth, touchable skin.

, This means dressing appropriately for the occasion, your body type, and your age. Use your best judgment to determine what clothes are most appropriate for you.


Buy fewer but better quality clothes which will last; wearing cheap, throwaway items isn't good for your new image
Don't try to squeeze into clothes that don't fit you.
Start to wear skirts or dresses rather than pants. They bring out your femininity and show off your curves better than pants do and you will feel much more elegant and feminine. And nothing says 'lady' more loudly that a girl wearing a smart skirt when all her friends are wearing jeans.
Don't go bare-legged. Always wear tights or pantyhose.
Don't feel obliged to wear high heels if you find them uncomfortable - flat shoes are just as good.
Don't wear sweatpants or tracksuits unless you are at the gym or exercising. Wearing these around all day suggest that you pay very little attention to your physical appearance.

, Iron your clothes to remove any wrinkles, and be sure to wash your clothes if they are stained.

, Elegance requires minimalism; wear makeup to accentuate your beauty, not to cover it up.


Don't show excessive cleavage or wear bare-midriff tops. These types of revealing clothes suggest that you are not dressing for yourself, but rather, to attract men.

, If you are at a restaurant, wait until everybody’s meal has arrived before you start to eat. When at a dinner party, wait for the host/hostess to unfold his or her napkin and begin eating.

, It is not only rude, it can actually ruin other peoples’ appetites.


Also avoid burping, smacking your lips, or fidgeting at the dinner table.
If you have to cough or sneeze at the table, be sure to cover your mouth with a napkin.

, If you need to get up from the table to go to the restroom, let others know where you are going.

, Not only will it disturb other patrons if you are in a restaurant, it is disrespectful to the person/people you are eating with, especially if one of them has cooked the meal for you. Wait until the end of the meal to make phone calls.


Turn off or silence your phone during formal dinners.

, This rule applies only when you are actually eating. If the food has not yet arrived, or if you are sitting at a table drinking water or other beverages, then it is acceptable to rest your elbows on the table.

, Not only is it healthier than taking huge bites, it will give you the opportunity to quickly chew and swallow your food if somebody asks you a question when you have food in your mouth. Nothing is more frustrating (and embarrassing) than having somebody ask you a question right after you have taken a huge bite of food!

, Otherwise, ask somebody to please hand it to you.


Always pass the salt and pepper shaker together, even if the person only asks for one of them. These items are meant to be kept together at all times.

, Clean your fingers or blot your lips when necessary.

, Be sure to thank the waiter/waitress if you are at a restaurant, and thank the host/hostess if you are at a dinner party. Compliment the food when dining with the person who has cooked it.

Be an Italian-American.,
Exercise as much as possible.,
Drink juices and shakes.,
Tan your body.,
Participate in nightlife.,
Learn the guido poses.",How to Be a Guido1," To truly be a guido, you have to have Italian heritage. Don’t fake being Italian to fit in with guido culture. The classic guido is from the Jersey-New York area and has an accent to prove it., If you’ve seen the Jersey Shore, you’ll see that these guys are ripped. To reach this level of physical physique, you will need a gym membership and a lot of determination. First, set goals for improving your strength. For example, if you bench press 120 lbs, set a goal to raise that amount in small increments.


Work on compound exercises, or lifts that exercise multiple muscles and joints. This includes deadlifts, squats, presses, rows, and chinups.
Let your muscles recover to allow them to grow. The best way to let your muscles recover is by getting enough sleep at night. Try going to bed thirty minutes earlier than usual.Abs might be the best muscle group to focus on. Abs are the reason The Situation received his nickname. It was because his abs stopped someone who couldn’t believe how toned his abs were., As said on the Jersey Shore, “My ideal man would be Italian, dark, muscles, and a 'juice-head'.”Pre and post workout nutrition is imperative for serious muscle gain. Following a serious juice and shake routine can also improve many health functions in your body. Buy a juice machine to save you money from buying juices out and at the gym. Try out this easy recipe that might normally cost $10 from the store:


1 ½ Granny Smith apple
4 Kale leaves
8 Parsley Sprigs
4 Celery stalks
1 Cucumber
½ Lemon, peeled, It may not always be ideal to go tanning out in the sun. Join a tanning salon or invest into spray on tans. The guido archetype is dark and this isn’t always achieved naturally. The guido lifestyle values products and cosmetics., You have to dance to truly act like a guido. An integral part of dancing is doing the fist pump. You can incorporate moving your hips and legs to the beat while pumping your fists to the beat. The most popular nightlife of guidos are clubs that play dance/pop music.


One of the major aspects of nightlife is dressing the part.

, Guidos have several poses that identify what type of mood and attitude they currently have. While many of these poses are for the camera, many of them can be used as a greeting or farewell. These are a few of the poses of a guido:


Fist-pump. This is a staple pose and dance move. All it requires is that you pump one fist up into the air. Imagine the radio is playing Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars and it throws you into a “hyped” move.
Alcohol shot. This is a pose that is used when posing for a camera at a party. Grab the whole bottle of a liquor like Grey Goose, and raise it up as though you are toasting the camera.
Backwards peace sign. This is a classic pose that spans across several groups of people. Make the peace sign towards the camera or person and turn your hand so your palm faces you. The peace sign consists of you extending your index and middle fingers together.
Duckface. You can incorporate the duckface, or kissing face, into any of these poses. You could also use the duckface by itself, or with a group of people.
Abs pose. Again, abs are valued highly in the guido culture. The ab pose means that you lift your shirt to pose your abs to the camera."
"
Style your hair.,
Craft your facial hair.,
Wear graphic t-shirts.,
Wear open shirts.,
Keep your clothes clean.,
Wear accessories.",How to Be a Guido2," You can do a lot of things to your hair, but the key is your ability to use products. If you have long hair, you’ll need to have it cut to be able to pull off the several hairstyles of the guido. Bring in a picture of the Jersey Shore males’ haircuts to the barber. You’ll need various hair products such as hair gel and hair glue. Here are a few examples of guido hairstyles:


The blowout. The blowout is when all your hair sticks straight up. There are variations, such as the Brooklyn blowout, which involves a meticulous fade on the back.
The spiker. The spiker hairstyle is similar to the blowout, but you additionally spike all your hair. Spiking your hair means gathering small portions of your hair and then spiking it straight up with product.
The fohawk. A fohawk is a mohawk that doesn’t require you to shave off the side portions of your head. Instead, you gather all your hair to the middle of your head using hair glue., If you decide to grow facial hair, you need to take steps to make it look clean. Do not let your facial hair grow for more than three days without styling. The key to the guido facial hair is keeping the hair thin. Here are a few styles you can try out:


Chinstrap. This means that your facial hair extends underneath your jawline.
Soul Patch. The soul patch is a small patch of hair underneath your lip and above your chin.
Goatee. The goatee is facial hair that only surrounds your mouth. It means no facial hair on your cheeks or underneath your jawline., T-shirts are acceptable when they contain a large graphic print on them. Popular clothing companies that make this style of t-shirts are Ed Hardy and Armani. Many popular graphics that are popular on guido shirts are crosses, skulls, and ships.


The key to wearing t-shirts in the guido style is that the shirt is too small. This will make your muscles bulge and make you look like your buff., Another popular top for a guido is the button down shirt. The key to wearing the button down shirt is to undo most of the buttons, revealing your chiseled torso., You should wash your clothes before wearing them. If you don’t have an ironing board and iron, invest in one. You’ll need to iron your clothes before going out to look fresh.

, There are several different accessories that can compliment your outfit in the guido style. These are the types of caps you could wear: flat brimmed baseball hats, fedoras, sweatbands, and bandanas. Another popular accessory is a cross or a dog-tag necklace.


Gold or silver watches that are large will also add to your outfit."
"
Be appropriate and respectful.,
Get a wig.,
Dressing the part.,
Use tanning makeup.",How to Be a Guido3," If you plan to go to a party as a guido, you need to be sure not to offend anyone. However you dress up and act, make sure nobody feels offended or disrespected. Guido themed parties and costumes are popular and typically don’t cross boundaries.


If you are confronted by someone offended, back down from the outfit and apologize.

, If you don’t want to cut your hair or expose it to strong chemicals, invest in a black wig. Once you have the wig, you can style it the same way you would as if it were your own hair. Use the aforementioned styles like the fohawk, blowout, or spiker.

, Search your wardrobe for slim fitting t-shirts or button down dress shirts. Go to a thrift store or secondhand clothing store to look for graphic print t-shirts. While you’re at the clothing store see if you can find any gold necklaces you could use for your costume.

, To easily convey a fake tan, wear a topical tanning cream on your face. You can also use a darker shade of foundation to your face. If you feel like going all out, purchase a temporary spray on tan."

, When things happen in life, you have to realize that they will pass on. Don't freak out at all when things happen. Instead, you could walk away, ignore, etc. There is normally a way out of things. If not, try relaxing your way out of situations.

, Accessories should probably be red, orange, green, and purple. Wear tank tops, t-shirts, leggings, ballet flats, maxi skirts, capris, and trench coat. Carry around with you a hobo bag and wear stud and hope earrings. They say that when you wear only black, it makes you look slimmer. So try wearing black a lot, but not appear as a goth. You should have at least 3 pairs of black tank tops. Also, wear a beret and fedora if you can, preferably black.

, If you have nappy, definitely wear it in an Afro.

, If you do try to wear makeup, try wearing only red lipstick.

, You could even doodle if you want. Write poems about anything on your mind. It doesn't even have to rhyme. It could be a free verse poem.

,, Let your hair out. One style that would be perfect is to wear an Afro if you can.

, Have at least 2 lava lamps in your room, one purple and the other green. Your walls should be a light brown and your bedding should be a cheetah pattern. You should have a black rug also.

, Try reading somethings you like at first, but then grasp for another genre of books that are out of interests. This can make you curious.

, Decorate with stickers of saxophones, pianos, trumpets, and music notes.

, If you can't find them, then you must be unique.

, Go to Starbucks and read a book there or go to Barnes and Noble and go to their Starbucks cafe there. It's a cafe inside a book/music store, which is perfect. You can get to enjoy your coffee and pastry with your book.

, Don't ever shout out. You are in school to learn, not to talk. Focus on school! But, if the teacher isn't talking and you're done with you work, you could write more poetry.

, They will probably be bored with their 'opinion' and leave you alone.

, You must expose your creativity somewhere, so why not onstage. Remember that the audience will love you.

, Do things that relaxes you in your time. Be a laid back person and yet do something that makes you shine.

Don't be a girly girl.",How to Be a Mean Girl," Regina has power. Part of the reason she's readily handed this by others is because she's beautiful and always, always, always put together. As much as it sucks, the world will look at you and label you by what they see on the outside. So if you want the power to be mean, you gotta get the look. You have to be intimidating. And what are girls intimidated by? Beautiful girls.


Be fashionable. This might mean following current trend, but it also means starting your own. Pick out your outfits very carefully and make sure your clothes fit you well. Keep to a certain look to give you an identity.
Carry a purse. In this purse, keep a bit of makeup. Even in gym class, Regina George has her look together. She is successful because she's mastered the details. The lip gloss, the accessories -- she's always prepared.;
, If you're mean to everyone, you'll just be a flat out witch that no one will have any reason to like. You must act like your approval is hard to come by -- only a few are worthy of your praise, you picky little thing, you. When people see that they don't measure up to your standards, they'll want to try harder.


Be nice to the few openly. Others need to see that you can be a really sweet person when someone is deserving of it. Choose those that you are nice to sparingly and stay consistent. These people will be your closest friends.

, If someone else wants something, you take it anyway. After all, why not? Someone's gonna get it and it might as well be you. If that's a boy, great. If it's a smart girl's homework, wonderful.


If people don't offer things, ask. Create opportunities to make them feel close to you. Ask a girl for the nail polish she's sporting. She'd love that you want her look. If you forgot your lunch money, mention it to a cute boy -- he'll want to swoop in and rescue you. Basically, seize the smaller moments.

, Regina is always ready with a biting, ready-to-wound-but-not-too-obviously insult. If someone is giving you a hard time, give them a hard time back. But be subtle -- they need to wonder if you meant what they thought you meant.


If someone accuses you of being mean, simply say, ""I'm not being mean -- I'm just standing up for myself. Nothing's wrong with that. You should try it sometime -- I bet you get sick of being a pushover. No one likes a pushover anyway."" Pad your insults to aid in misdirection. Or you can just straight up say ""Shut up, Allison. Nobody likes you and your tacky new haircut anyways."" Flip your hair and walk away.

, When it comes to boys, your personality needs to be a bit more refined. You should still expect things (and take them), but it needs to be done coyly and with a smile. They should feel graced by your attentions, so only give them out sparingly. What boy is good enough for you anyway? Don't forget: boys (and people in general) are there solely to be used and manipulated by you!



Smile. No one who's mean smiles, right? Be happy to see and talk to them -- they'll look over your meanness because they don't see it firsthand themselves.

, Remember how Regina George stopped that one girl in the hallway with the vintage skirt and told her she loved it? And then she turned around and made a ""bletch"" sound? Just. Like. That. Vintage girl has walked away thinking she's the tops and Regina is super sweet. Now, Regina has the power. Power. Control. Manipulation.


Let's say you do the exact same thing. All of a sudden, Vintage girl walks up to you and asks you if you'd like to walk to gym together, since she knows you're in the same class. You might say, ""Are you sure we're in the same class? I've never seen you in it before. But I'm sorry; I'm supposed to meet Gretchen.""

Those magic words ""I'm sorry"" keep Vintage girl from being able to go postal on you, even though you're probably so offended that she would even speak to you! What's more, you posed your insult as a question. It may seem nicer, but it's not being nice if you don't mean it.



, If you go overboard with your meanness, soon enough all the adults will be against you. When authority doesn't live with you, you'll have problems. So make sure the adults don't see this side of you.


Be a good student. When you're a good, well-behaved student, it's hard for teachers to come around to the fact that you're mean. And if you're nice to them, it'll be all the more difficult.

, Sometimes when you have high expectations of people, they yearn to meet them. So when people don't meet them, make it known. The idea here is that no one should want to disappoint you -- in fact, they should want to go above and beyond. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.


Let's say you're in an English project with a few girls who aren't your friends. One said she'd bring in poster paper on Monday, but she forgot it at home. Could you possibly come over after school to complete it? No, you can't. You have plans. She should've remembered -- it's totally slowing down the progress of the group. She'll have to do some work tonight and meet up tomorrow.

, In order to balance out your meanness, the other side of you has to be an absolute angel. This is the girl who never does anything wrong -- but if she does, she has a good reason. Never take the blame for anything; always have an excuse or a scapegoat.


So, Karen heard that you told Gretchen her butt was getting big. Oh, no, no! That's out of context. Gretchen was telling you that Karen was getting totally fat. She just wouldn't stop! So to make her shut up, you agreed that maybe her butt was getting bigger, but the rest of her looked the same. In fact, you wish your butt were a bit bigger too. Then you suggest going out for you with Karen, because you want her to feel better.

, Even if you've met someone 50 times, forget their name. Or fake it. You know they're in your math class and have been going to the same school as you for 6 years, but they don't have to know you know it.


This really irritates people. If they do start to get really irritated (""Are you being serious? You just asked me for my homework last week. What is your problem?""), you may want to come around. Brush it off as a momentary lapse that is no big deal. Your nonchalance will make them wonder if they overreacted.

, You're talented and beautiful, no matter what people think. You may not be perfect, but nobody is. Learn to be, act, look and feel confident. You'll be amazed at how much power simply acting confident will give you.


Think of it like this: when kids sneak into a movie theater, who are the ones who get caught? The ones that are giggling, looking around, and moving too fast. The ones that are cool, calm, and collected sneak right in, no questions asked -- because they look like they belong. When you're confident, put simply, you can get away with more.

, Learn to do things by yourself and only ask for help when you're desperate. You need no one. Depending on someone else requires you to need them -- something you want to avoid.


Being independent, being alone, will strengthen you not to depend on others for their validation. When you're less concerned with what others think of you, the world opens up for you to do what you please.

, People may not like it, but they'll respect your honesty. As long as you stick to the truth, it'll be hard to argue with you.


Be ready for others to treat you the same way. When you don't have social manners or subscribe to normal social etiquette, others will see that and feel more comfortable attacking you in the same way you attacked them. If you say, ""You clearly didn't pass the test because your intelligence is below average"" (while possibly true), the other is going to feel immediately wounded and probably retort with something to top you, something ridiculous, like ""I'd rather not pass tests than have a face only a mother could love, like yours."" Get ready for people to be harsh to you back.

, They'll encourage your confidence and the way you stick up for yourself, as opposed to shy girls that take any abuse hurled at them. You will need some support as this new change will be hard to keep up 24/7.


These girls are going to be the hardest to stay consistent with. You want them to know they have your approval...but only for now. Because if they turn into a mean girl to you, they need to be ousted, too. Be strong with them, but also keep them on your side. ""He called you fat? Okay, you do need to lose some weight, but I'd like to lose a few pounds too. Let's do it together.""

, We all know who they are and how destructive they can be. Never be nice to her -- even better, ignore her. Make her aware that you don't like her, and you're not afraid of her either.


You don't want to be downright mean to her unless you are aware of the consequences of your actions and are okay with them. But if you go too far, you'll sink too low and she'll be the better one. If you can, just ignore her. Treating someone with indifference feels worse than hatred -- at least with hatred, you care enough to spout off. If you treat them indifferently, you couldn't care less about their existence. That's the stuff that hurts.

, If you vary your moods or choices as you please, people will become wary of you. They may also get exhausted of this, so do this at the right time in the right places. This means being really mean and really nice.


Switch up your meanness with the occasional sweet moment -- it'll totally throw people off and it'll be fun watching their reactions. Stop a girl in the hallway to tell her you really enjoyed her book report. Tell another one that they did really well at the volleyball game on Thursday. It may seem like just one teeny comment, but when the rest of your comments have been negative, it's exponentially more powerful.

, Giggling, wearing pink everything, and acting like a pre-schooler is not going to work. Be whatever you like, but make people aware of your mean potential. You mean business, not simply 6th-grade girl moodiness.


Being mean will only work if you're mature about it. Being a tattletale isn't mean, it's dumb; people have no tolerance for it. But if you're mature, assertive, honest, and don't suffer fools, that's something people will have a harder time finding fault with. Be smart about your new-found aggression.

Don't give too much.,
Don't be boring.",How to Be a Nice Guy," Helpfulness is one of the hallmarks of a nice guy. Look for ways that you can be more helpful to everyone around you, and remember that even small gestures are appreciated.Pay attention to how your friends and loved ones are feeling. If they seem overwhelmed by something, always offer to help them in whatever way you can. For example, if your mom is stressed out about a party she is hosting, offer to help clean the house or pick up the groceries she needs.
Help people you don't know as well. You can do this by volunteering for charitable organizations, or even just by helping a stranger pick up a stack of papers that he dropped in the hallway.
Don't expect to get anything in return. Kindness is often repaid, but your goal should not be to be rewarded for your helpfulness.;
, Nice guys take the time to really listen when someone is talking to them. The next time you're having a conversation with someone, be sure to listen attentively and respond in a meaningful way.Avoid distractions that might make the other person think you're not listening. Always put your phone away when you're having a conversation and maintain eye contact to show that you are fully engaged.
Don't interrupt people, even if you think you know what they're about to say. Always let them finish talking before you share your thoughts.

, Nice guys always express gratitude when other people do nice things for them. No matter how big or small the gesture, always say thank you when someone else does something nice for you.Consider doing something nice in return. For example, if a friend surprised you with concert tickets, consider treating her to lunch the next time you see her.
Be grateful to people you don't know too. If a stranger holds the elevator for you, for example, be sure to thank her.

, Happiness is contagious and it makes people want to spend time with you. The happier you are, the nicer you will be perceived by others, so make an effort to smile and laugh a little more each day.Always smile when you see somebody, whether you know them or not. Your smile might just make someone else's day a lot brighter.
Smiling and laughing will also make you feel happier, which will make it much easier to be nice to other people.

, People do not like liars, so it's very important to be open and honest with everyone. This includes never pretending to be someone you're not, even if you think it will make people like you more.While it's important to tell the truth, be sure to consider how the truth might hurt someone else's feelings, and always weigh the pros and cons before you say something potentially hurtful. For example, it may be a good idea to tell a friend that his girlfriend is cheating on him, but it's probably not a good idea to tell him that you think his shoes are ugly (unless he asks).
If you have already lied to someone, consider coming clean and telling the truth. It will take a lot of weight off of your shoulders, and the other person will probably appreciate your honesty.

, Nice guys should treat everyone respectfully. Start paying particular attention to the way you treat women, whether they're strangers, friends, or loved ones, to make sure that you're not being unintentionally offensive.Avoid using diminutives like ""babe"" or ""hun"" with friends and acquaintances. Many women find these terms belittling (although they may be acceptable if you're in a relationship with the woman).
Avoid talking about women's bodies. This can make them feel uncomfortable and objectified, even if you're being complimentary.
If you're in a relationship, never pressure a woman to do something she's not ready for.

, Nice guys are not hotheads, so if you have a problem with anger, you need to start working on it. Getting rid of anger will not only help others perceive you as a nice guy, but it will also help you feel much happier.Yoga and meditation can help you calm your mind and release stress, so consider incorporating these into your routine if you need more calmness in your life.

, In order to feel like a nice guy, it's important that you not hold on to grudges. No matter how badly another person has hurt you, make the decision to forgive instead of seeking vengeance.Forgiving does not necessarily mean that you need to accept the harmful action as acceptable; it simply means that you need to make the decision to not let the action affect you any longer.Forgiving is easier if you can start to think about the person who harmed you as a good person who did a bad thing, instead of villainizing the individual., Nice guys are not self-centered, which means that they are always aware of how their words and actions will affect others. If you want to be nicer, be sure to always take other people's feelings into consideration.The most successful nice guys consider how others think, how they feel, and how they are likely to act. This helps them engage with others in a way that is both kind and effective.
When you think about how others feel, being polite and respectful should come naturally. If you think that something you say or do might be offensive to another person, don't do it., No one is perfect all the time, and it can be easy to think that you are a bad person just because you lashed out at someone or did something else that you're not proud of. Unfortunately, thinking that you are a bad person makes you more likely to act like a bad person in the future, so it's extremely important that you don't judge yourself too harshly.The next time you do something that you're ashamed of, remind yourself that you are a good person who did something bad and that you will try not to do that bad thing again. Do not fall into the trap of believing that one bad action is a reflection of who you are as a person.
Keep in mind that feeling guilty about doing a bad thing is an indication that you really are a good person. If you were a bad person, you wouldn't feel guilty at all.

, People sometimes make the false assumption that nice guys are timid and insecure, so you need to prove them wrong! This means overcoming shyness, if this is a problem for you, and standing up for yourself if people are taking advantage of you.Just because you're a nice guy does not mean that you have to let people walk all over you. You can set boundaries to let people know how you expect to be treated without being a jerk. If someone treats you badly, don't be afraid to let them know that it is unacceptable.
Being outgoing, social, and self-confident can help you be a nice guy without all of the negative associations.

, Helping others is great, but if you help others so much that you begin to neglect yourself, you've gone too far. Try to find a balance between taking care of others and taking care of yourself.It's okay to say no to others if you feel that you are over-committed. Being a nice guy does not mean helping everyone with everything all the time, but rather helping people whenever you are reasonably able to.
Being too generous can also make people see you as a poor leader. If you want to be a strong leader, you may need to be careful about how much you are willing to give to others., For some reason, people often assume that nice guys are dull, inexperienced, and uninteresting. This is a completely false stereotype, so show everyone around you that you are both nice and interesting.Develop unique hobbies or travel to interesting places. This will give you plenty of fascinating things to talk about, so people will never think you're boring.
Do something unpredictable every so often, whether it's going on a last-minute road trip or trying a new activity that's out of your normal comfort zone.
There are lots of nice things that you can do that other people will also find very interesting. For example, traveling to help people who survived natural disasters, volunteering to help build houses for the poor, or organizing a fund raiser for a local charity are all great ways to do nice things for people without being boring or predictable.

Learn cowgirl history.,
Find out if this is the right choice for you.,
Visit a cattle ranch.,
Know that it’s not just about looking good.,
Get the cowgirl basics.,
Dress for the situation.,
Learn to ride a horse.,
Learn to rope cattle.,
Learn to barrel race.,
Have fun with it.",How to Be a Cowgirl," Knowing the origins of the cowgirl is essential to becoming a modern cowgirl.


Cowboys and cowgirls originated in Texas.
Although cowgirl history is not documented as well as cowboy history, we know that cowgirls existed during the Golden Age of the cowboy (1866-1886).While the men were either at war or driving thousands of cattle up north, cowgirls worked on the ranches, riding horses and caring for livestock.The modern cowgirl may also herd cattle and work on a ranch or farm, but cowgirl life today also involves riding in rodeos.;
, Becoming a cowgirl requires a great deal of hard physical work and commitment, and therefore isn’t for everyone.


You should be willing to learn how to do physical things like riding a horse and roping cattle.
If you don’t like working with animals, being outside, or getting dirty, you might want to rethink becoming a cowgirl.

, Learning how to work with cows is a traditional part of being a cowgirl, hence the title “cowgirl.”


Look online for a local farm or ranch that allows visitors, and see what it’s like to work in there for a day. You can also volunteer at a farm or ranch to learn the basics.
Many cattle ranches also offer tours that teach you about living and working with cattle.
You can learn a lot about cattle: how to feed cattle, how to herd cattle, how to wean cattle, even how to butcher cattle.

, Cowgirls do hard, physical work, and their clothing needs to be functional, not just stylish.


Many of the stylistic elements associated with being a cowboy or cowgirl actually have a practical origin.
Because cowgirls work with large animals, they will often be covered in dirt, blood, spit, and snot. It may sound gross, but it is a reality of the lifestyle.There is a lot of stylish, practical cowgirl clothing available online or at Western clothing stores.

, There are some items of clothing that every cowgirl needs in her wardrobe both for work and for play.


Denim jeans - they are comfortable, durable, wash easily, and protect your legs from getting cut or chafed. Boot cut jeans are best when you’re wearing cowgirl boots.
Long-sleeved shirts - they can be worn all year long. In the summer, cowgirls will wear breathable, long-sleeved shirts to protect their arms while they’re out in the hot sun all day. In the winter, a thicker long-sleeved shirt helps keep the cowgirl warm.
Boots - these are essential to a cowgirl’s wardrobe. They were created to easily and comfortably fit into stirrups, protect the wearer from scratches and snake bites, and provide traction when leading horses or cattle, but are now made to be more stylish as well.Hats - they will protect a cowgirl’s face from getting burned, and also protect her eyes from the sun.
Dresses and skirts - they can be in any style, but good, clean denim is always in style for a cowgirl. Part of the fun of cowgirl fashion is wearing pretty dresses and cute denim skirts out to a concert, steak dinner, or the rodeo.
Nice boots - they should be more decorative and a maybe a little less functional than your work boots, because you'll be wearing them out to dinner or parties.

, Like anyone else, cowgirls don’t dress the exact same way for every occasion. Knowing what is appropriate to wear in different situations is important when it comes to cowgirl fashion.


A cowgirl isn’t going to wear a fancy dress out horseback riding or cattle-roping, just as she wouldn’t wear dirty jeans and muddy boots out to a nice dinner. Gauge what attire is appropriate for the situation.
Variety is important. Buy plenty of jeans and shirts for everyday wear, but also have dresses, nice shirts, dress pants, nice jeans, and fancy shoes in your closet for nicer occasions.
Make practicality your first concern with everyday dress, and style your second concern.

, A horse is the cowgirl’s closest companion, so an important step in acting like a cowgirl is learning to horseback ride.


Taking horse-riding lessons from a professional is the safest bet for beginners.
Many cities offer a variety of horseback riding classes suited for every age and experience level.
Know which type of riding lessons you want to take. Some different styles of riding are Western, Endurance, Saddle seat, and Racing.Western style is the most appropriate for a working cowgirl.



, After you’ve mastered Western style horseback riding, you can learn how to rope cattle while riding.


Cowgirls spend time on the ranch maneuvering cattle. Using a lasso to rope cattle and wrangle them is sometimes necessary.
Often, professional horseback riding coaches will also train you how to ride and lasso.

, Modern cowgirls often participate and compete in rodeos, and barrel racing is the most popular event for women.


Barrel racing can actually be a money-maker for an experienced cowgirl. Some cowgirls even compete in rodeos for millions of dollars.Cowgirls may also compete in cattle-related events like calf and steer roping.
Rodeo competitions are for cowgirls at very high skill levels only, so if you’re just starting out as a cowgirl, don’t think about entering a competition.

, Being a cowgirl is about hard work, but it is also about having fun.


Remember that horses are also pets, and you can have fun riding and caring for them. They offer companionship and love, just like any other pet, and can become your new furry best friend.
Going to rodeos, taking lessons, and meeting girls with similar interests are all great parts about being a cowgirl. Making new friends and having fun doing what you love is a cowgirl necessity.

Get the hair!,
Get the boots.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Keep your makeup natural and minimal.",How to Be a Country Girl1," Country girls love braids, volume, and curls. Your hair should be long, wavy and natural, preferably. Curly/wavy is preferred, but if it's straight, that's fine too. Country girls either have brunette, or red hair, or blonde (whatever your natural color is). Leave all the pink, purple, metallic and silver to the city girls!;
, Every country girl needs her boots! Have ones specially made for you or get some from your local store. Every country girl owns camo for hunting and owns a pair of either for riding, show, or work.

, When country girls aren't outside working and getting dirty, you can bet they're clean. Just because they work and sweat doesn't mean they can't smell like a tulip when the sun goes down. Shower regularly, brush your teeth twice a day, and don't forget to floss. Use deodorant and only one spritz of a flowery, summery, light perfume.

, You shouldn't look fake. Just fresh and pretty. If you do need a little coverage, a few drops of tinted moisturizer will even out your complexion without looking caked.


Dark circles are not fresh looking, so apply a light-reflecting concealer close to the lash line if you have them. Dust a little powder on top to set.
Curl your eyelashes. If you are blessed with naturally dark, long lashes, stop here. If not, apply 1-2 coats of brown mascara to the upper lashes only.
Apply a neutral blush to the apples of your cheeks. Use what is left on the brush after doing your cheeks to sweep on your forehead, nose, and chin.
Finish off the look with a clear or neutral gloss on the lips (no shimmer, please).

Determine whether or not you're a poseur.,
Get away from the stereotypes.,
Evaluate your music taste.,
You may want to try listening to some of these bands and genres if you haven't done so before.,
Look at your hobbies and interests.,
Look at your clothing style.",How to Know if You Are a True Goth," It's not uncommon for you to be trying too hard, but if you want to be honest with yourself, you need to answer this question: Am I trying to be something I'm not? If you want to fit in with a certain crowd, impress people or draw attention to yourself, you're only lying to yourself, and you may end up losing the true you. It's okay to like the Gothic fashion and not be a Goth, and it's okay to listen to the music and not be Goth. If you're forcing yourself to act a certain way or trying too hard to be something you truly aren't, then just stop, because when you lie to yourself, it is incredibly clear to others. If you simply admire certain aspects of the lifestyle, try just merging them in with your own style. The whole part of being a Goth is about being yourself and being unique: not a crowd follower.;
, Like anything that ventures away from the mainstream culture, the Goth lifestyle has been heavily labeled and stereotyped. If you are trying to discover whether this style suits you, it's important that you don't fall into any of the silly ""Goth Rules"" that poseurs or ignorant people may preach about. These include the commonly incorrect beliefs that:


All Goths wear black. Although a lot of Goths do wear black, there are so many different styles that you can explore with, from Cyber Goths to Romantic Goths. Corsets, long skirts, hair falls or cabaret outfits are only some of the clothing preferences that many Goths enjoy, and colors can be anything: even pink and black.
All Goths are depressed and suicidal. This is probably the most outrageously untrue of all the stereotypes. Many Goths possess a quirky, dark sense of humor, and everyone in the lifestyle is completely unique: nobody is the same. Although not every Goth in the world is happy, you don't have to be self harming or crying all the time to be a Goth.
Goths are into drugs, alcohol and sleeping around. This again, is completely untrue. Although of course, some Goths may be reckless, this all depends on your own personality, not whether you're Goth or not. Goths are as intelligent as anyone else.
Goths worship Satan or evil spirits: This is one of the reasons people wrongly assume Goths are ""freaks"". The vast majority of the time this is not true. There are many goths who are Atheist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Wiccan (who don't believe in Satan)... Just be yourself and believe, or not believe, in what you want to.

, While there are no ""rules"" to the subculture, it is a defined subculture with aspects, customs and traditions so something that is Goth will make you Goth. Taking a good look at your musical likes and dislikes can tell you a lot about yourself. Goth is a music based subculture. Therefore, someone who is listens to a large portion of Goth Rock is a Goth. As there are many different sub genres of Goth Rock, there are numerous genres of music and artists you may listen to.


These genres include Deathrock, Ethereal, Dark Cabaret, Darkwave, Post-Punk, and Gothic Rock. A lot of Goths also enjoy listening to Industrial music. Although fans of Industrial (also known as Rivetheads) often disassociate themselves with the Goth scene as Industrial has separate origins from Goth. However, Goths and Rivetheads are often consider siblings as both Goths and Rivetheads do share the same spaces on occasion. There are several other genres of music that aren't Goth but are commonly enjoyed by Goths. Such as EBM, Synth Pop, Electronic music, New Age, and Classical music. Being a Goth doesn't mean you have to listen to only Goth Rock. However, it does mean that a large portion of your favorite bands do come from within the Goth rock and it's sub genres.
Some influential bands include: The Cure, Bauhaus, Joy Division, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Sisters of Mercy, Faith and the Muse and The Damned.
You don't have to only listen to gothic rock or deathrock. Some people assume that you can only listen to goth music and while that is what makes you goth, you can listen to anything you want, just as long as your musical tastes contain goth music. If you force yourself to listen to only goth music, you may feel like you're putting yourself in a box and if you feel like that, you probably don't suit being part of a subculture. Being a goth is about being yourself and naturally fitting with the characteristics of the subculture, so if you feel perfectly comfortable listening to Lady Gaga while knowing you have some gothic rock in your music taste, and knowing that you're still goth then that's the way to go.

, Exploring your musical tastes can be a little overwhelming, so use the above as a guideline. If you enjoy these types of musics and artists, try exploring further, rather than listening to mainstream stuff if you don't particularly like it.

, Reflecting on the things you most enjoy doing is a good way to determine your personal tastes and styles. Although everybody is different, there are some common interests and activities that many Goths enjoy. These include:


Music. A lot of Goths have a deep understanding and passion for music, whether it be them singing or being in a band, or just listening. Of course, your musical tastes will also determine whether or not you suit the Gothic culture.
Writing. Poetry, stories and songs are all things that many Goths enjoy doing. Some main interests are Gothic stories and poems.
Reading. Goths are, as previously stated, as intelligent as anybody else. Some reading genres that some types of Goths enjoy are horror, supernatural, romance, drama or classics. You may enjoy vampire stories or classic literature. It can be poetry or stories.
Drawing. Goths tend to be more in touch with their artistic and creative side. However this is not a requirement in being Goth.

, Goth fashion is a major part of the subculture as well. Goth fashion originally started as fans dressing up like their favorite artists such as Siouxsie Sioux from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Andi Sexgang from Sex Gang Children, Robert Smith from the Cure, and Johnny Slut from Specimen. These days there are many different types of Goths fashion that have evolved. However there are some clothing items that are common to Goth fashion, such as:


Hair falls or bright or dark/deep hair colors.
A lot of Goths wear colors such as dark blue, deep purple, red or black. Not all of them, but a lot.
Corsets.*
Long skirts or extravagant dresses*, such as things from the Victorian era that include lace or ruffles, or a certain cabaret, classy over the top style like dress shirts or black suits and top hats and waistcoats.
Makeup such as dark eyeliner, deep colored lips and eye shadows. Some Goths like to go bright and over the top, such as Cyber Goths, but others stick to the Cabaret/Romantic/Victorian Goth image, with old fashioned, classy makeup or deep dark colors.
Boots, a common favorite of footwear.
Accessories such as chains, spikes, chokers or elegant jewelry. Piercings and tattoos may also be popular.
(*If you are in anyway uncomfortable with corsets and dresses, either due to claustrophobia or even just a non feminine gender identity you are not under obligation to wear them just to meet the fashion ""requirements"". People of all genders are also welcome and encouraged to hybridize their Goth look with punk, metal, and even ""kawaii"" pastel Goth elements to suit their individual personalities.)

Never turn down an opportunity to get down in the dirt.,
Learn to love animals.,
Know your stuff.",How to Be a Country Girl2," Country girls don't waste their lives inside watching TV and on the computer! They work hard, and they work for a reason. When they're not, they're outside with friends, being carefree, or simply lying in the sun, taking in some vitamin D!


A lot of country girls work on farms. This means bailing hay, milking cows, building fences, tending to livestock. You don't need to live on a farm to be country, but it certainly helps.
When not working, a country girl might simply like to take a hike, hang near a watering hole, or just be outside. Country girls are all pretty self-sufficient, which means that they learn to do things without much technology and without the help of others.
Lots of country girls go hunting, mudding, fishing, camping, horse riding, 4-wheeling, and most importantly, dancing! These are things that teens who live in the South do nearly every weekend.

, Country girls usually like watching and playing football, and often like horses. This doesn't mean they can't be girly though! Girlishness actually complements your country girl attitude. Country girls can also be very girly and, when accessorizing, get shiny and pink things, too.


Get involved with football. Country girls love their football, especially college football. Make sure you watch the games and know who your favorite team(s) is/are! If you don't have one, just go for your home team.
Learn to enjoy some traditional games. Cornhole, horseshoe pitch, and stock-car driving, to name a few, occupy a special place for a lot of country girls.

, Country girls are also hard workers not afraid to get dirty. Go outside and mow the lawn or help your dad on the car, etc.

, Have a lot of pets. Good country dogs are types of bloodhounds, coonhounds, retrievers, cattle dogs, and collies, to name a few. Basically any hound is great.


Don't just get an animal for the sake of having one. If you decide to get a pet, know that your responsibility is to take care of it and nurture it to adulthood, not abandon it as soon as it stops being cute and fluffy.
Dogs make a great hunting partner. If you're hunting turkey, grouse, duck, or quail, think about convincing your family to get a hunting dog to assist you. It's rewarding for the dog and gives you a hunting companion.

, Go to school and try to get good education. Learn all about the animal kingdom, too. Know the name of at least five mountains, lakes or farms. If you want to pursue a career off of being country, study biology, agriculture,(farming) zoology (animals), or marine biology.


Country girls might not know anything about operas or be ""sophisticated,"" but that doesn't mean they are dumb. In fact, country girls know a lot of practical knowledge and are very connected to nature. Don't play shallow or dumb just because you think that's what country is — it isn't!
Part of the education of a country girl is knowing how things work. Whether it's fixing the carburetor, plant hybridization, or just knowing how to prepare a perfect fillet, being “country smart” is all about knowing what's around you and how it works.

Mind your manners.,
Learn to love country music like Miranda Lambert, Josh Turner, Trisha Yearwood, Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Kellie Pickler, Toby Keith, Jason Aldean, Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Alan Jackson and Billy Ray Cyrus.,
Be sure to hold your own.,
Be proud to be a country girl.",How to Be a Country Girl3," ""Yes, ma'am"" and ""No, sir"" should always be in your vocabulary, right between ""please"" and ""thank you."" Don't talk southern if that's not your real voice—it'll come off as fake and possibly insulting. A girl from Alaska can be just as country as a girl from Alabama, even without the accent.

, These all should be household names to you.


Concerts are great places to listen to live music and hang out with friends. Try to go to a few shows to get a feel for what country music sounds like up close and in person!

, Country girls are mild-mannered, polite, and easy-going if you had to generalize; but they don't tolerate foolishness and they certainly aren't afraid to tell things like they are. Learn to trust your convictions and stand by them.


Faith is a cornerstone for many country girls, but it doesn't need to be. Many country girls are devout believers who go to church every Sunday and have a strong relationship with their congregation. If this is you, that's great; keep doing what you're doing. If that's not you, don't feel like you need to force it. Be yourself and good things will come.
Country girls respect their boys, but don't let them take advantage of anything. Country girls are sweet, sensitive, self-sacrificing. But they also demand loyalty and respect back from their men.

, Be proud of who you are and where you come from. People will respect that. If people say, ""I hate the country,"" don't get flustered or upset, but be friendly and act nice, so others will have nothing to hold against you. If you find out that they are putting you down, then still try to act nice, but don't act rude.


Country girls are bubbly, bright, strong-willing, funny, and down-to-earth people. Plus country girls are all full of fun and they love goofing around, especially if they're around sand, water and a sunset with a few beach chairs.
Be humble. Don't be arrogant. Country folk are kind, warm-hearted, and generous. Practice giving to other people not expecting anything in return. Practice giving people the benefit of the doubt.
Be fun and funny. Humor sure can keep you happy if you’re blue. Crack a funny joke every now and then! And don't be afraid to crack one about yourself sometimes; it shows you don't take yourself too seriously.
Be adventurous. Spend time outside and get to know the world.

",How to Have a Gothic Mind and Become Goth," Is it because you want to scare people, want to fit in or want to stand out? If it is, then stop right there. If it's because you love the Gothic subculture then feel free to continue. Remember, don't force yourself to become something you're not. You don't ""become"" Goth, you just are so there must have been something inside of you that feels you are part of the subculture to have looked up the article in the first place.;
, Research the Gothic subculture and learn as much as possible before proceeding. Do not skip this step because you will look like a poseur if you do. Real Goths get very confused if you've been calling yourself Goth for a long time and still don't know anything about it, this usually means you're a poseur and it's not really you. It also might mean that you're doing it for a different reason like attention-seeking/trying to stand out, because your friends are, any other reason other than because it's you.

, Goth bands come in many styles and it would take a long time to list them. To start listening you might want to start with classics like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Sisters of Mercy, Love and Rockets, The Mission UK, Fields of the Nephilim, The March Violets and The Cure (select albums). Then branch out to other others. If you want a more dance then try bands like V N V Nation, Suicide Commando or God Module (these bands are dark electro / EBM and is most commonly associated with Cyber Goths). If you want something lighter, try a band like Strawberry Switchblade, but bear in mind, these bands aren't Goth. Only Gothic rock/deathrock is actually Goth and CyberGoth and Victorian Goth are separate subcultures. Just because they use Goth in their name, doesn't actually make them Goth.

, You will most likely star off wearing simple black clothing, but at the style progresses you end up developing your style and looking less like a costume. Remember that Goth is a style, it is not a colour. You could dress all in white and still be considered Goth, like some European Goths.

, It's not needed but it is a big part of being goth. Some Goths don't wear make-up so if you don't feel comfortable wearing it, you don't need to. Nobody is making you. You can find YouTube tutorials on how to blend, draw your eyeliner on, how to apply lipstick and what foundation is right for you.

, The overall Gothic mindset and aesthetic is seeing beauty, embracing and accepting darkness. You might be interested in anything morbid and disturbing especially abandoned buildings, graveyards, serial killers, mass graves, murders, Creepy Pasta stories, Gothic architecture. Generally anything creepy, spooky and weird.

, You will get a few comments, stares and laughs. You just have to learn to put up with it. If you're really going to be yourself, there will be a lot of people who think you're doing it for attention or for another reason. It's best to just leave them to their ignorance because their opinion means little and should not effect you.

, This is essential for Victorian Goths if you have decided that is who you are. The Gothic subculture grew out of horror movies and Gothic literature so make sure to pick up a book by Edgar Allan Poe, Anne Rice, Bram Stoker or Mary Shelley and give it a try. Remember you can read any genre of books you want, you aren't just limited to reading Gothic or horror stories.

, You aren't just limited to watching Gothic movies because if you're watching The Crow one minute and the Princess Diaries the next, great. Some other movies Goths are particular interested in is anything by Tim Burton. Tim Burton seems to capture the mood quite well and it's shown through his movies. There is nothing wrong with watching the films of the books you're reading either such as Frankenstein or Dracula.

, Are you in shape? If not, you may want to consider going to the gym since vampires are idealistic creatures as far as appearance goes. They are seen as an object of attraction to all people, and the vast majority of the population likes toned, healthy bodies. It's also very beneficial for your health and will make you look better and more eye-catching in clothes.

, You don't have to be pale to look like a vampire, but you do need to have nice skin. Put on some sunscreen before you go out, it'll also help prevent skin cancer (even dark skinned people are at risk). To remain blemish free, you may want to invest in a face mask, cleanser, and blemish stick. All three may seem frivolous, but your skin will thank you and it will feel fantastic. Try for Tea Tree Oil at The Body Shop. They don't test on animals, and their products work wonders. Wash your face once in the morning, once at night.

, People believe that hair is your crowning glory. What does your hair say about you? Take time, and assess this in the mirror. Blondes should soak their hair in lemon juice 2-4 times every month. If you are not blonde, you should try mixing an egg with some mayonnaise and using it as a shampoo once every week or once every other week to make it shiny and healthy. If you are going to dye your hair, get it done by a professional. They will not let your hair get unhealthy like some box dyes do. To look like a vampire, you do not need jet black hair.

, Super straight hair or romantic waves are very vampiric. So, straighten your hair, use a curling iron, use curlers, or braid your hair when it's wet. Ponytails make you seem lazy; wear your hair up fancily, or let it spill over your shoulders. Garnier's Surf hair texturizing spray is a good alternative to hairspray. It smells allot better, doesn't harm the environment, and holds your hair in place without it feeling plastered. There is no stereotypical vampire haircut. Long, short, or medium hair can all work with these styles. Just make sure your hairstyle matches your face and personality.

, Keep up with eyebrow and hair maintenance. Shave regularly, and get your hair cut or trimmed as soon as it becomes too long or get split ends.

, You do not need extremely dark clothing. A cute leather jacket in a deep brown or black is always classy looking and very attractive. It's also common vampire wear. Nothing too short, most vampires are not from this era of micro minis .



Figure fitting clothes. This means the following: If you have good toes, wear peep toe shoes and polish your nails.

, You do not need to wear a lot of crosses or layer on chains. If that's how people are used to seeing you, then go for it. If you like that look, then transform yourself a little at a time. Remember that vampires are classy, so buy tasteful pieces. Reds, blacks, and silver are very nice. Gold can work, but not as well as those other colors. Do not layer on accessories.

, A light blush on the cheeks is great for a ""just fed"" look. It also brings some color to your face. Go for more natural colors. Violet looks good on some people, so try that. Mascara really can bring your eyes out. Try putting it just on the top lashes. Red lipstick is a must. Buy a red that suits you. Not all reds are created equal, so beware. Lip gloss is recommended for people with dry lips.

, If you are naturally a bubbly, happy, hyper person, then that's fine and you shouldn't change your personality. By wearing a mysterious, sexy look on your face, you will look much more like a vampire.

Start with 1 yard (0.9 m) of black fabric; Fold it in half like this.,
Now cut the top of the skirt to get the waistline, which should be ½ of your waist measure, but cut it smaller for seam allowance.

,
With the remaining piece of the cloth, make the top for your dress.,
After you are done with this, you need to sew the neckline, for this cut 2 pieces of neckline identical to the neckline.,
With the remaining fabric, cut out the sleeve.,

",How to Make an Inexpensive Gothic Dress,"


Now on the edge, cut a ¼ circle. But before you cut, draw out with a marking pencil. This will be the skirt.;
,, Though you can use any design and pattern of your choice, I tried to make it simple and hence cut it normally with a general neckline and sleeve. But a measurement is a must, so before you cut the top, get the perfect measurement of your body – chest and sleeve length.


When cutting the top portion, fold the cloth equally in half, this can be easy as everything is equal.
If you cut in this way, then you have to cut ¼ of your actual measurement, but cut a bit bigger for the seam allowance.

,


Stitch the part into the neckline and fold it inward to get the proper finish line.

,


To get the perfect and similar measurements for the hands, take the cloth and make 4 folds and cut the sleeve. Layer two pieces of clothes in half and cut into a crescent shape.
You can make ruffles with the cut out portion of the sleeve.
When you are done with this you can either pin it to the arm and sew it later, or sew at this time only.

,


For the skirt part, I cut out couples of strips of white fabric and lay it over the skirt, in the way I showed in this picture. Ruffles will be made out of this.
It will look something like this.
You need to sew the edge of each fabric, and then sew it to the main cloth.
When sewing it to the main cloth, you need to arrange this in a circular bottom.
Repeat this step for every layer.
Now just sew the side edges of the ruffles.

,


You can also add lace to the sleeve and neckline.

Dye your hair black if or bleach your hair platinum blonde because it shows a ghost mystical hair colour.,
Spread foundation two shades lighter than your skin tone with a plastic makeup sponge over your face.,
Draw a heavy, thick line at you're lashline on your eyelids and under your eyes with a wide, black eye pencil.,
Apply black lipstick if your skin is dark.,
Paint your nails white, grey, black or light pink.

,
Tear up your tights and hose if they are plain or lace.,
Sew patches on any tee shirts other than logo tees.

,
Wear skirts and dresses with obvious stitching up the side.,
Wear Ghost jewelry.,
Listen to classical music, Gothic metal, neoclassical metal and other types of music with a strong classical music influence.

",How to Get the Ghost Look," Flaming red may also work. Grow your hair as long as you can. While you're growing your hair out, only trim it when you start to get split ends. Braid it every night before you go to sleep to prevent it from tangling. Try to keep the shine low. If you have pretty dark skin, keep your hair black put it in ringlets.;
, If you have dark skin, don't get a foundation 10 times lighter than your actual skin color- this is really tacky. Then spread moisturizer over your face to smooth out your makeup. Apply a foundation one shade darker than the foundation you are wearing under your cheekbones.

, Spread charcoal or black eyeshadow over your lids and slightly over your eye crease if you have one. If you don't have an eye crease, spread it to the middle of your eyelid.

, If your skin is medium, apply bright red lipstick. If your skin is light, apply white lipstick. Put on black or red contacts on if you want. Grey, light blue, pale pink and overly bright natural colors work well also.

,, If they are spider web, spider or skeleton, leave them as they are.

,, Wear clothing that would be underwear in another era as outerwear, such as bloomers as shorts, petticoats as skirts, slips as dress, corsets as tops. Wear socks and hoodies with bones on them.

, Lockets, wilted roses as pins, barbed wire hearts are very Ghost. Onyx, jet, gold, fake gold and amethysts and other crystals are best. Imitations are great too.

Research into the Goth subculture.,
Look up Goth bands.,
Remember that having your music taste primarily made up of goth/deathrock bands doesn't mean that you should only listen to goth/deathrock bands.,
Dress goth.,
Understand the Gothic mindset.,
Read Gothic literature.,
Teaching others about the subculture.,
Be yourself.",How to Get Into the Goth Scene," Research is one of the most important things you could ever do while trying to learn about something. Contrary to belief, Goth has a defined meaning. Goth being ""anything you want it to be"" is a too vague definition and almost makes it have no meaning. Some basic facts of the subculture are:


Goth is a music based subculture that was born of the post-punk genre in the early 80s. Some real goth bands are Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Sisters of Mercy.The goth term came about because a member of UK Decay (tongue in cheek) referred to their music as ""gothic rock"" and Ian Astbury jokingly called Andi Sex Gang a ""gothic goblin"" because he was small, like macabre music and lived in a building called ""Visigoth towers"" in Brixton, making their fans ""goths"".The Goth subculture includes music, fashion and aesthetic. They are the only three things that goths, in general, have in common. The music is the most important because a goth is a fan of goth rock/post-punk. The fashion usually refers to traditional goth fashion which the original goth musicians wore in the 80s and the aesthetic refers to the dark and macabre way of thinking that goths have.;
, Listening to Goth rock or deathrock is the most important part of the subculture, and the thing that makes you goth. Goth rock was born out of post-punk in the early 80s with Bauhaus' song Bela Lugosi's Dead.Some other goth bands are:

, If you want to listen to anything else, you can. You should be being yourself and not trying to be a ""perfect goth"" by only doing ""goth things"". The goth music makes you goth, so it's important, but a goth shouldn't be the only thing that you are.

, Dressing goth alone does not make you goth, it would make you Gothic. There are said to be many goth styles, but trad goth, deathrock and romantic (lots of bands in the 90s used to wear this style) are ones that are only really ""goth"" whereas others like Victorian goth, CyberGoth, pastel goth etc are all from different branches and just take the name goth, rather than actually being it. It doesn't mean that you can't dress in these, just remember that they're not exactly goth. Pastel goth and nu goth in particular are from Tumblr and are more of a trend/just a fashion rather than a type goth. Again, if you want to dress in these, go ahead. Just understand what you're doing because misrepresentation can harm the subculture.

, Most, if not all, actual goths have joined the subculture because they had an interested in the dark and spooky from a young age. This sparked an interest in dark movies, literature and fashion when they were older, leading them to learn about the subculture that focuses on this especially. If you don't already have the Goth mindset then you need to ask yourself what reason you're doing this for, as a dark mindset is not something that is gained overnight. Remember that having a dark mindset only does not make you goth. It's an important aspect of the subculture, but Goth was born out of the music (the fashion following).

, Reading Gothic literature is certainly enjoyed by a good amount of goths, but it does not really make you goth. In Victorian times, barely anyone called their writing ""goth"" and since that was the most popular writing of the time, it would have made everyone ""goth"" which definitely was not the case. The subculture was born out of the music, which is the most important thing to remember. Some books you might want to check out are:


The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole
Dracula by Bram Stoker
Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte
Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
Zastrozzi: A Romance by Percy Bysshe Shelley
Anne Rice's works
Stephen King's works

, During the original scene, when an elder spoke, it wasn't out of respect, it was because you were genuinely interested.These days, people have started to throw goth aspects, customs, traditions and characteristics that make goth goth out the window.People are losing the sight of the backgrounds, roots and history that make the subculture what it is, so preserving the important of the music and creativity that goes into the subculture is important because without it, new bands and artists can't tour and make new albums. They are not getting the support from new members like they deserve. The reason why other subcultures like the metal subculture is doing so well is because people understand that it's about listening to metal, and that it's not just an aesthetic. So if you see a baby bat, someone who is new to the subculture, teach them (if they are willing to learn). Show them music, fashion and what the subculture really has to offer., If you have suddenly just gained inspiration because you've seen something that you like, it doesn't mean that you should become part of an entire subculture. Goth is something you grow into, not out of.

Wear mostly black clothing in a Victorian style.,
Look for vintage jewelry.,
Wear vampire accessories.,
Get a pair of vintage-looking black boots with pointed toes.Look for a pair that goes up to at least your mid-calf, but no taller than past your knee.,
Wear dark sunglasses.,
Be open to androgynous looks.",How to Get the Vampire Look at School1," The vampire look is essentially goth style with a twist – both groups wear predominantly black clothing, but the vampire look leans toward a more romantic, Victorian style of dress.Victorian-era fashion references the European style of dress in the 1800s and focuses on clothing with lots of different textures and made with exotic fabrics.


Examples of Victorian fashion would be ruffled shirts, cloaks, long skirts, velvet frock coats, opera capes, corsets, and vests.Examples of some of the more exotic materials would be crushed velvet, fishnet, silk, lace and leather.Referencing Edwardian, Elizabethan or even medieval styles is also common in this subculture.;
, Vintage items have a dated look that a vampire would prefer, since they are supposed to be very old creatures. Check out thrift stores for vintage jewelry, especially old-fashioned items like pocket watches and lockets.


Any vintage accessories made of lace, leather or velvet would also be great.Opera length gloves made of satin, velvet or latex are also popular., Silver jewelry is preferred and anything featuring bats, skulls, ankhs, gothic crosses, coffins and occult symbols is ideal.Wearing ornate silver rings on most of your fingers is another fashionable vampire look.


Chokers and velvet ribbons tied around the neck are popular looks, along with caplets and shawls in decadent fabrics.Consider wearing black and white striped stockings if you like that look, since they are prevalent in vampire goth fashion.

, Plain black leather lace up boots are fine, but if you can find a more ornate pair with buckles and other adornments, opt for those.Many women prefer a pair with heels, but it’s not required.Definitely check out thrift shops for vintage and/or less pricey versions of these boots, since they tend to be on the expensive side.

, In vampire lore, vampires usually can’t go into direct sunlight (which is one of the reasons why they are so pale). Since you can’t realistically avoid sunlight all the time, wear dark sunglasses any time you have to out in the sun or even outside in general.


Whenever possible, actively avoid sunlight.
Even with your sunglasses on, squint and wince a little when you’re forced to be outside in the sun, as though it’s making you very uncomfortable.

, It’s not unusual for all genders in this subculture to wear things that mainstream society considers feminine, such as makeup, skirts, corsets, heels, etc.Dressing outside of the gender you normally identify with is not required, but keep in mind that the gender lines are quite blurred and you should feel free to experiment if you like.


Vampire goths are progressive people and they accept, represent and identify with all genders and orientations.
Learn to embrace the things that make you different. Don’t be afraid to stand out from the crowd and be proud of who you are.

Try to get his attention.,
Talk to him.,
Try to act normal around him.,
Show him who you really are.,
Try to impress him.,
Don’t give up on him that easily.",How to Get a Normal Guy to Like You if You're a Gothic Girl," He can't fancy you if he's never seen you so try to get him to notice you. But be careful what kind of attention you're earning because there are different types of normal guys. (ex. nerds, preps, etc). Here are some things you can do in order to get his attention:-




Smile at him broadly
Throw him a short, darting glance
Look straight at him and flip your hair
Keep a fixed gaze on him
Look at him, toss your head, then look back,
""Accidentally"" brush up against him
Nod your head at him
Point to a chair and invite him to sit,
Tilt your head and touch your exposed neck,
Lick your lips during eye contact,
Ask for his help with something.

;
, Before you talk to him tone your personality down to a lower level, until you see what he's like. So instead of going up to him and strike up a conversation; when you meet him the first time you should walk & sit next to him then introduce yourself then strike up a small conversation and make sure your questions aren't too weird (ex. what is your favorite color?). Then the next day try to talk to him little-bit more for 3-4 minutes then walk away from him. If you talk to him allot you might scare him away (give him a lot of space). Be respectful to him. Don’t curse in front of him because it is a major turn off for a boy. If he comes to talk to you, you must make sure that you do not give him any body language signals that scare him away (ex. even if you look in some other direction and pretend to be bored) because he might read this as, “she is not interested” and he might leave so that you do not reject him. So handle all this delicately. Once he is talking to you, use all those eye-contact tricks and give him your attention.

, Don't get nervous/shy whenever he is around you because boys like it when girls are relaxed and calm. Don't show him that you are obsessed/crazed about him or else it will be hard for him to fall in love with you. So try to treat him like a friend and do not stare but glance at him instead. Be approachable and face your crush with your arms uncrossed.

, Try to show him your positive characteristics about yourself (ex. sweet, funny, etc), what type of bands do you like? (ex. darkwave, post-punk, etc), What type of things you are interested in? (ex. Goth subculture, poetry, etc), what kind of clubs you like to go?.

, Tell him jokes and make him laugh because that way he will think that you are fun to be around and make sure he doesn’t get offended/hurt by your jokes. Show him what an unbelievable person you are (ex. always make him feel comfortable) and in his eyes you should appear to have an aura of light all around you.

, Even though he didn’t like you back just because you are a Gothic girl doesn’t mean you have to give up. What you need to do is pick yourself back up, give yourself a love pat on the back and go back for another round. Try to be friends with him because he might end up loving you.

Use white foundation to make your skin appear as pale as possible.Get a high quality foundation in a pale shade that matches your skin or that’s one shade lighter.,
Get the appearance of gaunt features by using contouring makeup.,
Wear dark eyeliner, dark eyeshadow and blood red or black lipstick.Eyeliner styles are unique and vary, so experiment with a few different looks, like a heavy kohl/smoky eye and winged liquid eyeliner.,
Grow your nails long and paint them with dark nail polish.Vampire goths tend to grow their nails out quite long and some like to file their long nails down into points.,
Dye your hair very dark brown or black and grow it out.,
Consider colored contact lenses and artificial fangs.These things aren’t required but some enthusiasts like to go all out with their vampire look.",How to Get the Vampire Look at School2," If you have darker skin, go no more than two shades lighter with the foundation. After you apply the foundation evenly all over your face with a sponge, lightly dust your whole face with white powder.The powder will set your foundation and give your skin an ethereal pallor.Avoid over-powdering and be sure to powder past your jawline – dust your neck, chest and any other exposed skin with it, as well.
Buy the best foundation that you can afford. Low quality foundation may give your makeup a cakey, theatrical quality. The look you’re going for is slightly more natural.

, Use bronzer, a dark shaded powder or a dark blush to sculpt your face. Suck your cheekbones in and apply the shade in the hollow of your cheek. Apply the darkest makeup at your hairline and get lighter as you go down the hollow of your cheek toward your mouth. Blend well.This will create a gaunt vampire look, as most vampires have defined features.
Use a large makeup brush with soft bristles to apply the contour makeup, since this is the best tool for blending it well.

, Eye shadow should be a dark and you can apply it to the lid or all the way around your eye for a highly stylized look.Mix it up by adding some red eyeliner or dark red eyeshadow.


Lipstick colors are usually black or a deep red to accentuate a pale complexion.Lipstick isn’t required. Doing a pale mouth with dramatic dark eye makeup is a popular look.

, Nail polish can be any very dark color, it doesn’t necessarily have to be black, so experiment with some deep reds and purples.

, The length is up to you, but longer, dark hair is the most common look for all genders in the Victorian era. Wear it flowing loose and free, or tie it back with a simple velvet ribbon, allowing a few wispy pieces to fall around your face.


You could also curl your hair with rollers and pin it up in a true Victorian hairstyle, if you like. Do loose curls or tight ringlets.Another popular look is braiding long pigtails and then securing them with bobby pins at the crown of your head in a a sort of halo.

, The contact lenses chosen for this are usually yellow-green in color.Check out costume shops and goth specialty stores for artificial but realistic-looking fangs that you can pop in and out easily.

Befriend other goth/vampire kids.These kids tend to hang out in small groups, and they are easy to identify because of how unusual they look in comparison to the other students.,
Listen to dark/goth music on your headphones at school.,
Act mysterious and maintain a straight face at all times.,
Learn as much vampire lore as possible.Read Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula, Anne Rice’s series The Vampire Chronicles and Poppy Z. Brite’s novel Lost Souls.",How to Get the Vampire Look at School3," Introduce yourself and get friendly with these people. Bring up goth music or vampire lore when you’re around them at school to get conversations started.


Take mental notes about what the other vampire kids are wearing to get additional ideas for your wardrobe.
Investigate whether or not your school has any goth social groups or meetups. If so, check them out.

, There are tons of goth bands out there and goth music itself is highly varied with many subgenres, so if you’re new to the game, it can be a little overwhelming. However, you can’t go wrong with classic goth bands like The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Joy Division, The Damned, Sisters of Mercy, Christian Death and (early) Depeche Mode.Check out the bands on goth-friendly record labels like Projekt, Cleopatra, Anubis and Tess if you aren’t sure where to start., Vampires are known for their air of quiet mystique, and smiling is a rarity for them. Act a little broody and pensive around others. Avoid being talkative and glide around as though everything you do is effortless for you.


Maintaining a straight face doesn’t mean looking angry or upset. Focus on looking indifferent to what’s going on around you and relatively emotionless.
Be aware when people are looking at you, but don’t look at them. Act as gracefully as possible when you’re being watched.
Demonstrating impeccable manners and a reserved demeanor are also a big part of the vampire mystique., The classic German film Nosferatu is a must-see.


Other important vampire films are The Hunger, The Lost Boys, the Underworld series, the Blade series, From Dusk Til Dawn, Dracula (1931 film featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992 film featuring Gary Oldman as Dracula), and Interview With A Vampire.
Other vampire references to check out – the comic book series (and film) 30 Days of Night, as well as the following television series: True Blood, The Strain, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, The Originals and The Vampire Diaries.
For goth references outside of vampires, check out popular sci-fi/fantasy/horror writers like H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allen Poe and Neil Gaiman."

Make sure you're doing this because this is who you are.,

Hair.,

Attend Goth concerts, festivals or bars/clubs.,
Inspire and educate.",How to Enter the Goth Scene," Any other reason is wrong. People don't spend time developing themselves into an entire subculture if it's not who they are. Goth isn't just a label you can lightly apply to yourself; but comes with certain traditions, aspects and customs that should be respected. After all, something has got to make you ""goth"".
, Research is very important when trying to learn about something. Not understanding the background / history / root of the subculture you claim to be part of is the very definition of a poseur, as well as someone who isn't being themselves. You want to make sure you get the right information, so that means looking at proper reliable sources like books such as:

Gothic Charm School by Jillian Venters
Goth: Identity, Style and Subculture by Paul Hodkinson
Goth: Undead Subculture by Lauren M.E
Goth: The Design, Art and Fashion of a Dark Subculture by Chris Roberts, Hywel Livingstone, Emma Baxter-Wright
Some Wear Leather, Some Wear Lace: The Worldwide Compendium of Post Punk and Goth in the 1980s by Andi Harriman and Marloes Bontje

, Goth, down to its core, is a music based subculture and a Goth is a fan of Goth rock. Every Goth should know who Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure and The Sisters of Mercy are. You can look for their albums on YouTube, Spotify or even Bandcamp (if they're more underground/known) and decide if you like their music. Music is a very important aspect of the subculture, so if you don't like Goth music then Goth culture is probably not for you. You can dress Goth, but it will not make you Goth, but Gothic, instead. Some other Goth bands are.

The March Violets
Ikon
Frank The Baptist
Fields of the Nephilim
The Mission UK
Killing Joke
Southern Death Cult (The Cult)
Sex Gang Children
Christian Death
Alien Sex Fiend
45 Grave
Clan of Xymox
Dead Can Dance
Specimen

, As a goth, you don't only have to listen to goth rock. You can listen to anything you want (as long as your music taste primarily consists of goth rock and similar genres) but there are other genres that are considered to be ""goth"" as well. Goth rock is the main one, but some others are:

Punk Rock
Post Punk
Darkwave (Goth rock with more synths)
Deathrock
Neo-classical Darkwave
New wave

, Goths dressed like their idols and the idea was to use inspiration, but to never to directly copy. Fans have emulated their idols fashions in all subcultures and goth is no different. Common goth garments are fishnets (sometimes ripped, layered and in different colours than just black), leather jackets (which were usually DIY-ed with favourite bands), winklepickers/pointed shoes, corsets, gloves, silver jewellery and garments in velvet, lace and fishnet. Bands like Bauhaus, Specimen, Dave Vanian and Robert Smith from The Cure inspired male fashion trends whereas Siouxsie Sioux and Patricia Morrison inspired female ones., Hair is always important to the shocking goth look, but mohawks and death hawks were avoided until the days of The Batcave, where they returned, usually black, crimped or teased. Jonny Slut from Specimen fronted this style. Patricia Morrison inspired girls to have long black hair for girls who weren't into the short punk look, and Siouxsie Sioux motivated them to tease it to uttermost heights. While the stereotype is that all goths have black hair, the original goths experimented with any colours they could find. Platinum blonde, other shocking colours and later, hair extensions, were common too. This means any usual or wacky colour you like, you can have. If you're not comfortable with changing your hair too much, dye it and tease it. This is a very basic goth look., Goth makeup is very recognisable, with Siouxsie Sioux's trademark Cleopatra eyes complete with thick, pointed and triangular eyebrows. If you were not into that style, you can also have high arched and thin eyebrows like Morticia Addams or for men, flared and stroked upward like what Daniel Ash was famous for wearing. Colours used were electric blue, purples and metallics. Purple eyeshadow was used as contour under the cheekbones to emphasize them and give them the ""undead"" look. Black and red lipstick, and red nails were common too. Don't be afraid to experiment with different colours, because goth make up was never about copying the artists directly., Since the Batcave has closed, Goths found other ways to celebrate their subculture. Living in cities means there's more chance of finding a Goth scene, or at least a dark scene. Try and get involved and helping it out by keeping it alive. Some suggestions are becoming a DJ, musician, Goth/post-punk/darkwave night organizer and concert promoter. Some places or events you can take place in are:

World Goth Daywhich is on the 22nd May of every year.
Whitby Goth Weekendwhich is a bi-annual festival held in Whitby.
Wave-Gotik-Treffenwhich is the biggest ""dark"" festival in the world, held in Leipzig, Germany.
Numerous clubs goth/alternative clubsin the U.S and Europe.

, Educating people is one of the most important parts of being goth. Without knowledge of the background, history and what really makes someone goth, you can't pass down the legacy. When an elder goth spoke, you listened. And it wasn't out of respect, it was because you were genuinely interested in what they had to say.These days, people have been taking goth values and what makes goth ""goth"" and throwing them out the window, claiming ""anything can be goth"" and ""I don't have to listen to goth music to be goth"" when that's what the subculture was originally about."
"
Slowly ease into it.,
Accessorize.,
Pick a Hair style.,
Own the Attitude.,
Listen to the Music.",How to Dress Gothic (Men)," Don't go full-on Goth because yes, you will look like a poser. Add pieces here and there (you probably already own quite a few that you didn't know about)


Tops. The basic top is, of course, the t-shirt. Black t-shirts with a variety of band logos. You can print your own tee's on the internet, so be original! Use band images, dark anime, horror pictures, pick something you like. Make sure they fit well though, you are not a baggy Mall goth!
Tops again. Apart from t-shirts, try on a mesh t-shirt. If you haven’t got the body to wear it on its own, wear it over one of your t-shirts. Also try on black dress shirts, and Victorian period shirts in black, white, grey, or dark jewel tones. Experiment and layer. Long-sleeve black tees and jumpers are a good option.
Bottoms. Black jeans are the standard it seems. If you can, wear them tight (NOT uber-skinny) just regular skinny. Worn jeans are better than new ones. Tripp pants are the way to go. They may be expensive but in the end, they are worth it Apart from jeans, try leather pants. Not for you? Wear trousers. In the summer wear black shorts or 3/4.
Shoes. Boots, boots and more boots! Boots are the staple footwear of Goth. Doc Marten boots are the original favorites but you are by no means limited to this. Also wear black pointed Chelsea boots, with lots of buckles, black converse high-tops are a good mainstream choice if you don't feel like slugging your boots on.
Coats. Pinstripe blazers, leather biker jackets, wool overcoats, Houndstooth coats. Get a selection for all weathers! Might be a good idea to purchase a black zip-thru hoody (plain or with suitable Goth image) to layer under a jacket for colder weather. Please don't buy a leather trenchcoat. You've seen the types that wear them. Wannabe Goths, weirdo's, and Nazi's. OK, so a German WWII-era officer jacket is a classic item to wear with Goth clothing, but a Gestapo leather trench is bordering on cliché. Leave them to the mall goths.;
, Get a decent belt. Black leather with metal studs, dark imagery, a cool buckle. Fishnet gloves. Rings, necklaces, pendants etc. Silver is the jewelry colour of choice, looks best with black. As for makeup, light-coloured foundation and black eyeliner are standard. DON'T buy white face paint, it looks fake. Buy a pale or white foundation or face powder. And don't overdo the eyeliner. Less is more. You can do your lips and nails, but for a casual everyday look, don't. You are aiming to look darkly ascetic, not shock value. Again, leave that to mallgoths.Use a handkerchief. They are so much more romantic goth style.

, It's ok not to dye your hair, but it may look better. Black is the standard choice, as you can do anything with it. You can also try pale platinum blonde or a really dark red. You can try highlighting or low lighting your black hair with blue or green or pink or purple. Don't overdo it, though. Style it how you want. Grow your hair out so you have more options. Backcomb it, mess it up, spike it, straighten it. Use the internet to help, or be original!

, Of course, now that you are dressed the part, you need to act it. Goths are NOT always depressed,so don't always be moping around! But find new things to talk about. Poetry, the romantic movement, pre-Raphaelite art, vintage horror movies, and of course music.

, Wearing a slipknot t-shirt is not going to gain the respect of elder Goths. Start listening to proper Goth music from the 80's. Bauhaus, Joy Division,45 Grave,Siouxie and the Banshees, The Cure, Sisters of Mercy. Find them out and listen. Don't limit yourself to just Goth rock music. Goths also enjoy gloomy post-punk, Horror punk and neo-psychedelia (Echo & the Bunnymen, Jesus & Mary Chain) New Wave/Synthpop and New Romantic, Shoegazing/dream pop, Industrial, ambient. Explore darker bands that have some refinement (Not Manson for god's sake)

Check out the rules.,
Goth your hair.,
Select an appropriately Goth make up look.,
Accessorize!,
Paint your nails.,
Pick out some Goth shoes.,
Find a Goth Bag.,
Modify your unified.,
Have a great Goth school year!

",How to Dress Goth with a School Uniform," Before you do anything, check with your school to verify exactly how strict your dress code is! If you are not allowed to have any form of accessory, then there isn't much you can do.;
, For hair, there are many options. One option would be to tease it up a bit. If you are allowed to dye your hair, an unnatural color would definitely add some individuality to your look, or you could just go with black (since it IS in fact a natural color). Another good idea could be clip-in extensions. Recommended are ones made from real hair, as fake ones will look cheesy and you may look like a poseur. And if you have no interest in adding color to your hair, that is perfectly fine! No matter what style you choose, make sure you do it in a manner that will make you look good and put-together You could leave your hair loose and free, or do it like Wednesday Addams. Remember, the point is to express yourself.

, Don't do anything too distracting. Try choosing one feature to focus on. If you can use some, a red or plum lipstick could look nice. If you can't/don't want to, you could also use a tinted lip balm. If you would prefer to have the focus on your eyes, you could either leave your lips alone, (make sure they're moisturized!) use a lip gloss, or put a concealer/nude lipstick on them. For eye makeup, you could just do eyeliner (of any quantity, really), or add eye shadow. Colors that look good may be purple, deep blue, black or red. (Using red may be more difficult if you can't wear a lot of makeup. It should be worn with another color usually; preferably black.) If you want a more natural look, use a color that either matches or complements your eye color.

, If you're allowed to wear any accessories, some good ideas may be skeleton hair clips, creepy jewelry (bats, skulls, spiders, etc.) headband, and/or cuff, fishnet gloves, black or patterned arm warmers/tights, etc, etc, etc! If your school is freaked out by that sort of thing, (brace yourself,) you will probably have to tone it down a bit. In this case, try dipping into the more elegant side of goth! Try lovely jewelry that doesn't scream, ""GOTH,"" such as pendents with intricate designs or a black ring. There are (again) endless possibilities! If your style tends to lean more towards the punk side, you could try things such as a zipper bracelet, chains, a thin studded bracelet, or something with safety pins. (Whatever your style may be, DIY something! Nothing says ""you"" like something made by you!) If you feel that you must indulge in your love for skulls and bats, try something very subtle. Examples would be small skull stud earrings or something in the shape of a bat that could be mistaken for a bird.

, One essential for most goths is black nail polish, and in an environment where our style is more restricted, it seems even more necessary.

, Shoes are a great way to express yourself! If you're allowed to choose your own, you should almost definitely wear black ones. Some good styles would be elegant black flats, lacey shoes with a (small!) heel, or (the best,) pointy boots (with either buckles or laces).

, Your backpack (or whatever you carry your things in) is very important as well! You could buy one with a Gothic design, or (as I prefer,) buy a plain black one and personalize it with buttons, lace, studs, different fabrics, doodles, and/or anything else that you feel is necessary!

, Lastly, if everyone is okay with it, you could make some modifications to your actual uniform. Additions such as safety pins, lace/trim, sleeves, etc. may look nice. If your dress code is very flexible, you could also try fraying the edges of your skirt (if you have one) if you want to look a bit more punk and/or messy (but not in a bad way).

Wear breathable fabrics.,
Select intimates-inspired pieces.,
Go for loose-fitting clothing.,
Experiment with off-beat prints.,
Incorporate a bit of fringe.,
Find a unique bathing suit.,
Wear a health goth outfit.,
Try out ice packs and bodice chillers.",How to Dress Goth in Summertime1," Stick with clothing made of natural fibers, such as cotton. They will circulate air more and lower your skin temperature. Silk is another good option. The fabric gaps in lace also remove heat. If a fabric feels heavy in your hands, odds are it will trap heat against your skin.Avoid synthetic fabrics, such as nylon, as they are heavy-knit. As such, they will keep heat close to you and can even lead to overheating.For example, you could choose a dark cotton t-shirt. Glance through your wardrobe and select a special band shirt. Or, perhaps one with a basic logo or quote.;
, Goth fashion often involves layering. For the summer, your layers need to be light and airy. Look for slip dresses or romper-style outfits. If your initial layer is quite thin, then you can add to it without being too hot.For example, you might layer a light lace cardigan over a cotton slip dress. Or, you could go for a lace tank under a cotton-blend military-style jacket.

, Choose clothing pieces that skim your skin, instead of clinging to it. Or, mix-and-match tight and loose items. This will lessen the possibility of sweat stains showing and will allow air to circulate against your skin. Loose clothing will also prevent chafing.For example, darker maxi dresses are a great way to stay cool and offer a blank canvas for accessorizing. You can also go with a looser fitting cotton t-shirt, as opposed to one that hugs you closely.

, Move away from a basic black and white palette. Look for tropical prints that incorporate black and white, but with touches of yellow or red as well. Swirls or straight-edge designs are also eye-catching and unique. Don’t feel as if you have to select a “cheery” pattern for summer, instead look for one that captures the season and your style.

, This can be a bit much if you overdo it. So, stick with one item that contains a complimentary amount of fringe. Fringe can be used to both darken or lighten up an outfit.You could choose a beach cover-up with fringes at the edges. Or, a black maxi skirt with a fringe trim in a lighter color.

, Many goths feel out of place looking for swimwear, as they feel as if they have to go with a bright, summer print. This is simply not the case. There are some stunning and unique black bathing suits available for sale. Search online and look at specialty clothing stores for the best options.For example, some websites sell suits in unusual patterns, such as a pentagram-design bikini.

, This is a relatively new trend for those persons looking to combine sportswear with a gothic outlook. To achieve this look, you’ll want to wear gym gear, such as track pants, in all black. The weave of the fabric will repel sweat while allowing you to keep to your goth style.Some brands of health goth have even replaced standard symbols, such as Nike, with new ones that are a bit more subversive.

, If you decide to dress in a traditional goth style and wear heavy finery, then it might be a good idea to freeze a few ice packs before you head outside. You can then add these ice packs to your corset area or against your waistcoat to prevent overheating. This is obviously not a permanent solution, but it may provide temporary relief."

Minimize your accessories.,
Experiment with fans and handkerchiefs.,
Go with a very sheer stocking.,
Wear breathable shoes.,
Go for large, unusual sunglasses.,
Use a parasol.,
Consider a large hat.",How to Dress Goth in Summertime2," Instead of wearing multiple bracelets, just choose one that appeals to you. The same goes with necklaces, rings, and earrings. The more items that you wear, the more you’ll be wiping off sweat. Also, nix any heavy accessories, such as scarves or heavy gloves., A metal folding fan can be concealed easily and pulled out if you feel hot. You can even match it to the lace of your outfit. A handkerchief can be easily tucked into a shirt or pants pocket and used to dab or wipe away any accumulating sweat. You can match a handkerchief to your outfit as well.If the heat is simply too oppressive, you can also dip your handkerchief in cold water and place it against your neck or pressure points, like your wrist.

, Look for a stocking that is the lightest weight available, it is often called a “sheer.” You can choose a textured print, such as feathered lace, or something simpler, like a single calf line. Fishnets are another option as they circulate air well due to their many holes.Because they are lighter, be warned that sheer stockings are more likely to catch or tear.

, The shoes of preference for goths are often combat boots, but these can suffocate your feet in the summer and lead to painful blisters. Instead, consider chunky platform sandals or dark, thin loafers as an alternative. Even a retro men’s dress shoe can look right and hold up well in the heat.You could also go with black ballet flats or dark grey ankle boots.

, These will serve a dual purpose of protecting your eyes and giving you another chance to express your style. Look for ones that have a funkier vibe, such as Ouija patterns on the rim. Or, perhaps a perfectly round shape with colored lenses if that suits your taste.This is a chance to provide a pop of color into your wardrobe, if you wish. Go with a 1950s bright pink or perhaps a sparkly purple.

, This is a fancy, lighter version of an umbrella, often made with intricate fabrics. A lace parasol is easy to carry and can provide a degree of protection from the sun. You can find quite elaborate ones online, made with ruffles and even feathers. If you choose a darker shade, this will not impact its ability to keep you cool too., A traditional top hat is likely to focus more heat onto your head. Instead, look for a hat made of a lighter fabric with a wide brim. If it is plain, you can then adorn it with extra items of your choosing, such as metal elements or black tulle.For example, the black panama hat is a type that is worn by many goths during the summer. You can also choose a simple, wide cotton floppy hat and personalize it with a few well-placed dark ribbons.

Stick with a simpler hairstyle.,
Wear waterproof makeup.,
Go minimal with makeup.,
Try out dark shades of lipstick and nail polish.",How to Dress Goth in Summertime3," If you add too much hairspray or product, there is a good possibility that your hair will transform into a sweaty blob under the sun’s rays. Save yourself the hassle and try out a softer look with less product. Maybe go for some loose curls or more of a bed-head look.If you do try a more elaborate style, make sure to travel with product, bobby pins, or whatever else you’ll need to respond to a hair emergency in progress.
Some goths prefer to avoid the hair hassle by getting an undercut at the start of the summer. This is a haircut that lightens your hair by cutting out a layer.The pixie cut is another preferred goth hairstyle as it can be styled in a wide variety of ways and it suitable for all seasons.

, Almost all major brands of makeup offer products specifically designed to withstand sweat, water, and sun. Look for a product that is advertised this way, but that also feels light against your skin.


For example, purchase a light, waterproof powder instead of a heavy liquid foundation.
You can also go with a makeup that contains a built-in SPF for protection from the sun.

, Instead of wearing layers of makeup, opt for a single layer that provides adequate coverage. You can also carry blotting papers with you. If you apply these papers to your face, you can remove excess perspiration without ruining your makeup job., These are two areas where you can go as dark as you like without worrying about the heat consequences. In fact, many in the fashion world are now considering dark colors, such as deep green, to be neutrals as they can match almost any outfit. Try out a few different dark tones of the same product until you find one that you like."

Ease into it.,
Determine what style you are aiming for.,
Browse goth pictures and movies for inspiration.,

Try tight clothes (both males and females).,
Wear band shirts.,
Consider boots.,
The hair.,
Color coordinate.,
Wear makeup appropriately.,
Complete your look with accessories.",How to Dress Goth," Don't go goth all at once. Gradually ease into the style and subculture.;
, Some people like a romantic look with tailored velvet jackets, lace and period items, while others prefer punk, with bondage pants and a spiked collar, and still others go cyber/futuristic with goggles, yarn extensions, latex, and big industrial boots. There's not one single goth fashion, there are many branches.

, Look around and try to see what you want to incorporate into your wardrobe. Avoid copying someone else unless it is Halloween.

, Even mainstream clothing stores have basic pieces, (like pinstriped pants, black sweaters, and such), that will become the staples of your wardrobe much less expensively than specialty store buys.

, You can get a good deal at a thrift store, but the cheapest clothes to buy are the ones already in your closet. Go crazy; make it artistic and unique.

, Guys, do not try wearing tight clothes unless you like looking a bit more feminine. Also always make sure it fits your body right and looks good. Be warned, tight pants may get you called ""emo,"" but keep in mind that the stereotypical ""emo"" male wears women's skinny jeans. Gothics and deathrockers don't fall for that stuff, they buy cheap black jeans and alter them to fit tightly or buy quality looking/fitting black stretch tight jeans from Lip-service, DogPile clothing or Tripp Clothing brands. If it doesn't work for you, stick with normal or loose fit clothes.

, Try shirts by bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Christian Death and Bauhaus. (Only bands you ACTUALLY like and enjoy listening to, buying band shirts JUST because the band is ""goth"" makes you look like a poser). Many goths and deathrockers also cut their shirts up to make them hang off one shoulder, or cut the sleeves to allow them to sit lower on the arms and show the shoulders.

, Many goths have high, tall, black boots, the most popular type is men's platform boots. There are many different styles of boots, look around and choose a style you like! Or don't - boots are not required, goth is all about being original. However, some romantic goths wear dress shoes every day.

, Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to dye or even excessively style your hair to be goth. There are many who represent the epitome of dark goth fashion yet keep their natural hair color. If you do chose to Dye your hair start by figuring out what colors look good on you. Not all colors will look good on everyone! Next, try looking at examples of hair styles used by various goth bands for inspiration. Some like to spike, clump or make their hair messy. Remember, goth is an offshoot of Punk, so many goths do backcomb their hair into huge explosions, or style their hair into mohawks or huge frizzy spikes or whatever else they can think of. No matter what color you choose to have your hair or how you chose to style it, remember that it is all about expressing yourself, so be creative!

, Black isn't the only color that exists in the goth lifestyle. Dark reds, violet, blue, green, gray and white are often used as side colors to the general color black. Cyber or industrial goth accepts neon colors, but goth is what you make of it, not what others tell you it is.

, Goth make-up is often dramatic; black heavy eyeliner, red lips, and dark shades with heavy application. Colors such as black, red, and purple around and on the eyelids. Cat-eye eyeliner is practically a cliché, but it looks fabulous. Black lipstick is much less popular than it used to be. Regardless, there are no rules.

, It could be an elegant choker, lace gloves, an SM bracelet, goggles, bat earrings, ribbons, etc.

Get dressed in all your inner layers of clothing.,
Think about what you want to wear on your legs.,
Look through your tee shirt collection.,
Add any accessories, such as arm/leg warmers, gloves, jewellery, badges, etc.,
Do your hair.,
Do your makeup properly (see related wikiHows).,
Complete the outfit with footwear.",How to Dress Goth for a Casual Party," This means comfortable underwear, a step above what you'd lounge around in. Stockings or hose are good, if you want. If you're wearing a low cut shirt find a good singlet/tight shirt to wear underneath it in a contrasting or matching colour to add more flair.;
, Bondage pants are okay for pleasant weather, but if it is very cold you should layer something underneath if there are metal parts that touch the skin, as this can become an unpleasantly chilly feeling after some time. However, easier options would include a simple skirt in a good colour, or any other, comfortable and still attractive pants.

, Pick a band tee for something that isn't completely mall goth- for example, please wear your E Nominee tee instead of- or, over- your H.I.M. shirt (wear your HIM tee if you feel like it, just because you like a certain band does not make you any less 'goth' than a person who doesn't like said band. Also, can I just add that liking HIM does not make you a 'mall goth', that kind of thing just creates a divide in people who should really be sicking together). Or go a little more ""mainstream friendly"" with The Cure or Nine Inch Nails. If you choose a particular character tee or cartoon character, you might want to choose a major colour from the image and use it with your accessories. For example, a GIR tee may warrant your horrible acid green earrings. By matching/or contrasting your outfit and accessories, you can pull together a simple look to make it more unique.

, If you want to look striking but not completely overdo it, then accessorizing is a good idea.

, A simple style like a ponytail or left loose can work, though if you're wearing quite a ""quiet"" outfit then you may want to play it up with your locks. In any case, brush, smooth/spike/straighten and then fiddle around with it. Girls may want to add any hairclips/bows/pieces to go with their outfit and add some extra flair.

, Be careful with fine tuning this step - wearing a down-tone outfit and outrageous makeup doesn't actually look so attractive. For example, if you're simply wearing a skirt and band tee, then powdering your face white and applying rings of liquid eyeliner and shocking eyeshadow might just make you like a child who was playing around with magic markers. Assess the conditions of your outfit and apply your makeup accordingly. The basics, however, may include:


Some simple eyeliner work - if you're going for very casual, then just a simple pencil lining should do. If you want to play it up a little, try liquid eyeliner with a darker/thicker application.

Lip gloss/Lipstick. A simple shade of subtle lipstick or gloss should do.

Foundation/concealer is optional, if you're currently suffering from a ""bad skin"" day, to cover/smooth over any blemishes. However, white foundation may not be the best idea for the casual look, as you may look stupidly overdone.
You may also want to paint your nails - a simple solid colour, such as black, purple or red should do for a basic outfit, though for something that needs a little added flair, you could do multiple colours or practise your nail art skills.

, Boots are great, though you can pretty much wear anything comfortable. Make sure it goes with your outfit and doesn't look out of place.

Consider your personal style.,
Start a poster collection.,
With a friend or parent, affix all the posters to the wall using lightweight tape.,
Remove each poster from the wall one at a time.,
Mix glue and water in a 13""x9"" or wider cake pan, making it at least an inch deep in the bottom.,
Quickly and carefully submerge your paper in the water/glue mixture using a pulling motion.

,
Place it on the wall where you have planned and use a soft rubber squeegee and your fingers to smooth it out and remove all the air pockets.

",How to Cover Your Room with Posters," Are you someone who wants posters neatly framed and aligned, or are you more of a slapdash, double-sided sticky-tape kind of person? Think about what looks have worked in other rooms you've seen. Most styles are self-explanatory, so below there is described a more complicated method. It is not the only method!;
, Pick them up at concerts or shows, or check out websites like Amazon and Posters.com. Check in magazines and album liner notes, or check at movie theatres or video rental places.

, Play with different styles and looks!

, With a pencil, lightly indicate where each poster will be.

, If you have a lot of stuff to put up, then make it deeper.

Keep eye makeup very simple and classy.,
Base makeup: A pale, but still realistic looking foundation {one or maximum of two shades lighter than your natural skintone}.,
Use darker lip colors.,
Shirts and tops: A simple vest in black or tawny can be embroidered with feathers {black} or black roses.,
Wear ""professional"" clothing in darker colors.,
Look for dark pixie boots or short heeled little boots.,
Accessorize your outfit with period costume items such as: Fascinators or bracelets in brown and other earthy colours.,
Choose older hair styles.,
Music dark fairies may enjoy: Dead Can Dance, Emilie Autumn, Karen Kay, Rising Shadows, The Changelings.

",How to Dress Like a Gothic Fairy (Adults)," Examples : Black cat eye eyeliner, small black flicked eyeliner, brown eyeshadow/ liner, brown/ black mascara, a tiny bit of moss green/purple/black/ grey/ smoky eye.;
, You can seal this with a fairly pale powder. RIMMEL stay matte transparent 001 is an excellent compact powder which reduces appearance of pores, giving younger looking and naturally pale looking skin. It is also very inexpensive.

, Perhaps a toffee coloured/ plummy/dark brown lipstick. If you can pull off black lipstick, go ahead, but be warned: If it looks wrong don't wear it! If you like you could simply wear a transparent gloss.

, A nicely tailored waistcoat looks excellent with this. Shirts can also be lightly torn to give a handkerchief-like look.

, A good example might be a long, flowing velvet skirt, with a subtle net underskirt in a red/black/purple/dark green hue. A more grown up take on torn, holey tights often worn by younger goths can be black tights patterned with gray flowers and Tim Burton-esque curlicues!

, Understated pumps can be lovely too, especially subtly accessorized with black feathers or small black/ other colour fake flowers or glitter.

, Dragonfly/ black butterfly earrings are pretty. Black cross necklaces are nice also. If fairy wings aren't your thing, you could adorn the back of your waistcoat/ top with two black feathers or even peacock feathers!

, An elegant topknot is always a good look. Long, loose, flowing hair is ever popular. Hair can be adorned with perhaps a black rose, a black dragonfly clip?

Don't just stick to plain old white, try some other colors. Pick a shade of your favorite color and use that. You could even paint the ceiling if you want to, the same color as the walls or any other interesting color. You may also consider only painting two walls or so because this allows you do use darker colours without making the room feel enclosed and keeps it light.;
, Your local paint store will have ideas on how to do neat finishes on the walls. Take a look at sponge painting, and stencils, they add interest to a room and stencils can even follow your favorite hobby. Be bold and make your room into whatever you want. Also, you can try out wall stickers or cards which are an easy way to stop plain walls looking boring.

, It just tends to collect and usually ends up on the floor because there isn't enough space in the closet for it. Shelves are the answer. You can make shelves out of just about anything, from cement bricks and boards to those plastic crates that eggs come in at the store. Ask for the crates at the store and then stack them in your room, on their sides. They come in all kinds of bright colors, but you can always spray paint them if you want.

, Make sure it matches the colours. A tropical room in red and black doesn't make as much sense as one in blue and green. Try not to use permanent decorations for themes. While horses are cool today, you may not like them when you're 17. Most of all, let your imagination go wild.

, You could just do shapes or work on a city skyline that goes right around the room. If you paint a large black rectangle it can be used as a chalk board.

, There's nothing like some soft pillows or cushions to sit on when you invite a bunch of friends over for a video night. Make sure there is enough comfortable seating for a few people. Chatting on the floor isn't comfy.

, Arrange them in different ways. Try a checkerboard pattern or randomly tilted posters.

, Tired of your wallpaper and not allowed to change it? Try hanging a cool fabric over it. Fill it with posters, photos, cork boards, and the like.

, Borders finish off your room. You can stencil borders, add a wallpaper border, or make your own with a collection. Adding a shelf around the top of your walls will provide a place to put larger items, or you can stick up pictures or movie tickets, or ticket stubs from fairs, etc. Pick something that you like and go with it. Borders don't have to stay by the ceiling either, they can run around the room at any level you please.

, Anything that interests you and start gluing it up to the door. Layer things, overlap the pictures and stick the words on top. You can just do whatever or choose a theme like animals, fame, or something that pleases you.

, A small room is limited in use. Not much can be added except the bed, dresser, and night tables, and of course a desk and computer. Most second bedrooms are of this size.

If you need some help choosing colors that go well together, you can try consulting a color wheel. Depending on how much contrast you want, you can choose colors that are near each other or across from each other on the color wheel..
You can also choose a colorful piece of fabric or art to inspire your color choices for the rest of the room.
Keep your theme in mind when purchasing and repurposing items for the room. Everything doesn't have to match perfectly, but it should all coordinate.;
, Before you overhaul the room, take a minute to think about what is and what is not working for you. For example, if you have no place to study in your room, you may want to consider adding a desk. If the room feels claustrophobic, you may want to remove some furniture.


Measure the room so you will know exactly how much space you have for new pieces before you buy them. You should make sure you have enough room to comfortably walk around each piece and open all doors and drawers.
It's a good idea to keep these measurements written down somewhere or stored in your phone so you can consult them if you find a piece of furniture you like.

, Clutter can keep your room from looking the way you want it to, so find a way to minimize it.


Donate clothes and other items you no longer use to a local thrift shop. You can also try selling some things online or at a consignment store if you want some extra money to spend on your room.
Once you've gotten rid of everything you don't need, determine if you still have clutter, and if so, how to deal with it. You may need to add things like shelves, hooks, a dresser, or a storage ottoman to your room, depending on the kinds of items you need to store. Baskets and canvas bins are also great for making clutter disappear!You can also rearrange furniture, or clean out the room and store some unwanted items in the attic or basement. This will make it somewhat easier to see what the shape and size the room is.

, Painting is one of the most affordable ways to instantly change the look of your space. Choose a color that goes well with your theme, and make sure it's something that you think you will like for a long time.


Make sure to measure your room and check how many square feet the paint you are buying will cover. You will almost definitely need two coats of paint, no matter what kind you buy.
If you are painting over a dark color, you may need to prime the walls before you paint.
If you are using more than one gallon of paint, it's a good idea to mix them together in a large bucket just in case they end up being slightly different.
Don't forget to give the ceiling and trim a fresh coat of paint if they are looking dingy.

, Painting your walls a solid color can look great, but if you want something a little more unique, there are lots of ways to add some more interest to your walls.


Paint three walls a neutral color and one wall a very vibrant color for an exciting accent wall.
Use wallpaper for an added punch. Temporary wallpaper is also available if you don't want to have to worry about removing it later. If you can't afford to do your whole room, add wallpaper in strategic locations, like behind your bed or under a chair rail.
If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to wallpaper, try painting on a design. You can use painter's tape to create simple designs like stripes, or use a stencil for a more elaborate design.

Faux painting with a sponge or rag is also an option if you want to give your walls some texture.

Frame several photos and hang them to create a gallery wall.
Hang photos from a piece of string or fishing line with clothespins.Have your photos printed on canvas, glass, or fabric.
Arrange your photos on a poster board for a unique collage.
In lieu of frames, mount photos to colorful pieces of paper and stick them to your walls with double-sided tape.

, Putting up posters of your favorite band or actor can be a great way to express your interests. Better yet, wall stickers are meant for walls and won't rip paint.

Then paint them to go with your theme and hang them in groupings around your room., Just because a piece of furniture looks ugly, doesn't mean it has to go! With a little work, you can give most pieces an amazing makeover, especially if they're solid wood or metal. Solid wood is better quality than particle board or MDF.
Check to make sure all pieces are secure and do not wobble. If you find something that is broken, look to see if it could be repaired.
Drawers and doors should open and close nicely.
Look for joints that are tight and secured with dowels or dovetails. Be wary of joints that are only nailed or glued together.
Metal pieces should be held together by neat, consistent welds that are free from cracks.

, Painting is a relatively quick and easy way to completely change the look of your furniture and accessories.If you want a glossy finish, consider using spray paint.

Hang an old door horizontally on the wall above your bed. You can paint it any color you like.

, These are easy projects, and you can even make them with fabric you already have, like a sheet.These projects require a few simple, straight stitches. If you really hate sewing, you can even use iron-on tape for your seams and hems.
You can create a new cover to put over an old pillow, or, if you don't have an old pillow, simply fill the new pillow with polyester fluff from your local fabric store.

Sewing in a zipper is the hardest part of making a pillow, but this is only necessary if you need to be able to wash the cover. To keep duvet covers closed, you can use buttons, snaps, or even ribbons.
If you don't like the fabric on a chair or sofa, you might want to invest in a slipcover, which is still much less expensive than buying a new piece of furniture. You can also make one yourself, but you will need to have some sewing skills.

, If you have lamps and ceiling fixtures that are a little too boring, there are lots of ways to make them more interesting. Depending on the materials, you could paint the base or the shade, embellish the shade with garland or beads, or even create a new shade with fabric.You can also add creative lighting to your room with strings of holiday lights.

, There's nothing wrong with buying a few new pieces to decorate your room, but try to spend your money wisely.


If you buy new furniture, make sure the quality is good enough that it will last you for a long time. You don't want to have to replace it in a few years.
Don't spend a lot of money on pieces that are extremely trendy or that you may grow out of. Instead, try to make sure your core pieces are versatile so you can still use them even if your style changes. Less expensive accessories, like pillow cases and curtains, can be as trendy as you want.

, When buying furniture, it is important to think about how you plan on using the room. If you have a lot of friends over, for example, make sure you have enough seating. If you have a ton of clothes and not enough closet space, make sure to look for pieces that can store your extra items.If you're short on space, consider looking for pieces of furniture that serve multiple purposes. For example, a few cube ottomans can provide seating and storage. If you would love a couch in your room but don't have room for a both a couch and a bed, consider purchasing a daybed, which looks more like a seating area., There's no absolute rule for how to arrange your furniture, but there are a few helpful guidelines.


Try not to place all of your furniture against a wall. If you have a seating area, have the seats facing each other.
You should also think about colors when you're arranging your furniture and accessories. Try to scatter your accent colors around the room instead of having all of your colorful items on one wall.
Create a focal point. For bedrooms, this is usually the bed, so anchor it with a headboard, a large piece of art, or a colorful accent wall.
Try to have a designated area for each activity you plan on doing in your room, like studying, for example. This will help keep you more organized and help you make better decisions when buying furniture.

, Make sure you know how big your room is and how big a piece of furniture is before you buy it. Your furniture needs to be appropriately sized in order for it to feel cozy, yet comfortable. You also need plenty of space to walk around!


If you're buying a rug. Make sure it is large enough to extend beyond the bed on both sides., Before you buy anything new, check to see if there are any pieces of furniture in other parts of the house that could be used in your room.


You can also try asking around to see if any friends or family members have furniture that they're looking to get rid of.

, Now that you know how to make over nearly any piece of furniture with paint, you can start shopping for affordable used pieces that you can customize to your own liking. Try shopping at antique stores, garage sales, thrift shops, and flea markets.


There might even be a few pieces of furniture in the attic or basement that you aren't using. Repurpose those if possible!

, If you plan on buying new items, always look for deals. Comparison shop if you find an item you like, and never purchase anything online without first searching for a coupon code.

First of all, you are going to need a parent or other legal guardian to help you to buy materials and assist in major projects.,
The first thing you notice when you come into a room is its wall color.,
After you have painted your walls, it is important to have something to hang on them.,
Now you have your walls down, work on furniture , add stuff to your room that is inexpensive and you and your friends can use- for example chairs,a table, lamps.....Stuff that a normal guy would have in their room, but make sure you have a theme going with paint on your walls.

",How to Decorate a Boring Teenage Bedroom (for Boys)," It is possible to do this without parental consent but is much easier when you have someone with a car and debit card on your side.;
, If you have a nursery mural or something else embarrassing on your walls then this is an absolute must. If you are allowed to paint your walls don't go crazy. A red or black may seem cool at the moment but in a year or two you will be saying to yourself, ""What was I thinking?"" also black is a contracting color that makes things seem smaller or more cramped. A good color for a guy is a khaki, beige, coffee or caramel color. Orange is cool too but, it is somewhat hard to work with as things don't exactly add ""orange intensity"" or work with orange. This color may seem a little boring at first but is great because you will never outgrow it. If you are looking for something a little more adventurous move towards a darker blue or two-tone silver and blue room. If you go in a lighter blue it will look like a baby's room so watch out. If your parents or the people you live with prefer you didn't paint your room for one reason or another, this is fine and very easy to work around.

, Depending on the size of your room and your preference, the amount of wall hangings can vary greatly. An easy way to cover a large empty wall neatly and cleanly is to go down to target and purchase some large poster frames. These cost about $15 and are a 2x3 sheet of Plexiglas with a thin wooden backing and a narrow black frame around the outside. These are great for placing posters and other art in. Also, they can be great for collages of pictures with friends or posters out of surf magazines or even movie tickets. The best part about these are they only require one nail and your parents will love them because they can be taken down any time to be changed or if you move. Other great wall hangings are, concert tickets, vintage coke or Dr. pepper signs, cool clocks, sports jerseys and pizza or doughnut boxes. The pizza and doughnut boxes can be especially cool if used correctly. First, open the pizza box and hold it up to the wall. Then push a thumbtack through each of the inside 4 corners. This should allow the pizza box to be opened while attached to the wall. A great way to cover a lot of space is to put up white paper and allow your friends to write or draw on it over time.

Pick an ideal time to talk.,
Think about what you need from the conversation.,
Figure out what you can offer in return.,
Rehearse what you're going to say.,
Let your parents know you want to talk.,
Express gratitude as you ask permission.,
Be specific about what you want.,
Offer to pay for some of the decoration costs.,
Listen to your parents' perspective.,
Avoid arguing.,
Offer to compromise.,
Accept the decision for now.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Redecorate Your Room," Sometimes, when you talk can be as important as the conversation itself. When deciding how to have the conversation, think about a good time to talk.You don't want to bombard your parents when they're already busy or stressed. Aim to talk at a time when your parents are normally at ease.
For example, say your parents usually unwind and watch television on Wednesday nights. This may be a good time to approach them instead of, say, approaching them on a Tuesday night, when they both have busy schedules.;
, You don't want to go into the conversation without a plan. Think about your own feelings and needs. Identify why you want to redecorate your room. Why is this important to you and how can you best convey this to your parents?Oftentimes, redecoration is about something deeper. Maybe you're getting older and your room no longer reflects your personality. Maybe your tastes have changed over the years, and you want something that reflects your individuality.
Instead of just talking about your plans to redecorate, show your parents why it's important to you. Talk about how your room is your sanctuary, and how you want it to express the person you are becoming.

, Your parents want you to learn responsibility. If you request a big change, such as reorganizing your room, they may expect you to do something in exchange for this. Think about what you can trade in exchange for the right to redecorate.Find some specific ways you can offer a trade. Think about things your parents value. Is there anything they frequently want you to do differently? Maybe they want you to bring your grades up or help out around the house more.
Offer a few specific things you'll change if your parents let you redecorate your room. You can, for example, agree to keep your room cleaner in exchange for being allowed to redecorate.

, You don't want to go into the conversation without practicing a little. Talking to your parents can be nerve racking, so go over a few ways to start the conversation in your head.Figure out how you'll get your parents attention. For example, practice saying something like, ""Mom, Dad, could I talk to you?""
Practice your opening sentence a few times in front of the mirror. It doesn't have to be too elaborate. Something as simple as, ""I wanted to talk about my room"" can be sufficient.

, Begin the conversation directly. Approach your parents when they're not busy and let them know there's something you would like to discuss. Say something like, ""Mom, Dad, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you guys about something?"", Parents want to make sure you understand and appreciate responsibility. If you simply ask to redecorate your room with no real introduction, they may think you don't get how much money goes into the cost of renovations. Begin asking by expressing gratitude for how hard your parents work to give you the advantages you have.Say something like, ""I know you guys work really hard so we can have this great house. I really appreciate being able to have my own room and my own space.""
You want to make sure your parents know you appreciate what you have in the present. You need to let them know you do appreciate your room, even if you want to change it.

, Make a clear request. This will give your parents a clear sense of what they're saying ""Yes"" to. Talk to them about what, specifically, you want to change about your room and what kind of help you'll need from them.Tell them what your ideal is for redecoration. For example, ""Ideally, I want to repaint the room in a color I like. I don't really like yellow anymore, so I would really like to paint it blue or green.""
Keep in mind, not all of your requests may be met. Tell your parents what you want directly, but be prepared to potentially compromise.

, Redecorating costs money. Even if your parents can afford to revamp your room, they want you to know the value of money. If you volunteer to take care of some of the costs, your parents are more likely to say ""Yes"" to your request.Tell them how you plan to help pay for the re-decorations. For example, you can say something like, ""I've been saving about $30 of my babysitting money every month for awhile now. I can put that towards paint.""

, Your parents will likely have opinions on the matter. Try not to argue with them or interrupt. Instead, stay calm and try to see their point of view. They may have a point that you're overlooking.For example, your parents may worry about your tastes changing fast. If you're still young, you may change your mind again in the future. It's likely you've cycled through a variety of favorite colors and styles in the past few years, and your parents may not want to waste money redecorating if you're going to want to redo your room again before long.
Try to really consider their point of view. Reflect on your tastes, and how quickly they change. Maybe you want to paint your room green, but green has only been your favorite color for a few months. It may be reasonable to hold off on repainting until your tastes are more stable.

, Arguing is not going to get you anywhere. It's only going to frustrate your parents. If your parents think you're being immature or difficult, they're much less likely to say ""Yes"" to your request.Even if you're getting frustrated, watch your tone. A friendly, respectful tone will be more effective than raising your voice or complaining.

, Your parents may so ""No"" to some of your requests. If this happens, be open to compromise. Instead of getting argumentative, consider their perspective and see if you can reach an agreement that works for everyone.For example, say your parents say ""No"" to repainting. It's expensive and time consuming, and they're worried you'll change your mind in the future.
Try to see if they'd be willing to meet you halfway. Instead of repainting, maybe they would let you put up some temporary wallpaper.

, There's always a chance your parents will not agree to your request. In this case, the best thing to do is to accept a ""No"" for the time being. In the future, you can ask again. If you're mature and go along with your parents decisions, this increases the likelihood they'll say ""Yes"" in the future. They will see that you're mature, which will make them more likely to allow you to make some of your own decisions."

Relax in your clean room.",How to Clean Your Room (Teens)," This can motivate you to get up and clean your room.;
, This will make smell in the bedroom go away and the light will reflect on the room to make it look more inviting.


Opening the window will let fresh air get into your room and clear out any bad smells.







, This will give you room on your bed and make the bed look cleaner. Wash the sheets if needed.


Fold up your duvet nicely and place it near the headboard with your pillows.
Washing your sheets, pillowcases, covers, and comforters every week will keep your room smelling good. Also, it's good for skin because bacteria, dirt, dust mites, and other organisms can build up on your covers, which can lead to more pimples and breakouts.







, So the book on the bookshelf, paper on the work desk.

, If other people's belongings are in your room, then take them to the room they belong in. Their things can get into your way. You don't want anything that might be your siblings' so just take it into their room and place it onto their bed and walk out, it's not a big deal.

, If you find any rubbish like a bottle or paper then put it into your bin, and make sure you get all of it!


Go around with a bin bag or a trash bag. Pick up all the rubbish that is lying around in sight, such as crumbled pieces of paper, rotten apple cores, and other pieces of trash that you don't bother picking up.






After the noticeable pieces of trash on the floor have been cleared, rummage around in the overstuffed closet and underneath your bed for discarded items, such as the half-eaten sandwich from two years ago!







, Make sure you have got all of them in there.

, Remember to fetch things from the tops of cabinets, inside wardrobes, etc. Make sure you go around your room picking everything up, check under your dressers, wardrobe, bed (again) and anything else.


Although some people may like to place their items on their bed, it isn't recommended you do so because of the dirt and dust that might linger on those items. Your bed is where your face goes, and you definitely do not want to be clogging up your pores with dirt.







, Before you place all your belongings back into their spots, it's a good idea that you sort through them and throw out any that you don't need or want anymore. Separate them into piles - one for trash, one for donation, and one for keeps. Stuff the trash pile into the dumpster, carefully place the unwanted items into a trash bag for donation, and organize your remaining belongings so that they will be easier to find. Do not just stuff them in the closet again!


When donating items, make sure that they still are usable. Do not donate ripped, old belongings that are in poor condition.

, The dirty dishes can sometimes leave a really stale smell in your bedroom, and will attract ants and bugs to your room. Now who would want that? Not you, now take them out.

, Vacuum up the dust bunnies and dirt. Start with the floor, then work your way up to the skirting boards, cabinet tops, desk surfaces, etc. Don't forget to clean the inside of your wardrobe as well because this is where a lot of the dust might hide. However, be careful about vacuuming up your homework or any other important items!


Sweep if the floorboards are laminated, vacuum if it's carpet or hard floor.







, Use cream cleaner on a cloth to get grubby fingerprints off white light switches and doors. Use glass cleaner on your mirrors and windows.

, Put the pencils and pens in a holder and the paper in a pile.

, You might want to put a plant on there or a teddy, or just do what you want to do.

, Sort your clothes and group them together (all the pants together, all the short sleeved shirts together, etc.). You could also sort them by season or color.

Go through your clothes and donate anything that doesn't fit.







, Like a bookshelf, a desk, even the walls.

, For example, arrange a few ornaments, photos, etc. on top of your cabinets and shelves. Add a box of tissues and a vase of flowers as well to make your room seem fresher. However, limit your amount of decorations to very few because you don't want your shelves to appear cluttered! Less is more.

, Be meticulous, and maybe add decorative pillows or stuffed animals on the bed. It's your room's main fixture, so it probably should be the nicest.

, Make sure you don't spray too much.

,, Try not to mess it up again - the hardest part of all is keeping it clean and tidy.


One good way to keep on top of your room cleaning is by having a fifteen minute cleanup before bedtime each night or in the morning when you wake up. Then, during the weekend, vacuum, dust, and polish your room. This way, you'll keep it clean, and you'll no longer be embarrassed when your friends come over!

Prepare your uniform.",How to Be Organised (for Teens)," Basically, take out your clothes drawer by drawer, folding them into neat piles according to them (shirts, tank tops, shorts etc). When your closet is completely empty, allocate clothes to each drawer/section and put them in accordingly.;
, For this, so something pretty similar to cleaning your cupboard, the most efficient way (in my opinion) is to completely empty your desk, put all your stuff in piles on your bed. In your mind make a little plan for where you'll put everything, then carefully refill your desk neatly.

, It's not that hard, and it'll make you feel better about your room. It won't look right if you have a perfect room except for a bed that resembles Hiroshima.

, Yep, no undies scattered randomly like hundreds and thousands on that half finished cupcake on the floor. Clean it, if you feel like you're cleaning a chicken pen with bare hands, we may have a slight problem. But hey, gloves are your friend.

, If you have a bit of stuff that you don't use that much, but too precious to you that you can't throw it away, allocate a box for all this stuff and guess what you do now? Fill it. When done, label your box and put it subtly in a corner.

, When you take your textbooks home, it's better if you have a nice little box or magazine holder thing so you can keep your books organized, neat and easy to reach.

, Empty your pencil-case onto your desk or a table. Sort out your things, chuck out not-working pens or other items and if you have an unnecessarily large amount of something, use only a few for school. Use elastic bands or spare hair-ties to organize if you need it.

, A good one should be about to fit in all of your books and laptop (if you need/have one), don't let it be so small you need to carry something else to occupy your hands.

, Prepare your school bag every night before you go to sleep, if you take a packed lunch, you could prepare it the night before and put it in the fridge overnight to put in the next morning.

, Each night lay out some fresh clothes/your uniform for the next day and other things you need.

Tweens should be allowed input and some control of the style of the new room.;
, If it is time for a change, think about what you might want your new space to look like. Feel free to imagine your new room anyway you want at this point and allow for a free flow of ideas to come forward. Imagining the perfect room will help you to create a detailed plan for it.

Having a detailed shopping list will help make sure that you have everything you need.Try to get everything on your list when you go shopping.
Keep your budget in mind as you shop.

, Before you get too far into creating your new space you may want to consider a theme for the room. Picking a theme for the room can be a great way to create a new and interesting space in a way that feels coherent and evokes a certain mood or feeling. Think about what you want your new room to feel like and come up with a theme for your project.


A theme can unify the feeling of a room.
You could base a theme off of your favorite book or movie.
A hobby that you enjoy can also be inspiration for a good theme.
You may take some inspiration from something simple like your favorite color or season.

, Tastes change over time and it's no different for a tween. What might have been entertaining as a child may no longer be entertaining or interesting. Creating a unique entertainment corner or nook in the room can be a great way for these new interests to be showcased and enjoyed.


Think about putting in some shelving that can hold books, movies, and video games.
Make some space for a television, computer, stereo, or gaming systems.
Consider what decorations you want to include in the space. These decorations might be wall stickers, posters, paint, action-figures, or lighting features.

, Although you may enjoy reading, watching movies, or just hanging out in your bedroom, it should also be a restful place to get good night's sleep. Part of getting restful sleep is having a comforting bed. Consider customizing your bed in a way that you find both interesting and relaxing.


A simple way to change the look of your bed is to get some new sheets.
Think about buying or building a bed frame that fits the new style of the room.
Adding something like a canopy to your bed can change the feeling of the whole room.

, Furniture that was once suitable for a child will likely no longer be a good fit for a tween. Whether the style of the furniture is no longer desirable or the furniture is no longer an appropriate size, it may be time for an update. Think about what type and style you want your new furniture to be.


Adding bean bag chairs can be a comfortable touch to your new room.
Think about getting a new desk. Make sure it's a comfortable size to work at.
Dressers or nightstands might need a style change as well. You can either buy new ones or decorate the ones you have.

, A great way to change the look and feel of any room is to add new paint. As with other aspects of the room, the current paint may be too childish for a tween. Think about what styles of either paint might give the room a fresh and appealing new look that everyone can enjoy.You can paint the room anyway you like, either a one color or many.
Try to match the color of your room to any theme that you have in mind for it.
Think about including interesting patterns when adding new paint.
Color can have an effect on mood so pick a hue that makes you feel great., Before you can redecorate the room you will need to decide what to remove from the room. There may be old furniture, decorations, or personal items that need replacing or might be considered too childish for a tween. Decide which items are going into storage and which are to be donated or discarded., The items and furniture that are going to be kept will need to be protected or temporarily removed while you redecorate the room. Painting the walls, remodeling, or redoing any flooring is likely going to create a mess, damaging or ruining anything left in the room. Make sure important objects are protected or removed before working on the room.


Plastic tarps can cover up large pieces of furniture and protect them from dust or paint.
Smaller items can be directly removed from the room to create work space and keep them safe.

, If you plan on remodeling any areas of the room, you will want to do so as your first step. Remodeling will change the features of the room and can create quite a mess. Doing this first can help prevent you from needing to repaint or retouch these areas later on.


You may want to add something like a new closet or shelving.
Sometimes you may want to remove something, like a non-load bearing wall, opening up the space.

, Some new furniture or features might require you to install them as opposed to simply placing it in the room. These features of the room usually take some tools or hardware to install properly. Make sure these pieces of furniture are installed properly before moving on to other aspects of the room.Adding something like a new door will require you to fit and attach the door to the door frame. Most doors will come with all the hardware you need such as screws and hinges.
Some shelving needs to be attached directly to the wall. These shelving units may come with the necessary screws to hold it to the wall.
You will likely need to provide your own tools. Having a screwdriver or power drill will allow you to install most simple additions to the room.

, After the room has been remodeled you can now paint the walls, ceilings, or even the floor. Most paint can be easily applied with either a brush or a paint roller and can be a fun and easy way to change the look of a room. Work slowly and make sure you cover each area entirely to get a good finish.Paint brushes can be useful for corners or smaller areas that require a detailed approach.
Paint rollers are best used in large areas as they can cover a lot of area quickly.
Make sure you are wearing old clothes that you don't mind getting paint on.

, Finalize your room by putting everything back in it and adding any new items or finishing touches. These items can be any personal decorations that you might want to add, creating a personalized and comfortable new room to enjoy.Add personal items such as televisions, computers, or books back into the room.
Place new furniture or items in the way you originally designed your plan.
Within reason, allow your tween decorate the room with any art or posters or art they might want to.

Now you must buy a camcorder or some sort of equipment to record yourself on.,
Try to get onto a record label.,
You should be fairly popular now...",How to Start a Pop Punk Band (for Kids in Primary School.)," Always remember the band might break up because of moving schools.;
, Most pop punk bands consist of 3-7 people. This may be hard if you go to certain music lessons, guitar etc. then ask people there if they are interested. Ask all of your friends if they play an instrument or own one! If they do not know how to play that instrument then who cares, just make sure they can read the tabs and write music! Or if you are clever enough, teach them! Good pop punk bands have a lead guitarist a lead singer (or the singer might play lead guitar as well!) Rhythm Guitar, Bass and drums. A backing vocalist is additional but that could be the bassist or rhythm guitar or so... Hold auditions for band members, put up posters saying you need a band member who can play (an instrument!)Don't give up this task is VERY hard!

, The school music room, your classroom at break time, a garage, your home or you could even ask your parents if you can rent a small place somewhere for a cheap amount! Even ask a local pub if when the pub is closed you could practise there! Stretch your limits!

, Most good bands start out playing covers to songs. For a warm-up at every practise pick one song you all know and play it once! You could do that for a warm up for every practise. Practise daily at the LEAST once a week is fine but i would say twice a week but practise as much as you can!

, If you can't play a certain song then make your own version of it! See what you can come up with!

, Normally a band would have one or two people writing the songs! Pop punk song topics are lots of things. Sad things, good things, being excited, feeling lonely! Most pop punk songs are about bad things though.

, You could look in the dictionary and find random words that sound cool!

, Make posters, hand made or made on the computer anyway would do, and in addition to this make a band logo too! Put posters up every where, in school, on the streets, on buildings' walls, around your neighbour hood! Anywhere popular and visible would do!

, Get a simple small job that is suitable for kids like walking dogs, giving out newspapers, help some people cut their grass, or even help old people across the road! This will earn you simple reasonable amounts of money! If this doesn't work then make a deal with the band that every body has to give a tiny amount of pocket money every week for the band. Make it fair for every one like if somebody gets £1 a week then they should try to give in 20p or so...

, Now try to get gigs! Maybe ask shopping malls if you can do small performances their for a fair price, maybe do a few songs on the street. Or even do a small gig in your neighbourhood! etc!

, If not then don't give up! If you are popular then start making songs, recording them, making music videos and making albums!

If you're up there posing like you're something you're not, people will boo you off the stage faster than Nickelback at a metal fest. People will quickly hear if you're affecting a ""punk voice,"" or being fake, so sing in the most natural, but aggressive form of your own voice.


Although it has grown into a commodity, and you can buy studded belts and Ramones tees at the mall, punk has roots in anti-establishmentism and class consciousness. The earliest punk bands were fronted by angry working class youths.Anyone can be a punk singer nowadays, but it's important to understand the historical context of the music you want to perform.;
, The best way to get a primer on great punk vocals is to listen to great punk music. It's important to explore punk rock from different eras and seek out the vocalists who pioneered the sound, and vocalists who are doing it right today. Check out:


Greg Graffin from Bad Religion
Keith Morris from Circle Jerks and OFF!
Patti Smith
Henry Rollins from Black Flag
Johnny Rotten from Sex Pistols
Joan Jett
Joey Ramone from The Ramones
David Vanian from The Damned
Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys

, A punk voice should sound a lot like your regular singing voice, but amplified into a louder version of itself. When you're done singing a punk song, your throat should feel raw, which is how you know you're doing it right.


Generally, punk vocals don't move up and down much, but hang on a single note, or a few notes. Volume is more important than vocal acrobatics.
Popularized by some forms of progressive hardcore or ""screamo,"" a different form of vocalizing is sometimes just called ""screaming,"" with some bands even designating a particular screamer to the line-up. For more on this style of singing, read this article.

, Unlike metal singing or even country singing, which have very specific, established sounds that are associated with the voice, punk songs can be sung by all sorts of different vocalists. Mostly, though, we associate punk singers with a higher pitched ""head voice,"" that comes from the throat and the nose, more than the diaphragm.


If you have a high, nasally voice, you'll fit in right beside snotty punk bands like Zero Boys or Blink 182, while if you've got a lower growl, you'll be able to pull off a good Joe Strummer impression.

, Punk vocalists often look like they're in on some private joke you don't get, and you can hear it in the voice. It's a kind of sneering cool that's unique to punk and some other kinds of rock signing. Punk, aside from being a serious and emotional political form of music, is also a lot of fun to sing, and it should seem like it.


Even though they're not punk, check out old Elvis Presley videos, and listen to Jerry Lee Lewis sing their classic rock stylings. These are big influences on punk vocals, and they've got the same current of cool running through.

, All that yelling can take a major toll on the vocal cords, so it's important to take some preventative and restorative steps to care for your instrument to keep yourself singing. You don't have to become a diva, but doing a few little things will keep you howling.


Make sure you stay hydrated when you sing, warming your throat with some hot tea and then hydrating afterwards with sports drink or plain water.
While it may seem like a fast-track to a good punk rasp, smoking makes it much more difficult to maintain the breath support necessary for good punk vocals. Avoid cigarettes.

, A huge part of performing punk music happens with what you do around the singing, as much as the singing itself. Good punk singers are like performance artists and stage maniacs, flailing about and getting people whipped into a frenzy. Check out performances by these classic punk performers:


Lux Interior from The Cramps
Iggy Pop from The Stooges
Darby Crash The Germs
Cole Alexander from Black Lips

, Most of the classic punk vocalists are singers, not singers and guitar players. If you're going to be on stage with nothing but the mic, it's important to learn to handle it, both to get the best sound possible, and look cool doing it.


That spot between your nose and your top lip, where a mustache would be? Jam the microphone into that spot and keep it there while you sing. Don't worry about over-blowing it.
Grab the mic as close to the head as possible, like rappers do. Try wrapping the cord around the hand you're holding the mic with, to keep it out of the way for head banging.
Don't grab the mic cable and swing the microphone. Sound guys hate this, and it makes you look like a dork.
If you want to buck the trend, keep the mic on the mic stand and wrestle with it, swinging it around and bending it to your height, then straight up, then back again. This is strangely compelling.

, Cheap mics work best for singing punk rock, and if you can dial up a little reverb or gain on the PA that you're singing through, all the better. Try thinking of your voice like another guitar or another instrument on stage: it's there to make sound more than it is there to communicate specific messages. That's what the lyric sheet is for., It's not dancing, it's flailing. Punk vocalists will often perform the songs just as much by moving around. For different vocalists, this might mean hopping around, pumping fists, head-banging, rolling around on the floor, or–as in Iggy Pop's case–smearing peanut butter on your chest. You might not need to go that crazy, but it always helps to get wild when you're performing punk.


Practice performing your songs in the dark to help to free yourself and get comfortable. It doesn't matter if you ""look cool,"" speaking strictly. You just need to look uninhibited and free.

, Punk bands should play at the same level as the audience whenever possible, attempting to blur the line between performer and spectator. If there's a stage at the venue where you're playing, set-up on the floor. Better yet, perform in basements and union halls, or other all ages venues.


Avoid lame ""classic rock"" gestures, like stage diving and other cliches. Punk isn't about acting like some kind of rock god.

, Punk style is a controversial topic, for obvious reasons, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Think about it this way: you want to dress in the way that will make you confident to perform punk music. If that means you wear a plain white tee and a pair of Dickies, you'll be in good company, right along with Henry Rollins. If you want a jean jacket and some combat boots, all the better. Leather jacket and pink mohawk? Maybe. Try to match your concept of punk style to the punk scene you're a part of and the aesthetics of your music.


Want to learn how to sing punk? Go to shows. Local shows. Buy band tees from local punk bands and rep them whenever you go out. Put on shows and promote the local scene. That's punk.

, While it was originally used to describe country music, the phrase ""three chords and the truth"" is often used to describe many types of music, especially punk rock. If you're going to be the vocalist, you've got to provide the truth part. In general, punk lyrics need to come from your life, and come from the heart.


Listen to Keith Morris' lyrics on the first two Circle Jerks records. He addresses class issues, politics, and addiction in explicit ways. Perfect punk vocals.

, Punk songs are often from the perspective of alienated youth, giving voice to the particular frustration of being a teenager. Feel like nobody cares or understands you? Channel that feeling into your lyrics. Sing about what matters to you, and to your community.


Nihilism and anarchism are philosophies often associated with punk rock, both philosophies that privilege the freedom of the individual from all ideological and political structures. It's important to understand this context of most punk music.

, Most punk songs aren't incredibly complex in the vocal range required, or in the melodies included. Often, lots of classic punk lyrics will only include a few lines, repeated over and over. Don't worry about over complicating things.


Often, punk lyrics don't need to rhyme to make them work. Toss out all the traditional rules of songwriting and go with what works for the material.

, Most punk songs are only two minutes long, three at the most. If you can clock in a memorable punk song that takes less than 120 seconds to play, you're really on to something.


Don't overthink it when you're structuring the song. Think verse, chorus, verse, chorus, chorus.

, Punk rock also makes plenty of room for juvenile and the crude senses of humor. Toilet humor and sex puns are par for the course on lots of skate and pop punk songs, especially. Check out early NOFX, Blink 182, Screaming Weasels, and Green Day songs for good examples of punk at its most crude.

Get that bed set!,

Clear up the messy hooks.,
Fix or get rid of your posters.,
Clean out your closet!,
Organize and clean your desk and dressers.,
Sort through that mixed up, messy pile.,
Clean under your bed.,
Create a basket of stuff.",How to Clean Your Bedroom (for Youth)," Nothing looks worse in a bedroom than a messy bed! So before you start anything else, make your bed. It's simple and easy: pull up your covers, straighten them out, and fluff your pillows. If you have teddy bears or stuffed animals, lay them outside by side on the end of your bed. Voila, your room is that much closer to becoming clean, with just one easy step!;
, If you have any area rugs that can be picked up, take them outside and brush them off. Otherwise, vacuum the rugs to keep them clean.

, These are the hooks behind your door or on your closet filled with clothes!


Take all your clothes off of the hook.
Pick the clothes you are going to wear as pajamas tonight and the clothes you are going to wear for tomorrow, and place those clothes back on the hook. Those should be the only things you should leave on the hooks.
Take all of the other clothes that were on the hooks and sort them. The dirty clothes should be placed in the hamper for cleaning and the clean clothes should be folded and placed in your closet or drawers. Get rid of any old clothes that you don't like or fit. This will give your closet a more tidier look.

, Most kids rooms are overdone with maps, posters, and pictures! The walls and doors become overcrowded and the posters deteriorate over time. Some of the tape may be peeling off, posters may be overlapping, and the pictures may be outdated.


Decide whether or not you need the posters and pictures.
Take all of your posters down and throw the tape in the garbage.
If you want to keep your posters, roll em up and store them away. If you want to keep them up on your walls, fix the posters as needed to get rid of tears or rips and place them back on the wall with new tape.
Otherwise, throw them in the trash.

, Cleaning out your closet can be a difficult process but is one that must be done.


Remove any clothes that are on the floors. Fold them up and place them in a drawer or on a shelf. Alternatively, place them on a hanger and hang them in your closet.
If you have toys, board games, notebooks, and other accessories in your closet, gather them up. Place all of the objects in groups based on their function (all of the games together, all of the toys together) and find a specific spot for them. Not only will the closet look less cluttered, you will also be able to find things you need at any time!
One more thing: never put junk in the closet as a quick way to put it away!

, Are there candy wrappers, pieces of paper, small knickknacks, or food scattered throughout the desk and dressers? Clean those up!


Throw any candy wrappers, used paper and notes, and anything you no longer want in the garbage.
If you find anything important, place it in a safe spot where you won't forget it!
Any knickknacks that you find should be placed in one box that is easy to access.
If you find any old food or drinks, throw them away. They may no longer be safe to eat or drink.

, Many rooms have a small pile of junk that needs to be cleaned up but it seems like it will take forever. It can actually be simple to organize!


For girls:

Sort through the large group of objects and sort them.
Create sections in your room for the objects you find: hair accessories, knickknacks, notebooks, and so on.
Find a proper place for each section of objects that your grouped. Anything left over should be put in their own space.


For boys:

Follow the steps above for the girls, but instead of organizing your hair accessories, group any similar objects that you may have, such as Pokémon cards or mini cars.



,


Possessions are always pushed or placed under the bed, especially when they aren't always needed. You never know what might be under there!
Pull everything out from under your bed and organize it as necessary.
Vacuum and dust under your bed to create a clean floor surface.
If you have anything left (that was under your bed) which you haven't placed elsewhere, leave it out until you complete the next step.

,


Put a basket beside your bed, or wherever else you want to keep it.
Whenever you come home and you're holding onto something that doesn't have a place, put it in your basket.
Take anything that you left out (from under your bed) and place it in here if there is no other spot for it yet.
Choose one day out of each week to be your clean-up day.
On this clean-up day, take the time to sort through the basket, taking one thing at a time and placing it in it's proper spot. If you find anything that is old or that you no longer need, throw it out.

Wait for the sales. Plan your work around what's on sale and around sale dates. That way, you can probably get away with buying hardly anything at the full price.
Look for used items. There are plenty of excellent places to source secondhand goods that will make your room work well. Check out the local thrift stores, used furniture stores, online auctions, Craigslist, and the Freecycle network. Do your wallet and the planet a favor by giving old things another chance.
Look around the whole house. There might be items nobody else wants, but be sure to ask first so you don't inadvertently adopt something someone else was using. If you've left home, there's still no harm in asking your parents what they've got spare to donate to you. If you're still in your parents' home, rummage around for unused items and decorative things.
Take stock of what you already have. Can you rearrange or repurpose the things you already own? Should you spend some time removing clutter and cleaning up?;
, You need to have an idea of what you're going to do and what the finished product will look like: Modern? Retro? Classical? Keeping this general theme in mind will help you to shop efficiently for anything new you might need, and it also helps you to avoid buying things that won't fit into the theme. Also keep in mind that you will want to make your bedroom space as much like a living room (or den) as is practical.


Draw your room shape on paper or in a computer drawing program. On paper, arrange the room in the way that you'd like to see it. Put the furniture you already have into position and work from there. What's missing? What else will you need to create the various functions within the room such as mini-kitchenette, TV viewing space, study corner, and peaceful sleep zone? Where will you hang clothes to dry?
If you have an en-suite sink or bathroom, include this in your design too. An en-suite allows you to not only maintain your own hygiene but also becomes a clothes washing and drying space, a plant growing area (sprouts are great!), and a dish washing area using the basin. How will you incorporate these different activities within the en-suite space you've got?

, Clearing the room to make more space can be really helpful if you are prone to keeping things when you don't really need them. Even making sure that everything has a place can be useful if it means that things don't get cluttered as easily. Living in one room means you have little space and being tidy is the best thing., If you have the option of new paint, it is the fastest way to improve the look of a room. The color of the paint is very important; light paint will give a sense of greater space and brightness, whereas darker paint will tend to make the room seem more compact but the deeper color might also be cozier. Perhaps do a few test colors on the wall first, after choosing from paint color charts.


Consider using different colors within the room. Try painting the principal wall one color (usually the one a bedhead rests against) and paint the other three walls a slightly lighter shade of the same color group. Or, you might even want to paint a small area of wall marking out a corner for sitting, TV or games. Use your imagination.

, Ensure your privacy and keep out heat and cold with good window coverings, such as blinds or curtains. If they're not already in place, purchase ones that fit to the size of your window space.

, Use the plan you drew up earlier to guide you on placement of the furniture in the room. You don't want it to be too cluttered. Try to make make some furniture do double duty. For example, can you use a sofa bed or futon rather than a bed and a sofa? If you can, it makes the bed space usable during the day.


A comfortable but compact chair or two will make a nice addition when you have guests, plus it's a great place to sit and read.
Get a comfortable ergonomic chair for the computer desk. You can also sit in it to eat, or use it as an additional chair when you have guests.
Consider getting a table that folds down or folds onto the wall for a dining table. It doesn't need to be huge, as it'll usually only be you eating at it, but it's better than eating over your keyboard at the computer desk.
Try making a sitting corner with bean bags, a large armchair, or a group of large pillows and cushions.

, Lighting can really change the mood and comfort levels of your room. Accent lamps are a great way to add a bit of mood to the room inexpensively.


Try moving a small desk lamp between the desk and the bedside table.

, A bedroom won't have a lot of space for cooking, and in some cases, it could be dangerous to even try. But a microwave, a coffee maker, and a kettle are all useful additions that will let you make a wide range of easy-to-heat foods in your room, including noodles, steamed vegetables, canned or packet soups, etc.


Get a microwave. Any size will do, depending on what you are planning to cook in it, although the bigger it gets, obviously the more space it needs. You will need to have at least a good sized table or desk placed in your room for this, since you probably don't want your microwave on the floor.
Add a mini fridge. You can get these at just about any store that sells kitchen appliances. If you can find one with a good sized freezer, that will let you keep frozen dinners and ice handy. You can put your microwave on top of this if it's the right size. It's not good for heat transfer, but it will save space.
Anything small enough works. Size your appliances for one person. You might try a Foreman Grill, crock pot, or small toaster oven.
Coffee makers and/or kettles are good, too, if you can't live without your morning coffee.
Get some reusable kitchenware such as bowls and flatware. You can rinse them out in the bathroom sink.
Get a covered trash can, and don't let your garbage pile up. It is stinky, attracts bugs and is unsanitary. Plus, its just plain gross. Empty it regularly.

, Sufficient storage makes it much easier to keep things tidy. When everything has a place, you won't be so tempted to create piles or just leave things wherever they fall.


Get shelving and cabinets. If you plan on keeping canned foods or boxed snacks in your room, shelves and cabinets are ideal.
Bookshelves and cubbyholes in desks work well for books, games, knickknacks and small electronics like cords, USBs, cameras, and MP3 players. Try some invisible shelves for something different and conversation-starting.
Have somewhere to hang and fold clothes if there isn't already wardrobe space provided.
Try to make use of every possible area for storage. A small room can look like a mess with just a small amount of floor clutter so keep everything tidy all the time.

, A wall mount for the television is a great space saver that's fairly standard nowadays. Consider a laptop computer instead of a tower or desktop and use a thin wireless keyboard that can be easily tucked away.


A hand-held video game system fits anywhere. A standard TV-connected console gives much more realistic graphics and can often be played with a friend. A well-equipped gaming computer leaps yet further ahead, and can be played online for hours without end - but don't overdo it.

Games a few years old are generally very inexpensive. Many free games are available for computers. A few-years-old game on a computer with a good video card will generally look better than a new game on a console.


Avoid amassing a huge DVD or CD collection. Rely on downloading your music and movies instead and using laptop and MP3 connections to play your downloads. If you don't want to pay all the time, hire DVDs from the local video store and remember to return them on time, or have them mailed to you if your area offers rentals by mail. Or see if your local library lends CDs and DVDs.
If you can, add a ceiling fan. You might not have complete control over the household thermostat. When it's too hot in the room, set the fan to pull air up towards the ceiling (or blow down on you) on high speed. When it's too cold in the room, set the fan to blow warm air down from the ceiling on low speed to mix it in without wind-chill.
If your housemates are polar bears that keep the temperature far too low for you, look for a small inexpensive space heater. Modern space heaters stay cool to the touch except for the front where the heat comes out. Don't leave it on while you sleep though. Use it to heat the room and turn it off when you go to bed.
Ensure that you can iron in your room. Get an iron, as well as a small ironing board and a mesh basket for taking clothes to the laundry and hanging outside if possible.
Switch off all electronics at the wall at night. Any buzzing, humming, or blinking, will distract you when you're trying to sleep and you can do without the electromagnetic interference too. Plus, turning appliances off at the wall saves money.

, If you're allowed to keep a pet in your room, provide its sleeping quarters and other needs. You might have a cat and add its basket for sleeping, or a vivarium for your pet reptile. Also consider lighting, odor, and food storage issues.

, Since this is your home, you won't be able to leave the bed unmade and piles of take-out containers in a corner if you're planning on having people over. Plan a regular cleaning schedule and if possible, rely on the household supplies and tools rather than trying to store your own in the room. Once you have a schedule in place, stick to it and living wholly in your bedroom will be a pleasant experience.


Realize that odors are going to be one big issue in your tiny home within a house. If you're cooking in your bedroom, you'll need to have the ability to open a window to let trapped smells outside and you may also need air fresheners to disguise the odors. It is also wise to eat food with strong odors outside or at the place you've bought them from rather than having them in your room. Bear in mind that you'll have to sleep with the odors and that they're permeating your clothing.
Avoid smoking in your room for the same reason. A room that smells of stale cigarette smoke is unpleasant for everyone who visits, and it doesn't do your health any good to be smoking in close confines.
Consider opening your window for fresh air at least once a day, even during very cold weather (for a few minutes).
Keep an eye out for ants and other pests. They really like to get into areas with food. Keep ant traps handy and put one in each corner of your room before you can even see them.

, Since you'll be cooking in your room, as well as living in there much of the time, safety is a high priority. If there isn't a smoke detector in place already, install one. In addition, have an all-purpose fire extinguisher. Keep your fire extinguisher handy but not near your cooking area. In case a fire breaks out, you want the extinguisher to be available.

, Keep a spare key hidden somewhere outside so you don't lock yourself out, but hide it well enough so it cannot be found by others interested in prying. At night, you can also use portable security alarms sold to travelers if you're concerned about being broken into while you sleep. This might be overkill, but you'll know the safety of your own house and neighborhood.

A basic drum set including a hi-hat, snare, bass drum, and crash cymbal. Tom-toms and floor toms aren't necessary for basic drumming, but you can add them in as you go along.;
, Punk drumming is fast and exciting, so it requires great stamina and speed. This comes with practice. The only way to achieve speed is by practicing slowly.

, To hold your drum sticks, your wrist must be relaxed and your grip must allow the stick to bounce slightly when it hits the hi-hat or the snare. The grip is mostly between the index finger and the thumb; the rest of the fingers should be loosely arched above the stick providing balance.


The hi-hat hand(your dominant hand) will cross over the snare (non-dominant) hand slightly. Make sure that there is a comfortable distance between them so they don't hit each other when you begin to play.

, Punk music is usually made up of measures of four beats per measure. That is 1-2-3-4-cont during this how to rhythm patterns will be written within this template. For example, if the snare was to be played on the second beat I would write it like this 1-snare-3-4

, Practice this until you are able to do this in time to the beat without concentrating. It must be natural and it must act independently of the snare and bass drums. The hi-hat is the timekeeper of the drum set and must not stop.

, Using your non-dominant hand you can either strike the snare on every second beat, e.g. 1-snare-3-snare, or you can beat it on every pulse e.g. snare-snare-snare-snare etc. and repeat. The most difficult part of this is coordinating the right hand and the left hand as the hi-hat must play continuously and independently of the snare and vice versa. Your snare hand's wrist must be relaxed and allow the stick to bounce slightly after each strike of the drum.

, This involves playing the bass on the first and third beat of the measure, e.g. bass-2-bass-4, while also coordinating the snare and hi-hat. The snare usually hits on 2 and 4. So, you'll have bass-snare-bass-snare, with the hi-hat hitting every beat.

,, When you have practiced and mastered this basic beat, you may move onto more complex hi-hat patterns involving 8 strokes of the hi hat per measure, that is two strokes of the hi-hat per beat e.g. 1hi hat hi-hat- 2hi hat hi-hat- 3hi hat hi-hat - 4 hi hat hi hat. this requires practice and complete relaxation as the hand and shoulders may cramp (and nobody needs a cramped drummer at a high octane punk show).

, A very common punk beat has 2 eighth notes on beat 3 or both beat 1 and 3. b-s-bb-s, or bb-s-bb-s. You can add the eighth notes on snare as well for example: b-ss-b-s, b-s-bb-ss, or bb-ss-bb-s. Keep in mind that the hi-hat is playing eighth notes consistently just like the other rhythms. Lastly snare can also be played on the offbeats as well. (if you perfect snare on the offbeats it is one more step towards sounding like a pro).

, Begin slowly and then begin to speed up until they are as fast as you can possibly do them. Learn to move the rolls from different parts of your kit.


Rolls are done like this. R =right hand and L = left hand.- RLRLRLRLRLRL. practice slowly and move to speeding them up. this is just a basic roll and you can find many more online.

,, Listen to different punk sub-genres whether it be Hardcore Punk such as Minor Threat, Black Flag, or Bad Brains. Classic Punk: Sex Pistols, Ramones, or The Clash. Proto-Punk such as The Stooges, or MC5. Anarcho such as The Crass, Dead Kennedys, or Discharge. Pop Punk, such as Blink 182 or Green Day. Get yourself out of your comfort zone and experiment with different sub-genres. Don't limit yourself to one type of punk genre.

, something new and different is always appreciated. Listen to jazz as jazz drummers are especially creative and could provide some inspiration. Punk is an inclusive genre and the DIY ethic allows people to add new and unusual things into the music. For example The Clash incorporated reggae into their music

, Try watching Keith Moon from The Who in action. Watch Buddy Rich and see the speed and accuracy with which he plays.

, The most important thing in punk drumming is speed and volume. Learn to play loud and fast, but accurately. The drummer is the person who controls the speed of the song so you must be confident enough in your technique to play as fast as you desire. However also learn how to play quietly as this can be key to creating contrast in a song and also helps stop the neighbors screaming if you decide to practice at four in the morning.

, Many drummers get sidelined because they are situated at the back of the stage. Create an attitude that won't let you or the rest of the band be forgotten.

, It will improve your performance.

Sewing leather is very difficult.,
Sew funky fabric onto the collar, lapel, sleeve, back, side, or anywhere you think some fabric or a patch would look cool.",How to Make a Punk Rock Leather Jacket3,", It can be made easier by using a high end sewing machine and special needles for sewing leather, but if you are doing it by hand you will need to pre-punch each stitching hole with an awl, a nail, or some other similar punch tool to avoid breaking needles and swearing outlandishly when you poke yourself with the needle. Another tip is to use pliers to poke your needle through the leather.

, It is also a good idea, but not necessary, to superglue the fabric to the jacket as to hold the material in place. This also prevents the fabric from puffing out while wearing it and to make it look almost professionally done from a distance.

Supplies- Buttons and/or whatever would look good if you put it on a jacket.

,
Accessorize your jacket with anything that takes your fancy.",How to Make a Punk Rock Leather Jacket4,", Jackets look good with a little extra, and in adding all that extra stuff, why not put more on there.

You could really use anything on this step.

Do your hair.,
Now for the wardrobe.,
If your mom allows you to, start wearing make-up.,
Now that you have the main look down, you need to complete it by adding these simple things:


Get a backpack in the usual styles.,
You know how to look like a Skater Girl, now learn how to act like one!,
Last but not least, just be yourself!",How to Look Like a Punk Perfect Preteen Girl,"


Get a hair cut. Make sure your hair is from one-inch above your chest to one-inch below, and get it layered so it falls short in front, and then longer in back in a V-shape so it flows naturally. Follow these tips to achieve the ultimate hair style:
Straighten your hair. For curly-to-wavy hair, get a straightening perm (where they use the wavy-perm stuff, but they straighten it) if the hair straighteners aren't strong enough. Even if you do have straight hair, straighten it with a straightening iron, which you can find guides on WikiHow for.
If your hair is too short to do this then just get the simple shorter at the back, longer at the front look.
Highlight your hair. This works best for light brown to dirty blonde hair - if you have dark hair, you'll have to bleach the hair you want to highlight before you put the color in (leave it a couple days between bleaching and dyeing!). Either get blonde highlights from the root to a little above the middle of the hair, or get a color (like pink, purple, or even red) along the bottom.
Don't be afraid to experiment! Try new things with your hair. Put in plastic bows (they look oh-so cute!) or tie your hair in pigtails that rest on your shoulders. If you have a small section of hair dyed, take that piece and put a clip in it!;
, Make sure you follow these wardrobe steps:


Check out Zumiez, Journeys, Tilly's, Vans, Punky Fish, or any skate-shops. Most of them have websites. They will probably have ideas for outfits you can try!
Any pink frilly stuff you might have from your pre-punk days can still work pretty well, if you put an edge on it. Think Gothic Lolita, think Courtney Love and Kat Bjelland!
For tops, buy babydoll-tees with any patterns of ""skate stuff"", like hearts in bright colors, electric bolts, etc. Or try layering tank tops in bright colors. 'Tie up' your shirt around your waist (not showing your stomach, just around your waist so that only a little bit shows) and fold the knot under. You can also wear 'arm warmers' in bright colors, just don't over-do it!
For bottoms, try ripped skinny jeans, mini shorts or skirts, really anything that's a dark-wash, ripped/faded, or skinny. Under shorts and skirts, you can wear bright leggings in stripped colors. Try a black and another color combo, which minimizes the size of your legs.
For accessories, wear big necklaces, chokers, cuffs, bright big beaded bracelets, anklets, eye-grabbing earrings, and if you're daring...Ties!.

, Not a lot of caked-on garbage, just these few simple things to complete your look:


A skin-tone evener, or a concealer, for evening out your skin tone.
Black eyeliner. Don't make it thick and racoon-like, just a thin line, and a swirl or flip at the end.
Shimmery eyeshadow that blends with the eyeliner, and make sure you blend them. Try a sheer eyeshadow if you don't want it too thick. Another thing to try, is put on silvery colored eyeshadow with a wet brush, (literally cake it on, but don't make it very dark, just obviously visible) from your lash line to halfway up to your brow. Then take a dark metallic silvery shade and lightly overlap it on the outer corners of your eyeball lids, for a (lighter and neater) Nancy Spungen makeup look. Add mascara, eyeliner on your top and bottom waterline (Note TOP waterline, under your lashes, because it will add an illusion of fuller lashes, even if you have remarkably full lashes) and maybe, JUST maybe, put the eyeliner under your lashes starting 3/4 from the outer corner of your lashes and wing it out as far as you want. Punk is about being different, don't even mind the word 'Poser'.
Lip shine, in a pale pink color. What you're looking for isn't color, but shine.

, A dark, heart patterned JanSport one will be perfect. Or try a messenger bag, although they are murder on the shoulders if you have a lot of homework or textbooks, however you can get thick strapped messenger bags although these are harder to find. Decorate you bag strap with badges of bands, stars or skulls, another alternative is make your own badge. By gluing some ribbons and a beer bottle cap on top these can give an awesome punk touch to your outfit.

,



Be cool. Act wild and spazzy when it works for you, but learn how to say the right things and not make a fool of yourself. Be yourself, and you will soon be seen as someone who is popular!
Adapt a I'm-Myself-And-You-Can't-Change-That attitude. Forget about wanting to please the 'popular' crowd, just be yourself!

, Still be the real you, and don't give up on anything just to be like this. Punk is meant to be unique too, adapt this to make your own style!!

Buy yourself some appropriate footwear.,
Get some black stretch jeans or black work pants from a second-hand store.,
Choose or make your belts.,
Buy black t-shirts from a charity store or army surplus store.,
Buy a black hooded sweatshirt from a second hand store.,
Try finding a black denim jacket.,
Buy a black baseball or trucker hat from a charity store, or a black army cap from an army surplus store.,
Own some basic accessories.,
Try to avoid using hair dye or hair products.,
Body modifications.",How to Dress Like a Crusty," Salvaged or second hand converse trainers or plimsolls are good, but combat boots are better, so long as they aren't made from leather.;
, Alternatively you could get camouflage trousers (or shorts for the summer) from an army surplus store. If you want to be really crusty, you could just sew your own trousers from scratch using cheaply bought or found fabric.


Customize. Screen print some political or crust band patches using white fabric paint. Then sew these onto your trousers with white dental floss. You can also sew plain black patches onto your trousers. Try to totally cover your trousers in patches. Don't worry if they overlap, this looks very crusty. You can also sew purposeless zippers onto your trousers. Plain patches made out of camouflage, leopard print or vegan friendly false leather are also cool. Attaching studs or flattened lighter heads onto the tops of your pockets is a nice touch.
Butt flaps are a very cool crusty accessory. This is a roughly square patches of fabric that you can attach to the front of your pants (in which case you can sew it so it functions like a pocket) or the back of them (in which case it stops your but getting cold when you sit down and it stops the butt of your pants wearing through). Either way, painting or patching DIY silk screened band names or political slogans or symbols on your butt flap is very crusty.

, When it comes to belts you've got two options: Either a length of rope or a bullet belt. Don't be afraid to use both!

, Then paint political designs or crust band names/logos (which are often going to be politically charged anyway) on them with white fabric paint (use a home made stencil for extra precision). If you don't want to risk messing up your t-shirt you could just screen print a large patch and then sew this onto your t-shirt. Cutting the sleeves and collar off your t-shirt is very crust. You can then re-cycle this fabric to make patches.

, Customize it like your pants. Attach studs and flattened lighter heads onto the hood rim. Sew home made patches all over it and sew a big back patch onto the back. Remember to use white dental floss. If it's a pullover hooded sweatshirt, you could try painting a crust band or political statement onto the front of yours.

, Customize it in the same way as your trousers except this time you can cover it in metal studs or spikes. Putting these on over the plain patches looks very good. Try sewing on a home made back patch with your handy dental floss. You could try splattering your jacket with bleach before you start customizing it for a very crusty effect. Attaching political/band buttons onto the front of your jacket is cool. Even better if you buy a badge making machine and make them yourself


Alternatively, you could buy an army jacket from a charity store or an army surplus store. Customize it by adding patches and lengths of chain.

, Sew home made patches onto it or paint stuff directly onto it! You can also try embedding spikes onto the bill.

, Jewelry made out of hemp or found materials is very crusty. Lengths of chain attached with a carabiner or padlock are also cool. A black bandanna would top off your look, so long as you get it from a charity store.

, Just let it grow long and become naturally matted and unkempt. It may dreadlock on its own or you may opt to dreadlock it yourself. You could also shave sections of your hair to get a dreadhawk or a dreadlet.

, DIY tattoos and piercings are a good idea. But remember to take care of them and avoid infection.

Imagine a character you want to be.The first step in planning out a successful steampunk character is thinking up a vibrant, interesting character you want to dress as.,
Begin with a Victorian outfit and add from there.Steampunk fashion is essentially a science fiction take on old Victorian elegance.,
Include some punk aesthetic in your costume.,
Mix steampunk with ideas from other fandoms.If you're keen on cosplaying in general, chances are you have items from previous costumes laying around.,
Be yourself.Above all, the point of steampunk is ultimately to have fun.,
Look up costume ideas for inspiration.,
Raid a thrift store for your costume.,
Augment your costume with colourful fabrics.,
Incorporate a vest or a corset into your outfit.For men, a vest under an old-fashioned overcoat is a great place to start for a costume.,
Sew gadgets onto your costume.,
Style your hair accordingly.Hair is an important part of any costume, especially if your character is supposedly of upper stock and class.,
Make your own steampack.,
Make a steampunk-themed gun.,
Create steampunk goggles.Goggles are arguably the most recognizable trope in steampunk fashion.,
Walk with a cane or parasol.When you're walking around in dress, you can be made to appear more interesting if you have something to hold and carry around.",How to Dress Steampunk," Because steampunk can be so broad, you can choose to settle for an archetype. Do you want to be a gentleman steampunk? What about a mad inventor, or an aviator? Thinking up an interesting role for your character to play in this imagined world will make it easier to come up with interesting costume ideas.


Learn about the origins of Steampunk.Steampunk is seen to have originated from writers Jules Verne and other writers who made their then-contemporary Victorian aesthetic futuristic. Steampunk is influenced in equal parts by history and fantasy.
There should be a real-life counterpart to most of these possible archetypes. Look up photos from the Victorian era or early 20th century and look at the things they used to wear. You can use those examples to inform your final costume.;
, If you're having trouble knowing where to start, it may help to start out with a purely Victorian theme, adding the extra doodads once a foundation is ready. Vests, overcoats and corset-aligned dresses make up the basis of Victoriana.Bowties, top hats and tweed vests are all part of male Victorian fashion.
Corsets and dresses are a staple of female Victorian fashion.
Anything that attracts attention while retaining elegance may be seen as falling in line with a Victorian fashionista's ideology.Vivid colours such as deep red, royal blue and sea green were commonly used.These colours may be used in contrast with the ""industrial"" colours of steampunk.

, It's important not to forget the ""punk"" aspect of steampunk. Although some in the subculture choose to ignore the punk rock aesthetic, some people have had great success with sprucing up their costumes thanks to punk styles, including dyed hair, piercings, ripped clothing and tattoos.

, It's not uncommon for individuals to combine steampunk's distinctive look with that of other cultures or fandoms. Star Wars is a common thing to combine with the steampunk aesthetic.

, Even if you're preparing for a big convention, remember to relax! Creating a costume should be an enjoyable experience. Even if your first attempt doesn't work out the way you may have wanted, you're still gaining valuable knowledge that you can put towards your next project.

, Thanks to the internet, it's never been easier for subcultures to thrive. While you're in the beginning stages of your outfit design, it's always a good idea to check out the costumes of other successful steampunks. Many steampunks will include a quick rundown of the supplies they used to realize their costume. Sites like Etsy are well-known for their Steampunk communities.


If you're stuck with your costume and particularly admire the work of one cosplayer, you may stand to gain from getting in touch with the person. Ask for tips on the specific type of costume you're going for. Most steampunks are very friendly towards others in the fandom.

, Thrift stores are perfect when you're trying to put together a costume. If you have a strong idea of the character or items you need, it's a simple matter of diving into one or more thrift stores and finding items that at least approximate what you are looking for.


Costume stores acknowledge the popularity of steampunk. If you're willing to spend a bit more money, you can find steampunk-specific articles as well.
Consignment stores are another budget-savvy way of building up a costume quickly.
Check your own closet, too. If someone in your family owns an old coat, you can use that as the basis for your costume. Old, well-worn clothing is great, because it adds to the rustic quality that steampunk aims for.

, While you can find the majority of your costume at thrift stores, DIY steampunkers may choose to go the extra mile and add onto their costumes. Common steampunk fabrics include leather, brocade, wool, cotton. All of these may be found at fabric outlets. Fabrics should be sewn or taped to embellish your basic costume with a steampunk look.


Common steampunk colours include browns, bronzes, dark golds, burnt ambers, dark purples, dark forest greens, and deep burgundies. Also, dark teals, creams and just colors that appear to be greyed, worn, or ""rusted"" in any way.

, For women, corsets are notably common. Although a corset was traditionally seen as an elegant item for social occasions, you can reconfigure the corset to match a variety of character roles and situations.


Vests and corsets aren't as commonly used in today's fashion. With that said, their archaic appeal ca be combined with a ton of other fashion styles.
Sewing on a utility belt to a corset is a good idea if your character assumes a mechanical role.

, Effective use of fabrics in modifying parts of a costume depends on having a strong idea of what you want to do. Use your character's role as an inspiration. For instance, if your character is an aviator or soldier, you can sew leather strips to the outside of the coat to give the outfit a more protective look. Begin with a regular piece of clothing, and spruce it up in a steampunk style.


Reinvent your costume as you go along. Most DIY costumes end up at least a bit differently than the way they were first imagined. As you go on, don't be afraid to switch it up as you see fit. If you are new to the process of costume making, you'll be able to put new skills to better use. Tweak your plan to suit your improved costume-making skills.

Dye your fabrics for a more authentic look. Fabric dyes are available at any well-stocked arts store. If you want to go with a fully DIY approach, you can dye things at home using a mordant commonplace kitchen supplies like tea bags and onion skins., For women, doing your hair up can give your character an added elegance, even if the costume itself is intentionally ratty. Punk-oriented hairstyles also work great in steampunk costumes for the purpose of contrast.


Pinning your hair up will give your hair an elegance loo if you're playing a woman character. In true steampunk fashion, you can let strands of hair hang loose to add to the costume's industrial feel.
If you're playing a male character, combing your hair over to the side and gelling it in place will evoke a high class elegance.
Don't underestimate the importance of makeup in a good costume.

, If it suits your character, a steam-powered jetpack can be fashioned by gluing old coffee cans together and painting them over. A compass or broken wristwatch can be reworked to approximate a steam gauge. Affix leather shoulder straps to the coffee cans so that you can wear the pack on your back. Brown or black nylon straps will also do the trick.

, A steampunk gun can be made by using the basic form of a nerf gun. Get a nerf gun or plastic water gun. In order to make it steampunkish, you'll need to simplify its appearance. To do this, sand down the original model's details as much as you can. From there, paint it in a golden brown or one of the other typical steampunk colours. When that is done, you can paint gauges, industrial imperfections (like metal scratching) and other details using different shades of the colour your originally used.A coat of primer paint may be needed before using your colour paint.Plastic guns can be bought cheaply from a dollar store.

, A pure Victorian costume can easily be ""steampunked"" by adding goggles. Your goggles should be large and cumbersome. If you prefer not to wear the goggles over your eyes, you can strap them around your forehead or wear them over a top hat.


To make a set of your own, take a strip of leather that can cover both eyes comfortably. Secure the back either using a shortened belt (with two buckles attached to either side of the goggles) or a knotted string, tied through two holes on either end around the end when worn. Cut out two eye holes and glue on metal eyelets or rings as accents. Paint your goggles when done for a more steampunkish look.
You can make glass eyelets by taking mason jar lids and cutting out the centre.Most glass cutters can offer grey-smoked plexiglass for your goggles at a cost.
Due to the increasing popularity of steampunk culture, costume stores should have some pre-fabricated steampunk gadgets at hand for sale. Goggles are very popular and can be found from a professional outlet.

, A walking cane is a great choice for men, and for ladies, a parasol or quaint umbrella is a good fit for most costume ideas. *The cane or umbrella may be reconfigured to look like it has a more important, steampunk-oriented function by adding a compass or other hardware to look like a gauge.


Add-ons to your props can be done with soldering, taping or gluing, depending on the materials in use.

A collection of band tees from pop punk bands, new and old, can serve as key elements in your pop punk wardrobe.For a throwback pop punk look, you may opt for band t-shirts from 90s pop punk bands like Blink 182 or Sum 41. You can also harken back even further and get a Ramones t-shirt or an Undertones t-shirt, both big influences in the power punk scene in the 80s.;
, Plaid is a popular print in the pop punk world and you can wear this print on a button up shirt or a jacket. Look for red and black plaid or black and white plaid.You can also wear neutral colored button up shirts with a collar for a more put together day look, especially when paired with skinny jeans.
Camouflage print is also popular in the pop punk world. You can wear camo print in the form of a t-shirt or a button up shirt with a collar.

, Most pop punk enthusiasts wear skinny jeans in dark blue or black, or boyfriend fit jeans, which have a more relaxed fit around the thigh area.Jeans are great for everyday wear, as they look good with band t-shirts or a button up shirt with a collar. They are also comfortable and easy to take care of in terms of washing and cleaning.

Go for the low top look and pair your Converse sneakers with skinny jeans and a band t-shirt. Or wear high tops with a jean skirt or long shorts and a button up shirt.You can also wear combat boots in black or brown to vary up your footwear.

, Many pop punk dressers will opt for all black, such as a black shirt and pants or a black skirt and top. You can then add a pop of color, like a bright pink tie, colored wristbands, or brightly colored socks, to still have a pop punk look.

, Add to your pop punk look by wearing jewellery like a choker around your neck or stud earrings. You can also wear a trucker hat or a beanie to complete your casual day look.Many pop punk musicians also have piercings and tattoos, such as ear piercings or arm tattoos. These would be considered more permanent accessories and should only be done after some thought as they can be painful and difficult to remove once you get them.

You can then finish the outfit with black tights and combat boots or Converse shoes.This look would be ideal for attending a pop punk show or going out with friends for the night. You could also wear a band t-shirt under the plaid button up to show you are a fan of the band when going to the show.

Are you feeling extreme?,
If you are not making your own, you will have to acquire a dress or tuxedo, and you probably can't rent one either.,
Collect your materials.,
Go crazy.,
Finish off your look with a great hairstyle, some makeup, your favorite accessories, and your best shoes.,
Nothing you can do to your outfit is comparable to your attitude.",How to Dress Punk for Prom," Consider making your own dress or tuxedo. However, this will require sewing skills and a sewing machine, plus a pattern unless you can make one without it. While this is the hardest route to go, if you do it right, it will guarantee that you get what you want, it will fit perfectly, and you won't be lining the pockets of some morally questionable corporation.;
, Thrift stores and consignment shops can be used to find great deals so you won't feel guilty about modifying a couple hundred dollar piece. Colour and size aren't really important right now, but if you can't tailor it yourself, it will have to fit, and if it is made out a material that will be tricky to dye, it will have to be the right colour.

, You'll need your article of clothing, scissors, a seam ripper, a cheese grater, a razor blade, safety pins, paint, fabric, dye, buckles, studs, zippers, chains, mini stuffed animals, hair bows, and whatever other stuff you want to decorate it with or need to help you do so. A sewing machine/needle and thread can be helpful too as can a grommet puncher. Lay all of your supplies out on a large table covered with newspaper. Go to the bathroom, grab a snack, and get ready to begin.

, Take out the seams and reattach it with safety pins or lace it with ribbon, string, shoe laces, or caution tape. Cut off the hems, shred the fabric and rip holes in tulle. Punch a line of grommets along the bottom of a dress so it looks like a Converse shoe and lace it. Dye your fabric using the directions on the back of the dye container. Throw on some paint artistically or randomly. Cut of buttons and replace them with mismatching ones that show some off your style. Write on it with markers or fabric paint. Pull it apart, make a statement, and really show your personality. After all, that is what your life is about, isn't it? Leave the above suggestions behind and do whatever you want to do or think is right. Any mistakes can easily be fixed with safety pins and duct tape.

, When you like what you see and you feel great, you're all done. If you get to prom and they don't let you in, hit the nearest concert with your friends. If there isn't one immediately available, go hang out in one of your basements or try bowling. It's amusing to see how people look at you when you show up to bowl in your outfit.

, Keep your punk spirit about you and you'll have fun, no matter what you are wearing.

You don't have to change your entire personality, just make a few easy adjustments.,

Get involved in some sports and eat healthy.,
Be friendly towards everyone.",How to Go From Punk to Preppy," Be more outgoing, happy, and smart.;
, Some black is still nice, but as for all of the Clash t-shirts, put them in storage for now. Wear bright colors. Always wear cute jewelry and make sure it matches your outfit!

, For instance, O.A.R., acoustic pop, Vampire Weekend, British indies, and whatever may be playing on your favorite classic rock. Look for virtuosic guitar, especially in folk music, soft vocals, and somewhat less political themes, but not Britney Spears. All classic rock IS fair game. So are art rock bands like the Flaming Lips, and 90's alternative like the Strokes. Classic bands are also solo artists like Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Jakob Dylan, Bob Dylan's son.

, Don't make it look like you just stepped out of a beauty pageant, just a little lip gloss and blush is fine.

, No matter how much makeup you choose to wear, it's ALWAYS good to practice good habits, such as washing your face and brushing your teeth regularly.

, People (and teachers) will be suspicious if you go from wearing hoodies and ripped up jeans to ripped jeans and a neat shirt the next day. Messy preppy clothes will draw attention away from the shift, and doing it over a month or more can soften it too.

, Many preps have fit and healthy bodies. Try involvement in ""preppy sports"" like tennis, golf, crew, and soccer. Real preps are also into healthy eating, and organic and Fair Trade produce. Shop at Whole Foods for some organic macaroni, and look for soy alternatives to dairy products.

, Preps are known for kindness toward everyone, even if you know some who have been mean to you.

Enjoy your own company.If you want to be cool and a loner, you have to be OK with being alone.,
Smile.,
Ignore gossip.,
Find your internal sense of self-worth.Validation doesn’t have to come from external sources.",How to Be a Cool Loner1," It needs to be a choice that you make willingly, because you truly do like spending time by yourself. Perhaps you’re an avid reader, or a frequently inspired artist, or an athlete that enjoys solo cross-country sports. Maybe you just like the quietness of being alone sometimes.


Whatever your reasoning is for being a loner, it has to be a choice that you make freely.
If you're a loner but you don't want to be, that's a very different problem.;
, A genuine smile can communicate a lot to the world, but mainly, it shows other people that you’re happy, confident and comfortable.Even better, it’s been scientifically proven that smiles really are contagious.Your smile will set off a chain reaction of other smiles, and all of these people will associate positive feelings with you – without you ever having to say a word. No socializing required!


When you’re trying to be both a loner and cool, this is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get there.
Direct eye contact will make your smile even more impactful while also projecting confidence.

, Some people aren’t going to understand your loner side, and they may gossip about you. This isn't always going to be the case, but if it happens, don’t let it affect you. A big part of being “cool” is not allowing other people’s thoughts and actions to affect your self-image negatively.


Nothing can hurt your feelings unless you allow it.
You don’t need anyone's acceptance or approval.

, Set goals for yourself and quietly start working toward them. Stay motivated. The sense of accomplishment you’ll feel when you achieve a personal goal will be more meaningful to you than the admiration of others.


You don’t need to set tons of lofty goals for yourself. Small, every day goals are just as important as large ones.
You don’t need to be accepted by everyone in the world, but it is imperative that you accept yourself.

Be Respectful to your Parents.,
Touch, and be Touched.,
Have Fun while Being Responsible.,
Make Something Your Signature Thing!,
Dabble, and be Unpredictable!,
Be Charming!,
Be Beautiful.,
Be Healthy.,
Get a Job!",How to Be a Classy Teenager," You can show some skin, such as a cute cutout dress in the back. Never, under any circumstances wear anything that causes you to question whether or not this could be too form fitting and ladies you know what I mean. When you leave one of them out, cover the other! If you are going to school that day and you have the dreaded gym, lean more toward the easily worn clothing (skirt, tee-shirt). cute flats with some pastel colored jeans looks so much cuter and less trashy than wearing the mini-skirt with heels.;
, That doesn't mean you have to hang around with them every waking moment, but you should do your best to be civil and nice. Even to people that are rejected by others. And take it from me (yes I'm a teenager as well)! People will admire the more you include others if that ""other"" happens to be the ""loner"" of the grade. I have done this before and after the first few times it becomes easy. For example: compliment a bagging lady at your grocery store, a girl with a cute bag at school, or (if you happen to be a boy) you noticed a kid has some new shoes that you like.

, Always know what sort of events are going on during the day, and dress correctly. It's better to be prepared for possible issues that might pop up.

, You can act classy by being polite to everyone. You should never ever be rude, this includes people you don't even know (sales clerk, cashier) You can, of course playfully tease your close friends, but only in a joking way, and make sure they know that you are just kidding. For example, my best friend gives ""the finger"" to my guy friends, but promptly blows a kiss to them afterwards. Speaking of blowing kisses... cute and sexy! Also, kisses on the cheek are always sweet.

, I know, this sounds like a lecture, but you can honestly get away with so much more if you just help out when you can and talk respectfully to them! Get on their A list, and they will be way more willing to help you out when you need it too! If you can't stand your parents, just consider it practice for your acting career!

, With your close friends, you can get touchy! Link arms with your best friend, Everyone likes to be touched! However, there is a limit to being ""too touchy"". Don't be all over anyone, it gives people the wrong idea, and makes you look like trash. Also, try to keep personal displays of affection to a minimum (holding hands is the farthest you should go in public).

, Yeah, in Gossip Girl it sounds all fun to do whatever you want and not give a care. This can lead to major problems though! Have your fun, be impulsive and spontaneous, but remember that the things you do now might affect other things in your future!

, Make a signature for yourself, or make multiple things become a signature of you! Have a scent that you always wear, a style of earrings that you are never seen without, or a playful wink whenever you are teasing someone! Anything you love can become your signature!

, Try EVERYTHING! Dabble into acting, modeling, sports, whatever! Every time you try something, you are forming a well-roundness that will make you seem really worldly and smart. And speaking of smart, really work on school. It makes you ever so much more intelligent, and everyone loves smart people. Read a lot, learn a new language, watch the news. Then you will have something to talk about with EVERYONE, I promise! And develop your skills! If you are good at something, pursue the heck out of it! Becoming amazing at lots of things is very classy.

, This one is easy, I promise! Just make people laugh, make eye contact with everyone you meet, be engaged by others and be engaging: talk a lot, laugh a lot, smile a lot! Everyone will just be d-r-a-w-n to you!

, This one is easy too. Remember that you are a beautiful person no matter what you look like! First of all, make sure your skin is healthy and clean. If you have acne, try to clear it up with creams or other products. Use make up to enhance your natural beauty and show your creativity. Eat one serving of nuts or seeds everyday. These foods really give skin a glow. After just a couple weeks, skin will be smoother and softer, and glow like you have a personal light shining on you at all times! For makeup, keep it minimal. Pale eyeshadow in natural colors (cream, vanilla, coffee, gold) is all you need for eyeshadow, while you can either leave lashes thick with mascara or plain. All lips need is a little chap stick or lip gloss. Make sure when you wear lip gloss that its not too thick, all you need is a SMALL dot spread all over lips, so they look moist and dewy, not drenched.

, Eat veggies, lots of fruits, and a balance of other foods. Exercise by doing what you love to do, be it running, yoga, or playing sports! Find something you love and do it!

, Earning your own money is classy and sophisticated, but as my best friend said, ""My only job is to be witty, charming, talented, classy and beautiful."" If that's the only job you want, that's FINE - you have plenty of time to get one later!

Make interaction somewhat challenging.,
Respond with cryptic answers.,
Avoid letting anyone get to know you too well.",How to Be a Cool Loner2," You don’t want to be outright rude to people, but being social shouldn’t seem like it comes naturally to you, either. Avoid approaching others for conversation – let them come to you. It’s okay to seem a little standoffish and maybe even brood a bit.


When you are approached, avoid looking eager to socialize.
Appear distracted when others approach you to chat, and you can even try acting slightly annoyed about being interrupted.

, When people ask you questions, be brief with your answers. Don’t offer up a lot of personal information. You don’t want to be completely off-putting, but cool loners aren’t talkative or social people. After you have a conversation with someone, you want them to feel intrigued. They should want to know more about you.


It can be a little tricky walking the line between being cryptic and being rude.
The easiest way to go about it is to be vague with your answers.

, If you want to give off a mysterious air, you can’t be too easy to get to know. Interact with others, but keep these interactions relatively brief and leave them wanting a little more. Everyone should have a couple of close friends, but you should also make it a point to avoid spending a lot of time with too many people.


Don’t offer up very much personal information.
When you do, make sure that the information is interesting.

Be likable but reserved.,
Find your own niche.When it comes to close friends, quality is far more important than quantity.,
Avoid total isolation.",How to Be a Cool Loner3," The key is to be friendly, but not overtly so. When everyone is your friend, you're “cool.” When no one is your friend, you're a “loner.” Therefore it makes sense to have only a handful of close friendships, while also being well-liked by your peers in a general sense.


If you’re unfriendly and turn most people off, the “loner” reputation is going to stick, but definitely not the “cool” one.
Being a disliked loner is an unpleasant position to put yourself in, so try to avoid it.

, Find a small group of people who you identify well with, and who make you feel good about yourself. Even having just one or two people in your inner circle is perfectly fine.Make these special people your closest friends and confidants.
Everyone needs a close friend or two, even loners.

, There is nothing cool about completely isolating yourself, and the person it will most harm is you. It’s not good for your mental health and will most likely destroy any confident or happy vibe you were trying to put out into the world.Don’t miss out on the social experience of life completely.Find a balance that works for you.

Entertain yourself.,
Learn new things.,
Keep a journal.,
Get a pet.",How to Be a Cool Loner4," You don’t need a group of friends to go to the movies, visit a museum or have brunch at a new restaurant. All of those things can be just as great when you’re by yourself. Contrary to popular belief, having fun does not depend on the presence of other people.Treat yourself just like you would a friend – do nice things for yourself. Go out and have fun!


This doesn’t mean you should do everything alone, of course.
That can actually zap most of the fun out of hanging out solo. Try to find a balance.

, Spending time by yourself might get a little boring if you don’t seek out new knowledge and activities. Consider your interests and then look into ways you can learn more about them. Get a book, surf the internet, attend a class – whatever it is that gets your brain fired up, that’s what you should aim for.


Immersing yourself in a new hobby has a way of getting you interested in learning even more new things, since the experience is so gratifying.
Dive in and see where your interests take you!

, When you spend a lot of time alone, it can limit your emotional expression. However, it’s extremely important for your health and well-being to find ways to express your emotions. Keeping a journal is one very effective method.Try to set aside at least 10 minutes each day to write in your journal.
Write down your experiences, organize your thoughts, and sometimes, just vent.

, Companionship is good, and it’s not always necessary to find it in other human beings. With a pet that you love at your side, it’s hard to feel truly lonely. Furthermore, pets have real and measurable effects on your well-being and health in general.Any pet you're drawn to will work, although some are more interactive and emotionally gratifying than others.
Dogs and cats are common choices for pets, but don't feel limited!

Give her space and make sure she gives you space.",How to Be a Bad Boy," You have your own time, your own dreams, and your own plans, and you should almost never compromise them to make someone else happy (romantic interest or not). For instance, if you don't like something, don't pretend to like it. Be confident about your likes and dislikes - this will naturally attract like-minded people.


Discover your values. What do you like? What do you hate? What is unique about you? What makes you happy? Know your self, or you'll find yourself faking values in order to ""fit in."" Can you really be happy if you're pretending to be someone you're not?;
, You exist primarily to make yourself happy - others are secondary. Make yourself and your life a priority. If you treat yourself like you're important, other people, including women, will see you as important too. Most people are naturally attracted to important people - being important is cool!


With very rare exceptions, never sacrifice your self-image when pursuing a romantic interest. Do you like a girl who doesn't seem interested? Forget about her - you're too valuable to waste time trying to appease her.
Women will appreciate your self-interest. It shows that you know what you want and you're not afraid to go for it.

, Nothing's less sexy than someone who's constantly stressed out about every minor aspect of his life. Bad boys don't sweat the small stuff because they're sure that they have it all under control. For instance, in a situation where you're around women that you find attractive, while you won't necessarily want to act like a complete slob, you'll want to try to remain as relaxed as if you were at home watching TV. Doing this gives the signal to the people around you that you're cool, confident, and in-control of your situation, which, for bad boys, can be downright sexy.


It's pretty tough to go from being a nervous, worried person to a smooth, confident player overnight. If you're still working at being relaxed, try slowing down your movements and actions — this is a great first step that will make you look (and feel) much calmer. Walk with slow, sure strides. Speak slowly but confidently. Avoid flinching whenever you can.
Even for bad boys, things don't always go as planned. In the event that something does go wrong, try not to stress. Instead, play it off with a low-key joke. For instance, if you spill a drink all over yourself, don't spend time worrying about how you'll need to bleach it when you get home. Instead, just say something like, ""Whoa! Looks like I have a new tie-dye to add to my collection."" It's a little cheesy, but it shows that minor problems don't phase you.

, So-called ""nice guys"" are always waiting for a sign that it's safe to proceed before taking action. That sign, however, often doesn't come, so they appear indecisive. Be decisive (especially with women) and handle objections as they come. Don't look to others to determine if you're acting ""right"". Do what feels right for you. You might be surprised by what you've always had permission to do!


With women: instead of asking ""Can I kiss you,"" just go for the kiss. The same goes for ""Will you go on a date with me?"" Start talking to her, and say ""We need to hang out. What's good for you, Friday or Saturday?"" Even if you're shot down, your decisiveness is much more attractive than if you simply asked for her attention.
Have an opinion on everything, from the restaurants you eat at to how you spend your free time. Know what you want, and take action to achieve it - not only will you be more attractive, but you'll be happier.Disclaimer: Real men aren't creeps or pervs. Be confident, but also be very aware of your partner's needs. Never, ever force a kiss (or worse) on someone who doesn't want it. Just as you are keenly aware of your own desires, so are they. Respect their decisions.

, As a man, always lead. Don't wait for someone to tell you where to go or what to do. If your group can't make a decision, make it yourself. Being a leader becomes natural once you stop worrying about other people and go and do what you know you need to do. You're not being selfish. Rather, you're taking care of your own life because you don't expect anyone to do it for you.


Be the leader of your life in every situation - If you want to talk to that girl, or want to get that job, go do it.
Also be a leader to your peers - If a friend is too chicken to talk to a girl, you can tease him a little as long as you're not cruel and your goal is to help motivate him to gain confidence. Your friends will appreciate your help and women will go crazy for you.

, One reason girls love bad boys is because they're honest. ""Nice guys"" often aren't. If a bad boy likes a girl, he will show her. A nice guy tends to hide his interest or beat around the bush. A nice guy tries to be a girl's friend as a stepping stone to becoming her boyfriend, but winds up just being her friend. Most girls know when guys like them. A bad boy knows this and has no problem showing this to a girl. In order to be a bad boy, be honest about your intentions. Most girls will appreciate the honesty - no one likes wading through friendly BS to find a potential partner.


Girls can even appreciate relatively crude signs of interest. For instance, both bad boys and nice guys will look at a girl's chest. However, a bad boy won't care about being caught. This is much more attractive than trying to sneak a peek but being caught. The bad boy is honest about what he wants and he knows he has no reason to be ashamed.

, Never ""need"" anyone else - other people are nice to have around, but not necessary for your happiness. Learn to enjoy yourself and your own company. You will realize that the less you need other people, the more other people will need you. Always create your own fun and entertainment. Have a strong passion, and find hobbies and other interests that you would like to spend your time.


Never make a relationship your first priority or your only source of happiness. Stop looking for others, especially women, to make you happy - you don't need them. Men all over the world waste time trying to find happiness in everything except themselves. When you're happy on your own, others will naturally want to be around you.
Have a hobby - anything that uses your time and makes you happy. If it's something that lets you come in contact with new, young, sexy people, all the better. It should be something that you're passionate about, something you like, and something that you can build on! If you don't have or want a hobby, at least volunteer. Use your time to better the world - you're a bad boy, but you're not evil.


, A ""bad boy"" is bad because he knows that he is more valuable to himself than others are. He cares about himself. A bad boy realizes that he knows himself better than anyone else, thus, his opinion about himself is above the opinion of others. It comes down to having self respect, and you must earn your own self respect before you can expect others, especially girls, to respect you.


How do you earn self-respect? Create a standard for what you will accept or won't accept from people, and follow it to a T. The most important part of having self respect is to not put up with people (both men and women) who are disrespectful toward you or people who are important to you.
One problem with nice guys is that they are nice to everyone - even people who aren't nice back. We are all taught to turn the other cheek. In some cases, unfortunately, this only encourages jerks. Don't reward bad behavior. Be nice to people who deserve it. Remember, being nice to someone mean won't make them like you. Surround yourself with good people who have earned your trust and respect.

, As a man, you should be a pillar of strength that your family, friends, and especially women can rely on. Let go of the need to whine. Realize that no matter how much you complain or vent, your circumstances won't change. Instead, suck it up and handle it. Perpetual victims are unattractive and, more importantly, unable to better themselves.


When things go wrong, just do your best to make it through the day. It is easy to get caught in the moment when something bad happens, but just remember that you're a man who solves his own problems and you will be able to handle it.
Make sure the people in your life are taken care of. You shouldn't be anyone's sugar daddy - you are the most important person in your life - but you'll be appreciated and sought-after if you're helpful, strong and reliable.
Work out or participate in some form of exercise every day. Regular exercise helps improve your mood, energy, and overall health! This is a critical part of helping you improve your emotional control, as it helps maintain the daily stress level. Working out also improves your confidence and your physical attractiveness - there's no reason not to!

, Much of the advice above requires you to have high confidence and a good self-image. If you don't have these fundamentals, it's difficult if not impossible to be a true bad boy. Ask yourself questions like, ""are there situations that make me nervous?"" and ""am I being the best that I can be?"" If you don't like your answers, use the following steps to build healthy confidence. You'll be on your way to badness in no time.

, You don't need to be a body builder to be a bad boy, but you do need to be healthy. Scientific evidence has shown that physical exercise has a positive effect on self-esteem and can help thwart depression. The effects are both immediate (through the release of stress-reducing endorphins) and long-term (through the improvement of self-image and overall fitness). Don't put it off - go to the gym today, not tomorrow.


One study found that moderately intense aerobic exercise produces the greatest immediate psychological boost.Any exercise routine that improves your physical fitness, however, will make you more attractive to yourself and others.
For tips on starting an exercise routine, consult one of our many how-to guides on exercising, such as How to Exercise.

, Constantly work towards your career and personal goals. You don't need to be rich to have high confidence, but you do need to be proud of yourself. Working hard and succeeding will make you feel valuable and important - the cornerstones of a confident personality.


Everyone (including bad boys) suffers personal setbacks. If you're experiencing difficulty in your career or personal life, keep it in perspective - by persevering through your difficulties, you're building a stronger personality. Never give up!

, Allow yourself to enjoy the things you like. You don't have to spend lots of money to feel valuable - simply cook the foods you like, enjoy your favorite drink in moderation, and reserve time to practice your hobbies. If you're doing the things you like, you'll naturally be happier, and if you're happier, you'll be more confident.

, Sometimes, low confidence can be-deeply rooted. Childhood abuse and traumatic experiences can cause psychological difficulties throughout your life that can negatively affect your self esteem.Try to seek treatment for any issues that are affecting you mentally or emotionally. A variety of treatments, including counseling, biofeedback techniques, and the prescription of medicines, are available.


Remember that seeking help for psychological issues is a sign of strength, not of weakness. Real men don't ignore their personal problems, they fix them. Sometimes, this requires the help of someone else. Never feel embarrassed to see a counselor or a therapist - over a quarter of US adults received some kind of mental health treatment within two years of a 2004 poll., A bad boy knows what he wants from a partner and is honest about it (see step six under Part One.) There's no shame in pursuing purely sexual relationships as long as you're honest about it. Similarly, having a long-term girlfriend doesn't mean you have to be less of a bad boy. Below are some tips for handling the fairer sex like a true bad boy.

, The goal of a relationship shouldn't be to dedicate your life to your partner. Even if you're married, make your own plans. Reserve time for yourself. Spend time with your friends. If you treat yourself like a valuable commodity, your time will be highly sought-after by your partner. Conversely, if you're constantly making yourself available to your partner's whims, your time will become less valuable. Keep your backbone in any relationship - make sure you're not so dedicated to your partner that you forget about yourself.

, Being in a relationship with someone doesn't mean you need to worship them. Tease them! A lighthearted back-and-forth keeps a relationship passionate and fiery. It's also a good sign of a confident ""alpha"" personality - you're showing you're not afraid to engage in a little verbal swordplay.Think about it - would you really want to be in a relationship with someone you always have to be nice to?


Don't be too cruel with your teasing. Avoid subjects that your partner is sensitive about - for instance, her looks or her career. Keep it light.
Be prepared to receive some teasing yourself - don't dish it out if you can't take it!
If you accidentally hurt your partner's feelings, make a genuine apology. Remember, bad boys are honest - if you're truly sorry, say so. Don't feel like you need to withhold a well-deserved apology to be a bad boy. That's not ""bad"" - it's just jerkish.


, This doesn't mean to boss your partner around or prevent her from making decisions. Rather, it means you should aim to be decisive in situations where it's appropriate and to have a plan at all times. For instance, if you're going out, pick a place and make reservations ahead of time. Take her hand to lead her through crowds without being asked. Kiss her when the mood suits you. Show her that you're confident about what you want for yourself and her. Choose a topic of conversation that you're passionate about. Talk your family, or an event that strikes home for you. Don't gossip; speak from the heart, and let your darling know that you have a sensitive side and show her your true family man side. 

, In a long-term relationship, it can be difficult not to fall into certain habits and routines. Still, make an effort to be spontaneous sometimes. Plan weekend getaways when you both have the time. Surprise her with tickets to an evening concert when she wakes up in the morning. Breaking the routine of a relationship keeps it fresh and exciting.


It might seem paradoxical to plan seemingly ""spontaneous"" activities ahead of time. However, it's necessary - nothing's worse than making an impromptu trip to an ice-skating rink only to discover that it's closed. Skating rinks aren't very bad boy anyway.
Remember that the goal of being spontaneous is not to shower her with gifts. Maintain your personal value - if you're unsure of what to do, try to plan activities that you like. You'll be happy to go, and your happiness will reflect in your partner.

, Bad boys and their partners aren't dependent on each other. They maintain their own lives, friendships, and hobbies. This makes the time that they do spend together more valuable.


Balancing time between your friends and your partner can be difficult. Luckily, since this is a common problem, it's been the source of much thoughtful (and some thoughtless) online writing. Consider consulting a sensibly-written article for advice.

Don’t brag about your possessions or achievements.,
Avoid making backhanded comments.,
Don’t judge people by the way they look and act.,
Refrain from acting superior.",How to Avoid Becoming a Snob1," Make comments and start conversations around topics and ideas that interest you, rather than objects and possessions. It’s not a bad thing to share your excitement for things, but be mindful about spending too much of your time talking about material items.Set goals for yourself that are meaningful rather than goals that you hope will help get you more attention.
Start conversations that others can join in and share their input instead of stating facts and opinions. A good way to encourage a two-way conversation is to ask open-ended questions and bring up broad topics.;
, The old saying goes, “If you don’t have something nice to say, then don’t say anything at all.” Put yourself in the shoes of the person you’re speaking with and think about how a backhanded comment makes you feel.


Notice the good features of others and make comments about those positive things. Switch out statements like “That sweater looks expensive for your taste” with “That sweater makes you look like a million bucks!”
If you feel yourself about to blurt out a backhanded comment, take two to three deep breaths first. It calms your fight or flight reaction and can help to clear the mind. Thinking clearly is key to speaking with clarity and kindness.

, If you frequently judge other people, then it is likely that you are also judging yourself. It is important to become mindful of this because self-judgment may manifest as low-self-confidence and judgment of other people. Understand that everyone walks around with different kinds of baggage, different experiences and a different upbringing. Look past the exterior to try to get to know someone’s personality and learn from them.


Get out of your comfort zone and talk with someone outside of your normal circle. Attend a networking event or go to a cafe that interests you, but isn’t something you would normally attend. Sign up for a knitting class or learn to code if it’s something you’ve always wanted to try.
Find common traits among yourself and people who look, dress or act differently.
Start up a conversation with a simple statement or question. Comments like “Doesn’t the city look beautiful from this side of the park?” or “I love exploring new places to get coffee, what’s your favorite?”

, Feeling jealous or comparing yourself to other people frequently may indicate a sense of personal lack, which you might try to compensate for by acting superior. Purchase items and gain knowledge of topics only if you truly enjoy them. Understand that not everyone has the same interests, wants and needs in life. Share knowledge and information with others only if you know they have a genuine interest as well.
Avoid the urge to one-up someone else in a conversation.
Don’t devalue the way others live or the way they feel.
Enjoy the differences between yourself and those around you, instead of comparing interests, material possessions and money.

Choose a plaid shirt.,
Wear a band t-shirt.,
Try a crop top.,
Pick a tank top.,
Pick a baby doll dress.",How to Be a 90's Grunge Girl1," The most important element in a grunge girl's outfit is her plaid shirt. Token grunge girls were all over 90s TV shows. For example, Angela Chase and Rayanne Graff from My So-Called Life were always covered in plaid. Try to stay away from bright colors, focusing more on earth tones and darker colors, such as brown, red, burgundy, black, gray, mustard yellow, and dark green. The plaid shirt should always be oversized and even have holes in it.


Try looking at thrift stores or second hand stores for flannel shirts. These shirts will often have a worn, faded look, which is exactly the kind of plaid you want as a grunge girl.
If you buy your plaid new, avoid tight fitting or girly fit shirts. The grunge look is unstructured and loose. Try looking in the men's section or go a size or two larger than you normally buy.
You can wear the shirt either as an over shirt with another shirt underneath or tied around your waist. Avoid wearing it buttoned up. This is more grunge boy than grunge girl.
If you want something plaid that is slightly more girly, look for a checkerboard plaid dress that you can wear over ripped jeans.;
, The grunge persona came from a musical genre, so band t-shirts are a must. 90s grunge style icon Winona Ryder rocked band t-shirts as a main part of her repertoire. Try finding shirts from 90s bands that are popular in the genre, such as Nirvana, Silverchair, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Stone Temple Pilots.


You can go oversized or fitted, depending on the rest of your outfit. If you go fitted, balance it out with a baggy plaid shirt or oversized overalls.
Vintage t-shirts are really the way to go. Try to find some original tour or album shirts at thrift stores or second hand shops. They are more authentic and have the added bonus of looking worn and grungy because of their age.
Some major retailers and department stores sell reprints of band tees. If you go this route, do something to make it look aged. Try washing it a few times to loosen the fabric. Cut off the armholes and make it into a tank top. You can also cut off the collar and wear it off the shoulder. , Despite the typically masculine attire related to the style, you can still show a little skin in the midsection. This style was popularized by 90s style icons such as Gwen Stefani, lead singer of the band No Doubt. Find a crop top, which can be a t-shirt or sweater, in a plain color such as black, grey, white, or maroon. You can also go for a subtle design. Just make sure it is short enough to show off your stomach.If you can't find an oversized top that is short enough, cut off the lower portion of any shirt. You can cut it slightly jagged to make it look more grunge.
They make some crop tops with asymmetrical hem lines. These look great with flannels tied around your waist.

, Being grunge isn't just about oversized clothes. Try a tight wife beater tank in white, black, grey, or brown. They look great under flannel shirts.


You might also be able to find a band tank. These can be fitted or oversized, depending on what you can find. If they are oversized, pair them with a black bra and let the straps hang off your shoulders.

, You can also add a little less masculine flare sometimes by wearing a baby doll dress, typically in floral patterns. Stay within the neutral and earth tones color palette. 90s grungers were all about mixing styles and adding a layer of irony to their outfits. The key is to add a flannel shirt over it or around your waist to make it go from preppy to grunge. One of the most influential style icons of 90s grunge was Courtney Love from the band Hole. She was also the wife of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The grunge goddess rocked baby doll dresses all the time, mixing them with other grunge elements to create a messy, chic look.It doesn't matter if the patterns don't match. Matching isn't important when you're grunge.

Work on the best parts of your personality.,
Be happy.,
Imagine you look like your favorite celebrity and watch things with them a lot.,
Flirt.,
Enjoy life.","How to Be ""That Girl"""," Choose a haircut you know will flatter you. There are good choices to select from a favored celebrity or even people around you. Ask a few friends if you think the haircut would look good on you, and get advice from the hair stylist as well. Bring a picture of that celeb or photos of your friend's hair-do next time you get your hair cut. Ask to get a similar cut while also seeking the stylist's input. Consider the effectiveness of having subtle highlights rather than bold streaks which look dated. Most hair colors could use a little warmth, so ask for a richer, subtle tone.;
, It is essential to create a near-flawless canvas – bad skin is every girl's worst nightmare. Ask your dermatologist for advice on products to try. Never abide dirty skin, always cleanse and moisturize your face at morning and night especially, because in the morning your skin will be that much softer and healthier. Ask your dermatologist what he/she thinks would be good for your skin if it's really bad.

, The best tip is to buy the Sephora Beauty Guide. But remember - less is more. A baby-rose blush is essential for glowy skin. Concealer for zits, dark circles and redness, but only dust your skin-toned foundation where it is needed. And if you're wearing a lot of make-up, don't wear lip gloss – it will just make the face make-up stand out too much. Wear a nude-pink lipstick to make your lips look fuller and natural. Blonds are better off not wearing black or colored mascara; opt instead for brown.

, Style is easy for some people, harder for others. Think of one rule - more than four colors is overkill, and at least one color in your outfit should match something else in the outfit. For example, say you're wearing a yellow floaty shirt, a pink tiered skirt over blue embroidered jeans, and gray sneakers; a yellow cardigan, pearl earrings and a necklace, and a white, yellow, blue, and pink patterned bag would look great and pull together the teen-casual bohemian-classy look. Remember, in the words of Coco Chanel, ""When accessorizing, always take off the last thing you put on.""

, This is key. Be confident, but not in a ""look-at-me"" way. Don't put yourself down a lot like some girls do. If anyone asks you if you think you're pretty, give a tiny shrug and say, ""I think I look fine."" Be nice to everybody, even people you don't much like, and practice effective, assertive comebacks, but never get into serious fights. Hang around with at least one respected and nice girl, and have a list of people you can call up to do something fun with. Popularity doesn't have to be an episode of Gossip Girl.

, Laugh a lot and smile too. When you're walking or sitting on a plane or something, have a dreamy little smile on your face. You'll look like a girl with a good secret, like someone has a crush on you or something. Fact - smiling people look more attractive than frowns. Practice your expressions in the mirror.

, You'll start to unconsciously imitate some of their gestures.

, When you flirt, do it in a genuine way and work at least one compliment into every long conversation, but not too many. Guys love being flattered, as do girls! If you ask a guy out and he turns you down, keep your poise.

, This is a cliché, but life is short. Live a little, carpe diem. Someone asks you to do something fun but you're sulking, go do it. Otherwise you'll just sit feeling sorry for yourself. Always take that opportunity and do it.

Don’t be pushy about your opinions.,
Don’t monopolize a conversation.,
Talk with inclusive language.,
Educate yourself on diverse topics.,
Avoid giving unsolicited advice.",How to Avoid Becoming a Snob2," It is important to be a good listener and to show people that you genuinely care about what they have to say. Pay close attention when other people are talking and ask them leading questions to find out more about the things they say or to have them clarify. This will let them know that you are paying attention and are interested.

Try asking something like, “Your trip to Florida sounds really nice! What else did you do while you were there?”

, It’s not a bad thing to share the way you think or feel about a certain topic, but it isn’t good if you’re not open to others having a different opinion.If someone disagrees with a statement you’ve made, genuinely ask them to share why.
Show an interest in another point of view and open your mind to other perspectives.
Don’t view your opinions as facts.

, Notice if you’ve been chatting nonstop and provide an opening for someone else to voice their thoughts.


Don’t cut others off in the middle of a sentence to ensure you get your point across. If it’s important enough to the conversation, wait for a pause.
Ask other people questions about how they feel and view a situation.
Notice others’ body language and whether they seem engaged or disinterested.
Try not to talk just for the sake of talking. If you feel like you are, say something like “I feel like I’ve been talking so much, tell me about your life.”

, Avoid saying statements in absolutes, especially when meeting new people as they can make others feel inadequate if that’s not they way they think, feel or act.Notice if you say statements that start with something like ‘you should always’ and urge yourself to shift your language to something like ‘I believe’ or ‘in my experience.’
Tell yourself that everyone comes from a different background with different experiences and resources.
Keep an open mind during new experiences and inquire more information if someone shares a differing opinion.

, Reach outside of your comfort zone and learn about a new culture, sport or hobby. Being a beginner can keep you humble about your knowledge and experience.


Learn about something new regularly. Make a goal to read about a new topic or do something you’ve never done on a monthly, weekly or even daily basis.
Ask experts on the topic, whether you personally know them or can connect with them virtually.
Keep in mind that it is perfectly okay to say “I don’t know.” Avoid pretending that you know about a subject if you don’t. Just be honest about what you know and don’t know.

, Catch yourself if you start to offer your own opinion when it wasn’t requested. Follow the advice that you would theoretically give someone else.Instead of giving advice, simply explain that you are there to help if needed.
Let other people make decisions and mistakes and avoid pointing out mistakes of others if the outcome doesn’t come out well. No one wants to hear “I told you so” --even if you think it's warranted.

Buy baggy, ripped, or patched jeans.,
Try an A-line printed skirt.,
Wear overalls.,
Wear ripped tights or hose.",How to Be a 90's Grunge Girl2," One of the hallmarks of grunge is comfort, and there is nothing more comfortable than a pair of worn, baggy jeans. Buy a pair of jeans a size or two larger than you normally buy. Make sure you steer clear of the skinny jeans. They are made to fit more snugly than you want your pants. Try to find jeans with rips, holes, or patches made on them. They give them a worn, lived in look that goes great with the grunge look.You can save some money on jeans by buying a normal pair of jeans and ripping them up yourself. Non holey jeans are usually cheaper and you can add the holes wherever you want.
You can also try finding jeans at thrift or second hand stores. They will be more worn and comfortable than brand new jeans.
If it's warm weather, you can also go with a pair of cut off denim shorts. These look great with a crop top and a flannel shirt around your waist., If you don't want to go for the full dress, try an A-line printed skirt. Liv Tyler popularized this style both off screen and on, in music videos for Aerosmith and movies such as Empire Records. Try one in plaid or a floral design and earth tone color palette.


A-line skirts look great with an oversized band t-shirt and a flannel wrapped around your waist. Don't worry if your plaid shirt doesn't match the pattern on the skirt. It will make you seem even more grunge., Denim overalls were a huge trend in the 90s and the grunge scene worked them to their advantage. Buy a pair overalls and match them with a band tee or tank. You can wear the flannel as an over shirt or around your waist because both styles look great with the overalls.You can also try the one shoulder look as well. Instead of wearing both of the straps clasped, wear one unclasped, folding down the panels on both sides of the overalls. This variation looks great with the crop top and a flannel.

, If you aren't really in to wearing jeans all the time, try a pair of holey tights or hose to create the full grunge effect. Courtney Love would often pair her baby doll dresses with ripped tights. Buy a pair of neutral colored or printed tights. In the same fashion as the jeans, rip holes and runs in the fabric of the legs. Match these tights with the printed skirts or dresses. You can even wear them under your jeans.You can layer multiple layers of tights on top of one another, with holes at different places on each pair. This adds a little extra texture to your outfit, especially if the tights or hose are two different colors or patterns.

"
"
Wear minimal makeup.,
Dye your hair.,
Wear combat boots.,
Wear a beanie.,
Grab some accessories.",How to Be a 90's Grunge Girl3," The grunge style is made to look as low maintenance and comfortable as possible, and the same feel translates to the makeup. Pair a little bit of brown or dark eye shadow with thick eyeliner and mascara. You want it to look kind of like a messy smokey eye, but you don't want it to look bad. You can also not wear makeup all together.


You can top this off with a dark color lipstick if you want to add another layer to your makeup. Liv Tyler often topped off her cropped top, floral skirt, and ripped tights combination with a deep red lip., Grungers know how to rock dyed locks. You can either dye all of your hair or just some towards the bottom. Try dark red, maroon, ash blonde, brown, or caramel. You can even go pastel pink, purple, or blue. Just make sure the colors aren't too vibrant.


Gwen Stefani dyed her hair blue, pink, and orange. Angela from My So-Called Life dyed her hair maroon as a first act of grunge rebellion.Make sure it looks messy and natural. Don't straighten your hair. You don't want it to look like you tried to fix your hair too much. The messier it is, the grungier you will be., No grunge outfit is complete without a great pair of combat boots. Buy them in black, maroon, grey, or brown.You can even buy a patterned pair. They make every grunge outfit look more comfortable and casual. Pair them with a band tee, a floral print skirt, a flannel around your waist, and a pair of holey tights to have the ultimate grunge outfit.


The most popular boot brand was Doc Martens. Girls were seen all over popular culture wearing these iconic footwear. Actresses like Liv Tyler and Winona Ryder wore them and Angela and Rayanne rocked them on My So-Called Life. Even 90s cartoons grunge style icon Jane Lane wore them on Daria. No grunge girl's wardrobe is complete without them.If you don't like the combat book style, you can also wear a pair of chunky shoes such as Mary Janes or a pair of canvas shoes such as Converse. Kurt Cobain was known for wearing Converse and Drew Barrymore often wore them with her baggy, ripped jeans., A great way to accessorize any grunge outfit is a beanie. Actresses such as Drew Barrymore popularized these accessories by topping off their plaid shirts and ripped jeans with a beanie. Pick out a black, grey, brown, or dark red beanie to wear. You can wear your hair up or down with the beanie. It looks great with most hairstyles.If you aren't into beanies, try a bandanna. They have a similar grungy feel but come in more colors and designs. They are also more comfortable to wear in warm weather.

, Accessories can add some interesting flare to any grunge outfit. Liv Tyler and Gwen Stefani could rock a well placed necklace or earrings. Try a black braided tattoo choker, a large simple cross necklace, or large chunky earrings. You can also pick up a few silver and colored band rings to wear, layering a few on each finger.

Stop caring.,
Have attitude.,
Know the music.",How to Be a 90's Grunge Girl4," The whole grunge persona is built on a sense of ambivalence towards society, consumerism, and conformity. The clothes are worn, large, and comfortable because you don't care about many things anymore. Don't rush around and stress about anything. A grunge girl is content to just sit around and listen to some good music. She is not typically high strung or obsessive. She lets things happen as they happen without much though or care., Now that you have the look, you need to adopt the attitude. Although grunge girls don't care, they get an attitude with people when they try to make them conform or join things. Don't listen when people tell you to do something. Just tell them you want to sit and listen to your music all day long. Do what you have to do in life, but get an attitude with others when they interact with you.


The way Courtney Love, Liv Tyler, and Drew Barrymore acted in the 90s provide perfect examples for the grunge attitude. Their lack of respect for authority and snarky attitude led them to constant trouble and even some arrests.
This doesn't apply to your grunge friends. They understand your carelessness and apathy for the world, which means you don't have to get an attitude with them to get your point across.

, Grunge would not be a way of life if it wasn't for grunge music. While Nirvana popularized grunge music, there are many other grunge bands that you should become familiar with. Research who were the seminal bands of the era and familiarize yourself with their music. Go to your local CD store and look through their rock collection.


While there were many grunge bands in the 90s, some of the most influential were bands such as Hole, Green Magnet School, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Garbage, Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, 7 Year Bitch, Fastbacks, Temple of the Dog, Mad Season, Cat Butt, Veruca Salt, Skin Yard, Mother Love Bone, Tad, The Gits, Bush, Seven Mary 3, L7, Screaming Trees, Green River, The Melvins, Mudhoney, and Stone Temple Pilots.
Newer bands are still in the style of grunge. Look into Modest Mouse, Afghan Whigs, and Dinosaur Jr."

Know what fine dining is.,
Frequent bookstores and cafes, being seen reading a book shows a sign of class.,

Walk like there is a tiara on your head.",How to Act Like a Spoiled Girl," Wear well made designer clothing, any clothing that you wear should be of good quality, well ironed, and clean. Prefer pink, tan, white or black colors.;
, Gold, apparently, has a wealthy aura. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look.

, Being fashionable is a must. Try to read more fashion magazines to learn what kinds of clothing go well together and how to put together a classy outfit. Be sure to create your own fashion and have your own style, because it's not right to wear something that just isn't you. It's often better to have a basic personal style than to always be chasing the latest ""fad"" look.

, Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing. Never have greasy hair. It is gross and very trashy.

, Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy/posh. T-shirts and sweatpants will not cut it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or something from an exclusive designer. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some ""minor designer"" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Mossimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work.

, Yes, wealthy girls can be their parents' ""little princesses"" but outside of one's own home, putting on a ""baby voice"", pouting and making puppy eyes, or downplaying your intelligence just makes you appear a little bit socially awkward and incapable of acting mature in social situations.

, Wear Lacoste polo shirts, Tommy Hilfiger sweaters, Calvin Klein jeans and Burberry scarves. Don't try to show to others that you wear expensive clothes. Rich people don't do that. Most of them buy designer clothes because they like them, not just for the label. Also, buy a Louis Vuitton purse. If you cannot afford it, buy a cheaper one. Avoid knock-offs.

, It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like ""aberrant,"" ""culpable,"" or ""capricious."" Having a vocabulary like this apparently increases charm and wit, which can be considered a must in higher circles.

, However, not much is needed. Look for ways to get money. Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow people's lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it.

, Go shopping. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actual store. Check tips for a minor addition to this section).

, Spend less on trendy pieces. Do not wear a lot of logos. Rich kids don't need to wear logos to prove that they can afford expensive pieces. This is why you often see them in ripped jeans.

,, Work really hard at your schoolwork and make sure you get grades no lower than 'B+'. If you do, pout and kick up a fuss (but not to the teacher!). A 'C' is unacceptable!

, Like cute little sandwiches, a little cupcake with white frosting, celery sticks with the tips curled, baby carrots, a little drink bottle with orange juice. On Valentine's Day, maybe have a little box of chocolate to share with your friends. If the box is ordinary, decorate it with a big bow or some lace.

, Convince your mum to dress elegantly. Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfiger/Nautica polo's and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant.

, When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pink or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should be tidy.

, As clichéd as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like Béchamel and Beaujolais. Learn good table manners. Otherwise you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read etiquette books (American Girl is good).

, Having a coffee or tea at hand also makes you look rich.

, Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Never tell people about ""bad things"" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, than don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life.

, If someone is bullying you in any matter, you do not put up with it. It is disgusting behavior, and you don't let anyone walk all over you. This is the time to unleash the nasty.

, People will respect you. Good posture is always a must.

Even if a skirt seems ok while you’re standing, try sitting down and seeing if the hemline rides too high up your thigh. To stay modest and stylish, try swapping the miniskirts out for maxi dresses., Don’t wear a “low-rise” style that may slide down when you’re seated and reveal skin on your back or midriff. Aim to have the waist of your pants sit at or just below your belly button.Wear a belt if you’re concerned about your pants sagging.

, Choose shirts that have a straight neckline cut across your collarbone. Avoid V-neck shirts or tops with deep scoop-necks since those can dip down when you lean forward. If you wear button-up shirts, fasten all buttons up to the first or second button from the top.


Girls could also pick something more fun like a Peter Pan collar, which can add a feminine, youthful flair to a modest shirt., Girls can wear colorful ballet flats instead of heels, which tend to make you look more mature. Boys can wear clean tennis shoes with tidy laces. You want to avoid looking like a slob, which can create a bad impression, so leave the beat-up sneakers behind., For girls, ditch the eyeliner, blush, and bright lipsticks. Harsh lines and colors on your face can make you look sexy and mature, so wear as little makeup as possible. If you want a little something on your face, add a light coat of mascara to your eyelashes and choose a nude lip gloss., Don’t put too much effort into your hairstyle. Your hair should look carefree, so if you have natural waves, let them flow with little or no product. If you want it off your face, try doing one braid down the back or around the side of your head, or opt for pigtail braids for a really youthful look.


Try adding fun hair accessories like bows, headbands, or colorful clips.

, Smiling is one of the top ways to look more approachable and innocent, but it’s important to make sure you’re smiling naturally. Try sitting in front of a mirror and practicing your smile. Watch your eyes – if the skin beside them crinkles as you smile then it will look more natural.


Don’t smile when it’s not appropriate, such as when someone else is frustrated or sad. When greeting others, listening to light-hearted or funny stories, or receiving or giving compliments are all appropriate times to smile.

, Talking too loudly makes you sound authoritative, while talking more quietly can make you seem shy or sweet.If you’re not used to keeping your voice down, practice with a friend in a public space, and try to speak so that only your friend can hear what you’re saying.

, Vulgar language automatically makes you seem older and less innocent. If you’re frustrated or angry, try saying “Dang it!” or “Shoot!” rather than any swear words you may know., Selfishness makes you look cynical, a quality which tends to come with age and loss of innocence. Try simple acts like holding doors for people, letting someone in front of you in line, or baking cookies for friends. Or go a step further and volunteer at a local soup kitchen or animal shelter.

, Be supportive and empathetic when a friend is sharing something difficult with you. Avoid talking about yourself since this can make you appear selfish, and ask a lot of questions instead. It doesn’t hurt to offer advice occasionally, but don’t pretend like you have all the answers., You won’t look very pure if you voice negative thoughts about everything. Try offering people compliments about their clothes or hair, or share a weekend plan you’re excited about. You could even talk about the weather; if it’s cold out, tell someone how much you love wearing comfy sweaters and drinking hot cocoa.


Avoid participating in gossip. Excuse yourself from conversations that seem like they’re mean or negative about someone.

, Offer friends and family the benefit of the doubt when they do something you don't like. Rather than holding a grudge or getting angry, try seeing the situation from their point of view and forgiving them. You'll feel lighter and appear more carefree and sweet to others.

, Have fun and try to remember what brought you joy when you were younger. If you’re walking down the sidewalk and see a sprinkler, run through it! When you hear music, start dancing in a silly (not sexy) way. Play board games, stick out your tongue, or do cartwheels. The options are endless!

Lessen your smiles and laughter.,
Have a serious, ""no funny stuff"" look on your face whenever you are moving through an area where others are present.

,
Speak formally.,
Be cautious of bullying girls.,
Work hard at the tasks you are given: assignments, etc.,
Retreat to a quiet place, such as the library or somewhere where you are alone, during lunch breaks, recess, etc.

,
Talk less: not just meaning listen more, but also, literally, speaking as little as possible during the day.,
Pay attention and work hard in class.,
Keep with the ""cold hard"" attitude if someone is giving indications that he/she likes you (romantically).","How to Act Serious, Emotionless, and Professional"," This is the single most important step; remember, you can laugh as much as you want over a joke by yourself in a quiet place, in your own mind, or at home, but when a person tells you a joke, or something funny or joyful, don't smile or laugh. Be nice, express your emotions by your words, and not by your facial expression.;
,, Make sure to speak clearly and to only use formal speech. Always address teachers, your peers, and others by their proper names, unless they specifically ask otherwise.

, Sometimes girls come up to you and act like they are overly friendly, (ex. ""Hi Fred! How was your day?""). Maybe they even giggle at you behind your back. They might act as if they think you're ""cool"" and want to hang out with you, but in reality they may just think of you as a ""dork"" and/or a ""loser."" If this ever happens to you, simply ignore it; don't smile, frown or show any facial expression, and respond as you would to a typical conversation; ""Things are going well. How are you today?"" or ""I have a lot of work. Have a good day"". A polite response that is neither rude nor submissive will win in the long game.

, Being a high achiever will give the impression of ""professionalism"", another box now ticked, it will also benefit you later in and all throughout your life.

,, During class, do not speak to anybody unless spoken to by a teacher, and only a teacher.

, Choose a desk at the far back of the class, a desk by itself away from your class group, but not so far to the point where you aren't able to pay attention or can't see what the teacher is teaching.

, Be cautious of the fact that you could be making these ""indications"" up in your own mind. However, if he/she really is interested in you, then continue with your technique, and perhaps be a little extra friendly to him/her.

Mind basic manners, such as not laughing or talking when eating, saying ""Please"" and ""Thank you"", and respecting elders.;
,


Sit straight up, put your legs and your hands down. Keep feet flat on the ground, or you may cross them at the ankles.
Stand with your head, shoulders, hips, and ankles in a straight line. Imagine a string pulling your body straight up. When walking, cross one leg slightly in front of the other as if walking on a line.

,


Do not speak loudly, it can be considered rude. Speak at an audibly, but not excessively loud. Enunciate and exude confidence with your words.
Improve your vocabulary. This shows you are educated. Learn new words every day and actively use them when you speak. Also be sure to practice proper grammar and spelling.

, Walk at a comfortable pace, taking small steps instead of wide ones and walking as if gliding through the air.

,


If you do not like someone, remain civil and courteous to them and treat them with respect, but do not act as if you are friends with them.
Remember that there is a reason behind the things people do. For example, if you do not like a girl because she is an ""attention seeker"", keep in mind that her attention seeking behavior may be due to the fact that she might have been bullied or ignored in the past.

, Dress modestly and femininely. Wear colors such as light pinks, creams, white, black, dark reds, mauve, navy, purples, and grays. Floral prints are also great options. Cotton, satin, velvety and sheer materials make you appear ladylike.

Wear skirts. The best lengths are from mini to knee length. Pleated, A-line, circle, and pencil skirts are recommended.
Wear sweaters. Cardigans and pullovers are classic, and look great with collared shirts underneath. Turtlenecks are a great choice for colder weather. You can also wear pea coats, blazers, fake leather jackets, or other chic outerwear to keep you warm.
Accessories can add a special touch to an outfit. A bag to carry your things is important. For school, choose a backpack with good support to keep from hurting your back. A simple cross-body bag can keep your important things near you at all times. A pearl necklace or a simple silver or gold chain looks elegant.







, It's recommended to have at least three basic pairs: one for sports or active wear, one for school or work, and one for special events.

Sports shoes should be a good quality. They should be breathable.
Black or white shoes match almost any outfit.
Try not to wear heels very often. They are bad for your health. If you do decide to wear them, keep them 4 inches or under.

, Always condition it, and try to avoid heat styling or using many alcohol filled or drying products, as these things can damage your hair. Keep it natural colors, and if you choose to dye it, dye it black, brown, blonde, or a natural shade of red. You can also highlight it. Comb with a wide toothed comb when it is wet, and if you have curly or wavy hair, do not brush it when it is dry or it will become frizzy. Avoid perms and relaxers.


If you want wavy hair without head, put it into to two side braids or two french braids before you sleep.
If you have frizzy hair, put a leave-in conditioner or serum into you hair and put it into a ponytail or bun before you sleep.
If you have afro-textured hair, wear protective hairstyles or let your hair be natural. Some examples of protective styles are cornrows, twists, and braids.

, Some concealer under the eyes and on blemishes should be enough skin coverage for most girls. If you do need more coverage, wear a BB cream. Blend it into the neck to avoid a visible difference where your face ends. If you'd like to keep skin matte, use translucent powder.

Eyeliner should be pencil and look as if it is barely there. If you decide to apply makeup to your eyebrows, use a pencil or powder and make it look natural by using little product. Lip balm or gloss keeps lips hydrated.







, Eat well and eat good portions. You can find out how many calories you need in a day online. Try to eat that many calories to maintain your weight. Do not go on starvation diets. Exercise 60 minutes a day with cardio and strength training. Don't smoke, drink, or do drugs.

Don't forget your mental health. If you are dealing with a difficult situation or are not feeling well, talk to a parent, counselor, or other trusted adult. Develop healthy coping methods, and do your best to refrain from engaging in harmful behavior such as cutting, isolating yourself, or self starvation.

, Keep facial hair away with plucking or waxing. Shave, use a hair removal cream, or wax body hair. Daily showers are a must.

Take care of your skin. Wash with a gentle cleanser made for your face. If you have acne, use one with salicylic acid. Use a toner after washing, the a moisturizer, serum, or ampule. You can also layer these products. Exfoliate two to three times a week. Use hydrating or detoxifying masks. Don't forget to exfoliate and moisturize the skin on your body as well.
Keep nails trimmed and clean. You can paint them simple colors or have cool designs. It's better to have short nails as they are less likely to break and stay cleaner.

, Use deodorant. Scented lotions and body wash can be used. For perfume, choose a scent that is floral, vanilla-scented, or sweet smelling. One or two sprays is enough., Clean after every mess, and volunteer to clean other things in your home as well. Keep your bag and other belongings organized and uncluttered.

, A lady is well educated. Try to learn new things in your free time, and develop an interest in things like coding, science, literature, music, and more., Play an instrument, draw, make websites, design fashion. Find an activity you like and aim to be one of the best at it."

Volunteer to help with chores.,
Listen to your parents.,
Speak quietly and clearly.,
Stay calm when something goes wrong.,
Be nice to younger siblings.,
Use mature table manners.,
Ask for more responsibilities.",How to Act More Grown Up1," Most kids want to avoid chores at all costs. Mature kids know that chores are things that have to be done, even if they're not fun. Help out your parents whenever you can by volunteering for chores, to make life a little easier for them. This will make you seem very grown up.


Help with yard work in the spring and summer time, or help rake leaves in the fall when they're on the ground. Shovel the driveway if there is snow during winter.
Keep your room as clean as possible. Tidy up after yourself when you make a mess. Keep your toys and school supplies clean, and in their proper place.
Extra bonus: Help clean up other people's messes as well. If you help pick up after your sibling instead of whining about it to your parents, that will seem very mature.;
, Mature kids respect their parents, which means they will be treated with respect. Immature kids whine and complain, making their parents' job much more difficult. If you want to act more mature, listen to what your parents say. Listen even when you don't like it, and then do what you're told.


Be honest with your parents as much as possible. If you don't think it's right that you should have to clean your room on a Saturday, tell them so. But don't whine and cry about it like a little kid. Write out your reasons. Tell them clearly.
Never make your parents ask you to do something more than once. If you're acting up and they tell you to be quiet, be quiet. Immature kids are unable to control themselves, but mature kids are.

, No whining, shouting, or baby-talking. If you're going to act like a grown up, speak like one. Use a clear, firm voice when you have something to say. If you don't have anything to say, just be quiet.


Slow down when you're speaking, and think about what you say. Kids tend to talk very quickly and stumble over their words. Make sure to pronounce the words correctly, and learn how to say words that you're not sure about.
If someone is in another room, stand up and walk into that room to speak to them. Don't shout between rooms.

, Some little kids will fall to pieces whenever they don't get their way. Maturity means being able to accept bad news and take it in stride.


If your parents tell you that you can't go somewhere, or can't do something specific, calm down. Don't yell, but speak honestly. Say, ""I'm disappointed, but that's ok. Thanks anyway."" Often, maturity like this can even get parents to change their minds.
If you get into a fight with a sibling, relax and take a few deep breaths. Don't overreact. Act like nothing bothers you and stay cool. This will take all the wind out of your sibling's sails.

, Just because you're older doesn't necessarily mean you're more mature. If you want to act your age, or act older than you are, then make a point of being nice and looking out for your younger brothers and sisters.


If your younger siblings don't know something, don't make fun of them for it. Show them how to play a game correctly, or how to do their chores the right way.
If you have older siblings, don't let them bait you into throwing fits. Sometimes, older kids like to pick on younger kids to try to get a rise out of them. When they provoke you, say something like, ""That's kind of immature."" Your older siblings will be shocked.

, Even if it's just a basic weeknight meal, it's important to sit still and be quiet during dinner time. Thank your parents, or whoever provided the meal, and eat it quietly. Wait until everyone is finished eating before you leave the table, or ask to be excused if you're finished.


Sit up straight at the table and put a napkin on your lap. Chew with your mouth closed, and put your utensils down between bites of food.
When dinner is over, offer to help clean the dishes. Before dinner, offer to help set the table, or do other simple tasks.

, There's a lot to do around a house. Garbage needs to be taken out, dinner needs to be prepared, the floors need swept and cleaned. If you want to be a more mature member of your family, ask for more responsibilities and take them really seriously. Do your best work and take pride when you finish.


If you have a pet, you should be in charge of the pet, not one of your parents. If you have a dog, you need to clean up after the dog, walk the dog, and feed the dog. Not just today, but every day.
Talk to your parents about an allowance if necessary, but focus on doing the jobs first, not getting the money. The more you make it about helping out, the more likely you are to get a good allowance.
Ask your parents if you'll be allowed to get a house key. This can be a big step for a lot of kids in becoming more grown up. As you get older, you may ask for more responsibilities, like getting a part-time job, a car, and doing more things by yourself."
"
Be friendly and outgoing.,
Dress as you please.,
Practice compassion.,
Let yourself be silly.,
When a song comes on that you know, dance and dance wildly.,
Express yourself as you speak.,
Find fellow weird people whose company you enjoy.,
Don't worry too much about others' opinions of you.",How to Act Lovably Weird," When in public, talk to every single person you see. Say hello in another language. Compliment them. Or if they look at you funny, ask them if they need something. Be tough to the rude people and polite to the nice ones. If you see a tough person, just smile sweetly. If you see a good-looking person, let them know that they're good-looking.;
, Don't feel the need to follow the rules of fashion—wear whatever you like! Cultivate your own personal style, no matter how unconventional or silly it is.

, Kindness is what separates the lovable weird people from the unsettling ones. Don't hesitate to help a person in need, whether a friend or a stranger.

, Make funny faces, kiss people's hands, and speak your mind (nicely, of course). Be as spontaneous and lighthearted as you wish.

, Let loose and have fun with it. Sing along (even if you don't know the words). Grab hands with a friend and start spinning in circles (but only if they're having fun).

, Use gestures and tone of voice to add to your meaning. When you're telling a story, use different voices and many interesting/goofy facial expressions. Make big motions with your hands, exaggerate a little (or a lot).

, It helps to have a group of likeminded friends who like you for who you are. Allow yourselves to be silly together and enjoy life.

, Not everyone will like you, and not everyone will want to hang out with you. This is okay. It's more important that you do what you love and be authentically kind. Focus on the bright side and be yourself.

Maintain a blank expression and blink as little as possible.,
Use monotone speech and short phrases.,
Avoid showing emotions and using first person speech.Robots have no emotions, so display no emotional reactions at all.,
React only to questions and commands.,
Decide what you're programmed to do and your triggers.,
Avoid being seen eating, drinking and going to the bathroom.",How to Act Like a Robot1," Most robots have no reason to blink or change their facial expressions, so work hard to keep your face frozen. No smiling, no frowning. Some robots are expressive, and acting like that type of robot might be a little easier. Simply slow your facial expressions way down, blink very slowly, and slightly delay all of your reactions.


Your eyes might get dry doing this, so stash some rewetting eye drops in your pocket and use them whenever you have a moment of privacy.
Since robots have no social skills, maintain eye contact with people for long, uncomfortable periods of time.Avoid any rapid eye movement. You will of course need to move your eyes sometimes, but do so mechanically.
Try to move your entire head robotically in whatever direction you need to, rather than having your eyes dart around.;
, Speak slowly, use no inflection, and enunciate every syllable. Use technical jargon in response to everything. If you need help with this, there are tech jargon generators on the internet that can give you plenty of material.Don’t worry too much about using the tech jargon incorrectly, since most people will have no idea what you’re talking about anyway.


Some key nouns to remember: firewall, operating system, interface, platform, processor, bandwidth, hard drive, microchip, network, mainframe, pixel, matrix, protocol, virus, fiber optics.
Some key verbs to remember: encode, override, quantify, generate, transmit, navigate, bypass, input, compute, calculate, hack, reboot, transcode, implement, transfer, defrag.
Download an app that generates beeps and other robot sounds. Keep your cell in your pocket and use the sounds whenever you have an opportunity (you’ll need to be sitting or standing behind something so that your arm movements aren’t obvious).

, Be stoic and passive. Robots also don’t refer to themselves as people or use first person speech, so avoid using the word “I” completely. Robots don’t have any personal opinions, so don’t give any.


Refer to yourself as an operating system.
You could also give yourself a name consisting of a short combination of random numbers and letters (for example, C3PO).

, Robots don’t think on their own, so if you aren’t being spoken to, be silent. When someone asks you a question, reply using as few words as possible. If you don’t know the answer, say, “File not found.” If you are asked to do something, either do it without questions or reply, “My operating system is not programmed for the requested task.”


You can also try something along the lines of, “Performance analysis required. Initiate defrag operation for drive C.”
If you are continually pressed or questioned after using that reply a few times, say something like, “System error. Performance design flaw. Initiating system shut down.”

, Keep these in mind so that you can react identically each time. For example, you could be programmed to robot dance. Maybe you're a motion-activated dancing robot, so your trigger would be the movement of other people around you. When anyone gets near you or walks by, start doing the robot dance.


If someone is standing near you, keep dancing until they move away.
If someone walks quickly by you, dance a few jerky movements and once the person has walked by and is ""out of range"" you'll stop suddenly.
You can also consider being a robot that doesn't respond to commands at all. Instead, you can be programmed to respond to people in certain ways or assist them in specific activities.

, Stash snack food and small bottles of water in a few different places that you frequent so that whenever you have a moment of privacy, you can grab some quick nourishment. Make sure absolutely no one is around if you have to go to the bathroom, then sneak in quickly.


If you're in public, sneak away to the least visible bathroom and pop in and out as fast as you can.
You may want to limit your fluid intake a bit to prevent needing constant bathroom breaks.

Do your school work on time.,
Listen to your teacher and follow instructions.,
Be kind to younger students.,
Use your ""indoor"" speaking voice.,
Don't show off.,
Wear clean clothes that fit you well.",How to Act More Grown Up2," Kids often struggle to finish their homework on time. When you get home, there are so many other things to do. Playing outside, playing inside, messing around. Instead, do your homework first and get it out of the way, to free up time later to do what you want. This is a sign of maturity.


If you're always doing your work and turning it in on time, both your parents and your teachers will look at you as a mature student.
If you forget to do an assignment, don't make up excuses. Tell your teacher honestly what happened. Making up elaborate lies is an immature thing to do.

, Just like at home, at school you need to listen to authority figures. Even when you don't like what they're saying, mature kids understand the need to follow directions and behave in school. Sit quietly and listen when your teacher is speaking.


When you're in class, and your teacher is speaking, you always need to be quiet. Don't talk to your neighbor unless you're told to. Wait until afters school or recess to talk with your friends.
Sometimes, kids who act out in class may seem more ""adult"" because they're more willing to get in trouble. This is usually a sign of immaturity, though. As you get older, it'll be much easier to tell the difference.

, When you're at school, treat everyone with respect. Don't pick on anyone, especially younger kids. If you see a younger student looking lost, or looking like they might need help, offer it. Be a kind classmate.


When you're at lunch, or at recess, don't ever pick on younger kids. If you don't want to hang out with them, that's fine. But don't make a big deal out of it.
Mature kids know and respect people older than them. When you're in the fifth grade, you'll feel like you're super mature, but as soon as you get to sixth grade, you'll be the little kid again. And to a high school senior? You're really young. try to remember how old you are and don't get too big for your britches.

, Immature kids will always be yelling in school, making the lunch room loud and the hallways loud and the classroom loud. Speak loud enough to be heard, but speak clearly and at a reasonable volume. Kids often have trouble controlling the volume of their voice.

, Immature kids will often do things just to get attention, showing off in gym class or at other times. More mature kids know that the way to stand out from the crowd isn't to brag to your friends and try to show off to others, but to put your head down and do your work the right way.


If you're skilled at something, it's not bad to show off every now and then, but never brag about it. If you're going to be good at something, let your actions show it.
Be a good winner and a good loser. If you lose a game, don't pout. Congratulate the winners. If you win a game, don't brag. Go over to the loser and say, ""Good game, let's do this again.""

, Looking mature will help you to feel mature. There's no one way to dress if you want to look mature, though, so it's mostly just important to wear clothes that make you feel good. What makes you feel confident? What makes you feel grown up and mature? Wear those clothes.


Clean clothes that are well-fit to your body are always the best choice. Maturity tip: Learn to do laundry yourself, so you can always be sure the clothes you want to wear are clean.
It's still ok to wear the clothes that fit your age. When you're a kid, it's not necessary to start dressing like an adult yet, unless you want to. It would look kind of strange for someone in grade school to rock a business suit.
If you want to wear make-up, make sure it's ok with your parents first.

"
"
Admit when you're wrong about something.,
Ask mature questions.,
Stop complaining.,
Control your laughter.,
Avoid crude language.,
Act your age.",How to Act More Grown Up3," Little kids hang onto excuses even when it's obvious they're wrong. If you made a mistake, own up to it. If you messed something up, come clean. Adults respect when kids tell the truth. It's a sign of maturity.


Don't lie under any circumstances. Adults are usually able to tell, and lying will only make things worse.Apologize and accept the consequence. If you're going to get in trouble for something, don't make it worse. Say, ""I'm sorry. I'll try not to let it happen again.""

, Kids often just talk at adults, instead of talking with them. Kids usually like to just talk about themselves, focusing on really small details from their day. If you want to seem more mature when you talk to adults, you should be the one who asks questions.


Be curious about what adults do. Curiosity is a sign of maturity. If your dad's friend comes over, ask, ""How do you know my dad?"" Ask questions about his kids, and what his family is like.
It's also good to know when to leave adults alone. Sometimes, adults don't like to be pestered, especially by lots of questions. If an adult is happy to talk with you, feel free to ask questions. If they become quiet, or seem annoyed, leave them alone.

, Kids and other immature people will often complain a lot. If you're bored, if you're tired, or if you're hungry, you only need to mention it once, and preferably less than that. If you don't have something positive or interesting to say, just be quiet.


If you don't like something that's going on, don't just say, ""I hate this."" Offer a suggestion for something else to do. If you're playing with your siblings, don't just complain about the game, say, ""This is ok, but what if we played tag instead?""
If you have to do something that's boring, try to be quiet and find something to do. If you have to go with your dad to the hardware store and it's boring, turn it into a game. try to come up with silly names for all the pipe pieces. Find the piece that looks most like a monster.

, Little kids often have giggling fits. It's nothing to be ashamed of, because being a kid can be a lot of fun. But, when you're around adults, it's good to be a little more serious and quiet. Even if you think something is funny, try to just smile about it, rather than bursting into hysterical laughter.

, When you're really young, the kids who curse may seem older and more mature. When you get a little older, though, you'll be able to see that as being a sign of immaturity. You don't need to use four-letter words to seem older that you are. It'll only last for a short time, and adults won't be impressed.


As you get older, try to scrub offensive phrases out of your vocabulary entirely. Some kids think it's funny or normal to call things ""gay,"" which is really immature and offensive. Even words like ""chick"" and ""dude"" can seem immature to some adults. Speak in a mature way.

, Little kids who try to act like 30 year olds aren't necessarily more mature than little kids who act their age. Maturity happens slowly. It's much better to be a 10 year old who acts like a 10 year old, than to be one who acts like some different age. Enjoy being the age that you are.


Adults don't expect that little kids will drink coffee and play tennis with them, so you don't have to pretend like you do things you don't. Just act calmly and be cool around adults, and you'll seem mature."

Hold positions for long periods of time.,
Walk slowly.,
Move body parts independently and maintain good posture.,
Repeat basic movements.Robots generally only have a handful of movements that they can make, unlike humans.,
Avoid most smooth movements and gestures.Keep most of your movements jerky and mechanical.,
Isolate body parts to dance like a robot.",How to Act Like a Robot2," Robots normally don’t move around a lot unless there is a reason for them to do so. If you aren’t actively doing something, try to stay very still in one position for long spans of time. When interacting with others, keep movements minimal.


Try to avoid making any instinctual movements. For instance, if you see a book falling off a desk, don’t try to prevent it or catch it. You also wouldn’t pick it up (unless someone asks you to).Whenever you get a moment to yourself, do some light stretching, since you may get muscle aches and cramps from not moving around as much as you normally would.

, Robots cannot move quickly or fluidly. When you’re moving around, walk slowly and mechanically, with jerky movements.Running or doing anything remotely athletic is completely out of the question if you want to truly act like a robot.


Keep your movements as consistent as possible.For example, keep your strides a uniform length while holding your arms stiffly at your sides.

, If you need to use your arm for something, just move your arm. Try to keep your other limbs still unless they are required.


Keep your body rigid and try not to curve anything.
For instance, a robot would not be able to slump into a chair, since robots only have one posture – upright.

, They are created to make these movements the same way, over and over again.


Robots have no problem with repetitive motion since they never get bored or tired.
Unlike with walking, which should be slow, robots can generally make their repetitive movements quite quickly (but still rigidly)., Smooth movements and graceful gestures generally aren't very robot-like. Incorporate a few smooth movements, such as swiveling, since that is a common robot movement.


Decide on which movements you'll make smoothly and make sure to be consistent with it.
Practice mechanical movements in front of a mirror so you can mimic it effectively in front of others – it may take a little practice to get it right.

, Robot dancing involves isolating body parts so that they can move independently in a robotic, mechanical way. To start, stand in place and move your hands almost like a mime would a few times, and then stop with them in mid-air, as if you've been frozen in place. Then bend at the torso to lean forward stiffly, then back, forward, then back again (keeping your hands in the frozen position), so that the effect is very mechanical-looking.This is the basic concept behind robot dancing. Experiment by isolating other body parts and making stiff, mechanical movements, adding different elements one after the other.
Wrist rolls are a big part of robot dancing. Incorporate those in between your hard isolation movements.
Add a robotic open-and-close element to your isolations and rolls by opening and closing your palms.

Choose neutral colored clothing.,
Wear the same thing every day.,
Apply metallic makeup and stiffen your hair.,
Avoid accessories and other human behaviors.",How to Act Like a Robot3," Wear blacks, whites, grays and, if you can, silver. You don’t want to draw any attention to your clothes at all. Most robots are made of metal, so silver would be the best choice.Gold metals are pretty unusual, with the exception of C3PO. Choose clothing that draws attention to your angles rather than your curves.


Humanoid robots (robots that look like humans) do wear clothes, but there is no emphasis on their clothing at all. It’s usually a very basic outfit.
Don’t wear patterns, like plaids or polka dots, or graphic t-shirts with designs emblazoned on the front. Wear plain clothing with no embellishments at all.
If you have any utilitarian styles in your closet, or anything with shoulder pads, give those a try. They will give you a more box-like shape.

, Whatever you end up wearing, you’ll need to keep it consistent, since robots don’t change clothes (if they even wear clothes). It will essentially be your “uniform” while you’re acting like a robot.


Make sure that whatever you choose, the clothing doesn’t hinder your ability to make jerky movements and keep yourself rigid.

, You don’t have to go all out with the makeup, but a light application of some shimmery silver eye makeup would be very suggestive without being completely obvious. Very light blue makeup has a similar, although less metallic, effect.


Shape your hair into a very basic style, as well. Stiffen it with hairspray to keep it from moving and blowing around, which isn’t very robot-like.
Brush a little metallic silver make up on the bridge of your nose, your brows, and your cheekbones. Or apply a little bit of petroleum jelly to those areas, to give yourself a subtle, plastic-like sheen.Paint your nails a metallic silver, too. It’s another small touch that give you a robot vibe without doing anything too obvious.

, Robots have no need for jewelry, watches, sunglasses or even regular eye glasses. If you do wear eye glasses but you also own contact lenses, wear those instead.


Also avoid doing other seemingly insignificant things, such as chewing gum, shifting your weight, tapping your toe impatiently, coughing, clearing your throat, giggling and so on.

Gather your materials.,
Cut fabric for your full-length or loincloth costume.,
Sew your full-length costume together.,
Tie your full-length costume together.,
Wrap your loincloth around your waist and legs.,
Make a simple top if you're a cavewoman.",How to Act Like a Caveman1," You’ll need a soft tape measure and enough faux-fur fabric for whatever size you’d like your costume to be. For a full-length costume, measure the length from your shoulder to your knee and your body’s circumference, or the measurement around your chest under your arms. You’ll also need fabric shears or scissors and, if you’ve got a knack for sewing, a sewing kit or machine.
Fortunately, making a primitive caveman costume doesn’t require any sewing! It is, however, one option if you like to sew.
Be careful handling shears, scissors, and other sharp objects and, if you need to, get a parent to help or supervise.
If you just want to go for a loincloth look, get enough fabric to wrap around your waistline (and bustline if you're a cavewoman) a several times, with the amount of coverage you’re comfortable with.;
, Once you’ve decided on the size of your costume, cut and tear the fabric. Since you’re going for a prehistoric look, you can just make a first cut with the shears, then tear the rest of the way following as straight a line as you can – no need to be too neat!A loincloth is easy: just cut a length of fabric three or four times the size of your waist (and, if necessary, bustline).
For a full length costume, cut two rectangles. They should be as long as your shoulder-to-knee measurement and as wide as half your circumference measurement. Cut a triangle shape off of the top of each rectangle for the arm hole.If you don’t know how to sew, you’ll need to make your rectangles about 3 or 4 inches longer and wider, so you’ll have more room to attach them by tying them together
Make sure the triangles line up so when you attach them they’re both on the same side and the outside fabric of both rectangles faces out.

, If you’re sewing, first stitch the seam that starts where the bottoms of the triangle arm hole line up. Stitch the opposite length next, and leave enough room from the top for your arm to fit through plus two or three inches. Finally, stitch the shoulder seam, or the top side from the triangle hole to the edge., Instead of sewing, you can cut strips a couple inches long and about an inch wide all the way down the sides and top of your rectangles. Imperfections are okay, so don’t worry about making all the strips uniform.


Make sure you don’t cut the bottom edge, the triangle arm hole, or the shoulder hole on the opposite side of the triangle into strips, these will of course be the holes for your arms and legs.
Tie your strips together on each side with simple, tight knots.

, If you don’t have time to make a full-size costume, the loincloth can be a quick fix. Hold the fabric with one hand against a hip, weave it between it your legs in one direction, bring it around your backside and through your legs again in the opposite direction. Pull it so it’s tight but still comfortable, and then wrap it around your waist once.


Hold it in place with fabric pins, safety pins, bobby pins, a secure clip, or give yourself enough slack with your fabric to tie it very tight.Remember, prehistoric people didn't have any footwear and mostly went barefoot everywhere, so don't bring any shoes or socks with your costume.

, You can use a similar technique to make the top for a more feminine costume. Take measurements of your chest and cut enough fabric to give you the coverage you'd like. Wrap the fabric around your torso and securely fasten it with pins, a clip, or leave yourself enough material to tie it.

Decide what type of guardian you are.,
Decide if you want to become a guardian.",How to Act Like a Guardian1," There are the types below. This article also describes how to act like all of these guardians. But, just act like one of them. There are:


Magic Guardians, who guard all the magic in the world. They have the power to use all magic.
Rebel Guardians, who guard someone in need. They have a lot of powers.

Accessorize your costume.,
Make a papier mâché club.,
Use leftover fabric to make head, ankle, and wrist bands.,
Give yourself a primitive makeover.",How to Act Like a Caveman2," Now that you’ve made the basic costume, you can embellish it with accessories and props to complete your look. Try using a glue- or staple-gun to attach fur along sleeves or edges (make sure you’re not wearing the costume while you do so). Distress the costume by adding cuts and fringe along edges.

, You can easily make a prop to complete your prehistoric look. Mix 2 parts white glue and 1 part water, and cut or tear newspaper into strips. Dip the newspaper strips into the glue mixture and wrap them around an empty paper towel or wrapping paper roll. Let it dry for a day or so when you're done, then find some brown paint and give it a couple coats when it's finished drying.


Try to make one end thicker than the other to form a club shape.
You can also use a mix of 1 part flour and 1 part water instead of the glue mixture.

, Don't put any of your fabric to waste! If you made a full-length costume, cut the triangles from the shoulder hole into strips. Tie them around your forehead, wrists, arms, or ankles to accessorize your costume.

, Finish your look off with makeup: make your face look dirty, like you just came back from a mammoth hunt. Use non-toxic coloring to black out a few teeth. Get a hair product with good, matte or non-shiny hold and give yourself a really messy caveman mane.

Find a good caveman name.,
Talk like a caveman.,
Don't use electronics.",How to Act Like a Caveman3," Whether you’ve made your own costume or bought one from the store, you need a new name to get into the prehistoric spirit! Go with something short, preferably one syllable, and that sounds kind of like a grunt.

, You’ve got the look down, but you’ve got to talk the talk. Stay in character: don't use words like I, you, or us, and try to avoid proper grammar. Talk in grunts and hand motions rather than complete sentences.

, Put your phone out of sight for this costume party. One moment you’re looking at your phone, and before you know it you’ll be flying planes and inventing the internet. Leave the picture taking and tagging for the more evolved party-goers: remember, you’re still making cave drawings and selfies won’t be around for ten thousand years!

Go Paleo.,
Move and travel like a caveman.,
Put down the electronics and other modern conveniences.",How to Act Like a Caveman4," Dressing up and acting like a caveman can be fun for cosplay or Halloween, but there can be perks in your daily life and wellness, too. Going on a high-protein, high-fiber Paleo diet can help you lose weight and might make you less likely to develop diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart issues.Eat lots of fresh lean meat and fish, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and raw foods
Avoid processed foods (so no packaged or canned food), wheat and other grains, legumes (like peanuts and beans), dairy, refined sugar, and refined vegetable oils (like canola oil).

, In addition to sending your diet back to the Stone Age, make an effort to walk and run more instead of traveling by car. Spend several hours each day outside. Just make sure you’re protected from the elements and not risking your health and safety., Getting away from modern technology and conveniences can help you improve your focus and become more present, even if just for a day or two per week. Putting down the electronics, paying more attention to what you’re eating, and getting more exercise, your brain and body can become more balanced and energized.Set certain days or times aside to live ""off the grid"" that you won't have to constantly check your smartphone or computer.
Do away with fast food and take time to cook your own meals.

Go back to crying.,
Babble constantly.,
Sing.,
Watch baby shows on TV.,
Play.,
Be amazed and confused by everything you find.,
Take longer naps more often during the day.,
Use a pacifier.,
Start crawling.,
Eat baby food.,
Drink like a baby too.,
Wear baby clothes.,
Accessorize with baby gear.,
Carry around a blanket or soft-toy.,
Wear a diaper.",How to Act Like a Baby Again," Cry when you're feeling hungry, thirsty, or tired. If there's one thing all babies do, it's cry loudly and often. Cry when you feel dirty, cry whenever your pacifier falls out, cry when you don't even know why you're crying.


Try to vary your repertoire of cries. Whine and wail at the top of your lungs for a little while to release your emotions, then let the super-crying subside into more of a softer sob. If you get attention, you can stop for a while, then launch back into your wailing cry.
If you can actually make yourself cry, it can be an excellent way to relieve stress. According to research, stress hormones are released through the tear ducts and endorphin production is triggered, resulting in feelings of relaxation and euphoria following a good cry.;
, When you're acting like a baby, you shouldn't use words as much as you should make word-like noises as if you were trying to figure out how to use your voice. Goo-goo-ga-ga. Now you're getting it.


Try to imitate the things that other people say as if you were trying to figure out how to speak. Don't get it quite right. This can also be a way to launch into another crying fit when you're get frustrated by not being able to speak.
Keep making sounds. Babies between 3 and 6 months old will start making their first word-like sounds, mostly ""baba"" and ""dada"" ""yaya."" By the age of 2, most babies have developed a vocabulary of up to 50 words, and can make small sentences and understand lots of other words., One good way to make lots of sounds is to start singing simple melodies and baby songs. Get to know the tunes to lullabies, little folk songs, and nursery rhymes. You might not be able to actually sing the words because you're a baby, but you can still hum along to the music and try to make some version of the words.


""Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star"" and ""Old MacDonald"" are classic standbys for sure, but for extra hilarious baby-cache, try singing to a song like ""Poker Face"" or ""Single Ladies."" Singing babies are super-popular YouTube videos and Vines. If you need inspiration, all you've got to do is watch a couple of dancing babies and learn from the source.

, A great way to talk like a baby is to watch interactive baby TV programs and try to participate. Things like Baby Einstein and other programming on early-morning channels will often cater to a pre-verbal audience, making it an excellent way to get back into baby mode and kid around.

, When you're acting like a baby, lots of your time should be spent engaged in play, which makes up the primarily learning method in the baby's world. Babies tend to favor smooth, rounded objects like plastic rings and other simple-to-hold toys, as well as things that make noise, like rattles, drums, and bells. Simple pictures are also captivating to babies, and babies spend a lot time staring at faces.Before language, babies try to figure out as much of the world as they can through touch and through sight, literally feeling their way around. When babies play, a lot of the time they'll be not playing like you might have played with toys when older, making up stories and scenes with action figures, or building things with blocks, but just figuring out how things feel, instead.
When you're playing as a baby, don't worry about actually playing, just worry about feeling objects and imagine that you're seeing things for the first time. Find your ""baby mind.""

, When you're pretending to be a baby, it's important to really put yourself into a childlike frame of mind. Imagine that everything you're seeing is being seen for the first time. Stare for a long time at the couch and at the family pet. Try to really figure out what's going on with your pacifier. Your fingers should be amazing and bizarre. Wiggle your toes, kick, roll around. If you can trick yourself into being amazed, you'll be closer to that ""baby mind"" that before, and will be acting like a baby.

, Babies sleep a lot, so acting like a baby is a perfect excuse to get in some daytime rest. Nap time is a great way to start acting like a baby. Try taking an hour-long nap in the late morning or in the early afternoon. Newborn babies will tend to sleep sometime between 10.5 and 18 hours during the day, with a normal sleep pattern(of a few hours less) beginning at about 6 months of age.

, To calm babies, plastic pacifiers are often used to provide the baby something to mouth, as when feeding. Getting a pacifier to use during naps and nighttime rest can be comforting and get you into baby-mind.


Most of the time, babies will find that their fingers can replace the need for the pacifier, which is one of the big discoveries and independent moments in the baby's development, when they don't need to rely on the parent for the pacifier.
You can suck your thumb if you like as it can be very soothing.

, Crawl around, or take hesitant steps. Babies don't run or walk around at full stride, they crawl and take very hesitant steps, usually balanced against something. Instead, get on your hands and knees and scoot around as if you hadn't yet learned to walk.


Sometimes babies will also scoot, by sitting up and sticking the legs out straight in front, then bringing them back in to move forward slightly. It's funny to watch and can be a good way to look like a baby.

, Want to go all the way into baby land, you've got to eat from a spoon. Baby food is usually blended vegetable and meat mixtures fortified with vitamins necessary for early childhood development. Essentially, though, it's what you eat already, just in mushy blended form. Eat foods like applesauce, yogurt, banana slices, cheerios, and other bite-sized finger foods.Baby food tends to be high calorie and kind of tasteless. For an adult alternative that will get you the same texture and experience, try blending root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and turnips in the blender and having a cold blended soup, served with a spoon like a baby might eat. You can season it like you like and eat in as if you were in a high chair. If none of those dishes appeal to you, don't worry or force yourself to eat something unpleasant. Try some yummy pudding instead. Remember, this is about feeling good and having fun.
Put your food on trays with separate compartments and eat with your hands. Don't be afraid to make a mess. It's expected. No utensils.

, Pour juice, milk, and other drinks into sippy cups with a lid on them to keep spills from happening and to keep you from gulping them too quickly, or put your drink into baby bottles to get a real baby impression going.


Use regular cows milk instead of formula, since formula might be difficult for you to digest at this stage in your development.

, Most baby clothes are singlets, or one-piece items, the sort of which babies wear. These kinds of items are also made in adult sizes, though, making it easy to wear baby clothes at any size.


Babies love to look for things that are ""brightly colored"". Bright-colored pinks, yellows and baby-blues/aqua are much more appealing than white, gray and black. Include soft fabrics and pastel colors in your ensemble of clothes for a few days. Wear a pastel-pink item if you are a girl, and a blue if you are a boy (sometimes the colors may be referred to them as ""baby pink"" and ""baby blue"").
Footy pajamas might be hard to find in bigger sizes, but union suits are widely available, especially at feed stores and rural outfitters. They're warm and comfortable one-piece long-johns. Rompers or onesies are usually easy to find in adult sizes, and are actually considered stylish.
Novelty t-shirts are also common on babies, so you could approximate some baby gear with a goofy tee with some words on it. You could make bigger baby bibs for yourself to wear, as well.

, To complete the ensemble, you've got to have the right baby gear. No cell phones, belts, or watches. Trade them in for sippy cups, baby bottles, and pacifiers.


Make sure to have several bottles of baby-scented lotions and powders and diaper creams on hand once you begin acting like a baby. The smells are instantly recognizable as baby or nursery smells.
Buy baby wipes to use when you need to take makeup off, or when you just need to freshen up your hands and face. The scent will even leave you with a baby fresh scent.

, Comforting crib toys often become a big party of a baby's developing identity, and lots of babies will become upset and cry if their comfort object is taken away or lost. Carrying a blanket or a stuffed animal can help you be comforted and instantly become more childlike.


Most babies don't carry around any old stuffed animal and any old blanket, it's got to be a specific one that they carry around at all times. Find your special object and make it yours.

, Get pull up or disposable diapers, if you are unable to wear those tab-styled baby diapers at your age. Although best with the cute characters on them, pull-ups can be sold in the health and hygiene departments of most superstores. If you recognize that you can still fit into the pull-up styled diapers that toddlers wear, buy those. Besides the money and weight issue, toddler-like pull-up diapers are the only pull-up diapers with the cute characters on them that can be purchased at most supermarkets offline. Alternatively, several brands of adult diapers with baby-like prints can be purchased online.



Cloth diapers are reusable and most cost-effective, making them a much better option, especially if you don't actually need to use them.

, Goth isn't about finding and buying the most expensive clothes. Look in charity/thrift shops, there's loads of things you could buy. Remember to never look too hard, you could find a great jacket by simply looking in a charity shop

, Considering you're all warped up in getting your music taste, research and fashion sorted, you still need to study and do the required work to get a good grade. Many people believe stereotypes like goths are high school drop-outs, druggies, alcoholics or smokers etc. Prove them wrong.

, There's a lot of different genres, like gothic rock, death rock, EBM, Darkwave, new wave, and remember listen to what you like. Don't stop listening to a band just because it's not goth and don't listen to a band just because it's goth. If you don't like something, you don't, and you can't force yourself to like it.

This typically only works if you already are a real goth, or at least know the ins and outs of gothic culture... so if you don't know much about the gothic subculture, music, fashion, etc.,
Become her friend.,
Say you heard an awesome band called Sisters of Mercy, and that Andrew Eldritch's voice reminds you of the lead singer from HIM.,
If she does show interest, continue to have her listen to other goth bands through burning her a CD, having her listen on your MP3 player or just putting on one of their albums while you two are hanging out.,
Now that she has the basics of Goth music, you may want to work on her clothes.,
We've have music and clothes... what about literature?,
Finally, film.,
Throughout this process, the most important aspect is not necessarily the entertainment and certainly not the fashion.,
If you are so inclined, you may follow up with some new décor for her room, interesting hobbies or a trip to a gothic club.,
And now, the final step: change more poseurs!",How to Convert Poseurs to Real Goths," you should either work on that or give up now.;
, Even if she seems kind of dorky to you, act like she is fairly cool. She happens to be ignorant of the culture, not necessarily a stupid person in general and certainly not inferior.

, If she likes HIM, of course. When she gets excited, offer to burn her a CD. See if she shows interest.

, Take her out and buy some goth music together. You might even want to buy an album or two as a gift, if you're willing to spend money.

, See which type of goth she likes best, then take her out and find some clothes which fit the category (or categories) of goth she fits into the most. Obviously, this may be done with a male poseur as well. Perhaps you should just start out by finding her a nice Alien Sex Fiend T-shirt, and keep going from there. Don't dictate her entire wardrobe, just send her in the right direction so she'll be able to choose better for herself. Considering the clothes don't make the person, they are not incredibly important in whether or not someone happens to be goth, but simply something to think about if you wish.

, She may like Vampire Kisses and Twilight, seeing them as goth, but has never heard of this Lord Byron fellow. The books you suggest she reads should be based on what she already likes. If she enjoys Stephen King's horror, she should try H.P Lovecraft. If she prefers the Vampire Kisses books or other vampire novels, perhaps Anne Rice and Bram Stoker would be good starting points. For the poseur who doesn't read because she thinks it isn't cool (or simply hates it) buy a comic, like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, graduate to Sandman, then graduate to Poppy Z. Brite, then graduate to the more mind-opening gothic reading material.

, In many cases, poseurs tend to watch slasher flicks, anything by Tim Burton... and not much else. Consider The Hunger, Queen of the Damned, Nosferatu, The Craft, and of course, Rocky Horror Picture Show... if you're already into gothic culture, you probably already know.

, The most important step is to ensure she is educated on Goth's philosophical view. The Black Aesthetic, the separation from the mainstream, embracing things which most people simply ignore... the philosophical side of Goth is far better than the side which is all black candles and cool music with an excellent bassline. It is a beautiful thing, and she needs to realize this above all else.

, This is up to you, however; this article covers the necessities of educating her a bit on the culture of Goth, and getting rid of her poseur tendencies.

, The pretenders amongst the Goth subculture are precisely what is ruining it, and need to be either educated or removed from this scene. Considering that educating them is an easier option, it's probably the best way. With every poseur you convert, you're helping the subculture. Change as many as you possibly can.

, Find out more about the subculture. Once you are thoroughly educated on the Gothic subculture then you should continue to the next step.

, Take a few days to learn what you like and if you see that you have nothing to do with the Gothic subculture, you might as well give up because the first role in everything is stay loyal to yourself.

, The main and traditional Gothic rock and deathrock style is distinctive to the trained ear. Some classics are Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sisters of Mercy, The Cure, The Damned, Christian Death and some consider Alien Sex Friend to be another. Then after you hear some of those artists then branch off. If you like more dark electro or industrial then maybe you should listen to some VNV Nation. If you are looking for a lighter music then maybe some Strawberry Switchblade. The point is to find you music type. Find it and love it. Remember not to limit yourself to a few genres. It's great if you're listening to Gothic rock then rap the next.

, Some people feel there is a certain type for them and some people don't. Some Goth types are traditional, CyberGoth / industrial Goth, Victorian / Romantic (or sometimes referred to just Romantigoth), Geek or Nerd Goth, Vampire Goth and Fetish Goth.

, You can wear eyeliner applied underneath and on top of the eye for school and on the weekend eyeshadow with eyeliner applied underneath. You can search tutorials on the internet.

, Goths love to read, write (stories and poetry), draw, paint and make their own clothes. Goth is art, it's about being unique and individuality.

, This is yourself and your lifestyle, if you're not happy then don't be like this. If you feel limited to certain things you shouldn't be in the subculture. It's not about doing certain things because it makes you 'more Goth' it's about doing it because you want to.

Teach people about goth.",How to Be Goth," Learn the basics of traditional goth fashion. During the days of when the scene was new, the goths did not know or have a set image as to what goth looked like. They just made it up as they went along, but as goth is a certain style, similarities showed among the members.There are many so called ""goth"" styles out there, however, traditional goth and deathrock are the only ones that are goth whereas other types take inspiration or mix goth fashion characteristics in with other styles, making it become its own thing. Goth fashion includes:


Darker colours, including purple and redsSatin bodices and corsetsStriped stockings and tightsFrilly or lace gloves
Lace skirts
DIY leather jacket, usually of favourite band logos
Fishnet tightsWinklepickers, spiked heels, pointy-toe lace-ups, shiny thigh high boots or Doc MartensGarments of leather, lace, velvet, silk or PVC;
, Hair has always been an important part of shock tactic method of goth, and it usually takes longer than preparing your outfit or make up.


During the Batcave days, Siouxsie Sioux inspired girls to back comb their hair to uttermost heights and Patricia Morrison of The Sisters of Mercy influenced others to leave their hair long and blackBauhaus, Robert Smith of The Cure, Specimen and Dave Vanian all influenced men's fashion and Jonny Slut, keyboardist of Specimen became the face of the band due to his elaborate style and huge, back combed and hairsprayed death hawk.However, you don't need to do anything too extreme everyday. If you prefer to have it long and black, perhaps choppy, you can. There aren't any rules on hair, but goth does have its style. If you're interested in having a certain style you can look up tutorials on YouTube.

, Siouxsie Sioux's make up motivated many girls to take the time to draw on Cleopatra stylized eyes, and Daniel Ash influenced men to draw on ""death brows"" which were drawn on in black and then flared upwards. Eyeshadow palettes and colours were mixed in with electric blues, purples and metallics, and female eyebrows were either thin and high arched like Morticia Addams or pointed, triangular and thick like Siouxsie Sioux. If you don't necessarily like the style you don't have to wear it/make your own version, but a lot of fans of the music dressed like this because they were influenced by their idols., The more accessories you tend to add, the better your outfit looks. There are tons of accessories that go together with different themed outfits, for example you have fake fangs for a vampire outfit, a corset for a romantic outfit and sunglasses for a traditional outfit.


Other goth accessories include:

Piercings, including lip, eyebrows, tongues and belly buttonsSunglasses (much like The Sisters of Mercy), top hats, capes, cravats, riding crops or lunchbox purses. Piercings and colorful contact lenses and fake fangs are also popular.Silver jewellery such as silver skulls, human skeletons and bats or religious imagery like crosses made into chunky rings, brooches and necklaces.Nail polish. Black, purple and red were incredibly popular colours with goths., In the original scene, goths did not have complete stores to shop at. They had their creativity and what they found in local thrift stores to work with, meaning there was no ""set"" goth style (although it ended up looking similar in the end). As punk is DIY, that means goth is too, and will always be a big part of it. Start experimenting with clothes yourself, and make sure they are cheap enough so that if you mess up, you aren't too bothered about it. There are several goth DIY tutorials on YouTube and on blogs to follow if you have no ideas. Meanwhile, some simple tips include:

Buy or paint patches of your favourite band/anything from Etsy.com and eBay and sew them onto your jacket/garment of clothing.
Buy or make your own band/logo pins and do the same to them as you did with the patches.
Learn how to make jewellery, you can even sell it and begin your own business.
Cut up old clothes with patterns on and stitch patches onto clothes. Tartan or leopard print patches look great against black jackets.
Buy some safety pins and get creative with them, use them to pin jackets together or simply make patterns on your clothes.
Bleach clothes to create permanent patterns in them.

, Members of the subculture consider listening to and appreciating goth rock, post punk, deathrock and darkwave music to be an important part of being goth. Many goths listen to many other different genres, too, but there are certain ones which are considered goth whereas others are considered goth-friendly. It doesn't mean you can't listen to them, it just means that you won't make you ""goth"" if you only listen to those goth-friendly genres.


Musical goth characteristics include an echoing tribal beat, 4 / 4 post punk beat or drum machine, funeral synthesizers, flanging guitars that produced cold and brittle effects, distorted guitars, a prominent lead bassline and deep eerie baritone vocals, usually in men., These can be both in the goth and deathrock genres.

, Goth music places a great emphasis on the lyric and matching the lyric with creating a mood. Many early vocalists aimed for a Leonard Cohen-like dirge to focus on the words in the song. Start with the most popular Goth songs like A Forest by The Cure, Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus and Cities In Dust by Siouxsie and the Banshees.


Learn the words to your favorite goth songs by copying out lyrics in a notebook. Knowing the words to your favorite songs can be a quick way to make friends with other goths, if you're into the same things.

, The popular goth bands are good, and they will definitely earn you goth points on your goth card (see ""goth slang"") but finding underground or local goth bands is something you should definitely do, too. Check the ""goth/alternative rock"" sections of Discogs, Bandcamp.com, Last.fm and Soundclick.com and see what you can find. Be warned, though, because a lot of music is usually mislabelled and is actually metal, EBM or electronic., These are genres goths may be into, but aren't considered to be part of the music genre. These genres include gothic metal, neo classical, witch house, industrial, EBM, aggrotech, shock rock, symphonic metal, ethereal and dark ambient.

, Knowing your background and history of the subculture you are developing yourself into is a very vital part of being goth. This helps you get past the baby bat stage (a ""baby bat"" is someone who is new to the subculture) and into maturing into the culture, music and fashion. Some important facts about goth are:


In the year 1967, the American band The Doors were described as ""gothic rock"" and in 1974 Bowie's Diamond Dogs was called ""gothic"".However, it doesn't make the artist or band goth.
Some people cite Nico as the first to record a gothic album; either The Marble Index or The End.The song credited to have birthed the goth rock genre is the 1979 single Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus.Peter Murphy, lead singer of the band, said that the song was supposed to be written tongue-in-cheek and that their mistake was performing it naive seriousness, which changed the way the audience understood it.This song was also played at the beginning of The Hunger, a film popular among goths.Goth rock or gothic rock is a sub-genre of punk rock which was born out of the British post punk scene in the late 70s / early 80s.A nightclub on London's Meard Street named the ""Batcave"" opened in 1982by members of Specimen that catered towards this new flourishing scene. Although the club never named themselves as a ""goth club"", the club helped bring all the forming elements of goth together.The subculture took inspiration from Gothic architecture such as castles and cathedrals; the Romantic movement originating from the late 1700 and 1800 century and Gothic literature such as The Castle of Ontranto by Horace Walpole where the use of the word ""Gothic"" was first used in literature, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Dracula by Bram Stoker and the works of Edgar Allen Poe.Goth subculture draws inspirations from ancient Celtic, Pagan, Egyptian and Christian mythology and religions and goth fashion combines high chic, antique, retro-kitsch, punk, fetish and secondhand trash elements, Fill your room or your basement with sensuous surroundings: think gothic in terms of light, color, and sound. Put posters on the walls of your favorite bands and hand dark draperies on the walls to soundproof your space, so you can play your music as loud as you want without disturbing the rest of your family. Creating a space for yourself will put you in a headspace where you’re better shielded from the negativity of others. Since many goths are artists, writers, or musicians, it will also help you tap into the creativity and individuality that is such a big part of the subculture.

, Plenty of goths enjoy reading gothic literature. However, it influenced the goth subculture and isn't actually part of it, so reading gothic fiction alone won't make you goth. People were only starting to be called goth because they were into the music. Regardless, you can still enjoy it and indulge in the dark atmospherics that the genre has to offer. Some gothic works you may want to check out are:



Dracula by Bram Stoker

Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

Interview With the Vampire by Anne Rice

The Castle of Ontranto by Horace Walpole

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte

Zastrozzi by Percy Bysshe Shelley
Anything by Edgar Allen Poe, especially his poem The Raven

Also read gothic poetry and try writing your own. William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience is a classic in goth poetry, as well as Sylvia Plath's Ariel.

, Express yourself. Write poetry, paint, or take photographs. Start a band and play goth music. The goth subculture is full of creative people who like to participate in that culture.


Oftentimes, people don't understand or respect the goth subculture. If someone is giving you trouble, just walk away. Don’t waste time arguing. Being friendly and kind to everyone and you might change their perception of goths for the better.

, Don't let anyone tell you what to do, including other goths. If The Cure doesn't do it for you, but you are really into Johnny Cash, so be it. Don't let anyone tell you you're not ""goth enough"" for superficial and otherwise unimportant reasons. The most important thing is that you're you, and you're trying to participate in a community that accepts that.Develop your own style naturally by being influenced by what you read and feel, not by following ""How to"" lists. If you have a genuine interest in a scene, you will naturally be influenced as you get into the subculture. Do what makes you happy.

, Every year, and in several different countries across the world, goth clubs are open and festivals are planned. You can really take part in the goth community if you attend these and listen to what other goths have to say, especially since there will be people who have been into the subculture for 30 years or more, or even since it was born.


Some festivals, events and clubs are as listed:


World Goth DayReturn To The Batcave in Wrocław, Poland

Release The Bats, a deathrock club in Long Beach, CaliforniaWhitby Goth Weekend, Whitby, North Yorkshire, UKWave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig, GermanyNumerous goth clubs around the world,

Some goth slang phrases and their definitions are as followed:


Goth Points. A fictional points system which, every time you do something particularly gothy (example, listening to Bauhaus while dying your hair a shade of ebony), adds points to your card.

Goth Card. A fictional card which stores ""goth points"" as shown above.

Baby bat. A new and willing to learn member of the subculture. This is different to a poseur.

Goth In a Box. A term to describe someone who dresses in complete outfits from Hot Topic. This is frowned upon as goth has its roots in individualism and DIY.

Bat-caver. A frequent visitor of the 1982 nightclub The Batcave, but now refers to someone who is an older goth and was a fan of the music played there., As a member of the subculture, it's important that you teach baby bats and people willing to learn about the scene. This stops the spreading of misinformation and gives baby bats the correct information they need to be able to develop into the subculture. If the media's ""definition"" of goth reaches them first, they may feel they're obliged to participate in negative stereotypes like attempting to worship the devil or self harming. Above all of this, too many baby bats have been unintentionally throwing goth customs and traditions that make goth what it is out of the window.Forgetting the background, history and unifying elements of the subculture makes it lose all value and meaning. Without the background and history, goth would not be what it is today. Goth did not go from a complete social subculture with music and fashion relations to someone's opinion, or simply just a ""mindset""."

Deal With School Restrictions.",How to Be Goth at School," No Goth will ever be taken seriously if he or she does not know what she is talking about. You must understand the development of the Gothic subculture and Gothic music.;

, If you followed step one already you should know very well how much you can work with while still appearing gothic. Try to find clothes that you like and that express your interests. For example, many of the more energetic goths go for the cyber-goth look, emphasizing on black but with bright neon colors. If you're more quiet and reclusive, perhaps a more Victorian or Romantic-goth look is for you. If you like to look like a zombified nut then go for the Deathrock look. And if none of these suit you, and nothing else suits you, make something that does! DIY (Do it yourself) was huge when punk started, and goth grew out of punk with the same DIY approach.

, Obviously goths tend to garner a lot of attention for various reasons. Depending on your personality this may or may not be enjoyable, but no matter what you will get picked on every now and then.

Hallmark of punk music is using your band to stand up for what you believe in and fight against what you think is wrong.

, Don't take yourself too seriously, and don't allow yourself to be easily offended. Just have some fun.

, For example, ""ska punk"", ""riot grrrl"", ""classic punk"", ""hardcore"", ""straight edge"", ""pop punk"", and ""psychobilly"", among others, are all considered part of punk music, but they all sound very different from each other. (Please note that ""emo"", ""screamo"", ""metal"", ""goth"", and ""grunge"" genres are very different from punk, although they occasionally get confused.)


When you first get into the punk genre as a whole, you might realize that you don't particularly like some of its subgenres. However, don't give up until you've tried a little bit of everything!

, Examples of those include YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora. Those are all free accounts! Once you choose one and log in, type in a band name and/or song and just give it a shot. If you don't like what you're hearing, try a new song. Don't give up on the band or artist right away, since a lot of bands change drastically over time. There might be other albums that you'd like better.


Here are a few accessible band names (both popular and classic!) to help get the ball rolling: The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, X-Ray Spex, The Dead Kennedys, NOFX, Green Day, The Cramps, The Reverend Horton Heat, Bikini Kill, Joy Division, Blondie, Minor Threat, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Sublime.
All of those bands have a home in the punk genre, but none of them sound alike, so don't be afraid to try them all.
If you like any of the above mentioned bands (or any other bands for that matter), then that's awesome! Now, do a quick search to find out who influenced the band you're listening to. Often that can lead you to even more great music. For instance, early Green Day was heavily influenced by both Operation Ivy, and the Kinks. So if you like Green Day, then you might also like those bands, and so on and so on.

, There is Google, there are sometimes books (fiction and non-fiction) and movies are to use for search.


Don't forget that you can sometimes find these at second hand stores and libraries. After all, spending $25 on a book about anarchy is kind of ironic.

, This is of course a broad generalization.


Almost all self identified punks tend to have in common is that they all like talking about ""posers"" and ""sell-outs"". A poser is someone who is pretending to be punk for whatever reason, and a sell-out is someone or something that used to be genuinely punk but then started making money or getting a lot of mainstream attention.
If you are new to punk and you don't know very much about it, or if you are a casual fan, or even if you are doing something innocuous like wearing deodorant or clean underwear, be prepared to get called a poser. But don't be offended, because even though it's supposed to be the ultimate insult, it doesn't really mean anything. Just brush it off and continue enjoying yourself.

, One way to do this would be to walk around in your area and look for small places like bars, clubs, coffee shops and record stores that host live bands.


If you get lucky, you'll find a new favorite just by showing up. If there isn't anything like that near you, or if you aren't finding anything you like, then try looking up the touring schedule of a band you already know and love.
Assuming they're still touring and alive, see if you can go see them. If you get lucky enough to find a really great punk scene, take advantage of it! Go to shows, protests, skate parks and roller derby matches, and make friends there.

Refrain from intoxicants, such as alcohol, illegal drugs, and tobacco products.,
Respect your body.,
Respect nature and animals.,
Listen to hardcore music.,
Be hardcore.,
Do it yourself.",How to Be Straight Edge," Straight-edgers reject the drug/alcohol lifestyle and instead, choose not to pollute the body and mind. If you want to change the system, you have to outsmart it. And that, you can only achieve with a clear mind.;
, Contrary to common belief about hardcore punk, the straight-edge lifestyle in no way promotes self-harm of any kind. This means no cutting, burning, or harming yourself. Eat healthily and exercise often, and just take good care of your mental, emotional and physical health.

, Most straight-edgers abstain from or reduce consumption of meat and animal products and become vegetarians or even vegans. Make your environment a better place.

, If you want to, you can listen to some old school straightedge bands, such as Minor Threat. Or, you can listen to melodic hardcore music, such as Bad Religion. Contemporary hardcore music is subsumed by the metal scene, with labels such as metalcore, grindcore, deathcore, emocore, or even nintendocore.

, Actively oppose or passively ignore the ideology of the establishment. Hardcore punk is rooted in a response to the commodification of punk rock, and the wholesale rejection of consumer-culture and capitalism. Be an individual. Think for yourself. Do your own thing.


In the beginning, practitioners of the straight-edge lifestyle would often wear an ""X"" on the back of their hands, or as a patch on a jacket to display their allegiance to the lifestyle. At hardcore concerts, it was bad form to offer a beer to someone with an X on the back of their hand.
While you don't have to be straight-edge to be hardcore, straight-edgers are most commonly associated with the hardcore community, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the hardcore philosophy, at least, regardless of whether or not you embrace it.

, More than any other music or scene, hardcore is defined by DIY attitudes, styles, and opinions.

Contrary to what many believe, it is possible to outsmart the system and to change it from within. However, if you don't do it yourself, it won't get done, says that hardcore way of thinking. Get out there and start creating. Whether it be starting a band, getting that new job, creating an art project, promoting a political movement or taking an alternate direction in your life, hardcore philosophy makes it necessary for you to do it yourself."

Choose your colors.,
Always start with a clean ""canvas"" by washing your face and practicing good hygiene.,

A lot of punks draw shapes on their face, etc., like a heart, star, or sun.",How to Do Cute Punk Makeup (Girls),";
, Kohl liner (more commonly found in the form of a pencil) has a softer look, while liquid liner (more commonly found in pots and tubes and is applied with a brush) has a much more dramatic effect.

, Bright, eye-catching colors such as purple, hot pink, teal, etc work best with this style. Neutrals do not go with this look because they don't stand out.

, If you choose to wear foundation, try to get some with SPF to protect your face and still look nice. Conceal any blemishes with a concealer slightly lighter than your face color and blend it in.

, You could choose to layer some bright colors along the lid with a darker shade blended along the crease. You could go with black and gray eyeshadow and create a smoky effect on your eyes. Or, you could just include one bold swoop of liquid eyeliner all the way to the outer corners and sweep them up. There are no rules and there are no limits as long as you have some remover for any mistakes along the way.

, If you want to focus more of the attention on your eyes (which most punks choose to do), go with the dab of gloss.

, Some people leave out blush and others pile it on.

,, If you want to add that in, well...why not?

Develop the Attitude.",How to Be Glitter Goth," The first step of becoming a Glitter Goth is to appreciate and come to find what music of the culture you like. Listen to the common Goth rock bands like The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie And The Banshees, Bauhaus and The Cure for example. Also try getting into some Goth music that has a different feel to it like Bella Morte, Astrovamps and Joy Division. These are all great starters. Pick a few you like and learn more about them. Sometimes Glitter Goths tend to listen to EBM, Darkwave, Futurepop, Techno and Industrial bands, like Cyber Goths. Some great bands with an electronic feel to them are VNV Nation, Grendel, Neurotic Fish and KMFDM. But it's okay to enjoy other styles of music too, from any style new or old; one thing about being a Goth is that you are an individual first.;
, Glitter Goths are all about mixing color and fun with traditional 'Goth style', and wearing the style the way you're comfortable. Jeans in rare colors, like white or ink, in shapes to suit your body type are awesome. Black and dark blue jeans are classic. White and black tanks, corsets, frilly skirts, tutus, and band tees are popular. Bright and fun colors add an adorable touch. Mix it up with other styles too, hip, velvets, whatever you find that matches a 'Glitter Goth' look. Restriction and rules are for lawyers!

, Most Goths have a good pair of combat or platform boots. Get some platform boots in your favorite color. They are usually black but can be found in white and pink too. Fuzzy ones are even better. But it is understood that not everyone likes platform boots, therefore brands like Dr. Martens have combat boots in all kinds of different colors and styles to fit your particular taste. Converse sells white boots that are great for drawing on and adding things like sparkles and sequins to. Heeled boots are great but don't wear them too much, killing your spine for a look is for the fashion slaves!

, Hairstyles are always vary and unique to the person, the style they like and that they feel confidant in. Some Glitter Goths like to just leave their hair natural colors, some love to dye it, straighten it, curl it or crimp it, perm it. Some common colors are black or blonde. But not everyone can pull off black or blonde hair or likes it, so you can mix it up a bit and get it bleached and dyed a bright color like pink or blue. Or you can streak it, having different colors. Another option is dread falls. You can make these yourself or buy them offline. Read related wikiHow articles on the subject. Makeup can be anything you make it.x including non existent. Some move toward bright blue, pink and silver eyeshadows. They come in a large assortment of different colors. Some are metallic and some have sparkles in them. False eyelashes are really more Cyber Goth but can still be fun. Lipsticks and glosses are good too, though you should always pick between which you want to be the main feature - your eyes or your lips, or you'll just look too try hard if both are trying to be a feature of your makeup. Your lip color can be something simple like nude, pink, purple or red, to wild colors like black, grey or blue. Sparkly lipgloss is always good. Again, read some related Wiki Hows on the subject.

, Silver or gold bangles are very classy and look amazing on anyone. If you look hard enough you can find them in colors like black, pink, in almost any color. Rubber bracelets come in all kinds of colors. Keep it simple and wear only one color or wear only one color with black ones or wear a rainbow plethora of bangles. Long pearl necklaces in white and old-fashioned pendants are classy also. Chokers are very common, as well as large gemstone rings. Mini top hats are adorable, and wear a monocle if you happen to be able to get your hands on one.

, It cannot be stressed upon enough, but be yourself. Many Glitter Goths like to be the quiet type and can do many things like write stories, write poetry, paint, draw and design. Find something you like. Be nice to people, be a “social butterfly”. Do something you feel confident doing. This is as much about you learning who you are and what you like, as much as following a 'type', so don't bother forcing yourself to do things or dress a way that you feel uncomfortable or strange in. (Wasn't that the problem in the first place?)

, Go places based on what you like. Go to conventions, galleries and clubs. Go to the movies and lunch with friends. Concerts and plays too. The sky is the limit. This is you finally showing who you are; it doesn't have to change the way you live.

, Popular with many but not all Glitter Goths carrying a small selection of toys with you can be an important part of the look. Typical toys include dolls, slinkies, bubble kits, bubble guns, stickers, crayons and markers. Tools include pen and paper, an iPod or other MP3 player and a digital camera.

, Your music taste doesn't have to change, we all have our own tastes, but to get a good understanding of music that other Glitter Goths listen to always is good, and you'll always find something there you love! Although a Glitter Goth's exact musical taste varies by the person, the majority listen to 80s Gothic rock such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, Bauhaus, Specimen, Siouxsie and The Banshees, Sex Gang Children, Joy Division, and Dead Can Dance.


Popular contemporary bands include Switchblade Symphony, London After Midnight and The Cruxshadows.

, One cannot be a true Glitter Goth without the attitude. The key attitude for a Glitter Goth is perky. Don't act mopey and whiny; don't act preppy or scatter your language with 'likes' & 'OMGs!'. Eccentric, sweet, caring, are all words that would describe a Glitter Goth. You can act mean at sometimes, for example if someone bought the shoes you've been looking for a week, whine and then take your anger out of your friends, or better still, buy a stress ball.

Find opportunities to rebel against the status quo.All punk music is based on rebellion.,
Know your stuff.No punk popper can consider themselves part of the scene if they don't have an appreciation and knowledge of the music to begin with.,
Stay fit.Generally speaking, the punk pop culture favours slender builds.,
Go to shows.",How to Be Punk Pop1," Even if punk pop is fairly happy in comparison with other punk genres, you should still take a sense of rebellion to heart with you. Find opportunities in your day-to-day life to express yourself, whether or not it fits in with the status quo. At the same time, you shouldn't take rebellion as an excuse to be mean to people. Being punk pop means spreading good vibes around.


For a positive demonstration of rebellion, try to be outspoken with whatever you do. If you're in class, raise your hand whenever you have something to say, especially if it conflicts with the view the teacher is presenting.
Searching for your own style without regard to what others will think is rebellious in of itself.;
, If you haven't listened to much of the music yet, now's a good time to do some binging. Blink 182's Enema of the State and Green Day's Dookie are essential records to check out if you want to be taken seriously as a fan of the genre.


Although punk pop is usually seen as a singles-based genre, listening to albums from start to finish is a good idea if you really want to understand what punk pop is all about.Music videos are also worth watching.

, A lot of punk poppers also do skateboarding on the side. This is a great form of exercise that sheds pounds while you have fun. Some punk poppers also commit to vegan or vegetarian lifestyles. If you cut meat and dairy out of your diet and replace them with the proper iron-rich alternatives, you should end up feeling much better than you did.


Lentils, grains and nuts are all examples of high-iron alternatives to meat., Punk pop culture is based around the music, and the only place you can truly experience punk pop as it's meant to be heard as at a live show. Go to shows, preferably small shows at house parties or basement venues. These smaller venues lend themselves to a closer-knit group of people, and lower the risk of people coming there who might try to cause a problem.


Avoid drugs and alcohol when you're out at shows. If you need to rely on drugs to have fun, you're not having fun in the right way.

Wear band shirts.Band shirts are a staple for most underground music scenes.,
Try on a lazy beanie hat.Punk pop and skater culture are closely intermingled.,
Wear Vans or Converse sneakers.Because punk pop built up around teen culture, teen-friendly brands have become a part of the look.,
Consider chokers and bracelets.Chokers and bracelets are fun accessories you can dress your body up with.,
Dye your hair.There aren't set rules for hair in punk pop, so long as you're relatively clean cut and take care of your appearance.,
Get colourful.",How to Be Punk Pop2," Band shirts are helpful because they let other people know you are a fan of a given band without even having to open up your mouth. Many band shirts come with distinctive and appealing artwork that's specific to the punk pop look as well, so they're a perfect place to start.


You should only wear shirts of bands you sincerely like. Otherwise, you put yourself at risk of being called a poseur.

, Skaters like to wear beanie hats, and you won't raise any suspicions in the punk pop scene if you go for that look too. Beanies are cozy and casual. They're a symbol of what the punk pop lifestyle is about.

, Shoes are important for just about every style, so the same goes for punk pop. Vans and Converse shoes are the go-to brands for punk pop. Of course, any kind of skate shoe will do. Punk pop is unlike other punk lifestyles in the sense that it embraces some of the big name corporations. If you don't feel this appeals to you, you can always configure punk pop to your personal liking.


Brand name shoes are known as a part of punk pop but it's not necessary. If you are on a budget, you can go to a used clothing or consignment store and raid it for new digs., Punk pop is big into them with both genders. Some bracelets could be band merch as well. Rubber bracelets with band names and slogans (""Defend Punk pop"") are big with this subculture.Pyramid studded belts are a useful addition too., Dyeing your hair is a welcome way to distinguish your look. Put streaks of some wacky colour into your hair. Be careful not to overdo it, however, as constant hair dyeing will strain your hair.


Hair length and style varies widely within punk pop.However, keeping your hair long and straight (if you're a girl) or getting a crew cut (if you're a guy) is a good place to start if you're unsure what to pick.

, Punk pop is all about being young and expressing yourself in a fun way. For some, the skinny jeans and shirt combo will be enough. Others may want to crank it up a notch by putting some focus on the colours they wear. If you make your wardrobe colourful, your appearance will match the happy-go-lucky attitude of the music you love.


Accessorizes like bracelets, hair streaks and patches are easy ways to add colourful life to your outfit.

Learn a basic instrument.,
Form a band.,
Brainstorm song ideas.,
Write chord progressions with major chords.Punk pop is often referred to as ""happy punk"" for a reason.,
Write punk pop lyrics.,
Sing melodies over your chord progressions.,
Put effort into your image.Even if you have great songs by the end of it, punk pop is ultimately about image.",How to Be Punk Pop3," It should go without saying that would-be musicians need to learn an instrument before their dreams of punk pop fame are tickled. Punk pop is limited to electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals. If you play bass or guitar, you should consider trying to get your voice in basic shape. That way, you can front a band or sing harmonies while you play. Get a teacher if you feel you need some help getting started.


If you're playing guitar, you should keep in mind that punk pop is an almost exclusively rhythm-based genre. There is still a lot of room within that context to express yourself beautifully, however.Punk is infamous for having most of its songs consist of three or four chord song progressions. With this in mind, the technical aspects are quite easy to pick up.

, A band can be easy or difficult to form depending on the company you keep. If you are friends with enough people who are passionate about punk pop, it shouldn't be hard to find people who would be interested in playing some shows with you. Failing personal friends, post an ad on Craigslist and see if you get any bites. In the meantime while you're making contacts, you can get a head start on writing your songs.


Punk pop names are usually tongue-in-cheek or silly, like Blink-182.

, Punk pop lyrics tend to revolve around either politics or real life. In the end, you can write lyrics about anything you like, but lyrics about your experience as a teenager will probably go over the best with your future audience. Think about life experiences you've had that really moved you one way or another.


For example, a childhood friend moving to another city could inspire a song about how much you miss that friend.
Song titles should give the listener an idea what the song is about before moving into them. It can also be taken from words in the chorus.

, If you have a guitar, throw some chords together to make the backbone of your song. If you don't have much experience with songwriting, try building your new song around the structure of a classic punk pop song, keeping the same rhythm and structure but changing the chords around to suit you.

, Punk pop is simple, and the lyrics should be too. Once you have ideas for your songs, try streamlining them into pithy lines a few words long. Fill up part of a page with potential lines and pick the line that stands out the most to you. That standout should be your chorus.


Base your typical rhyme scheme on the common ABAB CDCD formula. Most pop songs fall into this format.

, Once you have the chords and a rough set of lyrics, it's time to write some catchy melodies to fit the mood of your song. If this is your first time writing a song, don't worry about perfection at all. Just hum out a melody and fit the words to it as best you can.


Vocal harmonies are a great way to improve the quality of your music. Don't sweat it if you can't pull off harmonies, however. A badly done harmony isn't worth the trouble.

, If you want people to have fun listening to your music, you need to practice what you preach. If you decide later on that you want to play a show, you should come there with a great attitude, wanting to show everyone there a great time. Punk pop is ultimately about spreading good feelings around.

Listen to punk music!,
Go to your local record store.,
Wear shirts with your favorite punk-band's logos on them.,
Attend gigs and shows put on by your favorite bands.,
Remember it's all about being yourself!,
Care about something.,
Make your own stuff.",How to Become a Punk Rocker," There are many different sub-genres of punk, and it's best not to limit yourself to just only one. Listen to as much as possible, and if you like something, go for it! Any punk who claims you are a poser could be called one himself, for being a Punk is about freedom to do whatever you wish! If you want to listen to a band, listen to them! Try going to your local record stores and sifting through some of the second hand albums to find some new or unknown bands. Keep in mind that you don't have to listen to exclusively punk music, and that it's actually considered cool by many to listen to a variety of genres.;
, Listen to punk and proto-punk bands like The Germs, Iggy and the Stooges, Buzzcocks, The Misfits, Minor Threat, Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys, etc.

, They are very fashionable in the Punk scene. Also, try customizing your clothes. Buying trousers with patches sewn into them is much less ""punk"" than sewing on your own patches- one with messages or symbols that mean something to you, or the names of bands you like. You can usually find some good clothes in thrift stores, as well as specialist punk/goth/emo stores. The advantage of thrifting is the low prices and wide variety of unique options.

, You'll meet other people who enjoy the same music as you, and have great fun.

, Wear WHATEVER YOU WANT TO. Punk is about identity and individuality. As John Lydon said, ""the punks ruined it. They developed a unified image and attitude."" If you want to be a punk, be a punk. You don't have to change yourself.

, Apathy is conformity. Find something you're passionate about and take back your desire to change the world. Get head over heels into veganism, feeding the homeless, or whatever else. Join a movement or organization for solidarity- Food Not Bombs is an organization that does amazing work, plus it's considered a ""terrorist organization"" by the government. Celebrate interesting or obscure holidays like ""Buy Nothing Day"". Make your voice heard and don't let anyone tell you to quiet yourself.

, Grow food plants on your fire escape. Tomatoes are good because you can fertilize them with used coffee grounds. Check out books like Food Not Lawns. Learn to knit and get free patterns from sites like knitty. Quit buying much, and be a consumerist sheep. Do you really even need all that rubbish? You wouldn't be a wage slave if you weren't up to your eyeballs in credit card debt for stuff you only want because the TV said you should. Don't be brainwashed by the media. Remember punk is a state of mind!

Strict School?",How to Be Punk at a School with Uniforms," If your school doesn't have a problem with you walking around with a hoodie/jacket, fix it up with some band patches, buttons, studs or spikes, and try painting some band logos on it, or painting slogans/logos all over it.;
, Buy a messenger bag or a black/dark blue backpack and add pins/badges with your favorite bands, sayings and symbols (any rebellious symbols will do but some symbols may cause more offence than you intended, such as Nazi or white supremacy symbols) on them. You can even add duct tape to your bag. You can also draw/stitch things onto it for a little originality. Get a marker or a corrector pen for some scrawling of your own. You can even make your own bag.

, Anything that is labeled by the dress code, do not wear. For instance, if all you are required to wear is a uniform shirt, then do not wear khaki pants. Instead, wear rocker belts (pyramid, bullets, spiked) with good belt buckles over jeans or black pants.

, A bold color, such as black, blue, or red, or even mix and match. Roll up your sleeves. For the finishing touch, wear a leather jacket or dark hoody.

, Put them in your hat, your jeans, shirts, your bag... Everything.

, Try to stay within the rules, but still be unique. Try a messy look, or some spikes, or possibly a faux mohawk. Test your boundaries.



If your school has rules and you aren't allowed to dye your hair crazy colors, just dye the very ends, so that you can easily cut them off if your school has issues with it. You could also try a temporary dye - this also helps when you are experimenting.

, If you are forced to wear a tie, leave the top button undone and let the tie hang sloppily. Roll up your sleeves too if you have to wear a dress shirt. Also, If the school does not require a specific tie to be worn, go to your local thrift store and pick out the ugliest or most satirical ties you can find. Also, if you want to be extreme, rip up your tie, pull out strands, just destroy it. Maybe even add a few anarchy symbols.

, Knee high, pink, green, hello kitty, whatever! Wear them. Don't tuck them in your pants! Also try to punk up your shoes. Draw, write, paint and color on them!

, Some schools have them embroidered on jumpers, shirts or hats. If you are good at sewing or embroidery, try modifying the crest so that it says something completely different. Usually, the changes are difficult to spot, but the results of people seeing them are great! Don't go too far in making too obscene messages, but it's all a matter of testing. If you're not good at embroidery, use a permanent marker or some acrylic paint.

, Some schools have an incredibly strict dress code, we know. So look at the rules and interpret them. Buy yourself some black converse if your school says you have to have black shoes. Only allowed school colours and/or black and white for accessories (like hair ties and headbands?)... make your own, preferably with a big anarchy symbol on it. Just interpret the rules.

The music is heavily electronic in nature, covering both alternative electronic genres such as EBM, industrial music, futurepop and power noise and club-oriented dance music styles such as trance and hard dance, and other electronic genres including drum and bass, synthpop, gabber and intelligent dance music.",How to Be Cyber Goth," Don't feel that because you are male you can't be Cyber Goth. Nor do you have to be white. Cyber Goth is a multi-ethnic style, and there are many, many black, Hispanic and Japanese Cyber Goths.;
, In Europe and Japan, Cyber Goths seem to lean heavily towards Raver, and are usually incredibly colorful. In America and Australia, Cyber Goths leans heavily towards the military side, known as Rivethead. Edit: You don't have to dress a certain way in a certain country. If you like the darker side of Cyber Goth and you live in Japan, that's fine.Likewise, there are a lot of people in America and Australia who dress like Japanese Cyber Goths

, Most makeup of cyber goths is quite complex and is color coordinated with the rest of their outfit. You should devote a lot of practice towards applying your make-up before taking it out for a spin, to avoid those face palm moments.

, Manic Panic sell the type Marilyn Manson uses, do not go too over the top with the paleness to begin with- just gradually get paler.

, This is very common in Sweden, Finland, and Japan.

, It's either dyed and styled real hair or more commonly, elaborate extensions or wigs either braided or somewhat resembling dreadlocks known as 'dread falls'. Falls can be made out of synthetic hair, thick plastic ribbon, yarn or more exotic materials such as computer cables, foam strips and tubular Crin (known as Cyber Lox); as cyber goth fashions typically aim for an artificial or heavily-stylised look, materials that are very obviously not real hair are particularly common. Dread falls made from synthetic hair can be made in many styles, such as candy cane swirls (two colors together to look like a candy cane) and transistor dreads (one color turning into another). Dread extensions are also used for a more permanent ""Dread Falls"" look.

, Try to get Cyberlox that are very thick, full and colorful. UV is even better. Even if you can't find cyberlox that fit your budget, you can easily find cheap materials for cyberlox like foam, yarn, and kanekalon hair that you can dread yourself. When you wear them, wear a thick headband to cover your hair, as this also comforts the pressure of all that weight on your forehead.

, Manic Panic has great neon dyes, but you'll most likely need to bleach your hair first. Some Cyber Goths just color their hair rainbow without a hint of black in it. You don't have to go through the trouble of dying it though, this is what cyberlox are for :) you can wear wigs too.

, The colors are usually a mixture of neon colors and white and/or black, the colors usually contrast well. Clothing with reflector panels, or circuitry designs are very popular. Neon colored fishnets worn over plain black tights are popular with females, and they look cool. Try to find clothing with radioactive or bio-hazard symbols as well. PVC chokers and bracelets with colored spikes are popular. Ones that glow in the dark are even better. Try to find a decent PVC Gas Mask, as they seem to be a popular accessory for some reason.

, This is primarily borrowed from Deathrock, but as long as it's colorful, it's Cyber Goth.

, Be aware that these can hurt after a few hours of wear, so a headband will comfort your head slightly.

, Many Cyber Goths are also seen at Anime/Comic conventions, as well as the yearly Wave Gotik Treffen and M'era Luna music festivals in Germany, which attract visitors from all over the world.

, Transmuter, Swear Alternative and Demonia seem to be very popular. Also, faux fur leg warmers are popular among female cyber goths.

, ""Tattoos are generally Kanji, or based on Japanese designs."" Edit: Great example of someone talking out of their behind. If one prefers Kanji, one gets Kanji. There is NO GENERAL RULE OF THUMB that comes with cyber goth tattoos. Also, please don't feel pressured to chop/dye yourself as it is not a requirement.

, It is advised not to go into this style without knowing at least some of the more popular cybergoth bands, such as VNV Nation and Icon Of Coil, otherwise you will be labelled a poseur. Cyber Goth music is a range of genres. Industrial, EBM (Electronic Body Music), Futurepop, Synthpop, Techno, Noize, Aggrotech are just a few of them. Make sure you know the difference between them all, and yes there is actually a difference. Some lean more towards a Rammstein-esque sound, and some lean more towards a rave/club sound.

Get the look.,
Make your hair look punk.,
Follow the three rules every punk needs when it comes to fashion.,
Get your own interest and passions.,
Don't be a sex object.,
Listen to the music.,
Be confident and fearless.,
Don't let being a girl stop from doing anything you want to do.,
Follow your dreams and make your own decisions.",How to Be Punk (12 to 14 Year Old Girls)," Punk fashion is underrated nowadays, and it covers a large range of clothing. However, there are some guidelines to follow.


Shirts don't always have to be black. In fact, neon and colors like lime green are punk if worn the right way. Shirts with slogans about uniqueness, freedom, or a cause important to you are punk. Tights for girls are recommend, although baggy works too. Feminine shirts work too. As long as it's you and something you like, that's all that really matters.
Punk dresses are good for more female punks. Although a lot of punks are tomboys, there are feminine punks. Dresses with sneakers can look great, if you wear it correctly. Look for colors that stand out such as turquoise, brick red, or a golden color. Look for unusual patterns, and unique details such as buttons, zips, etc.
Bottoms vary widely. Grey, black, or red skinny jeans work. Tights could be in a crazy pattern, or just normal colored. If your parents allow you to fishnet stockings are great too. Baggy jeans can work, as well as camouflage pants, or brightly colored pants. Pants with extra pockets, zips, studs and other details work.
Shoes can be almost anything, as long as you like them, and are unique. For milder punks, black flats or converse work. Those that want to go all out can choose combat boots, or high heeled knee boots work. Converse in patterns work well too.;
, Hair just needs to be clean and it needs to say something about your personality. If you're allowed to, dyeing your hair can look amazing. It's easier to start off with streaks than dying your whole head, because lots of schools and parents have problems with this. Getting side bangs, or a hair cut that is edgy works.

,


1. Be unique and don't look like something off a magazine or a show.
2. Avoid copying others, although it's okay to draw influence from people.
3. Have fun!

, Music is a big thing for punks, although if you don't want to do music you don't have to. Art, basketball, chess, whatever you want! Punk is about living your own life, so you can still be a cheerleader and be a punk. It's all in the attitude towards life and it's a lifestyle.

, You're probably only in middle school or early high school, and sex is something that should wait a few years. Girls and women have been seen as sex objects, but true punk girls want respect for something besides their bodies. Don't let any guy take advantage of you. Most guys are good guys and don't cheat, but especially in middle school some guys take advantage of girls. Just be careful.

, Avril Lavigne is a great one, as well as Sum 41, Sex Pistols, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Green Day, and the Beatles are other good ones. Punk is more about the outlook, so you can still listen to rap or pop and be punk. It's about the freedom.

, Punk girls must confident and willing to take risks. Start facing your fears, and accept yourself as you are.

, It's the 21st century, and punk girls often have interest in mostly guy activities. Don't let your gender hold you back.

, Be strong and don't let people wear you down. At this age, you personality is being to form. You might have discovered a passion or dream. If so, then follow it. Avoid people who try to change you or give you peer pressure.

"
Wear a lot of black; in the eyes of the public, there is nothing scarier than that.,
Try applying lots of eyeliner and eye shadow on your eyes; it doesn't matter what gender you are, this usually looks good on everyone if you apply it right.,
Practice doing Meatwad impressions in the mirror 7 times a day.,
Do your hair.,
Accessorize.,
Decide what you want on your feet.,
Listen to punk music and horror punk bands.,
Work out a LOT, or not at all, EVER.,
Know about Paranormal stuff.,
Watch horror movies.,
Listen to Green Day, they are true punk and have the image down and you can hear them on the radio any time.,
Have fun!",How to Be Horror Punk,"


Wear dark clothes with skeleton prints on them, and horror movie t-shirts.
You can also wear black shiny leather, just as long as it's not too tight.
You can even make your own shirts. They can be for your favorite band, movie, novel.
You can change shirts too by ripping, shredding, or sewing them.;
,


You could use eyeliner other than black too.
Try putting it as close to the eye as possible.

,


Trust me, it'll bump up your horror punk cred to astronomical levels.

, The famous hair is the devilock. It's essential to Horror Punk style. Though it isn't absolutely mandatory, it's something you would want to have, and it compliments the style of clothing you'll have. It is usually dark-colored hair that is short in the back, side, and most of the front, but one very long lock of hair (usually rather thick, but the Misfits usually sport Devilocks rather thin) streaking down the middle of one's face or off to the side a bit.

, Wear pointy spikes, skeleton print gloves, skeleton mask, and gas mask are good options. Fashion your hair in to a pomp or a devil lock

, Combat boots, Converse, Vans, Iron Fist or Punk Rose will work, just as long as it's dark colored. Heels make wonderful accessories.

, Some examples are: The Misfits, Samhain, Balzac, The Cramps, Calabrese, Wednesday 13, Zombie Ghost Train, and Blitzkid. Anything else is completely unacceptable and you will get your horror punk card revoked.

, Either look like Danzig in his prime, or don't even attempt to work out because it's conformist.

, Stuff like Vampires, Werewolves, or any myth/legendary stuff of the likes (especially the scary ones!)


Try reading and watching science fiction more often.

, It's a plus to know about Horror Movies, even cult hits, old movies, and B movies. Most horror punks are very into sci-fi and other horror cultures as well, aside from just the music. Almost all Horror Punk lyrics are fueled by movies or other scary flicks, anyway.

, Anti-punk-punk. Rob Zombie is great too because he looks like a corpse. This is perfect, look like Rob Zombie.


Anime is optional, but a lot of good horror punk comes out of Japan so lots of horror punks respect Japan and like anime, especially the more gruesome or scary animes such as Blood Plus or Elfen Lied.

, You'll notice most horror punks are great people and love to share their interests with other horrorpunks. Don't think you can't have friends and have to lash out at anyone who tries to be nice to you.

Take risks with your life, experiencing as many different things as you can.,
Follow your dreams, even when they seem like a longshot.,
Know that even bad experiences make for amazing stories.,
Be a little intense, letting your passion for life shine through.,
Stand up for yourself and those you love.,
Be up-to-date.,
Hang out with people who challenge you.",How to Be Edgy1," Edgy people are always willing to try new things. You don't have to go skydiving if it's not your thing, but you should accept invitations from people you're just getting to know, try a new cuisine you didn't even know existed, or take a last-minute road trip to hike a beautiful mountain. Don't just do the same old thing and make a goal of doing something completely new at least once a week.


Being edgy requires you to fill your life with new ideas, people, and places. To stay on the cutting edge of ideas, you need to constantly be exposed to them!
Start small, if you're feeling timid. Book a single vacation, take up the new hobby you've wanted to try, or try out a new bar or party.;
, This may sound like it has nothing to do with an edge, but finding your dreams and going after them have everything to do with being confident and cool. Being edgy means looking at everything a little differently, doing your own thing, and being okay with the fact that it may not fit the world's idea of what you should be doing with your life. Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein, and Coco Chanel were all edgy in their own ways, even if they only seemed eccentric or ""different"" at the time. They succeeded because they kept trying.


Whatever your dreams are, be confident and comfortable about following them. So what if you want to be an actress or to publish a killer novel while knowing there's a good chance it won't happen for you? Following your dreams, however impractical they are, will give you some edge.
And if you don't know what your dreams are, then now is a good time to find out. You can't really be edgy if you're feeling aimless or like you're just plugging along instead of following a passion.

, Do things even if the result may be consequential. Unless you have reason to fear for your life and safety, sometimes you need to just ""do it for the story."" Edgy people understand that things won't always go perfectly in the moment, but that these challenges and tribulations are the bases of many incredible, edge-of-your-seat stories later on in life.


Though having goals is important, it's also important to sit at the top of a cliff once in a while. Make every experience matter. Do some things just because they feel right.

, It's okay if you don't rush downstairs to greet your roommate the second she walks in the house or tear your eyes off your captivating book the moment your crush walks by. Get engrossed. Get obsessed. Get completely absorbed. It's okay to be so focused that you don't completely notice what's going on around you; what's most important is that you're committed to caring about whatever makes you excited about being alive.


Whenever you do something, give your full attention and effort to the task. You'll not only be edgier, but you'll learn faster and have more meaningful experiences., Edgy people don't just roll over when challenged. If someone calls you out, gossips about you, or even says something nasty about you to your face, don't back off. You don't have to start a fight or start name-calling, but you should be proud enough to be yourself that you know you're worth defending. Don't let anyone think he can get away with putting you down.


You'll find that most people, when challenged, will back down. Don't feel the need to pursue or punish them if they do -- you've already won the battle.

, If you want to be edgy, you have to be on the cutting edge of things. This means you should see the new Sundance Film Festival winner, that you should check out the new Burmese restaurant everyone has been raving about, and that you should update your hair and fashion more than once every five years. It also means that you should actually watch the news, read the papers, and be able to carry an intelligent conversation about what's going on in the world.


Being up-to-date doesn't mean you have to copy every trend that comes your way. There's a difference between being aware of trends and following them obsessively.
You can never be current about every topic. Instead, get deeply immersed in the topics that mean the most to you, following your passion.

, If you run next to someone who is faster than you, you will run faster. If you run next to someone who is way slower, your body will naturally slow down. The same goes for being edgy. If you know someone who is the height of edginess, who you deeply respect and admire and want to emulate, then keep on hanging with that person.


If you know a group of people who likes to stay up late talking about Marxism, going green, or whatever it is that excites you, then make a habit of hanging out with them more.
You don't have to think of them as your ""edgy"" friends. Just think of them people who encourage you to develop your inner edge.

"
"
Make strong eye contact with people and keep your posture upright.,
Ditch small talk, going straight to conversations that matter.,
Let your opinions run free, but be sure you can passionately back them up.,
Only speak when you truly have something to say.,
Ignore the haters, squares, and others who throw you shade.",How to Be Edgy2," When you run into someone, make eye contact instead of looking down at the floor or seeming distracted. Show that you're not afraid to make a connection and that you're completely confident in yourself. Keep your back straight and your chin up, whether sitting or standing, and let your shoulders relax and pull backward. Great posture not only makes you look confident -- you feel it, too.


Making eye contact shows that you're confident and ready to take things to another level.
Don't let anything sag, especially your shoulders and chin. Keeping these two body parts level and strong will help the rest of your posture fall into place naturally., This doesn't mean ""don't be friendly,"" it means talking about the relationships, ideas, and ideologies that make the world work, even if (especially if) it is the first time you meet people. Challenge others with deep questions, such as their hopes and goals, what they'd rather do than work, and their opinions on the major topics of the day.


Don't be afraid to make people a little uncomfortable at first-- you'll be surprised how many people appreciate deeper conversations than ""how about that weather.""
Follow your curiosities in a conversation -- don't tailor your topics to what is ""polite"" or right.

, Edgy people tend to stray towards the extremes when they have opinions. This doesn't mean you need to take a stand on every issue -- quite the opposite. Instead, get deep into the issues that really matter, becoming a passionate advocate and leader on the cutting edge of issues. For the rest, remove yourself. It seems paradoxical, but it is far more edgy to ignore an issue you know nothing about than to hop on a bandwagon and pretend.


Some opinions will be unpopular, such as what you think of your sister's new boyfriend or your political views. Just because your opinion is unpopular doesn't mean you should suppress it.
Edgy people need to be well-informed about new developments and ideas, at least in your favorite subjects. Don't equate edgy with uneducated, even if you hate the education system.

, Don't mince words, offer half-thought ideas, or give compliments when you don't actually mean them. There is nothing wrong with thoughtful silence, especially when the alternative is mealy, useless conversation. The flip-side of this statement, however, is equally important -- when you truly have something to say, say it!


People will fish for compliments or advice, but there is nothing wrong with being honest if you don't have any to give. In fact, it is far edgier than lying or ignoring the question.

, Who really cares what the ""popular"" crowd thinks? If they make fun of you, just smile and walk away. This doesn't mean you're being mean or off-putting. Rather, you're realizing that you can only control your own behavior and that you rock. If you can't change the haters, don't bother with them at all.


Don't waste your time trying to please people who don't really matter to you.
Do things for you, not because you feel like someone else wants you to do them.
Never forget that the only person you can control is yourself -- and that's a good thing! Edgy people focus on themselves."
"
Wear clothes because you like them, making that the only criteria for buying clothes.,
Throw different styles together in the same outfit.,
Pull and steal style inspiration from everywhere.,
Use accessories to cheaply expand your wardrobe and look.,
Consider a tattoo or piercing.",How to Be Edgy3," Who gives a flying care what others think of your clothes, if they match, or if they came from a thrift store? Furthermore, who cares if you spent $5,000 on that new jacket? The only factor determining whether or not you wear something is whether or not you want to wear it.


Get your clothes from anywhere -- garage sales, thrift stores, high-end shops, big-box stores -- and worry about matching later.

, Again, if you think it looks good, this is more than enough. You're not going to be edgy by copying the same trends you see elsewhere, and you're only going to find new outfits that work if you take some risks first., Don't feel like you have to be unique just for the sake of being unique-- paradoxically, you're still letting yourself be defined by what is ""normal,"" you're just choosing to show the opposite. But fashion isn't so black and white, and neither are you. When you see something you like, an outfit idea to try, or some new accessories worth rocking, go for it. Take inspiration and ideas from everywhere and you haven't really stolen anything at all -- you've just melded it into your personal style.


Always consider the overall tone or look of a style you like. How can you get this same tone across without the exact same clothes?
If you'd like to just wear a ""uniform,"" or the same basic outfit every day, this can be equally edgy. These people, including Steve Jobs (black turtleneck and jeans) and Barack Obama (gray suit), have largely ditched the societal pressure of choosing new clothes and instead wear the same well-cut, good looking thing each day., Just a few key accessories can kick your edginess up a notch. Girls can wear long chains (gold or silver), bangles, or chunky bracelets. Both guys and girls can wear out-there shoes, crazy earrings, or extra dark sunglasses. Carry a pocket watch if it feels like something you'd enjoy. Accessories let you quickly distinguish yourself without breaking the bank.


Guys can use a messenger bag or a funky belt to edge up their look.

, Yes, being edgy is about being yourself, and you should never get a tattoo ""just because."" That said -- what are you waiting for? The reason there is so much overlap between edgy people and body modification (tattoos, piercings, etc.) is that edgier people tend to regard their body as a temporary canvass. They know that they only get one body, and they might as well ""customize"" it however they want. The consequences can be damned, because they aren't a big deal -- anyone who doesn't like your tattoo is just too close-minded to be worth the time.


What you choose to get is up to you, but don't discount getting some incredible art just because you love it. Research local tattoo artists and breeze through their collections, or ask them if they'll make a custom design for you.
Get a tattoo because you want it, not because it ""probably looks cool."" If you like the design still 2-3 days after you first saw it, take the plunge.
Be careful -- tattoos can become addicting!"

,, Remember, you are supposed to be angry and tough.

, Buttons with band names or punk slogans are good., Remember at all times, that you are angry. You don't like authority, cops, parents, bosses, whatever.


Do what the hell you want. Punk shows in the 80s were famous for anger. Remember, a 80's punk show is one where you can throw a beer bottle in the air and not care where it comes down.
Hang out with others like you. Nothing says punk like hanging out drinking a brew on a street corner with your fellow punks.

, In the 80s punks had the reputation of being a bit dumb or uneducated, mostly because they were young.


You, however, are more street smart and wiser about the ways of the world.
The 2000s are a less innocent time. So fight the stereotype of a dumb punk by reading up on your anarchist literature and quote Alan Watts at them until their heads spin. Haters gonna hate, but that doesn't mean you have to embrace the stereotype of the dumb punk.

, There is some chance you decide not to be a punk anymore, so you want to be able to go back., Listen to 80's punk especially the big four of hardcore punk: Dead Kennedys, Charged GBH, Bad Brains and Black Flag.

, You probably don't want it. It is best to get money from family or friends.


A career in music is a good one.
If you are an intellectual, you might want to be a philosopher or economist or similar. But you need to extreme/anti authority views to fit the image.
You can also work in a creative kind of job, like design.

, SF, LA and New York are all good. Of course they are hard to pay for, but if you live in a warehouse it is cheaper. You can also live in Oakland, Brooklyn and so on.

, It is a great way to get more into the lifestyle and make more punk friends.

Color sprays are out there too if your parents aren't too keen on you dying your whole mop an unnatural color. You can also try clip-in extensions in wild colors then do a crazy haircut or try a crazy hair style. Asymmetry, choppy, messy layers, or short and crazy are good. Try some different products for more body or less body, such as mousse or hairspray, or to create spikes, use Elmer's glue. It does come out. Egg whites can be utilized for the sharpest of mohawks. So cut some cute bangs, add some extensions in a fun color, and play around with lengths. With stricter parents, try coloring just the very ends of your hair.;
, Joan Jett's makeup is plenty punk. Neon eyeshadow, like blush red, deep blue, or even a simple gray are good colors to try. Try a little lipstick, whatever color you like. Black nails are pretty rad too. White are even more out there.

, All of these should be customized to your style and appearance, down to bleaching denim or darkening a wash, and adding any kind of appendage you think is cool and will give you some punk credibility. Ripped jeans, light or dark, are a staple. Especially if they are fitted, cuffed, or just ripped on the knees. Other ways you can dress punk are leather pants, band shirts, vinyl pants, rubber clothing, plaid skirts, tank tops with or without the sleeves ripped off.

, The Sex Pistols are a basic punk band almost every punk likes. The Ramones and The Dead Kennedys are both great punk bands, and The Clash are too. Others include Danzig, Joan Jett, The Distillers, Bad Religion, and The Dropkick Murphys. Find out who Johnny Thunders is. Look up Stiv Bators. Learn something. Blast it! See show flyers out and about but you can't go? Decorate your room and binders with said flyers. You'll get to go soon, 16 and over is right around the corner.

, Those are really punk. Sneakers are good too, but choose Converse or Vans for this. Punk has many different styles. Study them. ""Brothel"" creepers, motorcycle boots, even some fun low heels. Punk included the 80's too.

Be yourself.,
Be open-minded.,
Go to shows!,
Check out some out-of-town shows.,
Start your music collection.,
Get involved.,
Start a band.,
Speak your mind!,
Read, write, and learn!",How to Be a Punk Rock Girl," There are so many young kids out there today that just see a scene as a cool way to dress or to rebel against their parents. You don't have to dress, act or think a certain way to be punk. That's the beauty of being punk. It's not about the superficial- it's a line of thinking, it's a way of life.;
, Don't be prejudiced. Open up your heart and mind to the things that are ""outside your box."" Experience new things and ideas. Punks usually stick together because they have been outcast in some way or another from ""normal, cookie-cutter"" society. Not all punks stick together, so just hang out with whoever you like. Don't close people out of your life for their views, politics, style, race, religion, sex, sexual preference or anything like that. Talk to different people, learn, debate. Expand yourself.

, No matter what city or town you live in, there are shows. Your local bands might not be great, but pay the cover and support their efforts. It's what punk is all about. Rock out with your friends and have a good time. Respect the venues that you go to. More than likely, it's people just like you taking money out of their pockets to put on a show, so have a good time, but be respectful. Lots of venues shut down because people don't know how to act and be respectful.

, Larger metropolitan areas usually have shows all the time with larger touring bands. Check out bands' websites, blogs and social networking profiles (e.g. Myspace) to see when they'll be in your area or close to your area.

, Punk is more than looking punk. There's no point in us listing bands here because the genre is so large, with many subgenres. You can find a niche to suit your tastes. Plus, if there's one thing punks love to do, it's nitpick and argue over what is and isn't punk. Check out the punk tag on last.fm or another music site for a very rough guide (although sometimes people like to mess about with the tags so be careful), look up some punk bands on wikipedia and follow links, or JFGI. Finding stuff out for yourself is the most punk thing of all. If you're here you probably already know and like one or two punk bands, so start looking for bands related to them. Older punks never had the internet, so take advantage of it as a really quick way to research and hear music.

, Make flyers for bands or help distribute them. See if you can help at shows by working the door or helping to clean up. Or even better, you could...

, This isn't essential, but people seem to assume that playing an instrument is part of being punk for a guy, but not for a girl. If you want to though, why not? Punk was originally about stripping rock music back down to basics, with no pretensions, and many punk bands valued passion and fun over skill. So you don't have to practice for years in your bedroom before having a fun jam with your friends. If you want to do more advanced stuff, having a 3-chord band will still help as you learn quicker by playing with other people, and you will meet more people through your band who can help you improve (and to form your next band with!). You'll be in great company- many female punk musicians got their start in the more open atmosphere of early punk scenes. Some people might criticize your skills at first, but those people are the type who take things too seriously.

, Protest the wrongs of your governments! Protest the media! Protest commercialism! Make a difference! Or conversely, be totally apathetic and nihilistic, and make fun of political types who think they can change anything. There are two sides of the coin on this one, as there are on most things within the punk community.

, Reading is an awesome way to, not only become more intelligent, but a great way to break people's stereotypes of Punks.

Get to know the tunes.,
Get the right look.,
Get involved in the local rock and roll scene where you live!,
Be confident and have the right attitude!",How to Be Glam Punk," Obviously, the most important part of this subculture is the music it's based around. Glam punk is a contemporary style of rock and roll with deep roots in several older musical movements, mostly from the 1970s and 80s. The music of all of these bands, as well as their fashion sense and general attitude, should give you a good feel for what glam punk is all about. It also wouldn't hurt to check out some first-wave (1977-1982) punk rock, 70s glam rock (David Bowie or T.Rex, for example) and even some 1980s 'hair metal' (Motley Crue, Twisted Sister, etc). There are countless other bands to discover, of course, but consider these a primer:


The Heart Attacks
Wildlife
Beat! Beat! Beat!
Biters
The Exploding Hearts
Prima Donna
Ravagers
Rock City Angels
Michael Monroe
M.O.T.O.
Dino's Boys
Cyanide Pills
The Soda Pop Kids
The Cute Lepers;
, Glam punk fashion is all about being wild and flamboyant while still maintaining a cool, put-together rock and roll style. If you like what you hear, and you'd like to start dressing to reflect your interest in glam punk, here are a few pointers:


A good place to start is to look at a few prominent musicians in the genre and take note of their style. Nikki Sixx (of Motley Crue), Tuk Smith (of the Biters), and Michael Monroe are all good examples.
Clothing tends to be tight or at least fitted--small sizes and stretchy material that hugs the contours of your body and shows few creases.
Glam punk style takes a lot of cues from classic rock and roll fashion; Leather biker jackets, motorcycle or cowboy boots, western shirts, drainpipe jeans, you get the idea.
Punk rock fashion standbys are also popular: Converse All-Star sneakers, studded belts, animal prints and vibrant colors.
Denim jackets or vests, usually decorated with a few buttons and embroidered patches, are a consistent element of the style.
Band merchandise, like t-shirts, pins, and patches, are a must.
Accessories help compliment the look--bandanas, chains, studded bracelets and other jewelry, etc.
Many hairstyles fall into glam punk fashion, from simple do's like short, spiky blowouts and big, teased-up 80s hair to more complicated styles like Nikki Sixx's signature cut or the classic 70s shag worn by the likes of David Bowie and Cherie Currie. Facial hair of any kind is rarely seen; most practitioners of the style are clean-shaven.
Elements of androgyny, such as makeup and nail polish (regardless of your gender) are common, but not mandatory. This was popular with glam bands in the 70s and 80s, and it's often part of modern glam punk fashion.

, Start going to shows and meeting new people; check out zines and blogs and find out about bands in your area. If your town doesn't have much of a rock and roll community, get one started! Learn to play an instrument, start a band, start a zine, get people interested! You'd be surprised how many people you'll find that are as into the music and culture of glam punk just as much as you are.

, There will always be people, even in other alternative subcultures, who want to ridicule you for the way you dress or the music you're into. Ignore them, strut your stuff and do your thing, even if you're the only one doing it! Eventually the naysayers will either realize how cool you are, or get bored and leave you alone. You've got better things to do than worry about other people's opinions!

Have the state of mind.,
Find your scene.,
Avoid consumerism.",How to Be a Punk1," Punk means resisting tyranny in any form and making your own decisions and own ways without what others say. It's associated with rebellion and anti-establishment.


Read up on classic punk topics like resisting tyranny, DIY, rebellion, anti-authoritarianism anarchism and violence. The more you know, the more easily you'll be able to express yourself.
Find interesting ways to express what you know and why you think it's important. There is a difference between complaining about authority figures and being against the structure that allows for authority in the first place.
Talk to like-minded people and different-minded people. You need to talk to both to really get comfortable with your own perspective. Also, if you're only talking to like-minded people, how will you deliver your radical message to those that need it most?;
, Get to know other people who have the same beliefs. This way you'll feel comfortable exploring your punk side without judgement or conflict from squares.


Go to some punk concerts. Some venues put up posters - check your local telephone poles.
If you have an Instagram account, set it up with a punk or heavy metal theme. That way you can get more friends who are punks, even if you don't know them.
Be unapologetically you. If you're autistic, stim in public. If you're LGBT, wear your colors loudly and proudly.
Choose a punk music scene. It doesn't matter what music they do. Either punk rock or hardcore punk or Oi!
Choose a regional punk scene you're affiliated with, such as The Detroit Scene, The California punk scene or the Boston music scene.
Figure out where punks in your area meet, be it a specific corner or landmark. Punks usually don't meet at establishments unless it's for the sake of music - they try to use public space as much as possible.
If all else fails, ask another punk on the street when the next gig is.
Don't be afraid to admit that you're new to all of this. Everyone was new once, and they will probably understand. If you are friendly, people will like you whether or not you know every punk band on earth and have all the typical clothes.
Join a punk online community. Here, you can meet other punks world wide, trade MP3s, find shows or discover new bands.
If you choose your favorite regional scene, you have do some research.

, Punks are very resourceful. Find new ways to enjoy yourself without giving your money to big corporations.


Enjoy the outdoors, be it hiking a mountain or enjoying the park with your friends.
Make or join a community garden. You can grow vegetables and cool plants and you won't have to buy them from any establishments
Learn to cook. Not only is it an enjoyable way to spend your time but it also saves money - more for you, less for the establishment. Negative Approach vocalist John Brannon doesn't only earn his music career, but he got another job as a chef.
Find free events through friends, the websites of venues you like or using local event forums.
Get crafty. For each item you craft, you haven't supported a store that sells a similar manufactured version.
Visit the mall or a big-box store only when necessity demands it. Even things like furniture can be found for free with sites like craigslist.org and freecycle.org. If you must buy something, try to find it used first. It'll be cheaper for you and a little more anti-establishment.

"
"
Express your attitude through your clothing.,
Start out with some punk staples.,
Customize some of the shirts or jackets you buy.,
Find punk footwear.,
Get the hairstyle.,
Get some piercings and tattoos.,
Be patient with your style.",How to Be a Punk2," Punk clothing is iconic because it captures a a unique sense of rebellion and individualism. Let that anti-establishment attitude show in your outfits.


Punks are known for being unique - don't let yourself worry that you don't look like punk. Wear what you want, make sure its relatively alternative, and you'll fit in with any punk crowd.
Make your own clothes if possible. Invest in a sewing machine. This way you can create truly unique looks without supporting the establishment.
DIY (do it yourself). A lot of punk clothing has a DIY look to it. For a punk, it's always better to remake something old than support consumerism and buy something new.

, If you're at a loss on how to build a punk wardrobe, here are some items to consider:


Skinny jeans or cargo jeans
Black leather jackets or denim vests
Studded or spiked clothing and bracelets
Safety pins
Pin-on buttons (side note: use tape if you put them on backpacks, or they may fall off)
Mostly black clothes
Tartan, camouflage, animal print and blood stains.
Ripped clothing held together with safety pins
Band T-shirts
Punk band patches
Black shirts
Spiky hair, Mohawks or dyed hair
Leather (or pleather) jackets with band patches, safety pins, or painted-on details such as an anarchy symbol.
Bondage pants, or pants with added embellishments such as zippers going up the back of the legs, chains, metal rings, or other add-ons.
Bullet belts
Fishnets
Classic accessories can include arm warmers, studded belts, bullet belts, and wristbands with pyramid studs, stars or spikes.

, This is similar to remaking, but with an eye for little touches that express your unique viewpoints. Maybe by cutting off the sleeves, sewing political patches on, or just cutting the neckline, or back differently – these are all things that the traditional person wouldn't dare try - especially not for aesthetic effect.


Rip or cut out a section of clothing, and replace it with a row of safety pins holding the fabric together, or expose your layers.
Stencil band names or symbols onto your clothes yourself.
Sew some patches on your jacket.
Distress your own denim. Use scissors or an x-acto knife to make cuts, or run sandpaper over the fabric to make it look worn out.
Strategically drip bleach onto jeans or T-shirts to make interesting patterns, or make them look more worn-in.

, Consider that you may be walking more given your punk lifestyle, since its pretty common that punks ditch private transport whenever possible. You need a sturdy, long lasting pair of shoes, or two, but you need to obtain them in an a-traditional way.


Boots - for men and women. Boots are often dark and are usually the best choice: they last a long time, you can find them on the cheap and the aesthetic works with the rest of your clothes.
Stay away from shoe brands. Because commercialism and materialism are frowned upon by punks, a lot of them choose to buy boots from the army surplus store.
Common punk shoes include black boots, Dr. Martens, Converse and some skate shoes like Draven and T.U.Ks. Note that because these are owned by corporations, some punks refuse to buy from them despite the aesthetic and you may run into people who disagree with your shoe choice.
Thrift stores are a good place to buy cheap shoes and boots, and then you don't have to think about whether your money is going to a multinational corporation.

, Spike it up, or even put it in a mohawk. You can also dye it.


Both males and females can sport a mohawk, and (though a primarily 'guy' hairstyle) some girls can pull off a Devilock nicely. Research the different kinds and think about what best expresses you. You might want a fanned Mohawk, Bihawk, Trihawk, ""bitch"" handles, or even liberty spikes.
If you're worried about fitting into a conservative work situation, there's always the ""Fauxhawk"" (a wider strip of stand up hair that can be combed down to hide the shaved sides of your head). Be warned, though, his style is sometimes frowned upon by other punks since the look can adapt to the mainstream world so well.
Although it is most common for punks to have hair no longer than chin length, long hair is acceptable if you want to be a punk. Remember: It's about breaking away from expectations and ""The Norm""
Having random things - such as beads, ribbons and ties - in your hair also makes you stand out if that's what you're going for.
There has also been a variety of 80s haircuts and even dreadlocks that have made appearances in punk subculture. Dreadlocks are often frowned upon by punks if they are on a white person because this can be considered cultural appropriation. Racism is NOT Punk.
Consider dying your hair. You could go jet black, platinum blonde, bright red, or some unnatural color like green or blue. Whatever you choose, be prepared to stick with it for awhile (or try a temporary dye first).
If you don't want to hassle with complicated hairstyles, shave your head. This is a huge message to others: you don't need to do what others do! A shaved head has always been a classic punk look, and can be used for both men and women.

, Body modification is another outlet that punks use to identify themselves.


You will see many punks with their ears gauged with rings, often to quite large sizes.
Septum and lip piercings can be used for any gender.
With tattoos, you will see a wide variety of images. A lot of punks sport their favorite band logos, or have spiderwebs on their elbows (please be aware that in the UK at least, spiderwebs on the elbow signify that you have been in prison). Straightedge punks sometimes have X's on each fist. Old-school-style tattoos (Sailor Jerry, for example) are also very popular, especially for chest pieces and sleeves.
Just remember whatever tattoo you choose, it will be there forever! Make sure that you choose something that reflects your personality, not just a current band that you like!

, Many people will tell you to avoid going from preppy to punk in one step, or that it's best if you ease into being punk or you may appear like a poser. This is kind of true, but there is no way to go from not punk to punk overnight. You can't buy knowledge of punk music and you can't get an entire punk wardrobe without searching hard. Go to shows, introduce yourself to other punks, and gradually your style will develop from there.

Go to punk shows to see bands live whenever you can.,
Familiarize yourself with the music, new and old.,
Try some genres of punk:


Punk rock - Overall, it is loud hard rock music with electric guitars playing power chords, energetic drum beats, heavy bass and began in the movement of rebellion, DIY and anti-establishment.,

, There are many different types of Punk music, and it is important to remember that not every punk listens to every band here.

Emo - A type of music derived from punk/alternative with melody and emotional lyrics. Originally it was short for emotive hardcore, and was influenced by hardcore punk and post-hardcore. It later got reinvented for a non-punk sound and for an alternative/indie/poppy sound. At first it was bands like Rites of Spring, The Hated and Embrace. Later, it became Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Jimmy Eat World, the Get Up Kids, American Football and Drive Like Jehu. Now, it is bands like Senses Fail, My Chemical Romance, From First to Last, Snowing, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Thursday, Paramore,Saves the Day,Modern Baseball,Dashboard Confessional and the Used.

Not always as fast paced as a lot of punk genres, and has more of a saddened tone to the lyrics. The Pogues popularized the genre in the late 80's but even still it is viewed as an underground sub-genre. Some great groups include, Andrew Jackson Jihad, Wingnut Dishwasher's Union, Johnny Hobo and The Freight Trains, Ramshackle Glory, Mantits, Neutral Milk Hotel and Charles Manson.
Nu Metal - Heavy metal style with either screaming, singing or rapping vocals. Bands who are in involved are Slipknot (early), Korn, and Molotov (although they do rap metal)

Dress the part.,

Know the music.,

Always stand up for what you believe in.,
Get punk princess hair.,

Wear punk princess makeup.,

Keep an awesome attitude.,

Be a good school girl.,

Keep your hygiene up.,

Wear the following accessories, they are essential: spike bracelets, checkerboard belts and spike belts, plastic bracelets that stretch, one earring, a safety pin, or a few ear piercings if allowed.,

Have confidence.",How to Be a Punk Princess at School," Don't go into school one day with Doc-Martens and think you're cool. You really should invest in this kind of thing. It is recommended that you stock up on skinny jeans. You should also make sure to own a number of graphic tees that says stupid stuff. You can also make your own t-shirts, it's easy. Doc-Martens are good with certain outfits but you should own some Vans and Converse, too! Avoid bright colored jeans, that's Scence, not punk princess. Be creative. Own a few band tees as well. You don't have to wear black, but the traditional punk princess is always spotted dressed in black.
, To be a punk princess, you need to go way back. The bands that you listen to shouldn't be just new or popular ones. Listen to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Write Bad Reputation Nation on your notebook. A few bands you should know are: The Rolling Stones, who are rock and very popular, The Beatles, who are pop and arguably the most popular pop group ever, Kiss, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and of course the rock band Aerosmith. You should know these bands as well as the new ones that are popular today., If you don't think something is right, don't stick with it. Don't yell at your teacher and slap her, then walk out the classroom. You should stand up for your rights, that's all., There are a wide range of hairstyles you should get. Mohawks are good for anyone. You can get layers and just poof your hair. However, it shouldn't be too poofy, because then you'll look like a Scene kid. Check out the mullet hairstyle for girls. Kirsten Stewart's or any of Toyah Willcox's styles from the 80s are perfect examples.

, It is recommended that if you're pale, just stick with black eyeliner and black eyeshadow. Go bolder and maybe try some orange or something on your eye lids if you wish., You may be a punk princess in training, but you may not perfect your punk princess rebel attitude for a few years. The rebel attitude takes time. Still be nice, but sort of rebellious at the same time., Your grades shouldn't change. Don't start letting your grades slip because that's what you think ""punks do"". Punks are smart, but again, they are rebellious. They never give in too easily, but they are also less stubborn., Take regular baths, keep your face clean, and of course, wear deodorant., For the modern punk princess look, these are important., Don't care what anyone thinks. It's all about you."

Determine why you want to become a Goth.,
Know that there isn't only one type of Goth.,
Music is key.,
Get the look.,
Last but not least, get the attitude!",How to Be a Simple Goth," Is it because you like the music or the fashion? Do you adore the style of Siouxsie Sioux or Vampires? This may help to determine what kind of goth you are aiming for.;
, Did you ever look around and notice that not every Goth dresses the same or listens to the same music? Have you ever seen Goths wearing lace or velvet gowns with long gloves and a parasol? This is the look of the Victorian and Romantic goths. If you ever saw a goth decked in Death hawks and combat boots, which mostly resembles DIY (do it yourself) clothes, you may be looking at a death rocker. Some Goths even wear bright neon colors (shocking, right?) with spandex, goggles, and bright crazy hair. This would be a Cyber Goth, or a Goth from the future, in other terms.

, Music is a must. Learn the music and how it influenced many Goths (and yourself). Some good bands to start you off are Siouxsie And The Banshees, The Cure, and Bauhaus. These are the basics, which most Goths tend to listen to a lot. They also know a lot about the song lyrics, meanings, and history of the band. Don't forget to learn the band members' names too! This is important if you ever strike up a conversation with another Goth. Nothing is worse than ending up tongue-tied when talking to a Goth. That gets you the Poser for life reward (CONGRATULATIONS!).

, Like I said, you want a semi-goth look without being totally Goth. To get a Goth look that isn't too drastic, shop at thrift stores and stores like Target and Kohls. Simply buy a pair of combat boots (like Dr. Martens) and pair them with black or blue jeans (beware skinny jeans and skater shoes like Vans or Chucks) and a band tee you made yourself or bought at a concert offline. As far as hair goes, get your hair dyed black or leave it natural, even if it is blonde! Go to places like Claire's Accessories or Spencer's Gifts and look for clip-in hair extensions, or go to any beauty supply store and buy Manic Panic or Beyond The Zone hair dye. Even temporary hair dye works good too! As far as accessories go, simple black or red or purple or whatever color you want rubber bracelets or a pendant necklace with a bat, cross, or even just a long black beaded necklace. Piercings of the ears are great: just avoid piercings in the face. Maybe pierce the nose, if you want. Have fun and don't copy! Be yourself! Be original and creative. Have fun!

, You may think that all Goths do are sit around and cry and cut themselves. This is a stereotype, and to avoid being called a poser, listen to music and crack jokes.When someone makes you mad, just walk away.Smile and be happy!

Listen to the music.,
Dress the part.,
Research the early days of Goth.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl1," It is said that the Goth subculture was born in the 80s; regardless, early Goth style was inseparable from Goth music. As such, a Traditional Goth will venerate the earliest Goth bands: Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Birthday Party, The Sisters of Mercy, and anything played in the infamous Bat-Cave club. Other influential bands (e.g. The Velvet Underground) may also be revered as minor deities.;
, Traditional Goth fashion recreates the looks of the earliest Goths. In the beginning, Goth was heavily influenced by Punk: it includes fishnets, leather jackets, piercings, heavy makeup, and the occasional bondage gear. It also gained Punk's wide usage of the color black (and it usually has other dark colours, such as purple).

, Since Traditional Goth attempts to faithfully follow the early days of Goth, you should do research to make sure you're doing it justice.

"
"
Think dark, sensual, and mysterious.,
Be emotional, creative, and dreamy.,
One of the biggest influences on Gothic fashion has been the imagery in Gothic literature and their movie counterparts, particular that of Victorian writers such as Edgar Allen Poe and Bram Stoker.,
Convey an image of decorum and dignity.,
Indulge in activities that were popular in Victorian high society.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl2," While Traditional Goth's tend to be all about the 80's music scene, Romantic Goth's focus on the dark, sensual and mysterious world of Gothic created by Victorian literature and subsequent movies. In other words they’re probably more “Gothic” than “Goth,” if that makes sense. Identifying features are velvet and lace, flowy clothes (often Victorian or Medieval inspired), and a love of poetry and literature.

, It is unsurprising that Romantic Goth's are typically emotional, creative and dreamy types. Dead roses, crumbling graveyards and old skulls are things of exquisite beauty to these creatures. Preferred bands tend to be those that focus on “brooding” rather than “horror,” and so may include down tempo ethereal bands (eg. Love Spirals Downwards), and folk-ish bands (All About Eve, Faith and the Muse). The Sisters of Mercy and The Cure tend to go down well too. And of course a bit of atmospheric Classical music, especially Bach or Wagner.

, Victorian fashions like corsets, lace, frock coats and pale skin are popular throughout the scene, but maybe none wear them with as much style as the Victorian Goth.

, Clothes must be smart and, for many, historically accurate (corsets are to be worn beneath one’s garments, of course). Ball dress and mourning garb are particularly prominent in the scene.

, This includes theatre, masquerades, tea parties and poetry. And, naturally, any kind of Dickensian or other Victorian festival that gives them an excuse to parade around in costume (not that they need an excuse).

"
"
Dress like the Middle Ages.,
Have a good sense of history.,
Know the music.,
Focus on Medieval interests.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl3," “Gothic” is normally used to refer to castles, cathedrals and other such ancient masonry, hence the prominence of Goth's who have a particular interest in all things medieval. Dressing in garb (loosely) based on that of the medieval period, you may find these Goth's at Renaissance Fairs or re-enactment society events. Of course, their dress and activities do not have to necessarily be strictly “Medieval:” blending with Tudor or Celtic elements seems perfectly fine too.

, Medieval Goths may also be found in museums, castles, churches and ancient monuments, and when they go to cemeteries, they actually look at the names and dates on the gravestones. When they get married, they have medieval-themed weddings and live in a house filled with pre-Raphaelite prints and gargoyles.

, Medieval Goth music may comprise of classical and Gregorian chants combined with folk (Loreena McKennitt), ethereal (Faith and the Muse) and, of course, Medieval Baebes.

, Generally, all female Medieval Goths would secretly like to be Morgan-le-Fay from the Arthurian legends, and all male Medieval Goths have a fixation with swords.

Know a cyber goth's personality and traits.,
Be sure to understand why they are called goth.,
Dress the part.,
Know that other goths many despise you.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl4," Cyber Goths are truly the antithesis of all that is Goth. They like bright neon colours, worship futurism and technology, and listen to dance music that is as different from Gothic Rock as possible.

, So why are they called Goth's at all? It could be because the music scene gradually evolved from Industrial, Goth’s experimental electronic cousin. It could be that the lyrics of their preferred music genre (Electronic Body Music, or EBM, eg. VNV Nation) are generally too deep and too depressing for other dance fans. It could be because they have weird hair.

, Other people should easily be able to identify you as a cyber goth. Cyber goths are usually the most conspicuous ones in the club with their insane pony falls, goggles, futuristic rave-inspired clothing, towering New Rock platforms, and miscellaneous glowing bits and pieces., Despite being some of the most lively members of the scene, all other Goths seem to loathe this type. Especially the Industrial fans. However, it cannot be denied that the cyber scene is huge now, and is getting ever more popular."
"
Be kinky.,
Identify the music.,
Know your facts.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl5," Kinkiness has been a part of the Goth movement from the beginning since the first Goth musicians like Bauhaus started wearing chains, leather, fishnet and strap bondage gear on stage. Today the image (and lifestyle) remains popular, with modern Fetish Goths having an even wider range of sexy bondage-related clothes available to choose from. Tattoos, piercings and other forms of body modification are also popular among this type. And they quite possibly all have a set of handcuffs, mask/gag and some sort of spanking implement in their bedside table.

, Pretty much every Goth band has written a song about kinky sex at some point, so there’s no real preferential genre associated with Fetish Goths, although 80s New Wave (eg. Depeche Mode) and Industrial (eg. Throbbing Gristle) tend to be more fetish than most.

, As one might expect, the stereotypical Fetish Goth has tried everything at least once everywhere and in every position, with every gender. Or at least that’s what they’ll tell you.

"
"
Understand hippies and Hippie Goths.,
Be respectful to nature.,
Understand what music hippie goths listen to.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl6," In the world of Goth stereotypes, you get two sorts: those who think hippies are too optimistic for their own good, and those who are hippies. A relatively abundant species, stereotypical Hippie Goths are nature-loving, follow Paganism and/or Wicca and/or misc. New Age religions, and are into candles, crystals, incense, Tarot, and anything else that can be found at the local New Age shop. The only major difference between hippies and Hippie Goths is the prevalence of black and occult symbols.

, Like their hippie cousins, Hippie Goths are quite often vegetarian or vegan, and are dedicated eco warriors or animal rights activists. When not campaigning for world peace, however, they usually know how to have a lot of fun eating and drinking excessively and romping around in fields at midnight as part of “an ancient Celtic ritual.”

, When it comes to music, Hippie Goths may be found meditating to dark folk (eg. Faith and the Muse), ethereal (eg. Cocteau Twins) and Pagan rock (eg. Inkubus Sukkubus), in addition to regular folk and New Age. Older Hippie Goths may listen to Fields of the Nephilim, The Cult and the more psychedelic end of the 80s spectrum (eg. Tones on Tail).

Be quiet.,
Listen.,
Find the music.,
Determine your clothing style.,
Perfect the makeup.,
Fix your hair.,
Accessorize.,
Read.,
Be romantic.,
Find the beauty in the darkness.",How to Be a Romantic Goth," This does not mean that you should never talk. However, being loud and boisterous is not going to pass you off as emotional and romantic. Romantic Goths are often soft-spoken and thoughtful. Think before you speak. Is that comment necessary? Has that question already been answered? Will that statement lead to a proper conversation? Train your mind to ask these questions before you open your mouth and you’ll be surprised at how much quieter you’ll become.;
, This links in with being quiet. Make a conscious effort to listen to what’s being said to you. People say things for a reason, and you owe them the respect to listen. When someone is speaking to you, make eye contact. Nod your head and take in what they’re saying. Try to read their emotions and opinions.

, The music taste of Romantic Goths veers a little off the other styles, although all Goths listen to the classic Gothic Rock style (like Bauhaus, Sisters of Mercy, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees). Romantic Goths tend to listen to softer, deeper music. Look for things with meaningful lyrics and instruments. One very popular genre with Romantic Goths is classical music. You can also go for offbeat art rock, like Kate Bush. However, you don’t have to go by the rules. Anything deep and emotional or anything that is soft and dreamy is just as good.

, There are alternate looks you can choose from while being a Romantic Goth. Remember to wear the right colours. Perfect colours include; black, deep red, purple, occasionally green, all worn with black and other strong, dark colours. If you’re a boy, you can simply try to dress with this colour code. Dark, long sleeved shirts with collars are perfect, as well as long and dark, high-collared coats. Girls have wider options. Skirts and dresses are good. Skirts can be floor length and flowing, in the same colours. If you want something shorter, try wearing fishnets under them. They usually are only worn by more hardcore Goths, but if you are careful, you can pull off the romantic look. Dresses can be floor length and fancy, in either dark or soft colours. They can also be knee length. Old Victorian clothes and lots of lace also work well.

, Makeup for Romantic Goths isn’t very challenging. Romantic Goths don’t tend to wear much heavy makeup. If you’re a boy, dark eyeliner is fine or no makeup at all. For girls, try softening your skin with natural coloured blush or powder. Black eyeliner is a good option. If you want, you can draw patterns around your eyes-stars or swirls, or other designs. Try to keep them soft and veer away from harsher prints. If you decide to wear lipstick, red is always perfect. Experiment and find the right shades for you. Eye shadow is optional. If you want to wear it, try natural colours like pinks and bronzes or strong colours like purple or even soft red. If you want to make your face a little pale, dust it lightly with a white foundation for a finishing touch.

, Dark coloured hair usually works well for this style. If you’re a girl, the easiest option would be long, straight, black or dark coloured hair. You can also try dark shoulder length hair. Blunt fringes and bangs work well. Guys can simply have dark coloured hair and if desired, you can grow it a little longer so that it falls over the eyes. Your hair can be either dead straight or loose wavy. If you have black hair, you can team it up with brighter coloured streaks such as red, blue or purple. Make sure your hair always looks glossy and sleek.

, Accessories will complete the look and add a more sensual touch to any outfit. Essential accessories include:


Long, black or white gloves - these can be worn with long skirts or dresses.
Chokers - lacy or bejeweled chokers add a nice touch to any outfit.
Long necklaces - long gold necklaces go well with softer coloured dresses or shirts. Long silver chains with charms on them can accessorize a casual outfit.
Bracelets - Charm bracelets or silver/soft coloured bangles go well with casual or fancy outfits.
Rings - fancy old, big rings add a great touch to boys and girls on any outfit. Just don't go overboard.

, One thing Romantic Goths are famous for is their love of reading. They are great lovers of romance, romantic tragedies and classic favourites. If you’re willing, dive right in and experiment with reading classics. If you don’t think you can handle them, try reading romance, tragedy or even just dramas. Again, Romantic Goth literature is softer and dreamier than the other styles of Goth literature. If you’re looking for something a little heavier, try supernatural themes, or stories including characters such as Vampires and Werewolves. Some suggested titles and authors include:


Shakespeare - Although this will probably seem strange, Shakespeare is incredibly popular among Romantic Goths. His tragic dramas and romances fit well with this style of Goth.
Charlotte Brontë -Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre, while not being particularly gothic, is romantic, tragic and dramatic and, therefore, fulfills all of the qualities of a good Romantic Goth novel.
Edgar Allan Poe - A 19th-century poet, short story writer and literary critic, best known for his macabre tales, contributing greatly to the science fiction and horror genres
Emily Brontë -Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is sorrowful, tragic and romantic as well.
Anne Rice - Anne Rice is famous for her religious or gothic based novels.
You can also try reading poems if you find them easier. Poetry is widely popular among Romantic Goths.

, Although this step seems obvious, it takes a lot of work. If you’re obnoxious, loud and clumsy, you are going to find it hard to pass off as a Romantic Goth. Try to appreciate the beauty of life and everything around you. Think outside the box and spread your love to the people who surround you. Surprise your partner with a candlelit bath or dinner, with soft dark music or take a moonlight stroll. It is not hard to find the romance in everyday life. It’s already there - you just have to open your eyes.

, One of the major talents that Romantic Goths possess is that they are able to find the magic and the beauty in gothic styles and darkness. Goths are often mistaken for creepy and at times you may find yourself thinking the same thing. But there are many hidden beauties in the gothic culture. Listen to the lyrics and feel the words in obscure songs and writings - feel the emotion. Open your mind.

Know your information about Japanese goth.,
Know what music J-Goths prefer.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl7," Japanese “Goth” should probably not be called “Goth” at all. Although the fashions sported by the alternative crowd in Harajuku (Tokyo’s equivalent of Camden) were largely inspired by the Western Goth movement, J-Goths tend to enter this subculture via different roots: either anime “cosplay” (dressing up as your favourite anime character) or through Japan’s own alternative music scene: Visual Kei, often thought to be started by the Japanese rock band X-Japan.

, Visual Kei bands vary hugely in sound. They can either take the form of heavy metal (eg. Dir~en~Grey) or something more like cheesy Euro-pop (L’Arc~en~Ciel, Malice Mizer). What’s important, however, is the band’s look, which takes Goth, Punk and Glam elements and blends it all into a unique, androgynous combination. Very often, these mostly all-male bands will attempt to look as feminine as possible (to the point of dressing in drag).


This style has recently come full circle, with Westerners now borrowing fashion elements from the Japanese. The most popular and distinctive of these is undoubtedly the “Gothic Lolita” look (a kind of cross between Goth, Victorian fashions, Alice in Wonderland and French maid), which has now become a part of the Western Gothic spectrum.

"
"
Rivet Heads, or Industrial Goths, often do not consider themselves “Goths,” although their preferred music and fashion can be found in the same shops and they’ll happily go to Goth clubs.,
However, in the modern era the Industrial scene has come to resemble a dark, rough, dystopian version of the Cyber scene.,
Industrial fashion is somewhat like Cyber in its futuristic appearance but is generally more monochrome, less polished and often has a military influence.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl8," The scene all started with the band Throbbing Gristle forming their own label, Industrial Records, for a new genre of extremely weird experimental electronic music. For some Rivet Heads, this is the only “real” Industrial music - bands like SPK and The Leather Nun which spawned from this scene of the early 80s.

, The modern Rivethead may listen to Darkwave bands resembling a heavier form of EBM (Wumpscut, Skinny Puppy), or even the commercial “Industrial Metal” bands (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, KMFDM).

, It is also undeniable that Sc-Fi movies such as The Matrix have inspired the look of many Rivet Heads - a lot of them will refuse to remove their trenchcoats even in the sweatiest clubs.

"
"
These creatures are regarded by some as the “missing link” between Punk and Goth, hence their extremely similar appearance and musical tastes to the Trad Goths.,
Most easily recognised by their layers upon layers of ripped fishnets, band logos and enormous hair, Deathrockers listen not only to the 80s Goth Rock classics (Christian Death, Specimen and Alien Sex Fiend being notable examples), but also a new breed of crazed artists such as Cinema Strange and Tragic Black, as well as other genres such as Horror Punk and Psychobilly.,Deathrockers may also be characterised by their love of old horror movies (the cheesier the better), and very often, a good (if slightly twisted) sense of humour.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl9," However, while the Trad Goths tend to believe that Goth is dead, the Deathrockers see that Goth is still alive and twitching, in a suitably zombified form.

, As long as it’s mad, bad and features zombies / bats / death, it’s all good.

"
Spooky kids, Kindergoths, Mansonites, Mallgoths...these pre-teen or early-teen types are known by many names, most of which are derogatory.,
It is true that, while Baby Bats often consider themselves “Goth,” they show quite a number of differences from members of the original scene; they tend to show a preference for metal (Marilyn Mansion and HIM being typical “Baby Bat” music), wear clothes that reflect metal/skater fashion, and tend to go for a “shocking” rather than “aesthetic” appearance.

,
As the older Goth's are painfully aware, the media also considers these kids to be “Goth.” While this can be annoying for Goth's who do not want to be associated with the Baby Bats (particularly the ones who are in it for shock value), one must remember that it was the media in the first place who popularized the term “Goth” to describe the original music scene.,
Very frequently, Baby Bats will start to grow more “sophisticated” in their clothes and music tastes, and become some of the most passionate members of the Goth community.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl10," They are often regarded with scorn and contempt by older members of the Goth community. Their crimes? Generally, not being old enough to remember the 80's, not being rich enough to afford a “proper Goth” wardrobe, and not being wise enough to know the “right” music to listen to or the “right” amount of make-up to wear.

,, So how we define what is and what is not Goth is very difficult these days.

, For this reason too, they are to be respected, not shunned."
"
Where metalheads fit in the Gothic spectrum is an incredibly complicated issue, and a controversial one.,
But on the other hand, the two groups do have enough similarities (particularly in a tendency to wear black and a love of things dark and spooky) for the two groups to mix, and more and more these days one will find crossovers in fashion and music.,
Moreover, there are a number of Metal genres and bands that both sides can be found listening to, including the so-called “Gothic” or “Doom” metal genre (Type O Negative, Theatre of Tragedy) or bands that use Gothic imagery (Night wish, Lacuna Coil), and arguably sound more “Gothic” than the original Goth bands.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl11," On the one hand, many Goth's (and Metal heads) point out that the two subcultures are separate entities, having different origins and music tastes, and other disparities in clothing and habits, and that the common confusion between the two is merely the fault of an uninformed public.

, Clubs that play both metal and Goth music are certainly not uncommon., Not to mention the confusion the “Industrial Metal” genre (Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein) puts on the issue. It all ultimately depends on one’s definition of “Goth,” and whether it is sound, image or behavior that determines the subculture.

"
"
Essentially, all Goth's are Geeks.,
The typical Geek Goth tends to place less emphasis on Goth as a fashion, and more on its overtones of dark fantasy.,
Geek Goth 's are some of the most intelligent, creative and open-minded Goths you’ll meet.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl12," After all, how can one devote so much time into dressing up, reading old literature and collecting obscure music without being somewhat Geeky? You will hence find typical Geek traits in all Goth's, but some will be more Geek-y than others.

, So while they may not look as spectacularly Gothic as other Goth Types, their knowledge of the symbolism and artistic influences behind Goth is very often superior. They are more inclined than most to indulge in role play, read science-fiction, fantasy and horror novels, and watch cult TV shows and films with Gothic appeal. Geek Goth's are also more likely to be into computer games and anime than other Goths. You are far more likely to find them in Forbidden Planet than in a goth club., Fittingly, they frequently have diverse and eclectic taste in music, although they may be more attracted to bands who regularly sing about Lord of the Rings, Cthulhu or other subjects with a high Geek interest.

Have faith.,
Find some Christian goth bands.,
Stand firm.People may call you fake or a total nut for a Christian.,
Don't go boasting about your new skull shirt.,
Reject the devil.,
Read the Bible.,
Jesus is Gothier than us, Remember, Jesus was a social reject.,
Prepare to be questioned!,
Ditch the make up at church if it's too shocking, or else the beloved priests will shove their crucifixes to your chest and this happens!

,
Accept the darkness.,
Know about Gothic Christianity.,
Clothing is an essential element!,
Know the difference of being a Christian Goth and a Goth with a Christian religion.,
Obey God.",How to Be a Christian Goth," Nobody wants someone claiming to be a Christian Goth and not knowing anything about patience in faith! All the more, those in the other subcultures or the norm will accept you.;
, Saviour Machine is a good band to listen to..... Considering the lyrics are great and so are the messages. A few Unblack Metal bands work, too! There are so many Christian bands out there and Antestor is great though it is not near to the Goth type.

, To counter this, narrate to them Jesus' calling for All of Us. They're hypocrites and not you.

, Though skulls are okay, for as long as they are not horned or winged. Christian Goths wear black, but with stronger appeal to CATHOLICISM. Crucifixes are a must!

, Remember, he wanted your Daddy and your brother dead, you'd be dumb if you let the devil be.

, It's a good start. Read and learn about God's wonders and remember to accept the darkness as well.

, He was spat on and mocked in spite of his cleanliness. The Goths encounter the same thing, and most especially, so did Christian Goths! Jesus made morbid symbolism to express himself. Cutting your evil arm, taking out your pervert eye, destruction of the temple, etc. They have a dark feel in them yet a cleaner message.

, Goths are often asked from or looked down, but Christian Goths get a more hectic life! Satanism? Witchcraft? Those things don't go near the Goth subculture. For the Metalheads and Shock rockers, Devil worship gets its chance on them. If someone calls you a freak, smile and tell them to look at themselves in the mirror with their common sins written on it with black lipstick. Though Christian Goths are forgiving and patient, we get to be angry, too!

,, Darkness is not evil! Remember, Jesus was born at nighttime! Stereotypes question you in your face about this, so keep your cool and answer politely.

, Learn about its history, objective and contribute to its cause.

, The DIY is still at work and so is black. Shirts with cross designs and Anti-satanic designs work for outrageous Christian guys. Victorian dresses work good for girls especially with a cross necklace. Boots are okay and so are usual Goth clothes.

, Deathrockers can be Christians, too! Religion goes first before any stereotype! Christian Goths bring their inner goodness to their dark appearances.

, He's our Father, Master and Creator. You are a Christian before a Goth.

Start with the music.,
Many goths love books, so go to your library and pick out a few.,
Your hair can be almost any color.,
You can have your hair cut in many different styles.,
For a basic unisex Gothic outfit, try a black t-shirt, a black, white or grey sweater, black jeans, and black boots.,
For makeup, try black or dark blue eyeliner or eye shadow.,
Find your inner darkness.",How to Be a Goth (10 and Older)," Some good starter goth bands are The Cure, Bauhaus and The Sisters of Mercy. But listen to whatever music you like, and don't listen to a band just because they're Gothic.;
, Edgar Allan Poe's poetry and short stories are a good start.

, Some good colors to dye your hair would be black, dark brown, light blond, orange, or dark purple. Or just leave it natural.

, For girls, you could get some blunt-cut bangs or just leave it all long. You could get a short pixie cut or a bob as well. For guys, try either longer hair or very short hair.

, For warmer weather, a band t-shirt, black shorts and riding boots. The basic colors are black, white, grey, purple, red and dark blue. Girls can wear dresses, tank tops and skirts in any of these colors.

, Apply it in a circle around each eye. Use a little light-colored foundation and lip balm. That goes for both guys and girls. If you aren't allowed or are unable to wear makeup, don't worry about it. Just going natural is fine.

, Indulge in subjects like music, magic and religion. Be a little shy. Pay attention to your emotions.

What do you get if you mix Elvis Presley, The Cramps, a bunch of old horror movies and a splash of lounge?,
With styles originating from “Rockabilly” (American 1950s rock n roll) and “Psychobilly” (1980s punk with a heavy rockabilly influence), Gothabilly is visually and musically a play on retro, kitsch aesthetics - but with a dark twist.,Gothabillys tend to be some of the brighter Goth's out there, with their vivid tattoos, cherry accessories and ubiquitous polka dot clothes.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl13," Bizarrely, you get Gothabilly - a rare and exotic breed of Goth with rather eclectic tastes in both music and wardrobe.

, Like Deathrock, which often shows many overlapping traits with Gothabilly, the music and imagery is frequently tongue-in-cheek and deliberately cheesy. As such, many Gothabilly bands sport such creative names as Nacho Knoche & The Hillbilly Zombies, Cult Of The Psychic Foetus, and Vampire Beach Babes.

The sexy, extravagant world of cabaret and burlesque is a natural partner for Goth; indeed, corsets, garters and black suits have been a Goth staple for many years.,
The look, feel and sound of Cabaret Goth is typified by the Dresden Dolls, although there are many other bands and artists who have toyed with burlesque imagery and music: Siouxsie and the Banshees, Voltaire, Sex Gang Children and the infamous Tiger Lillies, to name but a few.,
Enthusiasts insist that true cabaret and burlesque must be as classy as it is sexy; a skill at which Goths excel above most others.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl14," Hence, the birth of “Dark Cabaret” was perhaps a natural inevitability.

, Even “goth” metal artist Marylin Manson has flirted with burlesque (quite literally, if we count Dita Von Teese).

, Female Cabaret Goth's beautifully combine corsets, lace and feathers with high heels, garters and tassels. The men? Well, they often resemble peculiar cross between Dracula, Charlie Chaplin and a mime: but they have a style and class that is all their own.

The antiquated, refined elegance of Victorian Goth and the rough, edgy futurism of Rivetheads may seem a completely incompatible combination.,
Steampunk is, in essence, science fiction that takes place the low-technology setting of the past (very often the Victorian era).,
Steampunk Goth fashion is highly creative, incorporating elements that evoke Victorian technology such as clocks, keys and cogs.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl15," But, thanks to a particular genre of fantasy, the two have been successfully wedded to create the Steam punk Goth.

, In Steam punk, you may find steam-powered robots, clockwork computers and complex contraptions made from wood, brass and wheels. The merging of Victorian imagery with quirky technology is doubtlessly of huge appeal to many Goths, but perhaps the most important links between Steam punk and Goth culture are the Victorian writers who inspired the genre, including Mary Shelley and Edgar Allen Poe., Although Steam punk is not a music scene, acts such as Rasputina, Emilie Autumn and Abney Park have all been cited as having Steampunk appeal."
"
In the past, “Tribal” Goth was a vague, rarely used label for Goths who flirted with primitivism - bone jewellery, dreadlocks, beads, braids, heavy body modification and anything else “ethnic.” In a way, this Goth is perhaps closest to the original Goths - the Visigoth tribe - from which we get the scene name.,
When Turkish and Egyptian bellydance became popular in the USA, a new style - “tribal” - developed.,
Modern Tribal Gothic blends traditional bellydance clothes and accessories with Gothic motifs.",How to Be a Beautiful Goth Girl16," However, in recent years, “Tribal” Goth more often refers to a highly specialised and distinctive Goth type - the Gothic Belly dancer., Due to its mysterious, sensual nature and ties with goddess worship, it had instant Goth appeal and before long many Goths were donning black hipscarves and heaps of jingly jewellery. In short time, “Gothic Tribal” bellydance was born., Many dancers also invoke the “tribal” aspect of the style using accessories made from shell, bone, wood and other organic materials. Music preference is highly dependent on what music fits the dance. Bands popular among Gothic Belly dancers include Corvus Corax, Collide, Maduro and Knossos."

Limit yourself to one or two eye-catching accessories.,
Keep your style simple.",How to Be a Classy Goth1," Classy goths can't just put on a ratty old black t-shirt and jeans. While their style will mirror the macabre feeling of other goth subcultures, classy goths dress in durable, well-made fabrics. Wear high-quality materials, like silk, taffeta, leather (or ""vegan leather""), chiffon, gingham, or Venetian lace.

Don't buy clothing you can't afford! Visit thrift shops or garage sales for dressing well on a budget.;
, Part of looking classy is wearing clothes that compliment your figure. Take your measurements and know what your body type. This will help you find clothes that fit well.If you can afford it, you could even hire a tailor to refit your clothes.

If you have style and a knack for sewing, you could even make your own clothes.


, You are not limited to just black if you're a classy goth. While black should be your main color scheme, you can add muted colors to your palette. Try accessorizing with burgundy, navy blue, mauve, olive green, or shades of cream.

Blush, navy, and mustard yellow pair especially well with black., Adding variety through texture instead of color will help your outfits make a statement. Too much color is over-stimulating and distracts from the understated look of classy goths. Wear a leather jacket with a checkered gingham shirt, or accessorize your mauve chiffon skirt with a silky lilac scarf., Classy goths combine contemporary gothic subculture with timeless vintage beauty. If you're a girl, experiment with Victorian hairstyles like buns, braids, and French twists.For guys, wear your hair long and curly with minimal product.Avoid dying your hair neon colors, as this will detract from the classy goth aesthetic. If you want to dye your hair, opt for subtle colors or black.
Grow your hair out for a glossy, gothic Rapunzel-esque look., Keep makeup minimal so that everything you do apply stands out. Use eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to create a subtle smokey eye look. Wear a light layer of foundation or cover-up, and choose a violet, nude, or Merlot color for your lips.

Put emphasis on either your eyes or lips. If you opt for dark, smokey eye makeup, try a pale lipstick. If you wear scarlet lipstick, go easy on the eye makeup.

, Don't overload yourself with too many necklaces, bracelets, or piercings. Pick your accessories wisely, and only wear one or two at a time. Lockets, lace bracelets, pearl earrings, and pocket watches are all excellent choices.

A scarf (especially a silk scarf) can also make a great accessory.
Although studded chokers or bracelets are appropriate in other gothic subcultures, they do not mesh well with the classy goth style.

, The classy goth style does not draw attention to itself but intrigues people with its mystery. Focus on clean lines, sleek silhouettes, and one or two colors per outfit. This will prevent your look from getting overly-busy."

This is best done after a weekend, vacation, or school break.,
The first thing is the transformation into a vampire is pretty slow to so start acting like a vampire bit by bit.,
After about a week of ""transforming"" you are now a Vampire!,
Carry a metal thermos with you at all times.,
If someone asks you to sleep over your house, say something like ""I can't, I'm busy tomorrow.,
Don't be too-too social.,
For music, stick to either classical, Mozart, Beethoven, etc.,
NEVER complain about being cold, hot, or tired.,
If a person gets too close to you, scoot away, hold your breath, and clench your fist.,
For clothes, this could be anything.,
If you want, get vampire fangs.,
Keep a diary telling of your vampire life, of your struggle to keep your secret.",How to Act Like a Vampire (Girls)," If you just have 1 day off, that's perfectly fine too.;
, Some things to do are: stop fiddling with stuff, like pencils or hair, don't blink as often (but still blink! Don't ruin your eyes! Blink slowly, blinks at least 5-10 seconds apart), make it look like you are not breathing (but still breath!), and staring at people! Do not be a creep. Only stare for about 6-10 seconds. But stare intensely. When ""transforming"" pretend to get ""major headaches"" or ""your teeth hurting"". This adds to the effect.

, Congrats! Okay, so now you get into eating. Eat a big breakfast, and do not eat a big lunch. Maybe a salad, or small sandwich. If your school allows it, eat in an area that no one else is eating. If you can't eat a small lunch like stated above.

, Drink what's in the thermos more frequently than you eat. Kind of guard what you are drinking (""blood"") and if someone asks what's in it, just say, ""Oh, nothing."" Also when drinking it, sigh deeply, like you are relieved.

, but I can hang out until before dark."" Vampires usually get more active after dark. This is optional, but adds to the effect.

, Have a few close friends, and keep them close. Stick by their side and if danger comes, defend them.

, Or you could go for rock bands like Paramore, Evanescence, Flyleaf, Nightwish, Shinedown, Black Veil Brides, Metallica, etc. Your choice applies. 

, Vampires don't get tired! Choose to avoid light. You're going for the modern, I-can-go-out-in-sunlight vampire, not the oldest, I-turn-to-dust-in-sunlight vampire. When in the sun, wear big, dark shades. If it is really sunny, pretend that the sun bothers you a bit and move away. If you are in class and sitting near a window that is sunny, put on a sweatshirt. Don't get too hot though. Try to stay in the shade when outside.

, Then take a sip out of your thermos. The person will probably question this, just say that you were a little uncomfortable, and thirsty.

, Goth, punk, emo, scene, prep, normal, nerdy, dressy: it's up to you!! Wear a bit of natural makeup, and cover up zits, pimples, bruises, cuts, etc. with a concealer or something. Vampires heal quickly!

, NOT the glowy, fake ones you get for 99 cents at the pharmacy. You want real looking ones. Google it!

, If someone finds it, they may believe.

Listen to dark Romantic music to set the mood.,
Attend theater, opera, or concert performances.,
Read romantic literature.,
Watch classic horror flicks.",How to Be a Classy Goth2," Grow a love of dark, brooding classical music. Because gothic culture draws so much from Romanticism, sample the Romantic composers: try Beethoven, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Wagner, and Dvorak.Don't forget to study female Romantic composers, like Emily Mayer, Clara Schumann, and Florence Price.If you don't like Romantic classical music, classy goths can also listen to Gregorian chant, opera, or Baroque music.

, Gothic culture comes with an affinity for the arts, especially works that move you emotionally. Try attending a cultural event (like a musical or concert) at least once or twice a month. If you prefer visual art, check out local art museums and visiting exhibits., Romanticism is responsible for plenty of haunting gothic literature. Reading gothic literature will give you a taste for the macabre side of classic literature. Gothic novels and poetry heavily influenced contemporary gothic culture, so sample gothic works to get in the mood. Some literary works to start with are:Dracula by Bram Stoker

The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte

Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman

The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe

The Grey Woman by Elizabeth Gaskell

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson

, Part of the gothic subculture is appreciating scary subjects like ghosts, witches, and vampires. Classy goths especially appreciate vintage horror films. Watch horror films by respected directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento. If you don't know where to start, try these belovedly frightening classics:Wait Until Dark (1967)

Nosferatu (1922)

Dracula (1931)

Psycho (1960)

When a Stranger Calls (1979)

Suspiria (1977)

Frankenstein (1931)

The Exorcist (1973)

The Bad Seed (1956)

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)

Be polite.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Express yourself through poetry, music, or other artistic mediums.,
Be selective, not pretentious.",How to Be a Classy Goth3," In some ways, goth subculture is a rebellion against traditional norms in favor of individuality.But you still need to treat others (even non-goths) with respect. Listen to people when they talk to you, and avoid being obnoxious about your style. If someone has a question about your dress or actions, educate them to the best of your abilities.

Not everyone will understand gothic culture at first. Don't be rude to people who are confused. Instead, introduce them to the best parts of gothic culture.

, Classy goths think before they talk. They only speak when they believe they can contribute to the conversation. Use your works to express yourselves clearly, and avoid becoming a chatterbox. Silence, when used right, can contribute to an aura of mystery.

Cultivate a strong vocabulary. Learn and use Victorian words (like ""batty-fang"" or ""damfino"") to contribute to your vintage aesthetic. Only use words if you know what they mean., Because gothic culture was inspired by Romantic art and literature, all its subcultures encourage goths to express their emotions through the arts. Write, draw, make music, or create art however you like. Spend time with other goths, and appreciate the art they make, too.

Most big cities have goth night clubs or festivals. Spend time with the local gothic community to connect with gothic art and contribute your perspective as a classy goth.

, Being a classy goth is not about rejecting most of goth culture. If you look down on other goth subcultures, you will isolate yourself from making like-minded friends. Create your own aesthetic, but respect what every person (goth or otherwise) has to offer."
"
Determine what you mean by 'goth' - Are you looking to dress like a traditional goth?,
Listen to goth and industrial music - check out bands such as Christian Death, Joy Division, The Cure, etc.,
Read about your chosen splinter group of goth and the gothic subculture in general.,
Make your own clothes - Many goth chicks make their own clothes, or modify clothes they buy at the store.,
Assemble and wear your outfits!,
Buy and wear black or dark makeup.",How to Be a Preteen Goth Girl," Are you into the music? Do you want to look like a cyber goth chick? Are you trying to live your life as if you're from the 1400s or as a vampire? The definition of what being 'goth' is has changed so much that you need to decide what you like and want out of the subculture.;
, Go to a goth show or two - many of them are all ages. Remember that while these bands are considered gothic you don't have to listen to them to be a goth. Listen to what you like, not what others tell you to. Checking out a song or two still would be a good idea.

, Research will help you get more of an idea of the look you are going for and make it easier to achieve. Knowledge also make you look less like a poser.

, Figure out what you want to look like, and go for it! That way your clothes will more fully represent you. Take a sewing class or two to make sure your clothes don't fall apart!

, Some outfit examples are: Sweeter goth, good for easing into the look; Mary Janes, knee high sock, black skirt puffed up with a petticoat, and a nice, preferably fluffy, blouse or more of a club look (make sure your parents would allow it before wearing it): Boots, ripped fishnets, miniskirt, and a tank top.

, While this is not necessarily needed, it helps complete the goth look. Remember to make sure that your makeup goes well with your clothes, is appropriate for whatever you are doing at the time, and that you parents are OK with it. Reading up on school dress codes might not be a bad idea.

Learn about the original hardcore scene.,
Listen to classic hardcore.,
Keep up to date with contemporary hardcore punk.,
Explore crossover and sub-genres of hardcore.",How to Be a Hardcore Punk1," As punk rock became increasingly cartoonish, simplistic, and ""mainstream"" in the mid-to-late 70s and early 80s, local bands, specifically in the Washington DC metro area, began combining an almost militaristic work ethic in regard to their practice sessions with a DIY attitude about putting on shows, taking control of their own music.The sound also flourished in Southern California and other local scenes all over the United States. Hardcore punk would become a defining and significant subculture in American music.


These bands were independent of labels and record executives, taking an active anti-corporate and anti-establishment position in the music world. Before hardcore punk, the concept of an ""independent"" record label didn't exist.
The music itself fuses elements of metal and jazz with the attitude, aggression, and volume of punk, adding complexity and nuance to the genre. American Hardcore is a documentary film about the history and ideology of hardcore punk rock, featuring interviews with lots of the importance punk pioneers like Keith Morris, Ian Mackay, Greg Ginn, and Henry Rollins. It's an excellent primer to the genre.;
, Whatever kind of music you like, if you want to consider yourself a hardcore punk, it's important to familiarize yourself with the touchstones and defining moments of the genre. Before you sound off on the virtues of a band like The Used, give the forefathers a listen. A brief and incomplete list of nonetheless classic hardcore records includes:



Hardcore '81 by DOA

Damaged by Black Flag

Minor Threat by Minor Threat

Bad Brains by Bad Brains

Frankenchrist by Dead Kennedys

Rites of Spring by Rites of Spring

Suicidal Tendencies by Suicidal Tendencies

Double Nickels on the Dime by Minutemen

GI by The Germs

Age of Quarrel by Cro-Mags

, Through the years, hardcore punk has weathered multiple transformations and re-definitions, peaking in mainstream popularity (possibly) in the mid-2000s, with the rise of emo-crossover bands like Taking Back Sunday. Since nobody likes the old guy who complains endlessly about how much better the music was ""back in the day,"" it's important to get with it and stay current as a hardcore punk. This isn't a YouTube comment stream. Find stuff you like and champion it, and ignore the stuff you don't. Contemporary hardcore records likely to appeal to old timers and whippersnappers alike:



Jane Doe by Converge

Abandon All Life by Nails

Wasted Years by OFF!

Hazardous Mutation by Municipal Waste

Hoax by Hoax

, Very quickly, any discussion of hardcore can devolve into a shouting match: ""That's not hardcore! This is real hardcore!"" Nintendocore? Mathcore? D-beat? Arbitrary genres never matter as much as whether or not a particular band, record, or sound is actually good. Listen to a variety of different sub-genres to familiarize yourself with the sounds and the conventions, but take it all with a grain of salt. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Some common and/or popular sub genres of hardcore punk include:


Grindcore: a mix of the harshest of the harsh end of the spectrum, grindcore combines elements of thrash, noise, and industrial music. Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror, and Meat Mist could be classified as grindcore bands.
Metalcore: a broad mixture of extreme metal and hardcore music, this sub genre generally contains the vocal-stylings of hardcore punk, but with guitar-sounds and texture more reminiscent of metal. Bands like Bullet for My Valentine and As I Lay Dying probably fit this genre best.
Screamo: a combination of melodic hardcore punk and aggressive emo music, screamo is one of the more controversial and difficult-to-pin sub-genres, because it was commonly tagged to bands like Thursday, The Used, and Taking Back Sunday, bands that alternated high-pitched shrieking vocals with more melodic ""sung"" vocals.

Choose your style.,
Master the basics.,
Hone your DIY skills.,

Mix it up.,
Don't shy away from metal and other textures.,
Think black augmented with bright colors.,
Throw in different influences.,
Do whatever the heck you want with your hair.,
Listen to the music.,
Develop something to rebel against.,
Don't pay attention to what others think about you.",How to Dress Punk," Punk started after WWII, but really took off in the 70s. Since it's been around for a while, it's gone through different phases and style twists and modifications. When the norm was long hair in the 70s, punks went short. Punk girls of the 80s went more masculine to combat the more feminine look of the 70s. And then there's glam punk, pop punk, and hardcore punk, just to name a few variations. So what's your take?


Glam punk means bright colors, glitter, spandex, leather, leopard print, neons, and satin. Metallic jumpsuit? Sure?
Pop punk can be found at Hot Topic. Skinny jeans, band tees, pyramid stud belts, skater styles, and wristbands. It's like punk and hipster had a baby together.
Hardcore punk is the opposite of what it sounds like. It favors simple clothes that are safe to mosh in. A plain t-shirt and baggy work pants is ideal, eschewing the elaborate fashion of other types of punk, which doesn't really make sense in the first place.

Regardless of which style of punk calls to you (and there are many more that what's listed here), it's all defiantly anti-materialistic. No version of the punk way of life caters to the norm or caves into the mainstream. If it's not trendy, it's good. If it makes your mom furrow her brow, it's good. If the cool kids wouldn't be caught dead wearing it, it's good.

;
, If you're looking for a good, no-questions-asked punk look, there are a few main tenets that have withstood the test of time. Here's a few ideas to get you started:


Guys: black jeans (or any other type of jeans, really), bullet belts and silver stud belts, leather jackets/denim vests (with all your band patches), leather studs and any simple T shirt. As for shoes, Doc martens, converse, or military-style shoes.
Girls: black skinny jeans, leopard print or patterned skirts, bullet and stud belts, band tees, leather anything, mesh and ripped mesh, and feel free to thrown in a bit of pink. Converse, Doc Martens, and military-style shoes are best.

When it comes to band tees, know that everyone is rocking a Ramones or Clash tee. Do yourself a favor and go a little less mainstream punk which, unfortunately, isn't an oxymoron anymore.



, Core to the punk image is being anti-brand. Anti big stores, anti-capitalism. And the easiest way to stick it to the man? Do the job yourself. Rip your jeans, take a black marker to your t-shirt, turn wire into jewelry, whatever. If it's made by you, you can make damn sure no one else has it.


If you're lacking in creativity skills, there are still tons of ways to show your own style. Add patches to wherever, get experimental with dyes, and go to town with a pair of scissors. It doesn't have to look good. That's actually the idea. The more not-good it looks, the better. Who knew not being creative would ever come in handy?

, There is something decidedly unkempt about the punk look. If your t-shirt has wrinkles, no problem. If your socks look like your grandpa wore them, no problem. If all you're wearing is a t-shirt and jeans and nothing else, no problem. This isn't about trying. This is about throwing on whatever your little hands found in the closet this morning, no worries about it.


There was a punk movement that swore by simple because it was better for moshing.You would not wear studs in the pit unless you wanna get thrown out for inadvertently poking out a stranger's eye. So when it doubt, keep it easy. Fashion is a mainstream thing, anyway.

, If your mom were to walk by you, she might say, ""You know that shirt doesn't match those pants, right?"" Bingo. Nailed it! This is not really about piecing together a cohesive outfit. Feel free to scream British punk on your top half and Celtic punk on your lower. If anybody asks you any questions, just ask them why they're so concerned with labels anyway.


Feel free to mix up layers of formal-ness, too. A t-shirt and tie? Why wouldn't you? A skirt and masculine boots? Sure thing. Total bedhead, but an outfit you spent hours on? Why not?
If you're female, you can totally rock a tutu with combat boots. Play up your feminine side by juxtaposing it with masculine items. Feather earrings and cargo pants, sexy fishnets and a loose band tee, it's all good.

, There is nothing wrong with rocking a pair of chinos with a mesh top and a leather jacket. Nothing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Heck, your belt could be a metal chain (in fact, that was a prominent thing in the 80s). Wool socks, leather boots, ripped nylon tights? Yes, please.


Most of your clothes are gonna be cottons. To really have a piece stick out, it needs to be something else. This isn't completely necessary -- after all, simple is good -- but if you do want to nail that park of the punk look that is eye-catching, it's a surefire way to go about it.

, If there's one thing everyone knows (or thinks) about the punk look, it's that it's mostly black. And, in general, this is true. But tried-and-true punk rockers also aren't afraid to throw in a little color. And bright colors at that. Think neons -- blues, pinks, yellows, oranges, greens -- and silver and red. Punk is so not the same as being goth or emo, and this is one of the reasons why.

, Remember how we talked about how punk has gone through all these transitions? Pay 'em homage! Do your research -- there are often military themes, blue collar themes (work boots and suspenders -- getting down to punk's roots), and British influences. So raid your English uncle's closet. He's bound to have something in there.


Body piercings, glitter, rubber, vinyl, kilts, tattoos -- they all have a spot on the spectrum of punk. Bowler hats, studded wristbands, the anarchy symbol, shaved heads or long hair, punk has seen it all.

, Seriously. Some people will tell you you gotta dye it, but if you take it too far, you'll end up just telling everyone, ""Hey, look at me! I'm trying so hard to be anti-conformist!"" So you could dye it, but you could also wear a mohawk, shave it all off, or just do absolutely nothing to it whatsoever. It's totally up to you.


Not the answer you were looking for? Well, think about your hair the way you think about your clothes. If most people wouldn't sport it, it's probably on the money. So go get that perm, shave in your dog's name, dye just the part by your left ear blue, whatever. Who cares what your hair looks like, you know?

, Love it or hate it (since you're here, you probably fall more in the first category), it's still good to know the bands. You'd be on this page all day if we covered them all, so here's a few to get started: Some examples:


Sex Pistols
The Clash
The Exploited
Minor Threat
Dead Kennedys
The Cure
The Banshees
My Chemical Romance

Be aware that if you rock the tee-shirt, someone may come up to you and say, ""Duuuuude, I love the Adicts! What'd you think of Joker In The Pack?"" And then you'll be forced to either make something up and hope for the best, say, ""Omg, look over there!"" and run the other direction, or admit that you just bought the t-shirt because you thought it looked cool. So do yourself a favor and be part of the scene. If you don't know anything about the band and just bought it because of the logo, you're doing it wrong.



, Anything you hate in the world, rebel against it. This is way more important than the clothes. You can be a true original punk and not have all the cool clothes -- the clothes don't mean anything, just a way of identification. In fact, some punk lifers swear that fashion is just a distraction.You do not necessarily need something to rebel against, but ""police"" generally works in most situations. The man, the establishment, authority in general. Angst is very at home here in punk land.

, If you get a raised eyebrow or two because of your tutu, awesome. If the family doesn't understand why you're wearing a tie over your Black Flag t-shirt, tell them to go to Wikipedia. If your teacher is worried you're going through a detrimental phase, well, prove her wrong by getting an A on the next project. What they think may seem to matter now, but it in the scheme of things, it so doesn't. That's really at the heart of being punk.


And don't even pay attention to other ""punk"" enthusiasts. If they tell you your look isn't punk, they don't get it. Punk isn't something you can put into a box and say this is or is not punk. If you like it and someone else doesn't, you're doing it right. Don't second guess yourself. At the end of the day, to dress punk, just go for it. Whatever it is, go for it.

Actively oppose the ideology of the establishment.,
Learn about and consider the straight-edge lifestyle.,
Go local.,
Do it yourself.,
Practice good show etiquette.",How to Be a Hardcore Punk2," Hardcore punk is rooted in a reactionary response to the commodification of punk rock, and the wholesale rejection of consumer-culture and capitalism in music. While the umbrella of hardcore has grown large enough to include bands with ideologies to the far left and far right in the political spectrum, as well as Christian, Rastafarian, and Muslim hardcore bands, each of these bands still position themselves in reaction to some mainstream establishment culture they oppose, making it an integral part of the subculture.


What's hardcore for you in your community may not be hardcore for someone else. What it means to be hardcore in San Francisco may be very different than what it means to be hardcore in Des Moines, Dusseldorf, or Dakar. Embrace issues of social justice that are important to you and get informed about them to take part in active engagement.Hardcore punks generally avoid making an antagonistic presence in the community. Anarcho-punks and nihilistic hardcore punks in the vein of GG Allin, Richard Hell, Brainbombs and other bands in the powerviolence subgenre center themselves around an anti-everything stance that's in some ways linked to the hardcore tradition, but also distinct from it. Hardcore isn't defined by what it's against, although it is against some things.

, An early Minor Threat song called ""Straight Edge,"" which promoted an anti-drug message, gave rise to a popular anti-substance position in the hardcore community known as ""straight edge."" Straight edgers actively, and sometimes aggressively, abstain from alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and sometimes meat and casual sex, and are notable for often confronting other hardcore fans who engage in these substances and behaviors. It's a very common subculture in the hardcore subgenre.


Practitioners of the straight-edge lifestyle will often wear an ""X"" on the back of their hands, or as a patch on a jacket to display their allegiance to the lifestyle.
While you don't have to be straight-edge to be a hardcore punk, straight-edgers are most commonly associated with the hardcore community, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the philosophy, at least, regardless of whether or not you embrace it. It's usually bad form to offer a beer to someone with an X on the back of their hand.

, More than any other genre of music, hardcore punk is a local movement. The touchstone hardcore bands in Boston and Rhode Island were completely different than the classic hardcore bands in Southern California and the Bay Area. A titan of the genre on the East Coast might be practically unknown on the West Coast, because the goal of the music was never world-domination, national-touring, or record sales. It was putting on a killer show for a room full of fanatics.Find an all-ages venue in your town that puts on hardcore shows and start attending. Make contacts in that world and find out about local bands and other more underground venues where the great shows happen.
If your town doesn't have an all ages venue, start putting on shows in basements, warehouses, or other locations. Call bands in neighboring cities and ask them to come play. In Florida, one of the most punk venues for a long time was run out of a padlocked storage container.
You don't need to move to the Brooklyns of the world to find a thriving artistic scene to engage in. Resist the pull of ""Portland."" Make it happen in your own neighborhood. Love where you are.

, Hardcore punk bands got signed by record labels because they started their own record labels, and booked shows by calling up venues themselves and making them happen. Tours were run out of broke-down vans and played on short-circuiting equipment. Bands didn't make anything but gas money. Don't complain about the lack of resources at your disposal–work with what you have.


If there's a show on, volunteer to put up flyers, or make some flyers yourself. Help out at the venue, cleaning up afterward, if necessary. If the band cancels, call up your friends to fill in if necessary. Book bands yourself.
Apply this philosophy to all corners of your life, learning to become as self-sufficient as possible. Depending on where you live and what you're interested in, urban farming, wild fermentation, or cobblering could be considered ""hardcore.""

, Slam-dancing and violent-looking chaos in the crowd is often a big part of live hardcore shows, and it can be a fun way to experience live music and relieve tension. It can also be a way to break your nose. Learn to toe the line between throwing down in the pit and staying safe, and you'll be able to slip right into your local hardcore scene.


Survey the scene. How are people dancing? Does it look unapproachable or scary? If so, avoid the front of the stage. Slam dancing happens when the crowd's energy becomes so intense people just start moving, and slam into each other as a result of it. It's a way of building camaraderie and enjoying yourself, not of starting fights. Scope it out and see if it looks fun. If so, join in.
Don't go after other people, just get into the spirit of the pit. A common misconception about slam-dancing or ""moshing"" is that you run to the front of the stage and start pushing other people. If you do this, you're going to get punched in the nose.
Remove any loose piercing or sharp items of clothing that could hurt someone before slamming. The safety pins holding the band patches on your leather jacket make you look rad, but they can also jam into someone's arm while you're raging, or into your own.

"
Buy used clothes with utilitarian value.,
Wear boots or skate shoes.,
Wear band tees or solid colors.,
Keep your hair simple and manageable.,
Use symbols smartly.",How to Be a Hardcore Punk3," Shop at thrift stores and buy sturdy clothes that you won't need to worry about changing very often. The goal should be durability, reliability, and utility, not ""style."" Some hardcore punks look like traditional punks, with spiky pink hair and patch-laden vests, while others look like TV repairmen, while others look like metal-heads.


Black denim and Dickies are great for establishing a hardcore visual style that's simple and working class. You want to look like you'd be equally comfortable cutting linoleum as you would throwing down in a mosh. Denim or leather jackets optional.
Avoid the mall and big box stores. Don't buy band tees at Hot Topic, buy them at the show you went to, and buy them directly from the band. That money, instead of going to some corporate stooge, goes straight into the band till, where they'll use it to put out more records like the ones you love. You'll be feeding artists, not CEOs.

, Nothing shouts hardcore like a solid pair of workbooks, especially chunky Doc Martens. Paired with rolled-up jeans and solid colors, a utilitarian pair of working man's boots are as hardcore as you can get. Especially black leather.

, The simpler, the better. Rep your favorite bands with locally-sourced t-shirts, or else rock a simple solid-color T. Plain button-ups and work-shirts are also perfectly applicable to hardcore, often buttoned all the way up to the collar.

, Most hardcore punks don't wear studs or dye their hair or do anything fancy. You want to look like you don't have enough time to care about things like ""hair"" because you're so engaged rocking and tearing down mainstream values. Keep your hair short and messy, or shave it.


Some hardcore punks wear dreads, like Keith Morris from Circle Jerks, but for the most part this is rare and encroaches into some cultural appropriation territory.

, Something might seem hardcore and ""punk"" when you're in your group of friends, but empathize with others who might not share your worldview and your particular way of seeing things. Give yourself a good reputation in the community to activate change, don't be a degenerate. Swastikas, iron crosses, and other offensive imagery aren't punk and they won't give you any credibility in the hardcore community. You'll just look like a kid who's trying too hard.Be smart and be aware. Like anything as varied and complex as hardcore, there have been loads of misunderstandings and misconceptions as a result of adopted symbols and imagery associated with it. Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols used to famously make a regular habit of adorning himself in swastikas, because this was the ""most punk"" disgusting thing he could think of doing, and–while this doesn't make it right–he lived in an entirely different culture and context than today. Think twice about how you choose to represent yourself to strangers.

One of the most important aspects of being a Christian punk is to accept no standard that judges you or anyone else by appearances.,
Don't think too hard about your looks.,
The DIY ethic carries over into music.,
All in all, punk is not a special formula, it's the opposite.",How to Be a Christian Punk," Remember, man looks at the outside but God looks at your heart! That's why as a Christian Punk your words and actions should be kind and loving. Stand up for the defenseless. Help people who are in need. Don't bow to a bunch of rules because we're not under the law. (James 1:26-27)


The second most important aspect of the Christian Punk philosophy is Do-It-Yourself (DIY). Christian Punks can watch independent movies and participate in activities for political (or non political) issues you care about. Go to a small church that has a strong sense of community rather than getting lost in a mega-church. Support start-ups and mom & pop stores, and volunteer locally. These are all ways you can support the DIY ethic.
An aspect of Christian Punk that is primarily Christian (although it lives on in the Straight-edge Movement) is the idea that your body is the Temple of the Lord. Don't do anything to dishonor your body, the Lord's house. Many Christian Punks avoid pre-marital sex, drugs, and alcohol. Some even take it to the point of becoming vegetarian. Take your cues from the Bible and your conscience.;

Christian Punk has more to do than with just your appearance and what kind of reaction you want from others. You don't have to aim to be especially different. Being a Christian Punk is about creativity and expressing the freedom we have in Jesus Christ. Just make sure that you don't dishonor your Best Friend or disproportionately annoy those you care about by the way you dress.
Common Christian Punk aesthetics include piercings; leather/camouflage jackets; boots; tennis shoes; spiked, buzzed, and Mohican hairstyles. Quite a bit of Christian Punk fashion is done by yourself; buying clothes from Hot Topic or other ""punk"" stores (pre-ripped jeans, studded belts, etc.) is missing the point. Most punks are poor, and their lifestyle tends to reflect that. Accordingly, the thrift store is one of the best places to go for all of your clothing needs. Beyond that, most of the decorating can be done yourself. Mix and match flavors that look good to you. If you dig sunglasses, wear them... if you don't dig sunglasses, don't wear them. One thing you can do is buy a cheap leather jacket and decorate it yourself with stickers, safety pins, or whatever suits your fancy.
Wearing ""all-black"" is gothic, not punk. That doesn't mean you can't do it if it happens to fit your taste.
When it comes to piercings, tattoos, dying your hair, etc... remember that this is Christian Punk. Consider carefully anything you want to do and keep it all in the context of your conscience before God. ""Honor your father and mother"" may seem to be out of touch with the ""punk philosophy"", and it may not make you popular, but it's an excellent guideline. Christian Punk is first a genre of music, second, a lifestyle, and never, a dress code. If you're here to impress your friends, you can forget about being a Christian Punk. Punk is about rebelling against social norms, and Christianity is a nonconformist religion. Romans 12:2 is the motto for the Christian Punk community.
Yes, you do have to wear shoes but they can be anything. Christianity really has no guidelines regarding shoes so as long as you wear some you'll be fine. Show some creativity though!
Ignore the hair, just let your mom tousle your hair, and leave it that way if you like. Or you can spike it, shave it off, cut crazy designs in it. If your a girl: Experiment with beading, braiding, ribbons, feathers. Dyeing: go for it. Do whatever you like as long as it honors your Savior. This is another example of how conformity is not the idea.
Makeup -- do whatever you want or just skip it.
Remember you are stuck with the same tat, but you can get a different t-shirt or style... Getting a tattoo is your decision when you're of age. You can do things that really reflect your faith. It's a personal decision and relies on your own convictions. Your body is the Temple of God, show your faith through that. I personally probably would not get a tattoo, I have a mouth instead. I don't think that God would tell me to. Ask Him.

,


Pay attention to new bands and support the ones who don't trade values for fame... by buying their music and going to their shows. Try to find local punk bands that believe in Jesus Christ. Consider learning an instrument and starting your own band.
The music you listen to should reflect your faith. Try looking at Tooth & Nail, this is a record company with many alternative Christian bands. Some suggested bands are: Relient K's old stuff, Officer Negative, MxPx (although MxPx isn't a Christian Band but are ""Christians in a Band"". They do have songs reflecting their faith), and Flatfoot 56.
Skillet sounds great, and they definitely stick with their beliefs despite their popularity and tour with bigger, secular bands; however, this alone does not qualify them for ""punk"" status. It's important to note that you, as a punk, are allowed to enjoy many different kinds of non-punk music. Paramore is not punk, Newsboys aren't what you'd call punk.
Duckie, Philmore, Smiley kids, and Headnoise are pretty good. Take a look at Christian music on YouTube. Check slacker.com forums for Christian punk radio stations. Stay far away from ""contemporary punk"" or ""emo"" bands like Kiros and FM Static. Remember the DIY ethic.
Don't judge others for their choice of music. (Col. 2:16)

, You are the special formula. Don't care so much about what people will think. Live for the Lord, and enjoy good music, look cool in the way that God wants you to.

You need the attitude.,
You need the outfit.,
Next comes makeup.,
Next is hair.,
Most importantly--music!,
True grungers don't follow ANY trend they are the way they are, the media made out of this Seattle euphoria the label grunge, not the ""grungers"" themselves, so you can create your own version of grunge, really.","How to Be a ""Grunge Girl"""," If you're going to pull off this look you definitely need one. You have to have the ""I don't really give a f*** what anyone thinks about me!"" attitude. Don't let anyone bring you down, don't take any nasty comments to heart, and always have a smart-ass remark to throw back at those pricks!;
, It won't cost you that much, because you can shop at old thrift shops and even fabric stores to make your own clothes. Or if you want to look more adapted to your surroundings or you just want to look like a mixture of old 80s,90s grunge and now, you could buy things you like and rip them artistically, because we like it, we like to play with things and make on them our unique hallmark. So, never copy others, but make something on your own. That's grunge also. The goal is to make things look old and junky, but you don't have to really look like a beggar on the street. Wear big flannels and torn up jeans, along with old combat boots and studded belts. On top, put leather jackets. If you want to be feminine, you can put a beautiful flowery dress, or a school skirt.

, You don't have to put a lot of make-up, but if you do, use black eyeliner that's smeared with bright lipstick that looks like it's the same layer you had on last week. When you go out, make smokey eyes, make them black, black (PJ).

, In 90s you could have washed your hair once a month so it could have been greasy and straggly. BUT, because nowadays you simply cannot leave your house looking like that, you just simply wash it and don't straighten it. If your hair has big kinks and flicks without being straightened like mine does, towel dry it a little then leave it to dry naturally before you go out. look as much as natural. The whole point of grunge is to be natural, loose, look kinda lazy and that you think its over-rated taking care so much, because it's a big waste of time!

, What started grunge? Yep, music. Listen to Mudhoney, L7, Mother Love Bone, Soundgarden, lovely Shannon Hoon with Blind Melon, Alice In Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and amazing Scott Weiland, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and remember, like them, we fight against the cold, manufacturing, capitalistic, controlling, money-adoring, system, but we also spread love. You can listen to whatever music you want, though!

Buy a bike.,
Get Committed.,
Learn bicycle safety.,
The bicycle is your primary form of transportation.,
Bicycle rain or shine.,
Critical Mass.,
Optional: Clothing.",How to Be a Bike Punk," Of course, you can borrow one from a friend, but how will you be able to call it your own? A bike punk values their bicycle almost as much as their own life. Do not steal a bike. Only go out and buy a really expensive bicycle if you are serious about this. Lock it up. You earn extreme credibility if you find one in the trash or at a thrift store/flea market and do something unique to make it your own. You can paint it and add accessories (baskets, flowers, horns (literal animal horns), fake fur, bells, etc.). If you are talented with welding and inventing contraptions, use these skills to create out-of-the-ordinary tandem, tall, oblong, and unique bikes.;
, Sell, give, or burn your car away. If you don't have one already even better. Bike punks don't drive internal combustion engines without extreme guilt and malice.

, This cannot be stressed enough. be careful of driver doors swinging open, ""right hooks"", cars turning at intersections, and being visible at night. Red flashing LED lights clipped on your bag are always de rigueur.

, Even if your destination is 10 miles (16 km) away, bike there. Some of the most hardcore of bike punks have ridden across the state, and even country.

, While it is desirable to bicycle in the warmth and sunshine, a bike punk will move through rain, sleet, and snow.

, Every last Friday of every month, the Critical Mass ritual occurs in cities all over the world. Find out when your city has it and where people convene. There, you will meet fellow bicycle enthusiasts. If you live in a small town, ride to the nearest city to participate. If this is not possible, then create your own form of bicycle activism and bicycle communities.

, Well, clothing is optional. Bike punks consider themselves to be persons of different subcultures, mostly left of the dial. This includes: nudists, hippies, hipsters, punks, homeless people, utterly insane, etc. You can see that these all overlap at one point or another. Tight pants are recommended, usually rolled up past the ankles displaying socks and shoes. Unique hair is a must, be it dreadlocks, spunky colors, or fun hats/helmets.

,, Ninja Punk fashion is similar to Horror Punk fashion which means lots of black.


Leather biker jackets and leather pants are not a must, but are a perfect addition to any Ninja Punk's attire.
A black doctor mask is a must. You may have to search for this object. When acquired, you can customize it as you like. If not found, get a dark-colored bandana.
A Long black overcoat is also a must.
Dark colored jeans are appreciated more than blue ones.
Gloves/wristbands are another good addition to a Ninja Punk's attire.
Acquire lots of black t-shirts. Unless you are very muscular, avoid sleeveless shirts.
Black hair is another optional choice that will flare up your ninja style even more.

, Moving well is mandatory. Remember, you're a Ninja. A clumsy Ninja in the Feudal Era dies.

,,, There are bands everywhere.

, Typically, this band will not be comprised of only Ninja Punks since at the moment, it is a small population.

,,, Anarchy is about the destruction of government and social convention. Depending on the government and the social convention you can be a good or bad anarchist. You are a warrior of the night, and you listen to good music.

, For example, spraying graffiti is artistic, but illegal unless it's your own property. If you use Japanese Shuto , then you're going to make holes in walls, no matter what.

Choose a pair of jeans that you want to ladder.,

Continue to create ladders until you reach the look you want.","How to ""Ladder"" Jeans"," Choose a pair of jeans that you'd like to distress. If this is the first time altering a piece of clothing, use a cheaper jean that you don't mind destroying. If you don't have any cheap jeans, you can go to a thrift shop to purchase an affordable pair. Stretchy jeans are the best for laddering.
Get tighter jeans if you're going for a sensual look.
Get baggier jeans if you are going for the ""tomboy"" look.;
, To get a more natural look for your jeans, you can distress the area that you want to make the ladder with a pumice stone or some sandpaper. Place the stone or the sandpaper on where you want to distress your jeans and scrub your jeans horizontally with your tool. This will break down the vertical or blue threads in your jeans and give it a naturally worn look.








Use a 220 or higher sand paper when distressing your jeans.

, Traditionally jeans are laddered at the knee. Put your jeans on and use a white chalk to make two to four-inch (5.08 - 10.16 cm) horizontal lines on the areas if you are creating the ladder at the knees. The line on the back pockets should be two inches (5.08 cm) or smaller. The piece of fabric in between these marks will be your ladder.








The line on the side seam should be half an inch (1.27 cm) or smaller.
You can also choose to ladder other parts of the jean including the back pockets and side seams.
Decide on if you want the ladder to be above, below, or covering your entire knee.
You must decide on how large you want the rips in your jeans to be and how many rips you want.

, The cardboard or magazine will prevent you from cutting into the backside of the jeans. Put it on the leg that you're laddering at the time.







, Fold the jean vertically at the line you created and cut the line you drew with a scissor. Measure an inch above the cut and make another identical cut running parallel to the cut you just created. You can also use a razor blade or box cutter to cut the lines as long as the magazine or cardboard is under your blade.







, Flip the tab that you created with the two cuts and look at the underside of your fabric. The blue threads running vertically on the inside of your pants are called warp threads. Pull these out with tweezers until all that remains is the white ""ladder"" threads.








The vertical white threads in your jeans are called weft threads and should be left intact to create the ladder.
When laddering on smaller parts of the jean like the side seam or back pocket, measure a half inch (1.27 cm) up instead of an entire inch from your initial cut.

, Continue to pull out all the blue threads in your ladder until the white threads are the only threads remaining. Once you've done this, you can repeat the process to create other ladder areas around your jeans.








If you want larger gaps in between your ladder, you can pull some white threads as well., Continue to repeat the steps on other pieces of your jeans until you reach the look that you desire. Once you've distressed your jeans in multiple places, you'll have created your owned laddered jeans.

Teach as many resourcefulness and DIY skills as you can to your kids.,
Be conscious that your kids and teens may not experience rebellious moments, especially if you're a permissive and tolerant type.,
Calm the anarchy.,
Don't force punk rock on your kids.,
Use your punk roots to teach your children valuable lessons about not judging people too quickly.,
Wear your punk self in ways that fit your current lifestyle and parenting role.,
Come to peace with some of the nasty necessities of life, or find viable alternatives (welfare or SSI).",How to Be a Punk Rock Parent," Try building a chicken coop or shed, living in a yurt or in the outdoors, capturing solar power for cooking and finding food and water by foraging, etc. Teaching them how to do things rather than how to buy things will be one of the most useful and thoughtful gifts of punk philosophy that you can pass on.


Grow a garden. If you lack the space, go guerrilla gardening or join a community garden. Teach your kids how growing their own food helps them to know where it comes from, what it contains and helps them to remain independent of the grid.
Teach independence in chores and responsibilities early on. Doing everything for your kids teaches them to feel entitled rather than capable. As soon as your child is old enough to do things on his or her own, encourage it. Show how to wash dishes and clothes, clean the house, mend clothing and all of the daily necessary things, then build expectations that your child will do his or her own chores from that point on.
Obsolescence-proof your kids. As far as you're able, teach kids how to life hack everything from the motherboard to the vacuum cleaner. Being able to fix things that break, to re-engineer things that get overtaken by technology and to make completely new things from scratch will give your kids a sense of strength in an ever-changing world.;
, In fact, they might even goad you into telling them off once in a while, just to see if you care enough to set limits. That's okay––set a few simple ones and always be there for them when they need you.

, While anarchy may reign supreme in the credo of a punk, anarchy in the household is rather less helpful. Having systems in place to remain organized, from cleaning clothes and bed linen to preparing the kids' lunches is essential for keeping on top of everything that child raising entails. If you haven't already discovered this, cease your resistance to household systems, for these will restore calm and precious time in your life, freeing you up to pursue more exciting things that you love, like punk rock.

, Don't be bothered when your kids tell you it's weird music and they'd rather not hear it, or they prefer Justin Bieber. And even though you may recall the time your best friend had his teeth kicked in during this great Black Flag song, be ready for your teen to think it blows. Your kids are individuals with their own taste. It may take time to win them over unless you've had punk rock blaring in the background since their birth (a great method because Justin Bieber is the subliminal teaching tool of the commercial media -""you gotta serve somebody""). In turn, be ready to appreciate their music taste too, without your sarcastic commentary!


Find out if any of your kids’ favorite bands were inspired by one of your former punk bands. As with most musical cycling, many of the emerging bands (both non-punk and punk) today have been inspired by a punk band from the past. If you discover this, it's a great way to point out how your kid's favorite band was inspired by one of your favorite bands.

, While instilling the ever essential need to beware any possible stranger danger, teach your children ways to balance their initial gut reactions with a willingness to get to know a person properly. Some of the punk-based lessons you might be able to share with your kids include:


Show them how creative people of all types like to push the appearance of boundaries for specific reasons that have nothing to do with fear or spite. Sometimes it's about challenging the less tolerant elements in society; other times it's about self-expression and being open to all the possibilities by keeping an open mind. In some cases, it's a deliberate poke at societal ideas of beauty, while in many cases it's simply about having fun and doing things differently.
Explore difference with your children, using your punk experience. Explain that punks have often frightened others by their appearance alone, with their piercings, tattoos, ripped clothing and brightly colored spiked hair. Explain how some people choose to interpret this as ""bad"" or ""deviant"". This can then lead you into a discussion about why people might be frightened by mere appearance (for older children, you can also explore the implications of the philosophies held by punks). Hopefully, if your kids have a brain, they will have picked up all this stuff from you already. They should be happy playing with mud, and dry chicken bones, as artistic choices come in many different shapes and forms. For many punks, looking distinct is a story of creativity, boundary-pushing and challenging assumptions Yet, for others, such as the LAST OF THE TRUE ROCK N' ROLLERS, GG ALLIN, it was not a costume or behavior, but his way, the way he was, like an alien from another planet, or a strange mutant naked animal, who lived off violence, and had a sense of humor in the vein of Andy Kaufman. You might like to highlight how challenging conformity through appearance, actions and words can often cause fearful or uncertain people to feel threatened because they might either be upset that others have the pluck to self-express while they've spent their whole lives conforming or they may be jealous or fearful of what would happen if things changed too much from what they know.
Don't sugarcoat anything. Punk culture is, in reality DARK! That is something that can be explored with your kids, but above all DO NOT TELL FUCKING LIES! that is what our work-a-day world (the rat race) already does.

, While the green hair and black nail polish may have been ""very you"" in the nineteen eighties, the reality is that trying to relive the past by way of clothing, makeup and hairstyles is often a self-defeating action. Rather than clinging on to the past, find ways to look punk that fit your age and lifestyle now––there are plenty of cool quirks you can get away with that flatter your age and still denote a lack of conformity to the expected. For example, not wearing a tie, wearing brightly colored shirts, wearing women's clothing UNDER your rat-race monkey suit, dying your hair in interestingly creative ways rather than dramatic ones (use beet juice, or blood obtained from the local butcher for red, grind fresh cut grass for a green pigment) and wearing cool shoes made by a local craftsperson (unless you are poor, then go to the Salvation Army, and get them for free) These are just some possible ways to punk out & up your gear without letting yourself down.


Be aware that parents can embarrass their kids easily by how they dress. However, if you've done a good job of teaching them tolerance and acceptance, this will hopefully be less of an issue. If you still wear a mohawk at 50, give your kids a chance to express their feelings and be open to discussing the reasons for your choice. Ultimately, while it's important to give consideration to how your kids might feel about your outward punk expression, this is another lesson for them in being understanding and accepting.
Be careful to avoid wearing anything that could harm a child. Accidentally knocking your baby with a stud wristband while wrestling with the diapers on the change table is not a good outcome.

, Grown-up realities like mortgages and daily work can either be something you groan about or you reach acceptance about. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up––it means finding ways to make your current reality less onerous, more cheerful and one that works best for you. And if you can't reach acceptance, find an alternative like freelancing, renting, living off-the-grid, etc., while still making sure that your kids are getting a decent, healthy upbringing. Whatever you choose, help your children to see that life has meaningful purpose.


Parents who keep trying to ""stick-it-to-the-man"" risk teaching children more about anger and staying stuck than about being free unless you action your words and be that entrepreneur, business owner or free spirit you'd prefer to be. Teach them that an angry rebel, is only useful when controlled by someone who is smarter. There are many ways to subvert the negative aspects of our flawed system, JUST DO NOT GET CAUGHT! Show your children more personally satisfying ways to live than complaining and running away. STAY AND FIGHT! The people who have resigned their lives to the robotic rat-race horror A.K.A. The American Nightmare, have given up, and given in. Stand your ground, or you are no better than the conformists who hate who you are! Be strong, and have FUN!!!

Know what punk is not.,
Stand up for your cause!,
Be an individual.,
Dress punk fashion.,
Make your hair punk.,
Have the right attitude.,
Ignore any negative outlook towards your clothes, hair or being punk; it is none of their business how you live your life, what music you listen to, or how you look.

",How to Act Like a Punk Girl," Being punk does not mean wearing a certain outfit or acting a certain way. It means to be yourself without caring what the others think! Punks are often judged by others but act their selves anyway and don't take in others opinions - but don't let that bother you. This focus on being yourself and not defining or attempting to be punk may indicate to you that the rest of this article, which tells you how to be punk, is superfluous and possibly counterproductive- and you would be right!;
, Punk is about standing up for what you believe. This is not, for example, going up to a bank and stealing all of the money inside; rather, it is standing up for your values. Though, of course, hardcore nihilistic illegality may be one of your values, in which case, go for it.

, Stand out. What you wear can express you but you don't have to dress punk to be punk. Stand up for what you believe in, even if the whole world is against you. Be bold, but don't lose touch of yourself.

, If you want to look like a classical punk, vests with pins and badges are a common choice. Leopard print and plaid are also classical punk memorabilia. Purses and messenger bags are great for putting pins and badges on. Don't be afraid to wear what no one else is wearing, and conversely don't be afraid to wear what all your punk friends are wearing. Some people say that it is a way of conforming to dress in typical punk garb but if that is what you like to wear, go for it! It doesn't matter what they think.You can just as well be a punk in a princess costume just as if you pulled something from the Sex Pistols' wardrobe. Just wear what is comfortable to you. In fact, as the concept of a 'dress code' is antithetical to the very basis of punk, you can safely ignore this fashion; this 'punk fashion' is largely to broadcast your own status as a punk, which is arguably itself missing the point of punk. Refer to the point above and define your own look or anti-fashion as you will.

, You don't have to, but if you want to you can get Mohawks or liberty spikes, though they are very high-maintenance. Hair color and bleach is fun too but can damage hair . Ignore anyone who tells you that dye or a short haircut will take forever to grow out. However If you're not allowed to spike your hair or shave it or anything then just try getting a few splashes of bright colours in it for e.g. pink, green or blue etc, if your decide not to colour your hair then make up for it in your makeup.

, A punk girl is strong and sensitive. Respect yourself and others. Punk doesn't mean being rude -- but if someone is messing with you, don't be afraid to put them in their place.

Suggest therapy.",How to Understand and Help Sociopaths," These individuals defined as a personality disorder, characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, dis-inhibited, egotistical traits.

Sociopaths are rational, know why they decide to act the way they do, and why.
The reasons behind sociopathic behavior is due to brain structure, although there are an interplay of genetics and environment. It can also be caused by brain injury.
Sociopaths often (although not always) have a history of antisocial behavior, including criminal activity, violence, substance abuse, and inter-personal discord such as family issues, divorce, no real friends, and so on.
Sociopaths are not generally considered ""treatable"" in the way mental health professionals can manage or treat other mental health issues. There are no medicines that can be used to help sociopaths, for instance, and other therapies have a poor prognosis.
A sociopath typically does not want to be cured, even if there was a really treatment. (There are a few exceptions) They may take advantage of a person seeking to reach out to ""cure"" them through kindness, financial support, emotional bonding, and the like.;
, Sociopaths do not feel badly about ""using"" people, do not care if actions are hurtful, and are often extremely bright intellectually and psychologically. Therefore, sociopaths are often master manipulators. Many who have sociopathic tendencies will often blur the lines between what is true and what is made up.These behaviors may include a high level of charm and charisma.They often have a keen sense of how to get what they want from a person, and really do not care who it hurts.


They may manipulate you by over exaggerating their good qualities or by trying to sell you something that may not be all that they say it is. They may also try to stress the apparent safety of a clearly unsafe situation.
Feel free to say “I feel like this is manipulation, and I don’t feel comfortable with this situation.”
Sociopaths can be very socially and psychologically savvy, and may use this to manipulate you without you being fully aware. If your gut feeling is that you should not agree to something, honor that feeling, no matter what they say or do.
Being a check against manipulative behavior is very important in helping sociopaths. Since sociopaths are fully aware of their behavior, they are beholden to such actions. Understanding the limits of what is appropriate, and not, and letting them know the consequences of bad behavior is key.

, People showing antisocial personality disorder can use deceit to gain trust or to make a buck. They may be compulsive liars, use various aliases, or use cons to profit off others or just for pleasure.If someone seems to be sweeping you off your feet or wants you to commit to buying something immediately without having time to think it over, walk away.
Be wary of doing business with someone who shows sociopathic traits. They may trick you into thinking things are wonderful when they are not. Often, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

, Those with antisocial personality disorder tend to have a pattern of aggressive behaviors including hostility, irritability, impulsivity, and/or violence. These behaviors may be followed by a lack of remorse or empathy for people that may be hurt.They may be physically aggressive and want to fight, or they may be verbally aggressive and be prone to loud shouting.
Be careful when engaging with someone you think may have antisocial personality disorder. Guard your emotions (and perhaps even your physical body) if you fear harm.

, Most humans feel guilty or sad following hurting someone else’s feelings. For many people with sociopathic personalities, there is a lack of remorse and perhaps pleasure in causing hurt or manipulation. They may try to rationalize their behavior or outright not care about others’ reactions.If you find yourself hurt after an interaction with someone yet they don’t seem to care about how they hurt you, this could indicate sociopathic tendencies.
If you find yourself demanding an apology or wanting a sociopathic person to take responsibility for their actions, you may need to accept that they may not be able to do this at this time. It is more important for you to accept this and move on as best as you can.

, Many people that display sociopathic tendencies tend to see themselves as superior to others in terms of wit, charm, and intelligence.They may treat others as inferior and find fault in others easily without ever finding fault in the self.


They may talk about the self endlessly and embellish stories or events in a way that makes the self appear superior to others.
They may outright consider other people inferior to themselves and live life within this mentality.

, Many people with sociopathic traits tend to abuse alcohol or other drugs. They can end up going to prison because of substance use and associated actions while on substances.Substance abuse can look like uncontrollable use of a substance to a point that is physically dangerous, or frequent continued use over time. They may engage in risky behaviors as a result of the abuse.
Often, those with sociopathic tendencies grew up in a home or with a caretaker that also abused drugs or alcohol., Those with sociopathic personalities tend to be reckless and take many risks.A person may have countless run-ins with the law, go to prison, and have a blatant disregard for rules and laws.


They may come up with excuses for why they behaved the way they did, and put the blame onto other people and never take personal responsibility.The law breaking may also be related to substance use or abuse.

, Along with rule-breaking, people with antisocial personality disorder often engage in highly irresponsible behaviors. This person may engage in unnecessary risks with money, cars, business, and people. They may not follow through on custody or child support or may neglect their children.They may have poor work habits or not show up for work.
They may engage in poor interpersonal relationships, have very rocky romantic relationships, and may not learn from their mistakes.

, While it can be hard to accept, as much as 50% of sociopathology can be attributed to heredity, meaning it can be passed on genetically. People with sociopathic traits are born with tendencies to act the way they do.Just like a child doesn’t choose to be born into an impoverished family, an individual does not chose to be born predisposed to an inability to relate to others like ‘normal’ people do.

, While a history of childhood abuse is present for many people with sociopathic traits, it does not represent all individuals who express these tendencies. Generally, individuals who express sociopathic traits tend to receive a diagnosis of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence, and often express behavioral difficulties such as aggression, deceitfulness, and destruction.Children diagnosed with conduct disorder often have histories of having a dysfunctional family, traumatic experiences, family history of substance abuse, and inconsistent discipline within the home., While it’s easy to be upset with someone in your life that appears to have sociopathic tendencies, remember that this person does not experience the love and trust that most people experience. Imagine a life of not experiencing the butterflies of being around someone you romantically love, or knowing how to fully trust loved ones and friends. These individuals also likely do not feel the connection of friendship that most people consider ‘normal’.Sadly, these individuals do not even know what they are missing in these experiences, having perhaps never experienced healthy trust or love, given or received.

, Because these individuals often lack the ability to empathize with others, they tend to be invested in self-interest. They may tend to be hypervigilant in meeting their own needs, with no attachment to other people.It is likely they do not have the skills to approach the world in any other way, so life is about taking care of the self and only the self.


Because there is no apparent benefit to helping others or treating others with respect, no action is taken to help or improve the lives of others.

, While these people often are the source of a lot of frustration, pain, and hurt, remember that they are human, too. Despite these people often being very hard to love, it is for this reason they are in special need of empathy, care, and respect.


Do not excuse negative behavior, but be willing to share love and compassion with a fellow human.
Many people that grow up to show sociopathic tendencies were subjected to childhood verbal, physical and/or sexual abuse. Many experienced chaotic or unstable families while growing up, or the loss of a parent.While this is not an excuse for behavior, it can allow you to have compassion on a person who has had a difficult or traumatic childhood and had to find other less-adaptive ways to survive.

Remember, however, that sociopaths are completely aware of their behavior and effects on others. An abusive past is not an excuse for bad behavior.
Also be careful in what a sociopath says about their past if it cannot be confirmed. Sociopaths will often lie or blur the truth about themselves, and stating they were abused or dealt with trauma can be used to garner sympathy.


Note that you need to have firm, appropriate boundaries. For most people, the way to fully heal damage to a relationship is to trust again. However, with sociopaths that may be very unwise. Forgive and move on, but be careful not to put yourself in a situation where you can be very vulnerable. While sociopaths do not necessarily cause harm, because they do not feel remorse, guilt, or the like, there is a high likelihood they will repeat the hurtful behavior.
Showing empathy and forgiveness is good...but keep in mind that acting in such a way will not in any way mean they will feel any remorse, guilt, or have a change of heart at all.

, This is especially hard if a person with sociopathic tendencies is in your family. You want to love and accept the person, but without enabling them to hurt or manipulate other people. Let the person know you are unwilling to enable their lifestyle or contribute to them hurting other people.


Say, “I want to support you, but I cannot contribute to you hurting other people.”
If the person is recklessly spending money and then cannot afford rent and asks to stay with you, be careful in saying “yes”. Housing this person may enable them to spend money on drugs or other harmful items, and may cause added stress to your life and living situation.
Avoid giving money to a person. If they ask for money, offer to buy groceries or contribute to rent if you feel inclined to help.
It can be difficult to see someone destroy their life and hurt other people, but remember that those are their decisions and you are not responsible for them.

, A person may try to push boundaries or manipulate you or the relationship.Let the person know what you are available for and what you are unavailable for. This will help the person realize the predictability of the relationship, and that you are unable to be manipulated.


Don’t allow the person to push boundaries with you. If they call late at night, don’t pick up the phone. If they threaten to kill themselves, call the police. Don’t allow any responsibility that you do not consent to in being in this person’s life.
Don’t let the person call all of the shots. Say “no” to any activities you don’t want to participate in or contribute to, and be firm.
Discourage any harmful situations, such as doing drugs, engaging in criminal behavior, or other irresponsible behavior.
Say, “For you this may be normal, but for me, this is pushing my boundaries. I’d rather not participate in this.”

, People with sociopathic personality patterns may disregard respect for you and your personal rights or violate your rights outright.Stand up for your rights and do not tolerate anyone treating you in any lesser degree than you wish to be treated. Remind yourself that disrespect received from someone else doesn’t reflect any lack on your part, it reflects the problems or insecurities of the other person.


A lack of empathy for other people can contribute to stampeding over other people’s rights. Someone with sociopathic tendencies will often display a high self-appraisal, which may lead them to believe that they can treat others as lower than the self., The cause of this disorder is unknown, but biological or genetic factors may play a role.Remember that although it may not be a person's fault that they are a sociopath, this individual is still responsible for their actions, and you do not need to fix those issues or damage your own life by staying around.


Don’t make it your responsibility to “save them” or “change them.” Recognize that change can only happen on their initiative, not yours.
Offer your support and encouragement to any positive activities. This may be praising, taking responsibility, or seeking treatment for drugs. Encourage things around responsibility.

, Many people people with antisocial personality disorder struggle with addiction, mainly with substances.Substance use and addiction can contribute to poor choices and increase risky behaviors. While you may not be able to do much to lessen this person’s behavior, working through addiction can have positive effects and lower overall risk.


There are many treatment options for substance abuse, based on need. Addiction can be treated through outpatient therapy, inpatient treatment, and residential care.Talk to a mental health care provider to see which option is best.

, Therapy can help in rewarding positive behaviors and discouraging negative behaviors. Talk therapy in which the person is able to discuss difficulties in childhood or their insecurities can also be helpful.Often, people with personality disorders refuse therapy or only go when mandated by courts. In the case for people with sociopathic tendencies, therapy can be most helpful for accompanying psychological diagnoses such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders.


Empathy can be learned.Through therapy, one can begin to understand and experience empathy with animals, people, and all living things.

You may not focus on your needs because you are so focused on other people’s needs.To get help, you need to look at yourself and be honest about what you see. Have your friends or family told you about your codependent behavior?
No help you get will be successful if you don’t admit your problem.;
, Psychotherapy is a proven treatment for codependency. Psychotherapy includes talk therapy, family therapy, and group therapy. You receive psychotherapy from a licensed therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other mental health professional.In talk therapy, you will talk about your past, your feelings, and your thoughts. The therapist can help you start figuring out why you are codependent and how to start putting yourself first. Since codependency often stems from the past, you will work on uncovering things from your past that caused your codependency.You will learn how to build self-esteem and work on liking yourself and thinking that you matter.

Visualize different options of expressing your feelings in a given situation.",How to Express Your Feelings," Before you can do anything else, you have to recognize and accept that you are going to have feelings and there is nothing wrong with that. Feelings are not right or wrong, they just exist.


When you feel something, do not be angry with yourself. Instead, tell yourself, “I am feeling this way, and that is acceptable.”;
, Feelings are driven by emotions, which are controlled by your brain. Take note of your physiological responses when you feel something. For example, you might sweat when you feel scared, your face might become warm when you are embarrassed, and your heart might race when you are angry. Keying into your bodily responses will help you recognize feelings as they come.If you are having difficulty tuning into your body, try physically relaxing your body by sitting in a quiet place and taking deep breaths. Repeat the mantra, “What is this feeling?” to get a sense of the bodily responses associated with each feeling.

, It can be hard to express what you are feeling when you do not have the words to do so. Try looking at “feelings charts,” which can easily be found through an internet search, to understand the range of emotion and to learn words to describe feelings.


Try to learn words that make your feelings as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying “good,” which is very general, use words like “joyful,” “fortunate,” “appreciative,” or “elated.” Conversely, instead of saying you feel “bad,” say you feel “irritated,” “uncertain,” “discouraged,” or “rejected.”, As yourself a series of “why” questions to get at the root of what you are feeling. For example, “I feel like I am going to cry. Why? Because I am mad at my boss. Why? Because he offended me. Why? Because he does not respect me.” Keep going with the series of “why” questions until you reach the bottom line of your feelings., Often, you feel multiple emotions all at once. It is important to disentangle these emotions from each other so you can process each one on its own. For example, if you have a relative with a long-term illness who passes, you might be saddened by their loss, but also relieved they are no longer in pain.


Complicated emotions may arise from feeling both primary and secondary emotions. Primary emotions are the initial response to a situation and secondary emotion is the direct or indirect emotions felt following the primary emotion. For example, if someone breaks up with you, you might initially feel anguished, and then feel as though you are not worthy of love. Decipher your primary and secondary emotions to give yourself a fuller picture of your mental processes., When expressing your feelings to someone else, “I” statements are powerful because they promote connection and do not make the other person feel at fault. Saying something like, “You make me feel __” conjures blame and guilt on behalf of the person you are speaking with. Reframe your statement by saying, “I feel __.”


“I” statements have three parts, the emotion, the behavior, and the why. When you use the “I” statement, say a compound sentence like this: “I feel angry when you argue with me about my job because it undermines my intelligence.”, Deciding how to bring up a discussion about your feelings with others can be an intimidating task. If you decide to talk with someone about your feelings, always start with positivity by saying nice things about the person and your relationship. Then bring up how you feel using “I” statements, and be as honest as possible.


For example, say something like, “I really enjoy spending time with you. You are so important in my life and I want to connect at a deeper level with you. I am a bit nervous about talking about this, but I want to be open with you. I feel…”In a professional setting, start the conversation by being honest, direct, and positive. For example, say something like, ""I really appreciate all of the hard work you are doing. Let's talk about how we can help you and the company succeed.""Let the conversation be organic and do not get upset or offended by the person's response.

, Communication is critically important to the expression of feelings. Choose a trusted group of loved-ones to share your feelings with. As you are talking, be as clear as possible by using your vocabulary of feelings and “I” statements. If you are sharing how a situation made you feel, clearly describe the situation and the resulting feelings. Your loved ones will listen and validate your feelings.


Loved ones can also provide different perspectives on situations that you might not have considered. They can be a valuable sounding board that can help you work through your feelings.

, Communication is a two-way street, and you must learn to listen while others speak to communicate effectively. As someone is talking to you, give them your undivided attention (put away your devices!), nonverbally respond by nodding your head, and offer feedback to their statements.Feedback can include asking for clarification, such as, “What I heard you say is that you feel...” or reflecting on the speaker’s words by saying something like, “This seems important to you because…”, Before you react to a situation emotionally, take a deep breath. Deep breathing is scientifically proven to relax you and lower blood pressure.If you breathe before you react, you can clear your head and react responsibly.Practice deep breathing at least three times per week for it to be most effective.

, As social humans, we tend to match the tone of the situation. If you are with people speaking negatively about others, you might be inclined to join in the negativity. Conversely, if you surround yourself with positivity, you will thrive and feel nurtured. The friends with whom you choose to surround yourself will provide the environment in which you either succeed or do not. If you have a solid group of friends, you will feel more at ease to express your true feelings with them.Choosing the right friends can be a long, trial-and-error process. Choose friends who inspire, support, uplift, and energize you.

, There is nothing wrong with you if you are struggling to express your feelings. You might need to see someone who is trained to talk about feelings and help you express your own. You might need in-person guidance from a professional to not only express your emotions, but also get at the root of why you cannot express your emotions.


Turn to therapists, reputable online websites, call lines, and even religious leaders to talk about your feelings.

, Meditation is a powerful tool that can help you focus your energy and calm yourself down when you are feeling stressed or anxious. To begin meditating, find a quiet and comfortable place to sit. Start by taking a normal breath, then take a deep breath by slowly inhaling through your nose and allowing your chest rise as your lungs fill. Then slowly exhale through your mouth.As you are breathing, think about each feeling, where it came from, and how you want to respond to it.

, Get in the habit of writing your feelings down on paper or in your phone. Putting your feelings into a tangible form will help you organize and clarify your feelings. Journaling has been shown to drastically reduce stress, strengthen the immune system, and increase overall well-being.Try to set aside just 20 minutes per day to journal. Don’t worry about grammar or punctuation. Write quickly to block out any unnecessary thoughts. This is your own personal journal so do not be afraid if it is incoherent or illegible.First, try writing about a good experience to anchor your thoughts, and then move on to how that experience made you feel.
Try to describe your feelings in terms of colors, weather, or music. For example, if you felt happy today, describe what color or what kind of weather your happiness would be., For the days that seem unbearable and are filled with excessive anger, stress, and anxiety you need to find a release for those feelings. You cannot keep them bottled up inside because that will only lead to heightened negative feelings and even depression or physical problems.Other ways to release your feelings are to do yoga, give yourself gentle face massages, and engaging in activities you enjoy.

, When feeling positive feelings such as excitement, happiness, contention, and joyfulness, keep the up the momentum and treat yourself by going shopping, indulging in a dessert, or going out with friends.


By using positive reinforcement to reward yourself for these good feelings, your brain begins to associate that when you feel good on the inside, good things happen externally, too.In this way, you may be able to condition yourself to think positively.

, The way you express your feelings is a choice that only you can make. You can respond negatively or positively to each situation you are presented with, and visualizing all possible responses can be helpful to sort though your true feelings about a given situation.For example, your close friend is leaving town and you recognize that you are upset and sad about her leaving. You could choose to avoid her or pick fights with her to minimize the pain to yourself, or you could choose to spend as much time with her as possible.

Set realistic goals.,
Prioritize.,
Refrain from worrying about other’s work.",How to Fix Your Obsession with Productivity1," One way to help your productivity is to set realistic goals for yourself. This means knowing what you can do within your limits. Don’t try to give yourself unrealistic goals that will fail. Be honest with yourself and what you can accomplish.Start by deciding what your end goal is. What is it that you want? It can be to finish a project or to incorporate more rest into your day. Make sure it is an achievable, realistic goal. For example, don't make a goal to go completely through everything on your to do list by Friday. Instead, make smaller goals for each task or chunks of the tasks. Break down large tasks into smaller ones. This can help you feel accomplished.
Set time limits. Give yourself two hours to finish a task, or three or four. Don’t try to complete the task in too short an amount of time, or too long. Be realistic with how much time you have to complete the goal.
Be specific about your goals. Write them down in as much detail as possible. After you have detailed your goal, ask yourself if it is an achievable and realistic goal. Is this something you can achieve?
Prioritize your goals. Some of your goals will need to be completed before others.
Remember to think about any problems that may arise, or things that will block your progress. What may cause the goal to take longer? What steps do you need to take to make sure you stay on course? Also remember to keep in mind any time you need to take to learn a task or gather information for a new work project or goal.
For example, if you have a project due, give yourself a realistic deadline. This might be the end of the work day, or the end of the work week.
Set work hour goals. Give yourself a start and end time to complete work. Once you hit the end time, switch to your personal time. Give yourself personal time goals, too.;
, One way to help your obsession with productivity is to prioritize what you need to do. Many times, the reason someone isn’t productive is because he spends too much time completing tasks that mean nothing instead of putting all his energy into important tasks.Make a list. Put things that are more important, more urgent, and that have a bigger impact on your life at the top. Small things that are inconsequential should be lower down or eliminated altogether. This makes your productivity more effective in the long run.

, One way that people manifest their obsession with productivity is to constantly check on, judge, and worry about someone else’s productivity. Instead of worrying about what your colleagues are doing, you should focus on your own work.By focusing on what other people are doing, you add extra stress onto yourself. Tell yourself, “I can only control my work. It is not my job to patrol what my colleagues are doing.”
You don’t have to fall into the work patterns of those around you. If your colleagues are working long hours each day or through the night, you don’t don’t have to do the same. Doing work reports or answering e-mails until after midnight is not going to make you more productive or succesful."

Focus on yourself.,
Take good care of yourself.,
Assert yourself.,
Set healthy boundaries.,
Relax.,
Identify ways that you value yourself.",How to Get Help for Codependent Behavior2," To start working on your codependent behavior, you need to focus on yourself. Part of the problem with codependency is that you try to fix everyone else and put everyone else’s needs before your own. To recover from codependency, you must start thinking of yourself and working on making yourself better.Think about what is good for you, not everyone else. You probably will have to start consciously thinking about your choices. Instead of doing what is automatic, which is your codependent behavior, think about things before you react, speak, or take action. Think about what you need to do for you and your overall well-being.
Work on liking yourself. Tell yourself that you are worth it and that you matter. Your opinions matter. You deserve to be happy.
Respect yourself. You can’t move past codependent behavior if you don’t start to respect and like yourself and believe that you matter., You may need to start investing more time in your physical health, such as by following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, improving your hygiene, and getting enough sleep. Think about how well you take care of yourself currently and identify ways that you can improve your self-care habits.



Focus on eating more healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

Exercise for at least 30 minutes every day, such as by taking a walk, riding your bike around town, or doing a workout video.

Get more sleep, such as by going to bed earlier each night. Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep every night.

Care for your hygiene, such as by taking a shower or bath every day, brushing your teeth, and combing your hair.

, One of the most important things you should do when you start to recover from codependency is to learn how to be assertive. If you are codependent, you have ignored your wants and needs in favor of others. You may not even know what you want. Learning to speak up for what you want is a major step in the right direction.This may take a lot of courage and be difficult at first. Your therapist can help you figure out how to identify what you want and finally tell people your needs.
Remind yourself that you have the right to your opinions and ideas. Remember that you can stand up for what you want. That does not mean that people will not like you.

, Having poor boundaries is a common problem with people who are codependent. Your boundaries may be too loose, and you may feel responsible for other people’s feelings and put your needs last. Or, your boundaries may be too rigid, and it may be difficult for anyone to get to know you.That is why setting and maintaining healthy boundaries is important for overcoming a codependent relationship.


Keep in mind that setting and maintaining your boundaries is a process. You will need to start by defining your boundaries for yourself, such as by taking a look at what you value and what you want to maintain in your life.For example, if you value your time alone, then you might set a boundary to allow yourself a certain amount of time alone.
Then, you might let people know about the boundary, such as by saying, “I like to spend Friday evenings alone to give myself a chance to process the week and relax, so I am not available on Friday evenings unless there is an emergency.”
Then, you might also need to remind people of the boundary if they infringe on it. For example, if a friend texts you and asks you to go to a movie, then you might respond, “No. Friday nights are my chill at home alone night, remember? Can we do something tomorrow night instead?”

, Relaxation is a helpful technique to deal with any depression and anxiety that accompanies your codependency. Learning to relax can also help reduce stress and build a closer relationship with yourself. You can find the right relaxation technique for yourself, like yoga, meditation, or reading a book.You can try this relaxation technique. Sit in a quiet place in a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Focus on each muscle from your toes to your scalp, relaxing each one before moving on to the next. Breathe through your nose without trying to control your breath. Let it come naturally. Continue for up to 20 minutes.

, It is important to identify the ways that you value yourself beyond what you have accomplished or what you can provide other people.Think about your intrinsic values. What is it that makes you who you are? What is special about you? What traits do you possess that you value in yourself?


Try making a list of everything that you value about yourself and read it often to help build your self-worth. You may also consider trying a self-compassion meditation to help you develop your self-worth.It is also important to learn how to silence your inner critic.
Work on learning how to love yourself as well.

Look for a lack of boundaries.,
Decide if you need to help others.,
Figure out if you have to be in control.,
Look for a lack of honesty.,
Decide if you are dependent on others.",How to Get Help for Codependent Behavior3," One symptom of codependency is low self-esteem. If you have low self-esteem, you don’t think highly of yourself. You are negative about yourself, criticize yourself, and always focus on your flaws. You never feel good enough.You may compare yourself to others and their achievements.
You might feel like you’re unlovable. You may feel a sense of guilt or feel like you need to be perfect.

, People who are codependent feel like they have to please others. They often feel like this will make people accept or like them. They often agree to things they don’t want to because they have trouble saying no. They will go out of their way to do something for someone else.A codependent person will feel bad or like a victim if they do not receive approval.

, If you are codependent, you don’t have good boundaries between you and other people. This means you may have trouble separating yourself and other people. This includes feelings, problems, and material things. You may think other people’s problems are your fault.When someone says something, you have trouble realizing it’s just their opinion. You either get defensive or believe them. You take what they say to heart.
You may take everything someone says or does personally., People who are codependent often try to help others as a way to feel good about themselves. You feel like you have to solve other people’s problems and give everyone advice, even if no one asked for it. If you are codependent, you expect people to follow your advice and get upset if they don’t., Codependent people often need to be in control of situations or people. Having things be in a particular ordered way helps them feel better. If there is chaos or uncertainty, in people or events, codependents feel upset.Often, pleasing people and helping others is a way to gain control. This is a type of manipulation.
If you’re codependent, you may have been described as bossy by others.

, Codependent people are not always truthful with their feelings, thoughts, and wants. This stems from the need to please people and not upset them. Because of this, you may say one thing, but manipulate the person into doing what you want because you can’t just come out and say it.You may even start lying about your own behavior, feelings, thoughts, and wants.

, You may feel that you need other people to be happy. You need others to like you and accept you to find self-worth. You may even obsessively think about people or relationships. Some codependent people need to always be in a relationship to feel good, and they often won’t end the relationship when it needs to be ended.You may get irrationally upset if you believe you’ve done something wrong or made a mistake with another person.

If possible, hold a pillow or couch cushion over your neck to protect it from debris., Hide underneath a table or desk if you are close to one when the earthquake starts. Use surrounding items such as couch cushions to cover as much of your body as possible, as earthquake movement is unpredictable and can cause many things to fall from the walls or topple over onto the floor., Use one hand to stabilize yourself and prevent yourself from being hurt. If possible, keep close to the ground in a clear space and away from furniture., Natural disasters come without notice, and being exposed to the outside conditions can be dangerous. Stay put and wait for the earthquake to end before moving, unless you are in a dangerous location.If you are in an unsafe location, wheel or walk yourself to the nearest indoor location. Finding coverage for your head and neck to avoid falling debris is the most important move you can make.

, If you are in bed when the earthquake happens, stay there. Use your pillows to cover your head and body. Hold onto the headboard or edges of the bed, so that you are not thrown off during the shaking.

, If you have a service animal with you, keep it close by your side. Tell your pet to “sit and stay.”


Remember that your animal may be scared and unsure of what is going on, so keep it calm by petting its body and using a soft, reassuring voice to give commands.

, Move your limbs and make sure that you were not harmed by falling objects during the earthquake. If you are bleeding, wrap the wound in a towel or bandage to stop the flow of blood. Get medical attention as soon as possible., Elevators are unsafe because the power may have gone out during the earthquake, and you could get trapped. Look for accessible ramps if you are handicapped. If there are only stairs or elevators available, simply stay in place and wait for help.

, Aftershocks are possible, so be wary of moving from a safe location. When safe to do so, go to the designated area for evacuation and wait for the rescuers to pick you up. Stay aware of unstable surroundings and potentially falling objects.Beware of broken glass or other debris that can result from an earthquake. If you have a vision disability, realize that furniture has shifted during the earthquake, so you are safest in staying where you are until help comes.

, This network of people should reside in close distance of your home, and have access to your home. Give spare keys only to people you trust and those who are able to offer immediate assistance.

, If you are deaf, for instance, be sure that your television is set properly to display captions so that you can stay up to date with storm warnings. Set up a plan with a trusted source to obtain vital updates in emergency situations., Your plan should be catered to your specific disability. Go over the plan with your caretaker or someone that you trust, and communicate with everyone who lives in your household so that everyone will be on the same page if such an event occurs.Make a plan that involves rendezvous points, contact people and ways to communicate with them, and escape routes that include wheelchair accessible locations, if that is applicable to you.

, Create kits for emergencies that include key items such as water bottles, flashlights, and batteries. A first-aid kit should also be included. Scatter these kits around your place of residence so that you can be prepared for any scenario.

, Secure your space by ensuring that your surroundings will not endanger you. Keep your bookcases or high shelving units far from your bed, couch, or anywhere else you sit or sleep. Never leave electrical appliances plugged in near the tub or sink.

Talk to a friend.",How to Deal With Your Emotions1," Identifying a specific emotion can be more difficult than you think. If you are struggling, start with the four basic categories: anxiety, sadness, anger, or happiness. By simply identifying exactly what you’re feeling, you can begin taking the power away from the emotion as you work through what’s causing it. Though your feelings may vary in intensity, most fall into one of these broad categories.Anxiety often takes the shape of “what if” questions. What if they don’t like me? What if I’m not accepted? Etc.Sadness tends to happen when we focus on things we cannot change such as death or loss.Anger is the response after being attacked, such as our values.Happiness is positive thought often around a gain, such as a compliment from a friend or a reward like a promotion at work.;
, Taking steps in the moment to deal with a difficult emotion is one common coping strategy. You can help deal with an emotional response by focusing on something else that you can control, such as your breathing. Research shows that practicing breathing control has a positive impact on your stress response or “fight or flight” response.For example, a simple technique is to count to five while inhaling, hold for five counts, and take five counts to exhale. Focus on your each part of your breath.
Another way to focus on your breath is to use a deflated balloon. Blow up the balloon and watch it deflate.

, Self-soothing techniques are another way to focus on something aside from a difficult emotion. One specific example is the five senses technique to help you improve your state of mind. Sit in a comfortable position and focus on your breathing. Then isolate each of your five senses and spend one minute each focusing on the specific sensations of each. Consider the following:Hearing: What sounds do you hear around you? Focus on external sounds, such as cars going by, people talking, birds chirping. Focus on internal sounds, such as your breathing or digestion. As you focus on hearing, do you notice anything you did not before?
Smell: What do you smell? Is there food near you? Or maybe flowers outside? You might notice smells you did not before like the paper in an open textbook beside you. Try closing your eyes. Sometimes this helps decrease visual distractions.
Sight: What do you see? Take notice of details such as colors, patterns, shapes, and textures. Look for variations in hues of colors you haven’t noticed on common objects before.
Taste: What do you taste? Even if you do not have food in your mouth, you can still taste. Notice any aftertaste of a previous drink or meal? Run your tongue over your teeth and cheeks to help you become more aware of subtle tastes.
Touch: What do you feel without moving from your seated position? Feel the sensation of your skin being touched by clothing, your chair, or the floor. Feel the texture of your clothes or the chair with your fingers and focus on that.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a type of coping skill that focuses on tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. The benefits of progressive muscle relations include helping you become more aware of physical sensations in your body.Try starting with your toes and then isolating different muscle groups in your body all the way up to your head.


Tense each muscle group for five seconds, and then spend the next thirty seconds slowly relaxing them.
You can use your imagination to help the process as well. For example, when you get to your face muscles, imagine eating a lemon to help you tense them up, and imagine eating something sweeter as your relax them.

, Meditating has been shown to improve positive emotions, satisfaction, health, and happiness. Also, it decreases anxiety, stress, and depression.There are many different types of mediation, but the goal of all mediation is about calming the mind.


For example, start in a comfortable position. Focus on a single thing—such as a candle flame, a repeated word of prayer, or counting beads on a rosary. As you focus, your mind will wander. Let those thoughts go, and bring your concentration back to your focus point.This might sound easy, but focusing the mind is challenging. Do not be disappointed if you can only focus for a few minutes at first.

, Some people find it helpful to write down the negative emotion as they question it. The physical action of throwing away the paper on which you’ve written the negative emotion can assist with letting it go mentally as well.Though symbolic, associating a physical, controllable action with letting go of the negative emotion may be helpful to you.

, You may find it easier to interrupt your negative thoughts by replacing them with positive imagery. This can especially help if you’re fixating on a memory with a difficult emotional impact.Start with an image or mental picture that is positive or peaceful. It can be a memory or a place. Think of a time/situation/place in that location that made you feel calm and happy.Try to remember all the details of this memory or place. Focus on locating all five of your senses in the positive place. How did it sound, smell, feel, etc.?Some people find it helpful to carry a physical picture with them in their wallet or purse to help remind them of a positive moment., Being alone with sad or painful emotions can create an echo chamber where you can’t help but fixate on the emotion. If a good friend in your social circle is available, then reach out to him or her. Emotions—including happiness—are contagious.Sharing time with one of your positive friends might be just what you need to help you relax.

Step away from work.,
Plan recreational time.,
Engage in a physical activity.,
Talk to people.",How to Fix Your Obsession with Productivity2," One way to help break your obsession with productivity is to leave work at work. When you are not at work, don’t think about work, talk about work, or do more work. Make a clear separation between work and not-work time.Instead, use your downtime for other non-work related things, such as relaxing, spending time with friends and family, or participating in a hobby.
If you work from home, leave work in your office, or move all your work to a place that is out of mind so you aren’t tempted.

, If you find yourself obsessed with productivity, you may have to schedule recreational time. This may be especially true when you first try to break your obsession. Get out a weekly calendar and pencil in time where you do activities not related to work.This can include:


Dinner with family or friends
30 minute walk around the neighborhood
An hour of television watching your favorite show
Three hours to go to the movies
A day spent at the park
Two hours reading a book
Half a day painting
An hour taking a sewing classes
45 minutes baking something from scratch

, One way to help you get your mind off work is to stay physically busy. When you are not at work, do something physical that gets your body moving. Many jobs people have keep them at a desk, so doing physical activity helps break the cycle of being sedentary. Plus, moving around can increase your energy levels and even help clear your head so you can think better.


Physical activity can include a variety of things. Go for a walk, a hike, or a jog. Bicycle with your kids around the neighborhood. Go to a gym class. Play a basketball game with friends. Anything that gets you moving and enjoying yourself is a good activity.

, Another way you can break your obsession with productivity is to talk to people. This can be at work or at home. This helps get your mind off what you feel you have to get done, helps you connect with real people instead of being addicted to your electronic devices, and can even help you learn and grow.When you talk to people, make sure you are actively listening. Don’t pretend you are listening when you are actually thinking about what you need to get done.

"
"
Think positive thoughts.,
Shift your thought patterns about work.,
Avoid basing happiness on productivity.,
Refrain from basing self-worth on productivity.,
Focus on the present.",How to Fix Your Obsession with Productivity3," Every day when you go home, think positive thoughts about your job. Don’t focus on the negative, especially what you didn’t get done. Instead, think about what you did get accomplished and how productive you were.


Think about what good things you got done. For example, think about the project you finished, the people you helped, the stack of papers you got through.
Focus on how productive you actually were instead of how productive you think you should be.

, One reason people have such an addiction to work and productivity is due to outside social and cultural influences. It is definitely important to take pride in your work and provide for yourself and family, but you need to also find the importance of your personal non-work life. One way to do this is to shift your thinking about work and your personal life.To shift your thinking about your work and personal life, start telling yourself that your personal life is just as important as your work life. For example, say to yourself, “The activities I do when I am not at work are valid. They add to my success as a person.”
Shifting your thinking means you have to put as much focus on your non-work life as your work life. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. You can try to strengthen relationships with family or friends, enrich yourself by taking the time to find new hobbies or pursue interests, or setting aside time for relaxing and restful activities.

, If you base your happiness on how productive you are, you eliminate opportunities to be happy in the moment. Setting goals is a great thing to do, but when your goal becomes an obsession and is all you can think about, it is a problem.


Ask yourself why you made the goals you made. Are they realistic goals? Do you have unrealistic expectations for the completion of your goal? Readjust your goal, come up with a new goal, or get rid of a goal if you have to.
Celebrate the successes you experience as you go towards a goal. This helps you find happiness as you work or strive to achieve a goal, instead of always focusing on needing to do more.

, You should stop basing your self-worth on your level of productivity. Just because you were more productive the day or year before doesn’t mean you are less of a person. It doesn’t mean you need to make up for it by being extra productive. Your self-worth should be based on a combination of things, not just productivity.

, Being obsessed with your productivity keeps you either in the past or the future. Striving to be more productive has you looking too much into the future, while obsessing on how you weren’t productive keeps you in the past. Instead, focus on the moment.Get what you can done in the moment. Don’t worry about yesterday or tomorrow. Work your best today, and when you are done, be pleased with what you accomplished this day.
Don’t beat yourself up if you are sick, fatigued, or not at 100%. Instead of worrying that you are doing less than you have before, focus on what you can accomplish despite feeling under the weather. Be happy with what you get done.

"
"
Do breathing exercises through the day.,
Try therapy.,
Allow yourself to rest.",How to Fix Your Obsession with Productivity4," One way to help alleviate the stress is to practice breathing exercises. Deep breathing can help relax you, clear your mind, and help you eliminate negative, stressful thoughts.This aids your obsession with productivity by helping you take a step back, reconsider what’s important, and reduce the stress you’re piling on yourself by being obsessed with getting things done.


You can do something as simple as abdominal breathing. Sit up straight in your chair with your feet on the floor. Inhale through your nose, breathing so that abdomen expands. Place a hand on your belly and wait for it to move as you inhale. Hold for a count of four, then release slowly, your abdomen flattening as you expel all the air.

, If you are struggling with breaking your obsession with productivity, you can try going to therapy. There are therapy options for people who are workaholics. You can try one-on-one therapy, group therapy, or even family therapy.In therapy, your therapist might use cognitive-behavior therapy, a treatment where a therapist helps you learn how to replace negative thoughts and behaviors with more positive ones. They might be able to help you change the way you think about work and personal time.

, One of the problems with being obsessed with work is never taking the time to rest and relax. You are always worried or thinking about what you have to get done. This causes unneeded stress. It also affects your efficiency, your creativity, and even your productivity.Give yourself breaks during the work day. Get up and walk around the office, meditate, do breathing exercises, or do a stress-relieving activity for a few minutes.
Take naps during your off time. There is nothing wrong with resting and relaxing when you aren’t at work.
Disconnect from everything. Spend time away from your computer, tablet, cell phone, and e-mail. Spend time letting your brain relax from the stress of work.

Before beginning the disability process, it may be helpful to check whether your condition is on the SSA’s list. This will give you a better sense of whether the SSA may be more or less inclined to approve your for benefits.


Even if the SSA does not list your impairment, you can still apply for benefits. However, the SSA may require additional information or make the process more difficult to qualify.You can view the SSA’s list of impairments at: https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/listing-impairments.htm.;
, If you are recently disabled, it is imperative that you seek medical attention for your condition.

If you’re unemployed, you may still qualify for SDI if your disability kept you from looking for work for at least a week.
Nearly any medical condition can be an SDI disability. For example, you may be eligible for SDI if you are pregnant or recently gave birth. Being in treatment for alcohol or drug addiction also may qualify you for SDI benefits.;
, While most California employees can receive SDI benefits as long as they meet all the other requirements, some types of employment do not.


For example, athletes, independent contractors, or students employed through work-study programs generally are not eligible. To be eligible for SDI either you or your employer must have paid into the program.Some employers voluntarily opt out of SDI and offer their own comparable benefits instead.If you’re not sure, you should check with your employer before you spend time and effort applying for benefits.
You must have been working for covered employers in California for a total of at least 18 months to qualify for benefits., Although you can receive SDI benefits if you’re unemployed, California law does not allow anyone to claim or receive both SDI and UI benefits at the same time., To determine whether you’re eligible for SDI benefits, and how much you’ll receive, the EDD looks at your income during the year-long period beginning between 15 and 17 months before the date of your application.The EDD will divide your 12-month base period into three-month quarters. To be eligible for SDI you must have earned at least $300 during one of those quarters. The quarter in which you made the most money is the quarter the EDD will use to calculate your benefits.If you were unemployed during any of those quarters, the EDD will disregard that quarter and start your base period a quarter earlier. For each unemployed quarter, the base period continues to start earlier until it covers a period in which you were employed.For example, suppose you file your application in April. Your base period would be the 12-month period ending December 31 of the previous year.Last year would then be divided into three-month quarters, and the quarter in which you earned the most money would determine your benefits.
Continuing the example, assume that from January through April of last year, you worked full time and made $1,100 a month. In May you were laid off, but found part time work in June making $500 a month. You continued that job until October, when you found more full-time work earning $1,500 a month. Since you made the most money in the final quarter of your base period, that would be the amount the EDD would use to calculate the amount of benefits you are eligible for each week.
The total amount you earned during your base period also determines how long you’ll receive benefits and how much you’ll be paid each week., Whether you’re applying online or through the mail, you’ll need to have basic documents proving your identity as well as information about your disability and your most recent employment.


Identity information includes your name, date of birth, phone number and address. You also will need to provide your social security number and your California driver’s license or state identification card.
Employment information includes the business name, telephone number and address of your most recent employer, the last day you worked your regular duties and hours, and wages you’ve received or expect to receive from vacation or other leave.
If you worked for a period of time on modified duty to accommodate your disability, you should provide those dates when you submit your claim.
If you are receiving workers’ compensation or have filed a workers’ compensation claim, you should also include that information on your claim form.
If you are receiving or have received inpatient treatment at an alcohol or drug abuse treatment facility, you should provide the name, address and telephone number of that facility on your claim form. , The EDD gives you the option of applying online or ordering forms and sending them back in through the mail.


To apply online, visit the EDD SDI website and enter your identity information to create a new account.If you want to apply through the mail, you can order forms online or by calling 1-800-480-3287. If you order forms online, you may not receive them for two to four weeks.
You can also get a paper claim form from your doctor, from your employer, or by visiting your nearest SDI office.

, After you’ve either set up an online account or received paper claim forms, you can use the information and documents you’ve gathered to start the application process by filling out Part A of the claim form., Part B of your claim form is a doctor’s certificate. This should be completed by the doctor or other health care provider who is treating you for the disability you’re claiming entitles you to benefits.


Your doctor must provide basic details about your diagnosis, disability and treatment, as well as licensing and contact information.
Health care providers such as physicians, dentists, chiropractors, surgeons, psychologists and other medical professionals must use the physician/practitioner’s certificate found in Part B of your claim form.
If your doctor is registered with SDI Online, she can submit the doctor’s certificate right after you file your claim, and your claim will be processed faster than if she mails in a hard copy.If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner for your disability, you must call 1-800-480-3287 to get a different form, the DE 2502 Practitioner’s Certificate, for that practitioner to fill out and sign., If you’ve chosen to fill out paper forms, you complete your application by mailing your claim form along with your doctor’s certificate to your nearest SDI office.

, Most benefits are issued within two weeks of the EDD’s receipt of the completed claim form and doctor’s certificate.


Even if your claim is approved before that time, all claims have a seven-day waiting period during which benefits are not paid.
If your claim is approved, you’ll receive a letter with a debit card for you to access your benefits., If your claim is disqualified, you will receive notification of this along with a form you can fill out if you believe the disqualification was in error.


Claims frequently are denied because they were filed too late. Claims must be filed within 49 days of the onset of the disability. Because many Californians aren't aware of this deadline, they don't file for benefits in time. You can have your claim considered if you appeal showing good cause as to why you missed the deadline. For example, if you were in the hospital in a coma for two months, that would probably be considered good cause.To qualify for benefits, you must have been working in California for an employer who contributed to the state program for at least 18 months. People with shorter work histories in the state also will be denied benefits, but would be unlikely to prevail on appeal.Many denials also are based on a lack of medical documentation for the disability alleged. If you didn't submit much medical information when you filed your claim, consider getting additional records or more thorough medical history when you file your appeal.Explain in detail why you think you are qualified to receive benefits. Attach any additional medical or employment records or any other documents that back up your claim.

, You must file your appeal within 20 days of the date your disqualification notice was mailed.


If you lose the form itself, you can print the form from the EDD's website, or send in a detailed letter to the same office that processed your claim and issued the disqualification. Sign and date the letter, and include your printed name, address and Social Security number., If you sent in additional information that renders you eligible, you will receive SDI benefits. Otherwise, you'll receive a notice that your appeal has been forwarded to the Office of Appeals.

, If the EDD's Office of Appeals receives your appeal, you'll receive a hearing notice from that office that schedules a hearing for your appeal.If you aren't able to attend your hearing on the date scheduled, you must call the office at the number on the notice as soon as possible to reschedule. If you don't show up for your hearing, your appeal will be dismissed., Appeals are slightly less formal proceedings than a court hearing, and you don't necessarily need an attorney. However, you might want to speak to an attorney with experience in public benefits if your case is complex or you find the procedure confusing.


An Administrative Law Judge will hear your appeal. The ALJ is an independent third party who will listen to both sides of the case and decide whether benefits should be awarded. All testimony is under oath. Generally, the only testimony will be from you and an SDI representative.The ALJ will mail a decision to all parties. The decision of the ALJ is final."

Some seats may be intended for smaller spaces than others. Shower seats can be bought at most hardware stores, home centers, and through online sellers.If you have difficulty deciding on the right shower seat for your situation, consult a medical professional, like your primary care physician.
In narrow showers, prioritize a chair model that folds up against the wall. This will make it easier for others who don’t need the seat to use the shower as well.;
, Most of these supplies can be found in the home or purchased from a local hardware store or home center. If you have to drill holes into tile to install your shower seat, prioritize tile drill bits, as these better prevent cracking and chipping. You’ll need:

Bar of soap (or soap pen)
Cleaning supplies (for cleaning the wall where the seat will be installed)
Drill (and drill bits)
Fasteners (like screws; these may come with your shower seat)
Hammer
Masking tape
Measuring tape (or measuring stick)
Level
Safety glasses
Screwdriver
Shower seat
Stud finder

, Generally, the instructions for your shower seat should indicate the number of studs (supports) required for installation. In most cases, a stud on each end of the seat will provide the best stability. Use a stud finder to locate the studs in your shower.If your shower does not have suitable studs, installing a shower seat may not be possible without reinforcing the wall. In these instances, a standalone shower bench may be the best substitute.
Seats installed in a corner between walls may provide enough additional support for your seat if there isn’t sufficient stud support., Buildup accumulates on your shower walls over time. This can negatively impact the installation of the seat. Clean your shower with a suitable cleaner thoroughly until all dirt is removed. Dry the area with a clean cloth afterward.

Buildup can make it difficult to see where you’ve marked drill holes. Mis-drilled holes can harm the overall appearance of your shower.
Film or slime, especially, should be completely removed. This can make tools slip when installing the chair and could result in damage to your shower.

, The instructions of your seat should clearly indicate the lengths between wall mountings. Use a tape measure and mark where you’ll attach the seat to the wall with a bar of soap or a soap pen, which will wash away after the chair is installed. Situate mountings so they fasten to the wall on a stud, unless otherwise indicated.After you’ve marked all the wall mountings, check these marks with a level. Adjust marks as necessary. Failing to do so could result in a seat that slopes.

, Place an X of masking tape over your wall mounting marks so the mark is directly beneath where the X crosses. Situate your drill bit over the crossed part of the X and tap it lightly with a hammer until a small dent is made in the tile at the mark. Put on safety glasses. Insert the bit into your drill, then use low speed and moderate pressure to drill through the tile.

Applying too much pressure or drilling too fast can cause the tile to crack or chip. However, in many cases, these imperfections can be repaired.Sprinkle a small amount of water at the drilling location while drilling. Doing so will reduce heat and friction, which can cause damage.Depending on your shower, you may have to drill into concrete or some other material that requires specialized drilling techniques.

, Remove the masking tape from the wall. Each shower seat will be different, but in most cases,next you’ll attach wall mountings or brackets. The frame of the seat will connect to these. For best results, follow the directions that came with your seat.Some shower seats may come with pre-packed fasteners that may need to be installed with other tools, like a hex key (Allen wrench).

, In many cases, you’ll have to attach the frame of the seat to the wall mountings before putting in the actual seat. Use a screwdriver and appropriate fasteners (like screws) to connect the frame to the all mountings. You may have to fasten several separate pieces together to complete the frame.The frame should be sturdily attached to all mountings. Connecting parts of the frame should also be well fastened., In some situations, your seat may be a single piece that simply attaches to the wall mountings along with the frame. If not, you’ll likely have to attach the seat to the frame with screws. Use your screwdriver to attach the seat firmly to the frame., While the shower is off, test the seat with a heavy object, like a backpack full of books. After passing that test, sit in the seat yourself. Move around on it as you would naturally to evaluate its stability. If the seat is sturdy, your shower seat has been successfully installed.

If you question the seat’s stability at any point, stop immediately. Improperly fastened seats can rip free of your shower wall and cause costly damage.
When a seat’s stability is questionable, check your studs again. You might have missed a stud and need to drill another hole.
Supplemental brackets and supports can be purchased at your local hardware stores and used to improve the stability of your seat., Sit and move around in the chair once a month. Over time, the materials the chair is made of may come loose or degrade. Pay close attention to wall mountings. Water can seep into fastener holes and make the chair unstable.

Compare the stability of the chair to how it was when new. If your chair’s stability has noticeably decreased, you may need to buy and install a new chair.

, Even hardware that’s intended for use around moisture, like the kind used in shower chairs, can break down over time and become unsafe. Many seats are made out of plastic parts. Stress from use can wear-out the plastic. Brittle, discolored, or thinned plastic may be a sign you need to replace a part.Many replacement parts can be bought at your local hardware store or home center, though specialty parts may need to be ordered through the manufacturer.
If you need to order parts from a manufacturer, check the manual that came with your seat to find information about replacements.

, Shower seats have many nooks and crannies in which soap scum and other buildup can accumulate. Bacteria and mold that grow in these conditions can cause your seat to wear out more quickly. Use a suitable bathroom cleaner to remove buildup or grime from your chair once a week."

Keep a journal.,
Identify the source of your difficult emotions.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.,
Use thought interruption techniques.,
Sublimate your difficult emotions.,
Seek help from your support system.,
Talk to a professional.",How to Deal With Your Emotions2," Many people find journaling a helpful way to clarify and process tough emotions.Sometimes the difficulty of an emotion is simply feeling unable to express it. Write down what has happened, what you feel, and the duration and severity of the emotion. Even by organizing these thoughts into an entry, you often begin processing the emotion.

, Once you start journaling about your emotions, you may find patterns in the sources that weren’t as obvious beforehand. Try to locate the source that’s causing each emotion.If you recognize common causes, then ask yourself how you can make changes to either weed out the source or reduce its impact on you.

, People tend to despair over difficult emotions and immediately entertain negative thoughts around the emotion that simply aren’t true. By isolating and questioning these thoughts, you can separate out the negative thought reactions that often accompany tough emotions. The process of challenging and correcting your own thoughts can take time and patience. Begin by asking yourself:Is the thought true?
If you think it’s true, what’re the facts supporting it?
What are your reactions to the negative thought?
What effect on your actions or behaviors would you experience by not having the thought?

, Once you’re familiar with how to question your negative thoughts, you can also begin recognizing the patterns associated with them. This will allow you to simply interrupt the cycle of negative thinking and replace it with more positive or productive thinking.You can start with a verbal interruption (such as telling yourself to snap out of it) or even a physical cue (such as a rubber band on your wrist when you recognize the negative thought). This helps stop the thought by recognizing it is happening.

, Turn to your hobbies during times of difficult emotions. Using those feelings as a conduit for creative and artistic expression is a process called sublimation.A lot of energy goes into tough emotions, and funneling that energy into projects, skills, and other positive outlets can help you cope in a productive way.

, Don't try to take on the world by yourself. Talking with someone with whom you feel comfortable can help ease all manner of difficult emotions or negative thoughts you may have. They may also come up with a solution to your problem or a way for you to cope that didn’t occur to you. Hiding your problems will always create more problems than it solves. Seek support in good friends, loved ones, relatives, or even a professional therapist or counselor, if other methods haven’t helped.

, If the long-term stresses of coping with difficult emotions have left you feeling withdrawn or overwhelmed, then you may want to talk to a professional counselor or therapist.A professional also offers an alternative if your emotions stem from something you’d prefer not to share with friends and family members. Your therapist will provide an understanding ear, confidentiality, helpful suggestions, and additional tools and resources to help you cope.


If your counselor thinks that medication will help as you work through your emotions, then either he or she will be able to provide a prescription or refer you to someone who can.

To find a private plan that works for you, search the Internet for “short-term disability private insurer.” You can then contact a carrier who will connect you with a licensed insurance agent.Compare different plans based on how high the premium is and what percentage of your base earnings will be replaced. You also want to look at how long the waiting period is before you can get benefits. For some plans, you need to wait a month or more.Some plans also require that you take all of your sick leave before you can apply for temporary disability benefits.If you do not have much sick time saved—or if you do not want to use it for a disability—then you might want to check out other plans.;
, Contact Human Resources (HR) or your union to get a form to sign-up for short-term disability insurance. Alternately, your insurance agent will provide you with an application.

, Premiums can be deducted from your paycheck if your employer sponsors the disability plan. Otherwise, you will be responsible for making timely payments. If you miss a payment, your insurance may be suspended.

Don’t forget your state anti-discrimination law.,
Call an employment attorney with questions.",How to Ensure ADA Compliance at Your Place of Business," Title III requires that businesses be accessible to people with disabilities. Almost all businesses are covered. To be covered, a business must provide goods or services to the public and fall into one of the following categories:bars and restaurants
stores and shops
service establishments
recreational facilities
hotels
theaters
private museums
private schools
dentist and doctor offices
shopping malls
other businesses;
, The federal government created standards in 1991 but revised them for 2010. You should get a copy of the 2010 Access standards, which are available online.Read them and take notes.


If you altered your business in the past 25 years to conform with the 1991 Standards, then you are not required to make additional modifications. For example, the 1991 standards required that you have one parking space that is van accessible for every eight parking spaces. In 2010, the requirements changed: you need one van accessible space for every six parking spaces.Unless you are re-doing your parking lot, you don’t need to comply with the 2010 standards since you already complied with the 1991 ones.
However, the 2010 standards contain new requirements which weren’t in the 1991 standards. You do have to comply with these new requirements.
Furthermore, if you choose to modify your business, then you must make sure the modification complies with the 2010 standards.

, The ADA requires that newly constructed and renovated buildings be accessible to people with disabilities. However, there is no “grandfathered” exception for old buildings. Instead, all buildings should remove any architectural barrier.Look for the following:


Narrow aisles which people in wheelchairs or other mobility devices cannot use.
Parking space that doesn’t have enough space to allow a wheelchair lift to be used.
Restrooms too small for people with a mobility device to use.
Counters which are too high.
The lack of an entrance ramp.
Doors which are too narrow.

, You might not be confident you can identify all barriers to access. In this situation, a low-cost option is to ask members of the disabled community to come into your business and identify barriers., The ADA does not require that you entirely transform your business so that it is handicap-accessible. Instead, the law requires that you remove barriers if doing so is “readily achievable,” which under the law means “easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense.”This analysis requires that you analyze the following:


How much it costs to remove the barrier. Installing a ramp might not be very expensive. Installing an elevator to reach your business on the third floor of a building is quite expensive.
Your resources. A larger business with more money is expected to make more extensive renovations to remove barriers. A smaller business, with fewer resources, is not.

, You might identify multiple physical barriers that could be removed to improve access to your business. However, your resources might be limited. In this situation, you can afford to remove some barriers but not others. The government recommends that you remove barriers in the following sequence:Provide access into the business from parking areas, sidewalks, or public transportation.
Provide access to your goods and services by, for example, lowering shelves or widening aisles.
Make public restrooms accessible.
Remove barriers to drinking fountains and other public amenities.

, Sometimes it is not possible to remove existing architectural barriers. For example, the door may be too narrow for someone with a scooter to enter, or it may not be possible to install a ramp. In this situation, you need to make sure that you provide alternate ways to use your business, if possible.


For example, a restaurant could provide take-out service.You need to advertise these alternate methods as well. Continuing with the restaurant example: you can mention on your flyers and other advertisements that take-out is available.

, A “certified access specialist” can look at your property and make sure that it complies with the ADA. Some states, such as California, have created a certified access specialist program.Don’t forget about your state and local laws. The ADA is a federal law, but businesses also must comply with local and state laws as well.In fact, your business typically must comply with detailed building codes at the state and local level.
For this reason, you should make sure that your access specialist checks that you have complied with all applicable laws and regulations.

, Barriers aren’t just physical. You also have to modify any policy or procedure that would act as a barrier to the disabled. However, you are only required to make “reasonable” modifications. You are not required to completely change the way that you operate. Identify policies that might prohibit a disabled person from using your business.


For example, a retailer might have a policy that only one person at a time can use a dressing room. Because a disabled person might need help, you should modify that policy to allow a second person to go into the dressing room.The ADA does not require that you hire a staff person to assist disabled people with getting dressed. That is an unreasonable modification and not required.

, Disabled customers may need help as they walk through your store. You should train staff to help them. If you only have one employee working at the store, then it might be unreasonable to expect your staff person to help the disabled. But if you have more than one employee, then you should train them on how they are expected to help:Help patrons with intellectual disabilities read labels and tags so that they understand what they are purchasing.
Assist blind customers move around the store.
Retrieve items that are out of reach for some patrons, particularly those in a wheelchair or scooter.

, Under the ADA, only dogs qualify as service animals, and they must provide a service directly related to the person’s disability—e.g., a person with low vision uses a service animal to help them avoid dangers. However, you are not required to allow service animals if they are out of control or not housebroken. If it is unclear whether the animal is a service animal, then your employees can ask only two questions:“Is the animal required because of a disability?” Don’t ask what the disability is.
“What has the animal been trained to do?”

, The ADA also requires that you communicate with people who have disabilities. This is a very complicated area of the law. Essentially, you must analyze the following in order to come up with an effective mode of communication:Complexity of the interaction. If you sell clothes, then your staff should be prepared to communicate with the deaf by writing notes. However, if you run a doctor’s office, the information you exchange is much more complicated. You may need to hire a sign language interpreter to communicate or perhaps install devices like large monitors on which you can display information.
Difficulty securing effective communication. You do not have to provide a sign language interpreter (or other communication device) if it would be an “undue burden.” This means that it would be very expensive or difficult to arrange. For example, if you run a dentist’s office in rural Alaska, it might not be practical to hire someone who can communicate in sign language. However, it is not an undue burden for a waiter to read the menu to someone with low vision.
Your resources. The ADA requires more compliance from businesses with greater resources. For this reason, installing a Braille translator may be too expensive for a small “mom and pop” establishment. However, the expense could be reasonable for a larger business.

, Title I of the ADA prohibits you from discriminating on the basis of disability in employment.Not every business is covered. To be covered, your business must have at least 15 employees who worked for at least 20 calendar weeks., It is illegal to discriminate on the basis of disability for certain covered employment practices. These covered practices include:hiring
pay
promotion
recruitment
training
leave
job assignments
benefits
lay-off
firing
other employment related activities

, The ADA doesn’t protect everyone with a medical issue. Instead, it offers protection only to people who are qualified to do the job and who meet one of these other requirements:A person is disabled if they have a mental or physical condition that limits a major life activity substantially, such as walking, talking, learning, hearing, or seeing.
A person is also disabled when they have a history of a disability (such as leukemia in remission).
A person can also qualify as disabled if you believe they have a mental or physical impairment that you expect to last more than six months and isn’t minor.

, You should be particularly careful about not discriminating during the hiring stage. Accordingly, you should train your staff not to ask inappropriate questions during interviews.You can’t ask any applicant if they are disabled or about the extent of any disability. However, you can ask them to show you how they will perform the job.
You also can’t require an applicant to take a medical exam before you extend a job offer. However, once you make an offer, you can require an exam if you ask other employees to take one. You can also condition the offer on the applicant successfully passing the exam.

, The ADA does not require that you do everything possible to hire and retain disabled staff. Instead, you only must provide “reasonable accommodations.” There is no bright-line definition of what qualifies as reasonable. However, you should consider the following factors:The cost. You should analyze not only how much it would cost, but your own resources. You also should consider whether you can get outside funding to help defray the cost, such as a grant or tax credits.
How disruptive the accommodation would be. If it would fundamentally change the business, then you don’t need to make it.
Alternatives which are less of a hardship on your business.
Whether the employee will pay. You must also give the employee a chance to pay for some or all of the accommodation if you think it is too burdensome.

, Often, a disabled individual knows what she or he needs for an accommodation. For example, a person with low vision might know that she needs a larger computer screen so that she can enlarge documents. However, sometimes you might not know how to accommodate a disability. In that situation, you should contact the following:The Job Accommodation Network, which you can reach by calling 1-800-526-7234.
Your nearest EEOC office. You can visit the EEOC website to check the location and phone number.
State or local vocational agencies. Look in your phone book.
Other organizations that serve individuals with disabilities.

, Most states also prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. Furthermore, these state laws will cover you even if you aren’t covered by Title I of the ADA. You should research and read your state anti-discrimination law.


For example, you might only have six employees. The ADA doesn’t cover you because you have too few employees. However, your state law might not have a minimum number of employees.

, You should discuss any employment-related issues with a qualified employment attorney. For example, you might not know if you are covered by the ADA. Or you might have a disabled employee you want to fire but need to know how to protect yourself against a lawsuit.


You should also think about getting an attorney on retainer, which means you pay the attorney a small monthly fee and he or she is always available to do legal work.See Find an Employment Lawyer for more information.

See an education specialist.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Keep in mind that learning is different for everyone.,
Embrace your learning disability.,
Focus on your accomplishments.,
Give yourself positive affirmations.,
Avoid judging yourself.,
Steer clear of overgeneralizations or negative comments.,

Communicate with people about your disability.,
Talk to a counselor.,
Join a support group.",How to Accept Learning Disabilities," You may not be sure that you have a learning disability. You may also not know typical symptoms if you do have one. Figuring out if you have specific signs allows you to actively and positively address them. It can also help you more easily accept any learning disability. Some of the most common symptoms of learning difficulties in adults and children are:Short attention span
Poor memory
Difficulty following directions
Inability to differentiate between or among letters or reversing letters
Poor reading and/ or writing
Poor coordination
Disorganization
Restless or easily distracted
Difficulty understanding words or concepts;
, If you have a learning disability or suspect one, you may feel alone or even embarrassed. You’re neither alone nor do you have anything about which to be embarrassed. In fact, learning disabilities are very common: up to 20% of Americans have one.Understanding how normal it is to have a learning disability can help you more readily accept your learning disability.


Look around a room in which you’re sitting. Count ten people and say, “Two of those people have learning disabilities.” Then expand this to the whole room. This can help you realize that many of the people sitting with you—some you may know—have learning disabilities like you.
Focus on others if you’re feeling down about your disability. For example, say, “I don’t get these instructions. Actually, Kate said she was having a hard time with them, too. Maybe she also has a learning disability. We could figure this out together!”

, Education specialists or psychologists can identify learning disabilities. Scheduling an appointment with either can identify your specific learning disabilities and ways to navigate them. This may help you overcome your disorder and accept it. The specialist or psychologist may:Monitor your progress
Establish benchmarks for learning
Explore developmental, social and school or work performance
Discuss family history
Test for academic achievement
Assess your psychological state

, If you suspect or have a learning disability, schedule an appointment with your doctor. A medical examination can identify or rule out possible causes of learning disabilities. This can help you get treatment as well as accept and work with your learning disability.Give your doctor any relevant information from your own assessment or professional opinions. This can help your doctor identify possible underlying causes of your disability.
Recognize that your visit may include a neurological and/ or psychiatric exam. These test for brain diseases or dysfunctions and emotional disorders.

, There are many different learning styles and people have to adjust to accommodate their styles.However, this does not mean that one style is better than another style. They are just different.


For example, some people learn best by using their hands and others learn best by seeing visual representations of an idea, such as diagrams, pictures, and other images.
Remind yourself that you have a different learning style from other people and that is okay.

, Learning disabilities are often present for life. Even if you work with your disability, it may stay a part of your life. Learning to embrace this can help you accept your disability.Recognize that your learning disability doesn’t define you. It can even make you stronger. You can have a full, active, and rewarding life with a learning disability. Keeping this in mind may help you more easily accept your learning disorder.
Think about some of the coping mechanisms you’ve developed to deal with your symptoms. This may help you realize that you’ve done a great job with the challenges you have had.Have faith in yourself, your abilities, and the ability to work constructively with your disorder can help you accept it., Your learning disability doesn’t define you. Every person has traits and accomplishments that are positive. Think about what makes you wonderful and how much you’ve done in your life. This can help you realize that you are not your disability and accept that it’s a part of what makes you a wonderful person.Make a list of everything you do well. This shows you that your learning disability is one small part of what you do and who you are.
Compose a list of special accomplishments that make you proud. For example, “I got the prize for getting the highest math scores this year,” or “I won a regional running competition.”
Remember that even something like, “I got a higher score than I expect,” is an accomplishment.

, Tell yourself something positive every day to build yourself up and boost your confidence. This can help you embrace and accept your disability.Some things you might say to yourself include:


“I might have a learning disability, but I am awesome at writing essays.”
“I may not have a knack for chemistry, but I am a talented dancer.”
“Sometimes my learning disability makes school difficult, but it doesn't hinder my relationships. I am a loyal friend and a kind person.”

, You may find that you judge or get upset with yourself if your disability affects something in your life. Instead of judging yourself for a perceived failure, acknowledge the problem and move forward. Realizing that one episode doesn’t define you can help you accept your learning disability., Instead of stating, “I failed that task, I’m so stupid and can’t do anything,” say, “I had a hard time with this because of my learning disorder. I did get some things right, though. I’m going to use this as a learning experience on how I can navigate away repeating the issue.”


See the positive in any situation. This can help you put the disability in perspective and show how capable you are. For example, tell yourself, “I keep having trouble crunching these numbers, but Sasha said she could see that I’m improving. Plus, she complimented me on my oral presentation skills.”

, There are many myths and misinformation about learning disabilities. Social stigmas may make you feel shame, stress, or anxiety. Some people may even make stupid comments to you because they don’t understand learning disability. Ignoring social stigmas and negative feedback can help you move on and accept your disability.Counter negative comments with information such as, “You know, people with learning disabilities have average to above average intelligence,” or, “Learning disabilities don’t mean I’m irresponsible, lazy, or unmotivated. They are caused by neurological impairments I can’t control.”
Tell yourself, “What other people think about me is none of my business” to help you cope with social stigmas and accept your disorder. Reinforce this with self-acceptance and self-love. For example, say, “I may have a learning disability, but it doesn’t have me. I have a lot to contribute to this world.”, Navigating a disability may require you to work harder to obtain certain information or to learn a skill. When you do this, make sure that you allow yourself to be proud of what you accomplished.


Try saying something out loud to yourself, such as, “I spent hours making flashcards for the big math exam and I am really proud of my effort!”

, The statement that knowledge is power can be valuable for accepting your learning disability and getting support. Educating yourself and those around can help you accept your disability. It can help others give you any support you may need.Use the resources provided by your medical or educational professionals. You can also use online resources to supplement your knowledge on learning disabilities. For example, the Center for Parent Information and Resources and the National Center for Learning Disabilities offers information a wide variety of information about learning disabilities. Many of these resources can give you added support to accept your disability., People may be unaware that you have a learning disability. This may lead to misunderstandings. Letting people know that you have a learning disability can prevent uncomfortable situations, questions, or even looks. Seeing that people are considerate of and support your disability can also help you accept it.Acknowledging your disability to others can help them and you accept it. A simple, “Hey Jack, I’m really looking forward to working on this together. I wanted to let you know that I often reverse numbers but that I am a great writer. If I make a mistake, don’t worry. We can catch it together and present our best work.”
Make sure your teachers, professors, bosses or others in authority know about your disability. They can help you work to your strengths and tackle any areas where you may need extra help.

, Learning disabilities are common, but people often avoid talking about them. No matter the cause or type of your learning disability, you may feel embarrassed or ashamed. You are perfect just the way you are, but you may want more help accepting your disability. Talking to a mental health professional can help overcome and accept learning disabilities.See a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. These professionals can talk through your feelings about your disability. This can help you cope with and accept your disorder in a positive and constructive way.
Be honest with your counselor. Remember the person is there to help you without judgment.

, The effects of learning disabilities can be life long, especially if you are having a hard time accepting them. A support group can provide you unconditional support from other people who understand how you’re feeling. Members of the group can also offer tips on coping with and accepting your disability.Be willing to openly discuss your feelings or ask questions about your disability.
Meet with general support groups for learning disabilities or one for individuals specific disabilities such as ADHD or dyslexia.
Locate local affiliates of organizations that promote the wellbeing of individuals with learning disabilities. For example, the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDAA) offers a location service at https://ldaamerica.org/support/state-local-affiliates/. Search for online support groups from groups such as LDAA or the National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCDD)."

Certify your service dog.",How to Train Your Service Dog Without a Professional Trainer," It can be difficult to know if a puppy under the age of 6 months has the right blend of intelligence and attention to make a good service dog. Charity's that train up service dogs, have a high 'drop out' rate, even when they have used their knowledge to select likely candidates.


Buying a puppy with the express purpose of it becoming a service dog is a gamble. It might be better to source a young dog which has been properly trained and has established their personality already.;
, Your service dog needs to be in good health in order to meet the requirements of the job. For example, if it has arthritis, and finds it difficult to move around, it is unfair to place the responsibility of responding to the doorbell on its shoulders. Also, some dogs with health conditions such as diabetes, have needs of their own and may not always be on top form to perform their service role.


You are going to invest a lot of time into training your dog, so you want to ensure it is kept in optimal health. This means twice yearly vet checks and weigh ins, a regular vaccination protocol, and proper preventative parasite treatments. Depending on where you live, this might range from flea and tick treatments to heartworm preventatives.

, These are the hallmarks of a trainable dog and will make the task of training easier and more enjoyable. Look for a young dog that approaches you calmly but without fear. His or her body language should indicate confidence, such as an erect tail, wagging, walking directly to you (not slinking around the edges of the room), and keeping its head up (not lowered and cowed).


The best service dogs are intelligent and eager to please, which often makes their size irrelevant. Any breed from a Chihuahua to a Great Dane can potentially fill the role if they have the correct temperament. , If its basic training is solid, ask the dog to sit and stay. Observe if it fidgets and looks around (easily distracted) or it keeps hits eyes on you (eager to please). Does he or she respond quickly or is it slow to react (not ideal in a service dog where quick reactions are needed).

, The dog needs to be confident in a range of situations and with all types of people. If it is anxious or fearful in certain situations this could place you in harms way. A fearful dog exhibits introverts body language such as cowering, averting his eyes, slinking in a submissive posture, holding his tail between his legs.


A fearful dog may lick its lips a lot, and if forced out of its comfort zone may growl. However, a confident dog will approach with an erect wagging tail, and willingly present himself or herself for petting.

, An aggressive, highly territorial or protective dog is unlikely to make a good service dog. You will spend more time trying to control the dog that he spends helping you.Aggressive dogs snarl, or raise their lips. Their hackles (the fur along the backbone) may stand on end. The dog may make direct eye contact in a confrontation manner and growl.
A docile dog, however, is all about wanting contact and is more likely to bang their head against your hand than exhibit distancing signals such as growling.

, All service dogs are neutered. This is because females can't work while in heat (you will be followed by a pack of dogs wanting to mate her) and males are more easily distracted by territorial issues. Also neutered dogs tend to be less aggressive, which is important for a service dog.


Spay or neuter your dog when they are between four and six months of age to prevent females coming into heat and distracted males. This works well as a general guide and is much less effort.
If you are experienced and will not have the dog near unfixed dogs at any time (not to be taken lightly), the ideal is between one and two years depending on when your dog's bone's growth plates close (usually earlier for small dogs and later for larger dogs). This enables the dog to have stronger bones, which is especially important for some kinds of service dogs that perform rigorous physical tasks for the handler (such as mobility assistance dogs).
Depending on the weight of your dog, a neutering costs between USD$200 and USD$300 at most vets.

, A service dog has to be able to sit, stay, lie down, and come on cue. The dog also needs to walk next to the handler in a controlled manner all the time. This is so that you have control over your dog at all times.


You can use either verbal cues or hand signals as commands. This is done by using a treat and holding it just in front of the dog's nose. Then raise the treat in an arc, backwards over his head. As he looks up to follow the treat, his bottom drops to the deck. Click, give the command word 'Sit' and then reward.Recall can be tricky if the dog is distracted, so start the lessons indoors away from other animals, or in an enclosed back yard. Call the dog to you, when he comes, click, repeat the cue word, eg 'Come', and reward. If the dog fails to come, or is tardy about it, never ever reprimand the dog. This only makes him more reluctant next time.
The foundation of training a service dog is the same as teaching good manners and discipline to a regular dog, except you take things a step further. Given the importance you may place on the dog to keep you safe, if you are not an experienced trainer, seek the help of a professional service dog trainer, so that you don't teach the dog bad habits or over tax it.

, The principle of clicker training is the use the click-clack noise to mark the exact moment of a dog's good behaviour and then give the dog a reward. The dog learns to associate the click-clack with a treat and works eagerly in anticipation of the down payment on a treat that the noise marks.The method advocates rewarding good behaviour, so that it is remembered and the dog wants to repeat the action to get a reward. On no account punish your dog, which only teaches him to be fearful of you, the trainer, and does nothing constructive towards your goal of training your own service dog. , The dog should have impeccable basic obedience both when the lead is on and not on.

, The service dog has to be focused on you, and not on anyone else. This step is vitally important because you may need instant help, and if the dog is running around to other people to greet them, the dog can miss your need for immediate help.


To do this enlist the help of a friend, and get them to approach slowly. Get the dog to sit and look at you. If the dog turns to look at the approaching stranger, your friend immediately stops in their tracks (whilst ignoring the dog). When the dog's attention returns to you, click and reward.
Repeat these training sessions and eventually the dog will learn that paying attention to strangers gets no reward (and is not worth doing) whilst concentrating on you gets rewards.
In addition, teach your dog to take no note of cats, food on the ground, a stranger talking to the dog or vehicles (especially moving vehicles). The one and only thing that the dog is supposed to care about is you.

, Under some circumstances, it's OK for your service dog to go and play. Teach your dog a cue that signals it's off duty.


To do this, perhaps invite a friend to come and visit. Have the friend bring along a dog toy, and when the dog looks in their direction, click, use the cue word 'play' and reward. This gives him the signal its OK to keep approaching.

, The specific tasks you might want to teach the dog will depend on your disability. If you are profoundly deaf, then teaching a dog to alert you to the doorbell ringing, a phone going off, or a smoke detector alarm are all useful ideas. Likewise, if you have mobility issues, you might want the dog to retrieve small household items for you, such as keys, a remote, or a phone.


Do this in small steps. For fetching keys, this would involve the dog recognizing the keys, picking them up, bringing them to you, and giving the keys. To teach the dog what keys are, place a set on the floor where it can clearly see them. When it goes to investigate, click, cue word 'keys', and reward. Every time it approaches the keys repeat the same routine. You will notice the dog becomes more proactive about approaching the keys, and at this point say the cue word 'Keys' and as he continues to approach, click.
Now you want to teach him to pick the keys up. Perhaps put a soft ball on the keychain so he can pick them up without damaging his teeth. Place the keychain in his mouth, click, give a cue word 'Hold', and reward. Repeat this regularly for several days. Now place the keys a short distance away, have the dog go to the keys, cue word 'Keys', and pick them up, cue word 'Hold'. Then use your recall to bring him back with the keys. Once he has returned, get him to sit and drop the keys. Perhaps offer him an extra tasty treat, one worth dropping the keys for. Click, cue word 'Give', and reward.
Keep the sessions short 5 - 10 minutes at a time, but work on it twice daily. Mix this in with other training and keep it fun, so that your dog doesn't get bored.

, Good manners are crucial for people accepting your dog and looking forward to you or other service dog teams coming back. This includes:


urinating and defecating only on command
leaving any interesting looking or smelling things alone (especially important in stores)
walking calmly in a heel position at all times in public (unless not being in heel is needed to mitigate the handler's disability)
never showing aggression to the general public or other service dogs.

, While it is not a legal requirement for your dog to be officially recognized as a service dog, it may decrease confusion while accompanying you into areas where dogs aren't usually allowed.


Be aware that there is no legal way or requirement to certify. If a website claims it's necessary for you to pay for a certification from a legal standpoint, it may be a scam.
Find out which is the governing body for that particular type of service dog (eg, is he a Hearing dog for the deaf, or a Guide dog for the blind) and ask if they have assessors who would be prepared to license your dog.
Get accompanying credentials that confirm you need the dog. This might be a doctor's letter explaining your disability and how the dog is crucial to your life.
Get a vet check and a letter of good character to say the dog is well-trained and in good health.
Send all the documentation to the appropriate licensing body and await their further instructions.

Be respectful, above all else.,
Never talk down to someone with a disability.,
Don’t use labels or offensive terms, especially in a casual way.,
Speak directly to the person, not to an aide or translator.,
Be patient and ask questions, if necessary.,
Don't be afraid of asking about a person’s disability.,
Recognize that some disabilities are not visible.,
Put yourself in the position of someone with a disability.,
Offer genuine help.,
Don’t play with service dogs.,
Avoid playing with someone’s wheelchair or walking device.,
Acknowledge that most people with disabilities have adapted.,
Avoid getting in the way.",How to Interact With People Who Have Disabilities," Someone who has a disability should be afforded the same amount of respect as anyone else. View others as people, not impairments. Focus on the person at hand and her individual personality. If you must put a ""label"" on the disability, it's best to ask what terminology she prefers and stick with the terms she chooses.In general, you should follow the “golden rule”: treat others as you would like to be treated.Many, but not all, people with disabilities prefer ""people first"" language,which puts the name or person before the disability. For example, you would say “his sister, who has Down syndrome” rather than “his Down's sister"".
More examples of appropriate people first language include, ""Robert has cerebral palsy,"" ""Leslie is partially sighted,"" or ""Sarah uses a wheelchair,"" rather than saying someone ""is mentally/physically challenged/handicapped"" (both of which are often seen as patronizing terms) or referring to ""the blind girl"" or ""the girl in the wheelchair."" If possible avoid these blanket terms when referring to people. While some people find the word ""disabled"" unpleasant, others use it to describe themselves because they feel erased by treating it like a ""bad word"", and their disability is part of who they are. Take your lead from the person you are interacting with. If they refer to themselves as ""disabled"", ask if they are comfortable being described that way or why they choose to describe themselves like this. It will help you gain insight into their perspective.
It's worth noting that labeling norms vary a great deal between people and groups. In particular, many deaf, blind, and autistic individuals have rejected people-first language and prefer ""identify-first"" language (for example, ""Anisha is autistic"").As another example, it's common within the deaf world to see the terms deaf or hard of hearing used to describe their disability, but the term Deaf (with an uppercase D) to refer to their culture or someone who is part of it.If in doubt, just politely ask the individual you're talking to what they prefer.;
, Regardless of being their abilities, no one wants to be treated like a child or patronized. When you’re speaking to someone with a disability, don’t use child-like vocabulary, pet names, or a louder-than-average talking voice. Do not use patronizing gestures such as patting her on the back or head. These habits communicate that you don’t think the person with a disability is capable of understanding you and that you equate her to a child. Use a regular speaking voice and vocabulary, and talk to her just like you would talk to someone without a disability.


It is appropriate to slow down your speech for someone who is hard of hearing or has a cognitive disability. Equally, it may be acceptable to talk to people who have hearing loss in a louder than average voice, so that they are able to hear you. Usually, someone will mention it to you if you are speaking too quietly. You may also ask whether you are speaking too quickly, or ask her to tell you if you need to slow down or speak more clearly if necessary.
Don’t feel like you have to reduce your vocabulary to the most basic words. The only time you may be asked to simplify your language, is if you are talking to someone who has a severe intellectual or communication difficulty. Baffling your conversational partner is unlikely to be viewed as good mannered and neither is talking at somebody who is unable to follow what you are talking about. However, if in doubt, speak casually and ask about their language needs.

, Labels and derogatory names are not appropriate and should be avoided in conversation with someone who has a disability. Identifying someone by her disability or assigning a label that is offensive (such as crippled or handicapped) is both hurtful and disrespectful. Always be careful of the things you say, censoring your language if necessary. Avoid names like moron, retard, cripple, spastic, midget, etc, at all times. Be careful not to identify someone by her disability instead of her name or role.


If you introduce someone with a disability, you don’t need to introduce the disability as well. You can say “this is my co-worker, Susan” without saying “this is my co-worker, Susan, who is deaf.”
If you use a common phrase like “I gotta run!” to someone in a wheelchair, don’t apologize. These types of phrases are not intended to be hurtful, and by apologizing you’ll simply be drawing attention to your awareness of her disability., It’s frustrating for someone with a disability to have to deal with people never talking directly to her if she has an assistant or a translator present. Equally, talk to a person in a wheelchair, rather than the person standing next to them. Their body may not be working fully, but it doesn't mean their brains aren't! If you’re speaking with someone who has a nurse to help or someone who is deaf and has a sign language interpreter, you should still always speak directly to the person who is disabled.


Even if the person doesn't have typical listening body language (e.g. an autistic person who doesn't look at you), don't assume that they can't hear you. Speak to them.

, It can be tempting to speed along a conversation or to finish the sentences of someone with a disability, but doing so can be disrespectful.Always let her speak and work at her own pace, without you egging her to talk, think, or move faster. Additionally, if you don’t understand something someone says because they’re speaking too slowly or too quickly, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Assuming you know what someone said can be detrimental and embarrassing if you mishear her, so always double-check.Someone with a speech impediment might be particularly difficult to understand, so don’t rush her to talk faster and ask her to repeat herself if necessary.
Some people need extra time to process speech or turn their thoughts into spoken words (regardless of intellectual ability). It's okay if there are long pauses in the conversation.

, It may not be appropriate to ask about someone’s disability out of curiosity, but if you feel this might help you make a situation easier for her (like asking a person if she would prefer to take the elevator with you instead of the stairs if you see she has trouble walking), it is appropriate to ask questions.Chances are, she has been asked about her disability repeatedly over her life and knows how to explain it in a few sentences. If the disability resulted from an accident or the person finds the information too personal, she will most likely answer that she prefers not to discuss it.


Assuming you know what her disability is can be offensive; it is better to ask than to presume knowledge., If you see someone who appears able-bodied parking in a handicapped spot, don't confront her and accuse her of lacking a disability; she may have a disability you cannot see. Sometimes called ""invisible disabilities,"" disabilities that cannot be immediately seen are still disabilities.A good habit to be in is to act kindly and considerately towards everyone; you can't know someone's situation by just looking at her.
Some disabilities vary from day to day: someone who needed a wheelchair yesterday might only need a cane today. This doesn't mean they're faking it or ""getting better,"" just that they have good days and bad days like everyone else.

, It may be easier to understand how to interact with people who have disabilities if you imagine having a disability yourself. Think about how you would want people to talk to or treat you. It’s likely that you wanted to be treated just as you are now.


Therefore, you should talk to people with disabilities as you would anyone else. Welcome a new coworker with a disability as you would anyone else new to your workplace. Never stare at someone with a disability or act condescending or patronizing.
Don't focus on the disability. It is not important that you figure out the nature of someone’s disability. It is only important that you treat her equally, talk to her as you would to anyone else, and act as you would normally act if a new person entered into your life.

, Some people are hesitant to offer to help someone with a disability for fear of offending her. Indeed, if you are offering help because of an assumption that someone cannot do something herself, your offer could be offensive. However, very few people would be offended by a genuine, specific offer of assistance.


Many people with disabilities are hesitant to ask for help, but may be grateful for an offer.
For example, if you go shopping with a friend who uses a wheelchair, you could ask if she needs assistance carrying her bags or attaching them to her wheelchair. Offering to help a friend is not usually offensive.
If you are not sure of a specific way to help, you can ask, “Is there anything that I can do to help you right now?”
Never “help” someone without asking first; for example, do not grab someone’s wheelchair and try to push her up a steep ramp. Instead, ask if she needs a push or if you can do anything else to make it easier for her to navigate the terrain., Service dogs are obviously cute and well trained, making them perfect candidates for cuddling and play time. However, they are used for helping the person with the disability, and are necessary for performing common tasks. If you take time to play with the dog without asking permission, you may be distracting the dog from an important task it needs to perform for its owner. If you see a service dog in action, you should not distract it by petting it. If the dog is not doing any tasks, you can ask the owner permission to pet it or play with it.Keep in mind though that you may be turned down, in which case you should not be upset or disappointed.


Don’t give a service dog food or treats of any kind without permission.
Don’t try to distract a service dog by calling it pet names, even if you don’t actually pet or touch it.

, A wheelchair might seem like a good place to rest your arm, but doing so can be uncomfortable or annoying to the person sitting in it. Unless you’re asked to help someone by pushing or moving her wheelchair, you should never touch or play with it. The same advice goes for walkers, scooters, crutches, or any other device someone might be using for everyday functioning. If you ever feel the need to move someone’s wheelchair, you should ask permission first, and wait for her response. Do not ask to play with someone's wheelchair, as it is a childish question and it may make the person feel uncomfortable.


Treat disability equipment like extensions of their body: you wouldn't grab and move someone's hand or decide to lean up against their shoulder. Behave the same way towards their equipment.
Any tool or device a person might use to help with her disability, such as a hand-held translator or an oxygen tank, should never be touched unless you are directed to do so.

, Some disabilities are present from birth, and others come later in life due to development, accident, or illness. However the disability developed, most people learn how to adapt and take care of themselves independently. Most are independent in everyday living, requiring little help from others.As a result, it can be offensive or annoying to assume that someone with a disability cannot do many things, or to constantly try to do things for her.If you help a lot of the time and in a childish voice,this may be annoying. Work under the assumption that the person can accomplish whatever task is at hand by herself.


A person who gets a disability as a result of an accident later in life may require more help than someone with a life-long disability, but you should always wait until they ask for your help before assuming they need it.
Don’t avoid asking someone with a disability to do a certain task because you worry they can’t accomplish it.
If you do offer help, make the offer genuine and specific. If you are offering from a place of genuine kindness, and not an assumption that the person cannot do something, you’re less likely to offend.

, Try to be courteous around people with physical disabilities by staying out of the way. Move to the side if you see someone attempting to navigate in a wheelchair. Move your feet out of the path of someone who is using a cane or a walker. If you notice that someone does not seem to be strong and steady on her feet, offer help verbally. Don't invade someone’s personal space, just as you would not invade anyone else's. However, if someone asks you for assistance, be prepared to give it.


Do not touch anyone’s equipment or pet without asking. Remember that a wheelchair or other aid is personal space; it's part of the person. Please respect that.

Read your policy.,
Complete your application.,
Get appropriate documentation.,
Work with your claims administrator.,
Consider consulting an attorney.",How to Apply for Long Term Disability Benefits1," If you have a private long-term disability policy and you've become disabled, your policy documents will explain the process for applying for benefits.


Your policy specifies the disabilities that are covered by your policy as well as how to file a claim. Make sure you are already seeing a doctor before you apply for benefits, since the insurance company will want proof of your disability and will need to review your medical records and discuss your impairment with your doctor.Look for the plan's definition of disability. This definition essentially outlines what you have to prove to be eligible for benefits under your policy.Certain conditions, such as those related to pre-existing conditions, or to drug or alcohol abuse, typically are excluded from coverage. Similarly, your benefits may be limited if your disability is based more on subjective complaints than on an objectively quantifiable impairment. Examples of such conditions include depression and fibromyalgia.Keep in mind that if your policy was provided by your employer, it is governed by federal law. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulates applications for long-term disability benefits under these policies.Under ERISA, you have the right to receive a copy of your plan description and policy documents upon written request.;
, Private insurers typically will have an initial application you must fill out to provide the company with information about your disability.


Use the information you learned from reading your policy to determine the type of information you must include in your application or claim form to prove to the insurance company that you are disabled and entitled to receive benefits.Make a note of all deadlines and make sure you've submitted your application and any related documentation by the dates provided. If you miss a deadline, your insurer may use it as an excuse to deny your claim., To qualify for long-term disability benefits, you must prove to your ensurer that you are no longer able to work due to a disability expected to last more than a year.


Your insurer most likely will request all medical records related to your disability, including any laboratory or test results, clinical notes, and exam reports.You might want to consider getting copies of your medical records yourself before submitting them to your insurer, so you know what they include and can analyze how this information might be used either to approve or deny your claim.Make sure you submit all documents requested, particularly medical evidence, as soon as possible after it has been requested. This ensures you won't miss any deadlines and decreases the changes that the insurance company will deny your claim.You might consider getting your doctor to write a letter supporting your application for benefits. Your doctor can explain your disability and how it limits your ability to work.Keep in mind that your doctor may charge a fee to write a detailed report of your disability and medical history for you, but generally this fee will be worth it if the letter significantly increases your chances of receiving long-term disability benefits.While your doctor's opinion is important, you also need objective proof of your disability and its effect on your ability to perform your job., Your claim will be assigned to a claims administrator, who typically is someone who works for your insurance company.


Your claims administrator may contact you for additional information or to request documents or contact information for your doctors or other health care providers.
Keep in mind that most private insurers who approve you for long-term disability benefits also will require you to apply for Social Security benefits. If you are approved for Social Security disability, the insurance company is only responsible for amounts your Social Security benefits don't cover., Because ERISA claims are complicated and frequently denied, you may want advice from an attorney who specializes in ERISA and long-term disability claims.If you apply for disability and are denied, you have the right under ERISA to sue the insurance company in federal court. However, it is exceedingly difficult to convince a court to overturn an insurance company's denial of benefits.Keep in mind that an attorney can not only help you submit an application but knows how to maximize the chances that you will be approved for benefits."

Accept yourself.,
Practice writing.,
Amp up your typing skills.,
Work on your fine motor skills.,
Talk to people.",How to Cope with Having Dysgraphia1," Denying the fact that you have dysgraphia, or any disability for that matter is simply going to worsen things for you. Know you have a disability, but don't think of it as a necessarily negative thing. Think of yourself as different, think of yourself as unique. Just because you cannot express your thoughts on paper as legibly and coherently as everyone else doesn't mean you are any worse than any other person.Having a disability is not something you can control so it is often helpful to treat it as you would any medical condition. Learn about the symptoms and find ways to address them without negative self judgment. This type of disability has nothing to do with intelligence and should not be seen as a sign of lowered IQ.;
, Devote some time every day to practice forming letters, and writing in a comprehensible manner. This may sound strange, but it is extremely helpful to people with dysgraphia. You wouldn't be able to write in a neat, comprehensible manner overnight, as it obviously takes a lot of time, but you might get there.


Writing practice can help to strengthen the muscles as well and improve the overall writing.Keep in mind that it might be faster to develop alternate methods of expression, such as typing or dictation.

, For dysgraphic people, typing is a much easier task than writing by hand. Become proficient at typing as soon as possible. You can use this at home for yourself and in school if you can get accommodations.


Even for assignments that are required to be hand written you can ask for an accommodation to be allowed to type your work based on the disability. You have the right to reasonable accommodations., Dysgraphia doesn't necessarily just alter your writing skills; it can affect your hand-eye coordination and your motor skills immensely, as well. It can even affect some of your abilities to put things in order and memory as well., If you feel bad about being dysgraphic—and you shouldn’t--express your feelings through communication. This will help to lift your spirits and make you feel as if you aren't any different from anyone else.


Talk to fellow dysgraphics, especially. Ask them how they cope with it. You mind find out something helpful!
Check scores with other people. If you think you are being discriminated against, ask other people what they got points off for on a given assignment, and if they did many of the things you got dinged for without losing anything.

Check if your state offers benefits.,
See if you qualify.,
Notify your employer that you are disabled.,
File a claim.,
Provide follow-up information.",How to Apply for Short Term Disability Benefits2," Currently, only a few states require short-term disability benefits: California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii. The benefits differ depending on the state. In Hawaii, for example, employees can get up to 26 weeks of temporary disability benefits. In California, workers can get up to a year in benefits.The amount of the benefit differs by state. In California, benefits are 55% of the wages the employee earned in the year before applying for benefits. New York employees can receive 50% of their average wage (up to a cap).
Some of these states mandate that employers purchase private short-term disability for their employees from a private insurer. Do not be surprised if you have to file a claim with a private insurer.

, Each state also has different qualifying criteria. You must meet the criteria in order to qualify. To find your state’s requirements, you should check with your Department of Labor.


In Hawaii, for example, employees must have worked at least 20 hours a week for a minimum of 14 weeks. They also must have been paid at least $400 in wages per week., You should tell your employer that you need to apply for short-term disability benefits. Your employer should then provide you with the appropriate form to complete.You will probably need the help of your doctor and employer to complete the form.You should give yourself plenty of time to get all of the necessary information in order to submit the claim in a timely manner.

, After you have completed the application form, you should make a copy for your records and then mail the completed form to the appropriate office.The appropriate office may be your employer or the employer’s insurance carrier. In some states, you must return to the form to the state Department of Labor.Don’t wait. You must file a claim in a timely manner. In New Jersey, you have 30 days from the first day you became disabled in order to file.In California, you have 49 days., You may be contacted to provide additional information. You should respond as soon as possible so that there is no delay in processing your claim.


Otherwise, a determination should be quickly, depending on your state. In Hawaii, determinations are made within 90 days.Check with your state’s Department of Labor.

The SSA will assist you in requesting additional documentation if it is needed.Keep in mind that the more documentation you can provide to back up your claim that you are disabled, the greater the likelihood that your application will be approved.

, You can complete a long-term disability application online, by calling the SSA's toll-free telephone number, or by visiting your nearest Social Security office in person.The Disability Starter Kit includes a link to the online application. You also can apply either by calling 1-800-772-1213, or by scheduling an appointment at your local SSA office.If you want to apply in person, you can find the location and phone number of your nearest SSA office by using the SSA office locator at https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp.
The application requires you to provide details about yourself, your disability, and your work and income history. Generally, you must prove that your disability prevents you from performing work in your field, and that there is no other work available to you elsewhere that you could perform., If you apply online or over the phone, you still must submit certain documents to verify the information you provided in your application.


You should send your documents to your local SSA office, and include your Social Security number with the documents so SSA staff can apply the documents to the correct application.Keep in mind that you must send originals, not copies, of many of the required documents. You should send these documents using certified mail with returned receipt requested so you know when the office receives your documents.Once the SSA reviews your originals, it will make copies and send your originals back to you. However, if you don't feel comfortable sending original documents through the mail you can always take them down to your local SSA office in person., It can take between three and five months for the SSA to process applications for disability benefits.


After your application and all supporting documentation are received, a medical and vocational expert will review your materials and determine whether you qualify for long term disability benefits.You may be contacted by an SSA representative if further information is required to process your application, or if you need to complete additional medical examinations.Keep in mind that if the SSA requires you to complete a medical examination, you won't have to pay any money for it. You are, however, responsible for keeping the appointment., Especially if your application is denied, you may want to get advice and assistance from an experienced Social Security disability attorney.


Keep in mind that long-term disability applications frequently are denied and must go through the appeals process. An experienced Social Security disability attorney understands and can help guide you through this process.
If you are concerned about the cost of an attorney, you might consider checking with your local legal aid office. Nonprofit organizations dedicated to assisting disabled people also may have legal resources or recommendations for attorneys who provide services for free or using a sliding-fee scale based on your income.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of dysgraphia.,
Have your child professionally tested for dysgraphia.,
Refrain from assuming that dysgraphia is a minor problem.,
Understand that dysgraphia is not lethargy.,
Do not force anything upon your child.,
Be supportive and positive towards your child.,
Get accommodations.",How to Cope with Having Dysgraphia2," In general, dysgraphia impairs a person’s handwriting and fine motor skills. There are various signs that can help you spot dysgraphia in your child so that you can get professional help. Common signs of dysgraphia include:Illegible cursive or print handwriting
Inconsistencies in handwriting, such as upper and lower case letter, combinations of print and cursive, irregular sizes or shapes of letters
Unusual grip and/or complaints of a sore hand
Slow or labored copying or writing
Strange wrist, body, or paper positioning
Unfinished or unformed letters or omitted words

, If your child shows some of the common signs, then get them tested for dysgraphia. Testing can confirm that your child actually is struggling with this condition and inform health care providers and teachers on how to help.


Testing for dysgraphia includes IQ testing, educational testing, tests to measure physical muscle control for handwriting and creating writing samples to be examined for spelling, letter spacing and sizing., Dysgraphia can give any student an extremely difficult time at school. It is not a widely known disorder, but that doesn't mean that it should be overlooked.

, Your child's notes are incomplete and written shabbily solely due to the fact that they do not have the capacity to write in the same manner as everyone else, and not due to laziness.One way to help a child overcome the effects of dysgraphia is to ask their school for help with keyboarding and accommodations to use computers for assignments.

, Be encouraging towards them, but don't force them to keep practicing writing, and don't reprimand them if they don't master writing quickly. Let them get the hang of it at their own pace.Children with dysgraphia are often experiencing difficulty writing due to physical muscle control issues and the fact that their brain just works differently. It can take more practice and time for them to learn things that may come easy to others.

, Make him or her feel good about the effort being put towards improving handwriting. Praise your child using phrases like “Good job” or “Nice try” when you see he or she is trying as hard as he can. You might also incorporate a few strategies at home to help your child with handwriting. These include:Allow the child to feel the letter rather than seeing it. Trace a letter on his back and see if he can repeat it on paper.
Help him improve his pinching grip through the use of common household tools like tweezers or chopsticks.
Ensure he gets adequate exercise to improve muscle strength and coordination. Effective activities might include shooting basketball, rope-climbing, or doing planks and push-ups.
Suggest that your child record his thoughts and ideas on a device before trying to put them down on paper.

, Look up 504 plans and Individualized Education Plans , or IEP. You will probably have to fight the school to get one of these, so look up how to do so as well. Having adequate evidence in the form of assessments and consultation reports from various specialists can help you get your child the accommodations he or she deserves."

Help raise awareness.,
Tell your own story.,
Keep getting educated about the condition.",How to Cope with Having Dysgraphia3," Raising your voice about your own or a loved one’s experiences with dysgraphia can start a conversation about this condition. If everyone started talking about it, the condition would be more easily recognized in schools and workplaces and people can learn how to better support those living with dysgraphia. Sharing what you know with others can go a long way., There will be people who will try to tell you that you are perfectly normal and don't need any help. If they are right, you don't need to be reading this article. Gently correct the ones who mean well, and be wary of the ones who don't mean well. They will be the main opposition force in your life, along with the people who simply don't want to deal with you (and there will be those too). Know what you need and make it happen. Teachers will find it much harder to fight you in person, every day, then fighting your parents over e-mail and phone once a week.

, Take some time to learn more about both the educational and workplace rights for people with disabilities to protect yourself or your loved one with dysgraphia. There are many resources available for children and adults who are either students or employees."

Recognize that a disability means changes, but it won't ruin everything.,
Keep all your doctors' appointments.,
Tell the people around you the truth.,
Get a strong support network.,
Meet the disabled community.,
Maintain your hobbies or get a new one.",How to Cope with Being Newly Disabled1," Many disabled people can live happy and meaningful lives.;
, A doctor can help you evaluate your condition and find ways to keep your health in good shape. Don't give up and start skipping them now.

, It will make for a better situation if they understand how difficult this is for you.

, It's important to have people around you who care about you and can help you through hard times. Open up to them. It's okay to be vulnerable, and it's okay to ask for support. In the long run, you will be glad you did.

, People with disabilities get together on the internet, in support groups, and through disability organizations. Find other people who are going through similar situations, so you can share advice and support each other.


They can show you by example that it's possible to be happy and disabled at the same time.
Consider getting involved in a disability advocacy organization if you feel strongly about it.

, It might be the perfect time to experience something you were always meaning to do.

"
"
Try support groups for people with disabilities.,
Look for disability-related clubs and activities.,
Visit disability communities online.,
Volunteer at a disability event.",How to Get More Disabled Friends1," There are support groups for specific disabilities (e.g. cerebral palsy), groups of disabilities (e.g. mental illnesses), or disability in general.


Make sure that you qualify for the group before you go. For example, if the group is only for people who have Down Syndrome, and you are the mother of a child with Down Syndrome, this is not a space for you.;
, From the Special Olympics to a social group to people with ADHD, there are plenty of recreational groups that focus on disability.

, You don't have to limit yourself to in-person friendships; the internet can be a great way to meet people like you.

, Many people with disabilities will show up to disability-related events, either as beneficiaries or as volunteers. Look for a positive, inclusive event tailored towards people with disabilities.


Make sure the event is disability-friendly first! Some disability organizations exploit disabled people instead of helping them. Check with the disabled community to make sure that people with disabilities actually support the event.

Understand that disability is not the same as going on unemployment.,
Consider these questions: What would happen to you if you could no longer care or afford what you once considered a basic necessity?,
If you have no family nearby, you will need to turn to friends.,
Talk to a lawyer, if you deem it necessary.,
File for disability.",How to Cope with Being Newly Disabled2," One day, should you become injured or sick enough, you may need to face a disability. It is a drastic life changer.

, Do you have money put away in an account? Do you have a place to live safely, with no threat of losing your home? Can you count on your parents/friends/other family members? Have that discussion now.

, It may be hard to do.

, You may need to seek paid legal help. Lawyers can pick which cases they will take. The good ones work on a percentage, but others may want a lot upfront to help you.

, Filling for disability on your own is not easy, but you can do it. (It is a necessity if you don't have any income.) You will need to visit all of your main doctors and have them fill out a report. Getting copies of your medical records may cost you a fee and it will take time. Find out if there is a best time of month to submit the completed paperwork.


A decision about your disability can take 3-12 months or more. Enclose a well written letter explaining your health issues and how you had worked as long as possible. Your application will be evaluated by ""their"" doctor(s). The doctor will ask you several questions and it will only take about fifteen minutes. Then you wait to hear something.

Learn to live within a budget.,
Stop eating out.,
Evaluate living with pets and decide if you can afford them with your new lower income.,
Find discounts when you can.,
Turn down the heat and AC as low as you can.,
Skip the name brands, make your own Christmas and birthday gifts, learn to trade, barter, swap chores with friends and neighbors so you don't have to pay a repair technician.,
Look for ways to get things for free.,
Break it to the kids.",How to Cope with Being Newly Disabled3," If you are approved for disability you may expect to have only a fraction of your income to live on. Check into your benefits and get the facts for your own situation. Is going on disability your only option?

, Pay your rent, taxes, water and power bills first. Your secondary bills can wait.

, Many people feel their pets are a companion they can't be without, but they need food and medical care too. On the other hand, it is often difficult to find someone who will take an older cat or dog.

, Stock up on sale items, buy clothes only at the end of the season, drive your car until it drops, go to discount food stores, use coupons, or buy sale products in bulk.

, Treat yourself to one thing you can't live without, (such as TV, computer, and phone) and substitute that cost for something else (such as entertainment).

,


If you can make handmade items, participate in free craft shows to sell your work.

, See if the gym has a slow day/time you can get in for just an hour for free, use the library computers, DVDs, books, magazines. Go for walks, listen to the radio, enjoy nature, help a child to read, volunteer, call a friend, offer to go to the grocery for some elderly friend if you are able. Re-organize your stuff and donate unused items.

, Mom is no longer the ATM. (Don't be surprised if you need the kids to pay a bill to avoid a disconnect.) It's okay!

"
"
Show the same respect that you show to non-disabled people.,
Find common ground.,
Make plans together.,
If you aren't sure about their needs, just ask.,
Accept their differences.",How to Get More Disabled Friends2," People without disabilities sometimes treat disabled people as childlike, and this attitude can come across as condescending and very annoying. Talk to them like a real person.


Use your regular tone of voice. Don't modify your voice in pitch, volume, or speed unless they tell you they're having trouble understanding you.
Don't bend down or treat them as if they are younger than they actually are. Their only ""real age"" is their chronological age.
Speak directly to them, not to their translator, aide, or family (even if they don't exhibit typical listening body language).
Ask before helping them. Sometimes a disabled person really does need help, but other times they can handle things on their own. Ask before you jump in to the rescue.
Don't play with their service dog, wheelchair, tablet, or other accessibility device/animal without their clear permission.

, Disabled people are people like anyone else, with unique interests and passions. Ask questions about their hobbies, plans, and favorite things. When they mention something you like, say you like it too, and talk about that thing together.

, Some people with intellectual, developmental, or cognitive disabilities may have trouble initiating tasks and planning things. Thus, you might need to take initiative by suggesting an idea first, and handling most of the planning and logistics. Suggest a get-together, talk back and forth about what you want to do, and then help them work out the details or do it on your own.

, It's okay to ask how to accommodate them and be helpful. As long as you're polite and respectful of their feelings, it won't bother your friend. Here are some examples of ways to ask politely:


""Would you like me to escort you across the street?""
""I've heard that sensory issues often come along with autism. Will you need to sit in a quieter part of the restaurant?""
""Do you have any needs I should be aware about?""
""I'm curious about cerebral palsy. What would you say are the biggest misconceptions about it?""

, Your new friends may behave in ways that seem unusual to you, and may have needs different from yours. This is okay. Let them be themselves and don't worry about it.


If they are seriously upsetting you or invading your personal space, let them know.
Look for the beauty in their uniqueness. Maybe your friend with Down Syndrome has the most beautiful eyes, or your Autistic friend waves her hands and squeaks because she's so happy to see you. Appreciate them for who they are.

Note any reasonable accommodations you might need.,
Follow up with the employer a week after you have handed in the application.",How to Find a Job if You Have a Disability," One of the best ways to determine your abilities and skills is to consider any previous jobs or positions you held as a disabled individual. Many employers will look at the demands of your recent past work and compare them to their requirements and needs in a worker. Think about any work you did for pay or profit and how long you did this work.If you are currently working, and make $1,090 US a month, you generally are not considered eligible for disability coverage by the US government.If you are not currently working, the hiring agency or employer will send your disability application the Disability Determination Services office. They will then ask doctors about your medical condition, how it limits your activities, and what treatment you are receiving.Your disability will then be confirmed by the government and you will have proof of your disability.;
, Consider how your medical condition affects your ability to do certain work-related activities like sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling.You should also think about how your condition affects your ability to complete manipulative and postural activities like reaching or handling large objects, using your fingers, stooping for objects, balancing objects in your hands, climbing stairs or ladders, and kneeling or crawling.
For example, if you are confined to a wheelchair, you may not be able to complete certain work-related activities, or you may need assistance when completing these activities. You may also have certain techniques to help you reach for objects or lift objects.

, Your employer will want to know how well you maintain concentration and attention in a workplace, and your ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions.You will also need to be able to respond appropriately to your supervisors, co-workers, and clients. There may also be changes or adjustments in your work setting during your time at a company or organization. Consider how you cope with change, and shifts in your environment.If you have a condition that limits your ability to see, hear, or speak, note this so you are prepared to respond to questions about your mental abilities in an interview with an employer.

, Some conditions may make you sensitive to certain environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes or certain substances in the workplace.For example, you may have respiratory issues that are aggravated by humidity in the air or dust and fumes. Or you may have hearing issues that are irritated by noise or vibrations from moving machinery. You may also have a discomfort working at heights or with certain odors.
Identifying your comfort level with these factors will ensure you only pursue work positions that will suit your condition and not harm you in any way.

, There are several online hiring agencies and services you can access to help you find positions and employment opportunities, including:GettingHired.com: An online resource for people with disabilities seeking employment that connects disabled individuals with employers committed to hiring people with disabilities, career services departments and disability advocacy groups.Hire Disability Solutions: Provides career services for people with disabilities, veterans, their family members, and others who face challenges in their lives.ABILITY Jobs: This site has an extensive database of employers for job seekers with disabilities, and a resume bank where employers can seek talented people with disabilities looking for work.

, Temporary agency employment is a great way to get back into the workforce, gain skills, and reorient yourself to the current job market. Two of the largest temporary agencies are:ManpowerKelly Services, The Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) does not award grants to individuals with disabilities.But there are several helpful government programs and resources for disabled individuals seeking employment.


USAJOBS.com is a great resource for individuals with disabilities looking for employment through the government.The US government also runs a program called Selective Placement that give federal agencies incentives to hire individuals with disabilities. Qualified applicants can be placed in federal agency jobs without going through the competitive placement process.The Workforce Recruitment Program, co-sponsored by the Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy and the Department of Defense, connects postsecondary students and recent graduates with disabilities with positions in the federal government.
The Pathways Programprovides employment opportunities and internships for students and recent graduates, including those with disabilities, in the federal government.

, Working from home can be a useful option for individuals who have difficulty with transportation, long work hours, or who need to maintain specific work schedules.Positions like online tech support, quality control, and over the phone customer support are all potential at home careers. Be wary of online scams advertising high paying work from home opportunities. Look for an employment network (EN) in your area to start searching for legitimate jobs for people with disabilities.There are several programs and non-profits that look for telecommuting positions for individuals with disabilities. A comprehensive database of these programs can be found here.

, Some individuals with disabilities find starting their own business or working for themselves is the most flexible way to generate income and maintain long term employment. If you are thinking about starting your own business, look at entrepreneurship resources online, specifically those that focus on small business owners with disabilities.You can also complete a self-employment assessment to determine if you have the skills necessary to start your own business., In the US, private employers with at least 15 employees must follow the American Disabilities Act, and cannot discriminate against a “qualified worker with a disability”. The ADA also specifies what counts as a disability, and how these disabled workers are protected by law. Most employers will require proof of your disability and coverage under the ADA. This can be in the form of a simple letter stating you have a disability from your doctor, a licensed medical professional, a licensed rehabilitation professional, or any entity that issues or provides disability benefits.The letter does not need to detail your medical history or your need for an accommodation in the workplace.

, Though the ADA law prohibits an employer from discriminating against you based on your disability, it doesn’t require the employer to lower her hiring standards.You will need to meet the same education and experience requirements as the other applicants, unless the requirements are discriminatory. For example, they may specify no applicants with disabilities or less hours or pay for individuals with a disability.

, Look at the job description or list of skills required for the position. You should make sure you can do the basic job duties that are necessary for the position, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Under law, your employer should be able to provide any reasonable accommodations you require to complete the job.Don’t worry if you may not be able to do nonessential functions, for example, if you are applying to be an office receptionist, you will rarely need to lift 25-pound boxes of paper. As long as you can perform the essential functions, you are protected from discrimination.

, A big consideration should be if the job fulfills your financial obligations as an individual with disabilities that may require physical therapy, medication, or other medical needs. Some employers may specify an hourly or salary wage for the position as part of the job description.


You can also search for a salary estimate on salary.com.This site takes the job, location, and cost of living for a region to provide a report on salary expectations.
Once you have an expected salary estimate, compare this amount with your yearly budget. Confirm the position will fulfill your financial needs.

, Disclosure, or sharing information about your disability with others is a personal decision that individuals must make for themselves. You are not required by law to disclose your disability on your application or during the job interview.The only appropriate time to disclose your disability on an application is if the employer is actively recruiting employees with disabilities. You can note this by the Affirmative Action statements on the application form.During your interview, an interviewer cannot ask you questions about your disability that are not relevant to the job responsibilities. The interviewer should only ask you questions about your qualifications and how you can perform the essential functions of the job.There are risks to disclosing your disability to a potential employer at any point of the hiring process. But most disability specialist recommend that applicants disclose their disability after the job offer. This gives you time to learn about the job and to prove yourself to your new employer., Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities. Types of accommodations can include:Assistance during an interview or any training sessions
Modifications of positions responsibilities or the work environment
Opportunities to telework or telecommute
Other adjustments to allow you to enjoy the benefits of employment
To receive accommodations at work or during the application process, you need to disclose your disability and share it with the employer. They should then take the necessary steps to meet these accommodations once you are employed.

, Once you submit your application, you should follow up with an email or a phone call to check on the status of your application. Try to speak directly with the employer or with a Human Resources representative about your application."

Practice math with your child.",How to Cope With Dyscalculia1," Dyscalculia can cause a lot of anxiety and self-esteem issues for children who suffer from the disorder. They may feel that they are unable to do math at all or that their peers are too far ahead for them to catch up with. Whenever you are helping a child deal with dyscalculia, you'll want to help ease any anxieties about math and help them see that they can overcome the difficulties of this disorder.It's a good idea to acknowledge how difficult math can be for the child and talk to them about dyscalculia.
Offering praise whenever a child attempts to work on math assignments can reduce anxiety and boost self-esteem.
Focusing on a child's strengths can be a good way to help them see that they have plenty of talents to be proud of.;
, As you go about your day with a dyscalculic child, try to ask them basic questions about math or numbers. Keeping them engaged in this way will help them get in plenty of practice and become more familiar with mathematical concepts. Try some of these examples to help keep a child practicing and working to overcome their dyscalculia.If you pass a clock, you can try asking them what time it is.
Try asking the child to count out exact change for you when buying something.
If you're on a walk with the child, ask them to count things that you might see. For example, you can ask them to count the number of dogs in a dog park or how many cars are parked near you.

, There are plenty of games that you can play with a dyscalculic child to help them practice and improve their math-based skills. Many of these games involve simple mathematical questions and will help expose your child to numerological concepts that they might be struggling with.

At New Year's make sure you don't do the traditional self-denial style of resolutions.",How to Persevere With a Disability," Especially talk to people who share your disability and have lived with it for years. They know a lot about its emotional and social challenges as well as a host of runarounds for your physical limits.;
, You're given time to vent, and do so as your please. But when asked questions: make sure you listen to them and really think about the answers. Sometimes these questions can lead you into new ways of looking at your life.

, Try to break it into the multiple different problems that exist. How to get along with an unpleasant relative is not the same problem as how to get disability benefits. How to survive on a fixed income is not the same as how to get along with your roommate. Some of these problems may connect with each other but once you sort out the different ones, you can look at each of them separately without feeling overwhelmed. Success in dealing with any of them can make it easier to face the others.

, What happened has happened. Try to figure out why it happened. What sort of events took place that changed your current situation?

, Get a glass of water if you're on edge or frustrated. Let it all out. All of it. Then take the time to practice breathing and move forward.

, Use logic to solve your problems.

, Take time away from worrying about your problems to focus on a distraction like a good movie or a book. When you take time off from worrying, sometimes your unconscious mind can come up with a solution better than you'd think of consciously.

, Don't put anything negative on the list. Do include everything you think is cool like your taste in clothes or music, your political opinions, your talents and abilities, your experiences. The list will be a lot longer than you think it is with more important things on it than you expected.

, This is easier said than done if some of them are people you have to depend on for necessities. If so, start looking into alternatives and independent living. It's almost impossible to deal with anything else when you live in a dysfunctional relationship. The dysfunctional person will create drama and an urgent emotional crisis anytime you try to accomplish anything because that might mean you won't be as dependent.

, This is true in the helping professions as well as in family relationships. Find a good counselor. Seek support groups and read self help books. Understand and apply assertiveness rather than aggression, passivity or passive-aggressive tactics. Seek help to get out of dangerous and destructive situations.

, Don't expect yourself to be perfect or not feel the pain. It's better to grieve, be real and let the feelings go. Anger can be turned into positive action if you think through practical things you can do to improve your life.

, Grief is a process, not a lifetime. Eventually what you have to live with being disabled will become the ""new normal,"" things you're used to all the time don't hurt as much. Instead you'll have good days and bad days as often as anyone else. Getting used to it is hard but don't get used to having a low opinion of yourself - that just isn't right. You had some bad luck being disabled but that's all it is, not a character flaw or a deserved punishment. No one has a right to disrespect you or abuse you. Seek real help if they do.

, Date your efforts. Chart your progress. Pat yourself on the back for every bit of progress. A daily achievement of any kind can do a lot to help rebuild self esteem or maintain it. Make sure it's something you want to do rather than just doing what other people tell you to.

, Listing goals and gradually achieving them does a lot to improve anyone's life. Daily achievements can add up to something good. Monthly goals might be to improve function with your disability, expand your social life, spend more time with loved ones, read books you always wanted to get around to reading, etc. Make long term goals like ""become self supporting again"" or ""become an important volunteer at my church/club"" but don't set a date for them - just keep them in mind and work toward them with daily, weekly and monthly goals.

, Set an annual goal that's either so easy you know you'll do it like ""watch 12 movies I always wanted to see"" or so pleasant that you know you'll do it without saying how often, like ""Spend more time with friends."" Most people make self defeating New Year's resolutions but this is depressing - you can't afford self denial when life already denied you ordinary things everyone else takes for granted. You're better off reaching for things you enjoy enough that they'll improve your life from the first time you add them to your goals. ""Enjoy life more"" might be the best one.

, Disabled people often experience the misfortune of others speaking for them and over them, and you can avoid doing this by learning what they think. Here are some examples of misconceptions that the disability community discusses:


Insistence upon only person-first language when many (but not all) disabled people prefer identity-first language (""disabled person"").Using appropriate language shows respect.
Inspiration porn—""This girl is smiling despite the horrible horror of having two prosthetic legs, so all your struggles are invalid.""Widespread support of harmful organizations, such as Autism Speaks., You may have unwittingly absorbed negative attitudes, so education can call them to your attention and allow you to act with acceptance. Here are some examples of stereotypes:


Conflating disability and deathDisabled people as violent, evil, etc.Disability caused by mental weakness or laziness
All disabled people being childlike or asexualDisability being constant suffering; disabled people being incredibly strong for having accomplishments/leaving the house/breathing

, Be sure to read from disabled women, disabled people of color, disabled LGBTQIA people, disabled heavier people, et cetera. An end of ableism means access for all disabled people, not only the straight white male ones.

, As you read, it's important to reflect and evaluate yourself. What have you been doing that helps? What have you been doing that hurts?


Have I done this harmful thing that the writer describes? Next time, what could I do instead?
Have I been dismissive or disrespectful towards disabled people?
Do I harbor negative attitudes towards people with physical disabilities, mental illnesses, or cognitive disabilities? Do I think of them as worthless, criminal, lazy, or disgusting?
Do I know how to be polite towards disabled people? Should I read more about good manners?

, It takes time to understand new things. You will mess up sometimes, and you may be called out for it. Apologize sincerely, carry on with kindness and grace, and forgive yourself. The fact that you made a mistake is less important than how you responded to it.

They will probably know the support groups out there, and can help you find one to address your particular needs and concerns.Some major CP organizations include the March of Dimes, Cure CP, the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, and Reaching for the Stars., Look for groups like volunteer organizations, community centers, churches, or even public libraries. These groups can be especially helpful in finding local support groups. Places like libraries and churches may even host a support group, giving you a place that may already be familiar and comfortable.Some CP organizations that have local chapters that may already be in your area include United Cerebral Palsy (UCP), The Arc, Easter Seals, and Parent to Parent USA., The internet provides a variety of options when looking for support groups. In particular, this will also help you find online-only support groups. These use chatrooms, message boards, forums, and other online tools to allow people to connect and communicate without having to go to meetings, or even be in the same place.Another way to use online searches is to get a list of organizations and support groups, then check them with your other sources. They may be able to more specific advice about certain groups rather than stating the ones that they are most familiar with.
Online support groups can be good for people who are more comfortable remaining anonymous, or want to get information from a larger network of respondents. If it is difficult for you to get out of the house and go to meetings, these can also be effective ways to communicate with others while remaining at home., Some are smaller groups dedicated to sharing information between people and providing emotional support. Other groups focus on fundraising for research or advocating for more public support. The support group you join needs to fulfill your needs, so look at what different groups try to do for their members., Once you have found some CP support groups, you will want to make sure that you are joining a group that fulfills your needs. Different organizations provide certain services depending on the level at which they operate, so make sure you find a group that provides what you are looking for.Larger national organizations provide support groups and social networks for parents, and work to raise money for research and public advocacy. Along with their local networks, they may also hold larger events which can expand your support circle. Some of these organizations include the March of Dimes, Cure CP, and Reaching for the Stars. Reaching for the Stars also founded the CP Kids Coalition, a place for kids with cerebral palsy to meet and talk.
Some groups organize local chapters for more direct help. These groups will have support groups along with a variety of available resources to help those with cerebral palsy live normal, healthy lives. Some of these include United Cerebral Palsy (UCP), The Arc, Easter Seals, Parent to Parent USA, and Family Voices.
Make sure you find out when and where these groups meet in your area. When you join a support group, you’ll want to take full advantage of what they offer, which you can’t do if you don’t regularly show up to meetings and events. Make sure the group is located in a place you can get to, and will feel comfortable talking in.

, Some groups are set up to provide medical and emotional support specifically for children suffering from CP rather than for a parent or family member who acts as a caregiver. Different groups may also have medical professionals there as well to provide additional information., Online support groups can be good for people who are more comfortable remaining anonymous, or want to get information from a larger network of respondents. If it is difficult for you to get out of the house and go to meetings, these can also be effective ways to communicate with others while remaining at home.Online groups will have social networks for people to communicate, as well as a set of links to other kinds of products and services. They tend to be most helpful for parents and other caregivers. Some of the biggest are Special Needs Moms for Moms and Mommies of Miracles.

, If your support group has regular meetings, make sure you go to them. The point of the support group is to share experiences and provide mutual support. Once you have a place to go, show up and let people know you want their help and want to help them.


Support groups can do a variety of activities, including social gatherings, equipment swaps, and workshops. Taking part in these events is a great way to learn new information and get to know your fellow group members better., Many of the issues surrounding cerebral palsy are going to be fairly common across sufferers. Your story may be difficult, but it isn’t unique. Other people have probably gone through the same or similar experiences, and will use the support group as a way to share things that worked (or didn’t). Pay attention to the kinds of issues they address. This will help you deal with similar problems, or prepare yourself to handle them in the future.Some groups also include health professionals, who can provide more scientific advice. Talking to a medical professional in this more informal setting help you feel more comfortable when discussing issues during an appointment in a hospital or doctor’s office.
Some of the important advice you can get from members of a support group includes recommendations on doctors and other health care workers, certain milestones or signs you should be watching for, and even advice on how to deal with legal difficulties.

, Some of the main purposes of a support group are to relieve stress and let people know that they are not alone in struggling. Sharing your good experiences can help others facing similar problems, while talking about your struggles may give someone else the opportunity to share how they overcame the issue.Remember that about 764,000 children and adults currently have cerebral palsy in the United States, and about 10,000 babies born each year will develop it. Considering both those who suffer and those who take care of them, that is a lot of people who will recognize what you are going through and be able to give good advice., If existing nearby support groups just aren’t providing the emotional or material help you and your family need, consider starting your own group. Talk to other people in your area or circle of friends who might need the kind of support you are thinking about to make sure you will have potential members. Figure out a time and place to hold your meetings, and make sure people know to show up.You may find it easier to consult a national organization, like UCP or Easter Seals, to discuss setting up a local chapter if one doesn’t exist in your area.

Keep a calculator handy.,
Try using graph paper to organize your mathematics.,
Use colors to identify different parts of an equation.,
Create and use reference sheets.,
Keep reference books handy.,
Try using online tools to practice your math skills.,
Approach math problems from different angles.",How to Cope With Dyscalculia2," For many dyscalculics, doing any math or arithmetic mentally is a serious challenge. To help reduce the difficulty of mental mathematics, it's a good idea to carry a calculator with you. Your calculator will help you to remember the numbers you are working with and produce an accurate solution to the problem you're solving.A simple pocket calculator could help with basic, daily math.
Most cell phones will have a basic calculator app.

, If you find it difficult to keep track of the parts of an equation, you may want to use graph paper. Using graph paper can help keep each part of your equation in order and can also help you to isolate difficult sections. Try using graph paper whenever you are doing arithmetic or mathematics to make the problems a bit easier to work with. Keep each number or operator in a square on the graph paper.
Keep equations in the same row.
Keep numbers in the correct column, aligning them with the value place.

, If you need some help keeping track of your equations, try getting a box of colored pencils or highlighters. Color coding your math problems can be a simple way to help you keep track of the various elements in the problem. You can use whichever colors you like, so long as they help you remember the parts of the equation.Each operator should get it's own unique color.
Number groups can be given a color. For example, 1 and 2 in the equation 1+2=3 could be colored red, while the sum of 3 could be blue.
You can make a small color key to help remind you of which colors you've assigned.

, Many dyscalculics have difficulties memorizing formulas or parts of the equations they are working with. If you have trouble remembering how certain numbers, equations or operations act, you can try making some reference cards. These cards can help you quickly recall how to handle a difficult part of your mathematical work. You might try creating a large sheet that contains many references.
You could make smaller reference note cards that contain single references to specific formulas.
You can carry these reference cards with you to provide quick help to math problems.

, Although you may be able to create some useful reference cards, you might not be able to write down everything you need on them. Because of this, it's a good idea to have a few mathematical references or textbooks handy. These books will allow you to look up any issues you may be having trouble with and can help you to solve difficult problems., There are many mathematical tools and learning opportunities available online for you to use. These tools will help you practice your existing math skills and acquire new ones. Whatever level of skill you are currently at, try using online tools and courses to help you overcome dyscalculia and build your mathematical capabilities.Many online tools and courses are free.
The wide range of courses will allow anyone at any skill level to practice.
Some courses and tools are developed specifically for people with dyscalculia.
You can find a list of courses and tools at http://www.dyscalculia.org/math-tools


, If you are having trouble with a concept or specific problem, looking at it from another perspective might help you get past it. Seeing the problem in a new way can help you rethink the question and find the solution. The next time you're stuck on a math problem, try thinking about it a bit differently to help you successfully solve it.Memorizing formulas or tables can be a serious challenge for most dyscalculics.
Focusing on the concepts behind mathematical operations can be more helpful.
For example, memorizing a multiplication table might be extremely difficult. It might be easier to understand the underlying concept behind multiplication. Take the example equation 5 x 2 = 10. If the 10 was doubled, that would mean 5 x 4 = 20.

Recognize the five types of dyscalculia.,
Look for the symptoms of dyscalculia.,
Get tested for dyscalculia.",How to Cope With Dyscalculia3," Although dyscalculia is generally described as being a singular learning disorder, there are actually five subtypes. These subtypes will all have their own unique symptoms and conditions. Knowing these subtypes can help you plan for your specific needs and successfully cope with dyscalculia.


Type 1 dyscalculics may be able to grasp some basic functions of math, but will have difficulties with higher mathematics.
Type 2 dyscalculics are capable of doing mathematical operations, but may take much longer than their peers.
Type 3 dyscalculics will have significant difficulty understanding time or sequence. This type of dyscalculia is rare.
Type 4 dyscalculics have troubles with memory, which can affect their mathematical capabilities.
Type 5 dyscalculics cannot grasp numbers conceptually and will have difficulties connecting them to real world objects or situations.

, Dyscalculia is not simply having trouble doing math. Dyscalculics have a learning disorder and will often display specific symptoms and traits regarding math or numbers. You will need to speak with your health care provider or a psychologist to learn if you have a case of dyscalculia. However, discovering some of these common traits associated with dyscalculia can help you work with your doctor to learn more about your condition:


Difficulties understanding mathematical operations and concepts such as decimal places, doing sums, making change or counting money.
Troubles with reasoning, making it difficult to follow processes or understand how abstract ideas relate to concrete examples.
Issues memorizing the meaning of mathematical symbols, formulas or instructions in math textbooks.
A large gap between your performance in math-related and non-mathematical subjects. People with dyscalculia may do well in school overall--especially in non-mathematical subjects such as history or literature--but their grades will be disproportionately poor in math or math-based classes like algebra or physics.

, Cases of dyscalculia will be diagnosed by a psychologist. There have been tests developed that can help discover which type of dyscalculia you may have, as well as the severity of it. Talk with your health care provider to learn more about dyscalculia testing.Your school may offer psychological examination services.
Many initial tests will aim to rule out other conditions that could be causing any difficulty grasping mathematical concepts.

Treat disabled strangers with the same common courtesy you'd extend to anyone.,
See the person and their disability.,
Listen when disabled people when they talk about their disabilities.,
Avoid assumptions.,
Recognize that their abilities may vary from day to day.,
Ask about their needs as relevant.,
Respect their problems and emotions, visible or not.,
Treat their disability as natural.",How to Fight Ableism as a Nondisabled Person2," Look them in the eye (if they are open to eye contact), and address them directly using a normal vocabulary and tone of voice. Basically, treat them like you would a non-disabled person, with courtesy to any individual needs.


If you feel the urge to stare, give the person a smile instead. Then continue what you were doing.
Avoid pitying remarks such as ""I'll pray for you"" or backhanded compliments like ""you're so pretty for a girl in a wheelchair.""
Don't ask about their disability if it isn't relevant; they don't need to answer the same questions 15 times every day.

, Their disability is a part of them, so it's unfair to pretend it doesn't exist or get mad at them when they need accommodations. You can like and respect them as a person while acknowledging that their disability exists.

, They understand their own bodies and experiences best. Good listening skills are always important, but especially when talking to people who are often talked over.


Assume that the disabled person is trying their hardest to manage their disability and get the help they need.
Remember that they know more about their disability than you do.
When in doubt, ask ""Are you looking for advice, or just a listening ear?"" They'll appreciate it.

, You can't usually assess the degree of someone's disability just by looking at them or talking to them for 30 minutes. Disability is complex, so trust them when it comes to their needs—they are the experts on themselves.


Some people use mobility equipment or alternative communication to make difficult tasks easier (e.g. a wheelchair user who can walk short distances or a partially verbal person who only uses sign language sometimes).
People can have disabilities without ""looking disabled.""
Not all disabled people perfectly match the textbook definition or popular stereotype.

, Level of difficulty can change based on many things—stress, the weather, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves yesterday—some of which are highly variable or not even understood by the disabled person. When in doubt about their needs, just ask.


A wheelchair user who shows up walking with a cane today is not necessarily faking it or ""getting better."" He is probably just having an easier time walking today.
An autistic woman who is normally full of hugs may not be able handle the input when she is stressed. Don't take it personally if she says no.
A depressed person can smile and laugh at a party and feel miserable the next day. This is nobody's fault.

, If you mean well and intend to help, most disabled people are glad you asked. This can allow them to be more comfortable or safe, and they'll trust you to respect their needs in the future.


""Do you have any needs that I should be aware of in general?""
""Should I move this chair out of your way?""
""You mentioned that you have PTSD from sexual assault, and this movie has a pretty intense sex scene. Would you prefer to watch something else instead?""

, Many disabled people don't discuss how deep their troubles run—it's often personal, and they don't want to upset you. If they say something is really hard for them, then assume it is, even if you don't personally witness them struggling.


People with chronic pain and other disabilities may have an excellent poker face.
Respond with compassion if they have a panic attack, meltdown, psychotic episode, or other breakdown. (Call one of their loved ones if you don't know what to do.)

, This can be an enormous relief to people who have to put up with others treating them as burdens or curiosities.


Accommodate without a fuss. ""Loud noises hurt your ears? Okay, I'll shut the door more quietly from now on.""
Don't make a big deal out of difficulties. ""Huh, there's no wheelchair ramp here. That stinks. We could get takeout and eat it at the park, or should we try that Chinese place instead?""

Amplify disabled voices on social media.,
Celebrate disability awareness/acceptance events.,
Work on removing ableist language from your vocabulary.,
Fight the idea that strong emotions are a sign of weakness.,
Call out or call in your non-disabled friends when they do problematic things.This can be a huge relief to disabled people, so they don't have to constantly bear the burden of educating others.,
Be respectful and mature when called out.,
Treat everyone with compassion.",How to Fight Ableism as a Nondisabled Person3," Pass along that ""Disability Manners 101"" article or ""How to Help a Depressed Friend"" PDF. You don't have to be disabled to share disability resources! This is an easy way to educate people and promote understanding attitudes.

, This can educate people who don't have the specific disability, and provide emotional support to those who do. Your friend with Down Syndrome may light up when you dress up in blue and yellow to celebrate World Down Syndrome Day.


Check with the disability community before celebrating an event, in case it is run by a harmful group or promotes dangerous ideas.

, Stop calling people who disagree with you crazy, willfully ignorant people deaf or blind, foolish people -tards, or anyone stupid. These all refer to people with disabilities.They imply that disability is insulting, and that disability is antithetical to agreeing with your or having a reasonable opinion., The idea that suffering should be hidden contributes to mentally ill people's reluctance to seek help, and hinders understanding of all disabled people's problems.


Mentally ill people and autistic people can experience especially strong emotions.
Men face additional pressure not to appear ""weak"" or ""girly."" Rigid gender roles are not good for anyone. Treat men's emotions as worth sharing, and consider your own prejudices.

,


""Hey, that language is really hurtful to people with disabilities. Please don't use it.""
""That's not fair. Would you treat a non-disabled person the same way?""
""How do you think a Deaf person would feel if they heard you saying that?""

, Calling others out can be a very scary thing to do (especially for disabled people), and you need to make it clear that you're a safe person. Listen, apologize, and work on doing better.


If you cannot accept criticism with grace, then you are probably not ready for activism.

, You never know who is disabled, nor do you know who is struggling or having a really bad day. Give second chances when people make honest mistakes. Treat people as having equal human dignity, no matter how difficult it is for them to pass a test or brush their own teeth. All people, disabled or not, deserve respect.

Get educated about your child’s disability.,
Find out what programs and accommodations are available.,
Participate in support groups to learn from other parents.,
Stay involved at your child’s school.When your child is diagnosed with a learning disability, he or she is in dire need of an advocate to ensure that they are treated fairly and receive the same education as all other children.,
Identify how to help your child thrive.,
Set realistic goals for progress.,
Stick to a routine.,
Try to stay positive.,
Gather a network of supportive family and friends.,
Avoid falling into self-pity.,
Confide in someone about your feelings.,
Eat well and exercise regularly.,
Practice stress-management.",How to Parent a Child With a Learning Disability," When you first learn of your child’s learning disability, the problem may seem insurmountable. However, when you learn more facts about children with learning disabilities, especially those that grow up to be fully functioning, you can gain the confidence you need to make smart decisions and support your child.


Many people think that learning disabilities only relate to specific subjects, like math, language, reading, or writing. However, they can affect higher level processes that are less obvious, including time management, organizational skills, focus and concentration, short- and long-term memory, reasoning, etc. Research is vital to understanding the intricacies of their disorder.
Organizations like the Learning Disabilities Association of America have a host of resources accessible to parents who have recently had a child diagnosed.Such organizations is a great place to start gaining more information.
You can also reach out to your child’s therapist, pediatrician, school counselor, and teachers to learn more. Call attention to your concerns by saying ""I don't know much about this disability. Can we schedule a time when you can sit down with me one-on-one and answer some of my questions?"";
, Once you have gained more information about the specific type of learning disability your child has, you can look into different services that can offer assistance. Each learning disability will require specialized services to help your child function in school and at home. Search for programs regarding your child’s learning disability through national and local/regional organizations.For example, if your child has been diagnosed with dyslexia and you are struggling to make ends meet, the Dyslexia Services Foundation helps connect families with experienced professionals who can evaluate and treat children from low-income backgrounds.In America, every state has a Parent Training and Information (PTI) program designed to help parents learn about the legal rights associated with children with disabilities. These programs also give you access to special programs, services, and resources available in your area.Other options include private tutoring for school subjects, individual therapy specific to their disability, and special schools (or classes at school) meant to accommodate and rehabilitate those with disabilities.

, As a parent, it’s easy to feel isolated and alone in your journey of parenting a learning-disabled child. When you take part in parent groups, you are able to connect with other parents who understand what it’s like to raise a special needs child. In these groups, you can learn insider information about approaches that help and also learn about additional community resources from other parents.


These groups exist within local communities and online. You can search Facebook for ""parents of children with X disability"" and usually find numerous groups. Websites specific to each disability also often include discussion boards/chat rooms.
The Parent to Parent Program exists to match parents of children with the same type of disability. In this group, you can participate in a one-on-one relationship with other parents who can share a wealth of information and experience with you.It may be nerve-racking to speak about your child's learning disability with a stranger, so be forthright about your uncertainty. Say: ""I've never done anything like this before, but I want to help my child in any way I can. How does this work?""
Though parents often become pseudo-experts, remember that you are speaking with a non-professional and always consult with your child's treatment team about anything you want to change or try.

, You are your child’s advocate, which is why being informed about your child’s LD is so important.


Work with your child’s school system to determine appropriate objectives for your child, modify his or her Individualized Education Plan (IEP), and share new research of effective approaches.
Communicating with your child’s school may be stressful, but remember to maintain a goal-oriented focus and be persistent in getting your child’s needs met.
It's often a good idea to set up a meeting with your child's school counselor mid-semester to see how they are doing and avoid any surprises.

, Everyone has a learning style that is personal to them. This is the way that a person retains and comprehends information best. Figuring out how your child learns the best can help you and your child’s school maximize progress in the classroom and at home. Children can be visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners. Visual learners work best by seeing or reading information. They perform well when info is given visually through notes, charts, pictures, and directions.
Auditory learners work best by listening. They perform well in oral environments where they can hear info, such as in classroom discussion and study groups.
Kinesthetic learners work best by moving around in the environment. They perform well during hands-on activities, such as labs and field trips.
You can also learn more about your child's learning style by observing in the classroom and during other aspects of life. What's your child's personality? How does his/her shyness or gregariousness affect learning? When does he/she seem to be most engaged? Take time to watch your child and use your observations to inform teaching approaches., Goal-setting is essential to success in all areas of life. It is equally important for children with disabilities. When you set realistic goals, your child has something to strive for, while still accounting for setbacks as well as the limitations of the LD.Before discussing goals with your child, run them by your child's therapist or treatment team to ensure they’re realistic. This way you can avoid setting the child up for failure by choosing unreasonable goals.
Sit down with your child and come up with a few short-term and long-term goals that he or she can work towards. Include various action steps under each for how to accomplish the goal. Set a reasonable deadline for achieving it. Come back often and evaluate your progress and modify goals as necessary.
For example, a child with dyscalculia has difficulty with math. You can set a goal for learning the amounts of different coins and bills. Then, you can progress to adding money and then subtracting.

, Since your child has to devote an undue amount of focus and concentration on their deficits at school and at home, you can help them function in other ways by making sure they follow a regular schedule. Doing so can help your child learn in a natural and structured way while reducing confusion and overwhelm.A routine helps your child set realistic goals, adopt consistent behaviors, and improve in difficult tasks and subjects. For instance, waking and rising at the same time each day and completing chores/tasks in a set order can help your child feel more secure. When things are constantly changing, it can be hard for a learning-disabled child to catch on, causing a dive in his/her self-confidence.

, A positive attitude is central to seeing progress in your learning-disabled child. It can be hard to look on the bright side when you are questioning why your child is the one who is struggling. Still, take things a day at a time and always remember that there is a positive side to everything. For instance, you may be distraught because your child is struggling in school due to an LD. However, you may want to express gratitude that your child is otherwise healthy.
Maintaining a positive outlook may be challenging, but it helps to look to your child's strengths. What are some things he/she is particularly good at? In what ways has he/she demonstrated progress? Pay attention to these things rather than what's not working or how far you still have to go.
Be sure to wear that positive attitude outwardly so that your child and others can see it. This will help your child have more confidence and help others see them in a positive light, which will work to their advantage.

, Both you and your child will benefit from surrounding yourselves with positive people. Be sure to identify those who have been a help to you and your family and show appreciation. Don’t be afraid or too prideful to ask for help or comfort when you need it.Protect your child from family members who are hypercritical, negative, or controlling, even if they’re well-intentioned.
In addition to building your own support network, encourage your child to develop strong friendships. Also, model to them how to ask for help when it’s needed. You can even practice by role-playing situations when your child may need assistance and teaching them how to ask for it.

, Practice empathy instead. Pitying yourself or your child can be a detriment to positive change and progress. Feeling like a victim prevents you from taking the necessary steps to improve you and your child’s situations. Overcome the need for self-pity in you and your child by:Practicing empathy and compassion for yourself without viewing yourself as a victim
Looking to your strengths in difficult times
Recognizing every small victory or mark of progress
Looking around you at the struggles of others to help provide perspective
Reading inspirational stories of people who have overcome obstacles and thrived
Volunteering your time or resources to others

, Being isolated will only make you feel worse. And, when you’re not feeling great, you are not able to fully support and advocate for your child. Pay attention to how you are feeling and be willing to share these feelings with others who care about you.


For example, you may keep your thoughts and feelings inside about a financial strain never knowing that, if you only just spoke up about it, friends or family would be willing to help you take care of a bill or expense.
Confiding doesn’t just mean asking for help. It also means venting and releasing frustrations onto others so that you don’t feel so alone. You can reach out to a sibling by saying ""I'm really stressed out after learning about Peter's diagnosis. It would be nice to have a listening ear. Can we have coffee and talk about it?""
If your feelings have crossed over into symptoms of depression or acute anxiety, contact a therapist for your own self-care.

, It is particularly significant to support your body and mind during the stressful road ahead. Make an effort to eat 3 to 5 healthy, balanced meals daily. Incorporate some kind of physical activity into your schedule most days a week.


Make it a family affair and include your child, spouse, or other children in regular exercise.Research shows that physical activity have been shown to increase physical fitness and self-esteem in children with learning disabilities., Find healthy ways to manage stress and negative feelings so that you are in tip-top shape for your child. It’s easy to get lost in caring for your child and forget to care for yourself. However, you cannot pour from an empty cup. Your child will be so much better off if you are rested and relaxed.Remember to take time out for yourself. Get enough sleep each night (and encourage your child to do the same). Engage in activities that you enjoy. Go on a date with your partner or spouse. Notice when you need a breather and have the courage to ask for it.

Find a trained music therapist.,
Sing along to music.,
Tap out a rhythm to the music.,
Write songs.,
Move to the music.,
Discuss your experience after the session.",How to Treat Speech Impediments with Music Therapy1," Music therapy should be performed under the direction of a trained musical therapist. These music therapists have been educated in the best practices for each speech impediment and are up-to-date on the latest research.When treating speech impediments with music therapy, many times the music therapists will collaborate with a speech therapists. The speech therapist will help the music therapists focus on words or speech skills that need to be worked on through music.You can search online for music therapists in your area. Websites like Musictherapy.org provide services to help you find a music therapist. If you are already working with a speech therapist, you may ask her for a referral since she may already collaborate with a music therapist.;
, For many speech impediments, you can sing songs to help begin repairing your speech. This can take many forms. The key idea is to put words to melodies, which activates a different part of the brain and helps unlock words and speech in the brain.For example, if you have a stutter, your music therapist may get you to speak your words along to a melody. You may also read something you have written down that you want to say along to a melody.
Another example of singing to help speech is to start singing the tones or melody of a song. After becoming familiar with this, you can then say words or phrases along with the music, using the rhythm and melody to help you produce speech.
You may also be able to tap into your memory and sing familiar songs to help you bridge the gap between the sides of your brain. Singing these familiar songs can help you start building your speech abilities again.
Singing along to songs can also help you learn how to slow down and breathe correctly, which may help with some speech impediments., In some music therapy treatments, a person taps out a rhythm on a drum or similar surface. This helps the person feel the rhythm of the music. Then, the person speaks sounds or words that the speech therapist instructs.Combining the rhythmic tapping helps the person gain the right rhythm. This taps into the music part of the brain, which helps stimulate the lyrical part of speech so the person can vocalize in the tempo like a song.
Speaking to this tempo also helps a person learn breath control.
Combining bodily movements with speaking may help a person feel like he has control over the situation, his body, and his mind.

, Another aspect of music therapy may include songwriting. Writing songs allows a person with a speech impediment to put words and feelings down. After writing the song, the person works on using the melody of a song to vocalize those words.Writing songs helps a person gain control over his speech by vocalizing his own words instead of someone else’s.
Songwriting is a creative outlet through which a person can express himself. This can help relieve stress and anxiety.

, Many people combine dancing with music in music therapy. Dancing helps your body find a rhythm which your mind then responds to as it sings the words.Instead of tapping a rhythm on a drum, you can get up and move around. This may include tapping your foot to the music, swaying your body, or going through rhythmic dance moves., Many music therapy sessions finish with a discussion or communication afterwards. You may be able to express what you felt through the session, including things that frustrated you or made you happy.Since music therapy is individualized, the discussion afterwards is a good time to tell your music therapist if something isn’t working for you. If you want to listen to music instead of sing for a session, let her know. If you want to move around instead of tapping a drum, discuss that with her.

Remove distractions.,
Set aside a block of time.,
Listen to familiar songs.,
Practice speaking along to music.,
Create different playlists for different moods.",How to Treat Speech Impediments with Music Therapy2," You can try music therapy at home for your speech impediments. You can use it to relax and reduce anxiety connected to your speech impediment. When you do music therapy on your own, make sure to remove all distractions. This time should be about you focusing on the music.Focusing on yourself can help you clear your mind of negativity or blocks.
If you have been going to a music therapist for your speech impediment, you can do some of the exercises your therapist gives you, like rhythmic singing or repeating words or phrases to a melody.

, To get the benefits of music therapy at home, make sure you give yourself the proper time to do it. You should take about 20 minutes to really get into your music. This gives you a nice amount of time to work on speech drills, practice singing, or other music-speech exercises.This length of time should help you get to whatever mental place you want to be.
Make sure that 20 minutes is distraction free. Devote that time to only your music.

, Since the part of the brain that houses your memorized songs and lyrics is different from the speech part, listening to familiar songs can help you work on building your speech abilities.Put on songs with words you have memorized or that are familiar. Practice trying to sing, say, or hum the words.

, Choose some of your favorite songs. You may also want to choose soothing, relaxing songs. Use these songs to practice your speech skills by singing your words.Because singing is easier for many people with speech impediments, you can try singing your words instead of speaking them.
You may also write down words and read them as you sing them to the melody of the music.
Practice repeating phrases or sounds along with the music to improve your speech ability.

, Think about the music you enjoy and like. Think about the music that lifts your mood or relaxes you. Put together playlists for these different moods so you can use them during your personal music therapy sessions.For example, if you need to relax, find music that soothes you instead of excites or depresses you. These songs might be instrumental, soft, or slower than a lot of the songs you listen to.

Know that music therapy is individualized.,
Understand how singing connects with speech.,
Know that results vary from person to person.,
Understand that music therapy can be used at any age.",How to Treat Speech Impediments with Music Therapy3," Research surrounding music therapy is in the beginning stages. Many clinical studies have shown positive improvement and response to using music therapy with a wide array of speech problems.However, music therapy has been found to be a highly individualized treatment. This means that no music therapy will be the same for anyone.Music therapists, oftentimes along with a speech therapist, study an individual’s case and determine what the correct type of therapy might be.
The kind of music therapy depends on your speech impediment. Someone with a stutter may have to only sing words, while a person who has lost the ability to speak may have to tap into a memory of a song or tap out a rhythm on a drum as he learns how to speak again.
Discussing your specific condition with your music therapist, or having a family member discuss it for you, can ensure you get the individualized treatment you need for your condition.

, For people who have speech problems, whether it is complete loss of speech or a stutter, singing may be able to help. The lyrics and melody of a familiar song, like a person’s favorite song or “Happy Birthday,” is kept in a different part of the brain than words used for speech. Additionally, lyrics and melodies are kept in the memory, which allows a person the ability to recall them without using the speech part of their brain.Because it’s easier for people with speech impediments to sing memorized songs to a familiar melody, this acts as a starting point to building speech and word usage again.As a person sings, the other side of the brain starts to build and strengthen as words are recovered.

, Music therapy affects everyone differently. Some people fully regain their ability to speak, others can only speak in a sing-song melodic voice, while others are only ever able to learn a sentence or two.Since research is still developing for music therapy and each case is individualized, a person’s response to music therapy will vary.

, Music therapy is used for people of all ages. Since it works for a variety of speech impediments, music therapy is beneficial for those just learning to speak, those trying to overcome speech impediments like stutters or lisps, or those who have suffered brain injuries that affect their speech.


Young children who are just learning to speak can benefit from music therapy to help improve their speech abilities and peer relationships.Older people who suffer from dementia, stroke, or even alzheimer's may benefit from music therapy to help them regain speech capability."

"
Educate Yourself.,
You could start with the sites listed under the Sources and Citations section in this article, buying books or borrowing them from your local library, taking a psychology course or speaking to a medical professional (if this is something which is an option for you).

,
If possible, keep yourself informed on any psychological treatment they might be receiving.,
Assist the person with scheduling, recording its use and especially remembering to take the prescribed medication.,
Communicate with the person in non-aggressive ways.,
Acknowledge their thoughts/feelings verbally -- but without agreeing or disagreeing with them -- and try to speak to them in a comforting way.,
Consider joining a support group.,
Don't neglect your own needs.,
Be aware of the social stigma that is attached to individuals with mental health disorders.",How to Support Somebody Living With Schizophrenia," Learn as much as you can about the condition. By doing so, you'll gain a lot of useful insight into the types of difficult things that sufferers of this disease experience and how it affects them on a regular basis. There are various ways of doing this, including online research.;
,, If you are a relative or partner/spouse of the person, keep up regular communication with the mental health professional who is providing this, so that you can take an active part in supporting this treatment.

, This is a very important part of aiding the person, as skipped medication doses -- especially if this happens regularly for any reason -- can lead to further problems. Encourage them as best as you can to take it on time, if at any point they forget or for some reason don't want to take it -- unless it's apparent that in some way the medication is having unwanted side effects/making the patient feel worse, in which case seeking appropriate medical advice is advisable.

, In the event that you are ever on the unexpected receiving end of hostile/disturbing behaviour from the person during a psychotic episode -- remember that they are experiencing things beyond their control at that time (which can be in the form of delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking) -- as a result of how this illness affects their brain. Avoid arguing with them or trying to convince them that what they are experiencing is not real as this is unlikely to help.

, Be as calm and patient with the person as you can.


If this doesn't help, and the person gets agitated to the point where they are resorting to violent behaviours/putting their own life at risk, seek appropriate medical help by calling emergency services and explaining the situation.

, Find out if there are any which are local to you. This is another good way of finding out valuable information about the disease and an opportunity to meet and connect with others who are going through the same types of difficult experiences as you.

, Remember to take good care of yourself too. In order to be a positive support source for others, it's important to ensure that your own physical and psychological health states are also as good as they can be.


If at any time you are feeling that this situation is starting to have a negative impact upon either or both of your personal health states, you might want to consider counseling and/or taking a break at some stage and letting a relative or professional carer help out with caring for this person -- if caring for them is something you do on a daily/regular basis.

, Your friend or relative may not receive fair and unbiased treatment when looking for a job or in other social situations. Educating others that the person with a mental illness is rarely dangerous and has the same emotional needs as any other person can help. In other cases, be aware that some will refuse to make allowances for someone with mental illness, and though that is illegal and inhumane, it is difficult to address. Find supportive employers, family and friends and avoid those who have difficulty being understanding and accepting of those with mental illness.

, Use a mobile app or an online web tool that allows you to track what you eat. Awareness is the first step in changing unhealthy eating behaviors. Therefore, if you get an idea of what foods you are eating and when, you can come up with a strategy to prevent emotional eating before it happens.Jot down the foods you are eating and the times you eat them in a health and fitness tracker. You might notice a trend of late-night eating when you are lonely or that you tend to eat emotionally on days when you have several deadlines.

After you recognize situations in which you are vulnerable to emotional eating, you can apply the coping strategies outlined above.

, Oftentimes, people eat on a timetable or by a schedule without paying attention to if they are actually hungry. To prevent eating for entertainment only, eat food when you notice the signs of hunger in your body.Physical hunger arrives gradually and can be put off by drinking water or having a light, healthy snack. When you eat something to satiate true hunger, it can be any food and once you have eaten enough, your body feels full.
Emotional hunger, on the other hand, arrives suddenly and feels urgent. Usually, these ""hunger pangs"" are for specific foods like ice cream or pizza. Plus, even after you have had your share, you might continue to eat.

, Eat your food without watching TV or using any other distraction. With each bite, notice the texture, taste, smell, and colors of the food. Chew slowly - about 20 chews per bite - and put your fork down after each bite. Once, you've had your fill, stop eating, even if there is still food on your plate.

, If you think you are hungry, drink a glass of water first. Sometimes, hunger is mistaken for thirst. If, after 10 minutes, you still have the urge to eat, choose a healthy, balanced snack such as nuts or fresh fruit and veggies. Or, a meal with lean protein, produce, and whole grains."

Consider creating a schedule of people who come and go.",How to Take Care of Caregivers1," It's better if many people are helping look after the person in need: people to take on full caregiving duties, people to visit for housework or socializing, people to take the person out, et cetera. This way, one person isn't doing most of the work.
, Seeing their friends and family can help cheer them up, and it'll also give the current caregiver some time where they don't need to worry about the person., Especially if the person needs a lot of care, it may be hard for the caregiver to find time for chores. It can be very helpful if someone comes over to do the dishes, mop, vacuum, clean the bathrooms, and handle other household tasks., This can help organize what is happening and what needs to be done.

You could set up an online calendar (e.g. through Google Calendar) with the schedule on it so people can easily see what is going on.

Work with someone who specializes in eating disorders so that you have the assurance that your therapist can and will help treat your eating disorder.It’s important to work with someone who has worked with eating disorders before, as treating eating disorders can be complex. There are different types of therapy and therapists you can choose from. Find an option that suits your needs.


Ask for a referral from your medical doctor, or call your insurance provider for a recommendation.;
, Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has long-term success in reducing binge eating disorder.CBT helps you identify and address the negative thoughts and behaviors that lead to binge eating. The therapist will work with you to help you change those negative thoughts and behaviors.CBT can help you feel more control over your behaviors and cope with negative feelings about your body, and help you regulate your eating patterns.CBT is good at gaining control over a disorder that can make you feel out of control. This systematic approach can put you back in the driver’s seat and help you feel like you can handle the disorder.
For more information, check out How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

, Interpersonal therapy focuses on your relationships and how the issues in relationships can influence your eating habits.The goal of interpersonal therapy is to help you improve the way you interact with others and increase your skills in dealing with other people.


Interpersonal therapy can help reduce triggers that are caused by poor relationships and poor communication.Interpersonal therapy may be beneficial for you if you tend to binge eat around relationship problems.

, DBT is skills-oriented and focuses on how negative feelings can lead to binge eating. The therapist will help you learn skills to focus on the present moment to help you to control the emotions and as a way to cope with distress.DBT can help you recognize that feelings are fleeting, and it’s okay to re-focus your attention when you have an urge to overeat. Instead of focusing on urges, you may learn to focus on your senses as a way to bring you into the present moment.


Skills focus on tolerating stress, improving your relationship with others, and regulating your emotions as ways to cope with urges to binge eat., A support group or self-help program can help you connect with other people and learn from them.Sometimes, you can find a group therapy program for binge eating that focuses on CBT, DBT, or interpersonal approaches.Unlike support groups, group therapy is led by a psychologist or therapist. Support groups and group therapy are good options if you want to learn from other people’s experiences, feel less isolated, and meet with other people who have similar struggles.


Groups can also be more cost effective than individual therapy.

, Sometimes, binge eating can be triggered by a disorder such as depression or anxiety. When you begin to feel depressed, you may turn to food and binge eating. A therapist can help you work through the underlying causes of your binge eating and help you recover from the psychological disorder.Your therapist may focus heavily on relieving symptoms of depression (for example, lack of energy, low mood, feeling hopeless, irritability) and ask how these symptoms relate to your binge eating triggers.Binge eating disorder and depression are strongly linked.To fully address binge eating disorder, depression must also be addressed.

, Low self-esteem is often tied to binge eating disorder.You may have negative feelings about yourself, especially after you binge eat. The shame of binge eating can lead you to have negative feelings about yourself. You may find yourself isolating as a result of shame or low self-esteem.Tell your therapist you feel ashamed of your disorder, or maybe even of yourself. Therapy can help you improve your self-esteem by teaching you to focus less on or to change your negative thoughts.
Your therapist may help you discover where you lack self-esteem (for example, self-esteem related to your body or body-image, your abilities, or comparing yourself to others) and challenge whether these feelings or beliefs are accurate. Your therapist may also help you build skills to improve self-esteem, like positive self-talk.

, You may eat as a way to manage or cope with stress. Finding new, healthier ways to deal with stress can help you recover from your binge eating disorder. When you feel stressed you will have skills to deal with the stress in healthier ways apart from food.You may feel like you don’t have any coping strategies apart from food. Ask your therapist to help you discover different ways to cope outside of food.


Your therapist may have you practice deep breathing exercises, or encourage you to try different activities such as journaling, listening to music, doing yoga, or meditation.

, A therapist may help you set up a notebook for you to track your moods. If you feel the urge to overeat, reach for a pen and not a pancake. Write down what triggered you, what emotional state you were in, and what contributed to the urge. You can talk about this notebook weekly at your therapy sessions.


Use your journal to backtrack as well. If you binged, work backwards to see how you were feeling before the binge. What triggered the binge? How were you feeling? What happened right before? Write down what you ate (or wanted to eat), how you felt before, during, and after the binge. You may begin to see a pattern emerge that can help you with treatment., You may see binge eating improve and worsen. It’s very common to experience relapse when treating binge eating disorder, especially early in treatment.Even if you relapse, stick with treatment.


If you relapse, make sure you tell your therapist and work through relapses together.

, It’s recommended to start a weight-loss program after treating the symptoms of binge eating disorder, as dieting can trigger binge eating behaviors. Choose a program that is monitored by medical professionals. You may choose a binge-specific program that can help continue the work from therapy as you aim to lose weight.You can also do a weight-loss program as you go through cognitive behavior therapy. CBT can help you cope with triggers as they occur.

, Some people are prescribed SSRIs as part of binge eating disorder treatment. SSRIs can boost your mood and help curb bad eating habits.Make an appointment with a prescriber to discuss options regarding medication.


As with all pharmaceuticals, side-effects are common when using SSRIs, including feeling shaky, diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, and low sex drive. Carefully consider taking medications prior to beginning treatment.

, Support your body by treating it well. Aim to get consistent sleep each night to adequately rest your body and fight cravings. When you don’t get adequate sleep, your body craves sugars for a quick energy boost. Make time for daily exercise to boost your mood and energy levels. By boosting your mood, you can help curb emotional eating.Move toward making your health your priority, and balancing those different aspects of health, including nutrition, sleep, and exercise.

, If you feel isolated or lonely, this can trigger binge eating habits.Surround yourself with friends and family and build a support network. Make time for people, both in person and on the phone. You don’t have to meet over a meal, instead, consider going bowling, having a game or movie night, or going on a hike.


Plan to meet with friends regularly. If you have family that lives far away, plan phone calls, video chats, or emails to keep in touch. Surround yourself with support so that you have a network that keep you from isolating.

Be an example of healthy self-esteem.",How to Talk to a Teen About Bulimia," If you suspect that your teen has an eating disorder, speak to a doctor first. A doctor will be able to help reinforce the messages you are trying to provide to your teen. Additionally, they may be able to notice other changes in the teen's body, or talk to them about their eating problem in a way you cannot. A doctor will be able to assist with finding your teen a dietitian, and a counselor if needed.The doctor will also make sure your teen is not experiencing any medical complications from an eating disorder.;
, Begin the conversation by stating your concern and asking your teen if they are having an eating problem.Approaching the conversation this way is non-threatening and opens the dialogue for further discussion. A large factor in eating disorders is control. Starting the conversation in an inquisitive manner allows the teen to keep the control. You should still be prepared however, that your teen may deny they have an eating problem. Try the following.


”I've been worrying about something lately. Do you have time to talk to me about it?”
”I've noticed some changes, and I'd really like to talk to you about it.”
”I'm wondering if you have been struggling with eating lately.”
”I'm concerned about your health. Do you think you might have an eating problem?”

, Talking to your teen about bulimia is likely going to be a very difficult conversation to have. It's important to keep a loving, calm, and focused tone while you are talking. Try and remain as respectful and positive as possible to keep the conversation non-confrontational.It is especially important to keep your tone calm and consistent if your teen begins to become angry, upset, or defensive. Remind yourself that it is about what they are feeling and what they need.


Offer your support for whatever they need.
Make it clear you will be there for them, no matter what.
Ask how you can help.

, While you are talking it is important to avoid accusations, judgments, or criticisms.Instead approach the conversation as if it is a medical condition with the focus being on getting healthy.Try not to “win” the conversation with arguments, but rather make it an open discussion of the situation. Use the following tips.


When you are speaking use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.Instead of saying, “You are lying and sneaking food,” say “I'm worried for you.”
Take the time to explain bulimia, and the dangers of bulimia nervosa.
Don't demand that they change or get into a power struggle with them about their habits., Appearance is such a sensitive topic for your teen, it is better not to comment on it at all. Focus instead on the behaviors you have been noticing such as missed meals, exercise schedule, etc.Avoid commenting on your teen's body or physical appearance, even if it is positive. Instead praise them for their efforts, opinions, and achievements.Talk about what you have noticed in regards to their exercise behaviors, their eating, or major changes in their attitudes. Try, “I've notice you have been exercising a lot more than you used to,” or, “I've noticed you don't eat with us as much as you used to.”
Steer clear of identifying any prejudice about body size you may have.Avoid making statements such as, “You're not fat,” or “But you're already skinny.”

, This is going to be a difficult conversation and it will be hard to know what it is like for your teen if you don't listen. They may express how they feel about themselves, or the changes and social pressures they are under.Listen to what they are saying and reflect it back to them to make sure you are understanding them correctly.


For example, you can say, ""I hear you saying you're feeling a lot of pressure trying to keep up with school, sports, your chores at home, and your job. Is that right?""

, Your teen is experiencing a wide range of emotions while dealing with this ranging from anger and sadness, to shame and frustration.While discussing their eating disorder with them, focus on feelings and relationships rather than body, weight, or food.Ask them how they are feeling, emotionally.
Share how you feel about what they are going through.

Make a habit of eating with them.Make sure you are providing healthy eating options in your home.Demonstrate healthy eating habits for your teen.

, The goal of talking about their bulimia, should be to determine what kind of help is needed and to start getting that help going for them.After discussing with your teen, use the information you have learned to determine the best plan for care or treatment. Remain firm and solution-focused while trying to let them direct the plan, so they can maintain the feeling of control.


Avoid giving simple solutions such as “just stop” to your teen. It is rarely ever that simple.
Follow up after making the plans. Once you decide on a plan, make sure you are both following up on it to ensure it is being put into action.
Go with your teen to any appointments, if they need or want you to for support.
Regularly check in with your teen about how they are feeling and what you can do to help. This will help them feel supported and cared for.

, Educating yourself about bulimia begins with being able to recognize the signs and symptoms.

Avoiding eating around others, fasting, or skipping meals.
Vomiting after eating, using water pills or laxatives, or exercising excessively.
You may notice the teen disappearing right after a meal or going to the bathroom frequently. They may run water to cover the sound of vomiting.

, True, eating disorders are about food and weight, but they are also ways for teens to deal with emotional problems and stress-related issues.Learn about the possible underlying causes of their bulimia or eating disorders in general. Consider recent changes to your teen's life and behavior. Some possible sources can include:


Distorted self image or low self-esteemSocial pressure or bullying
Anxiety or feeling out of control
Painful thoughts or emotions, In order to know if their behaviors are out of the ordinary, learn what healthy eating and exercise looks like. Educate yourself on proper nutrition in general as well as the proper nutrition for a teenager. It may also be helpful to learn about any new diets which are popular that your teen might be trying.


Healthy eating for a teenager includes teens trying to avoid fast food, sugary drinks and energy drinks.It is important for teens not to skip meals as well. Teens should eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains and proteins.Healthy exercise for a teenager can depend on what sports or activities they are involved in, as well as how much they are eating. Teens should make sure they are not burning more calories with exercise than they are taking in. Athletes should not train for more than five days a week., In addition to the eating disorder, other negative side effects could be occurring within your teen's body. It is important for you to identify what these health risks are. Bulimia health risks can include. Weight gain
Dental problems
Heart, kidney, and stomach problems

, There are many treatment options to help assist with eating disorders such as bulimia. Deciding on a treatment option for your teen will depend on their circumstances.

Dietitian or nutritional counseling
Family physicians
Guidance counselor or school nurses
Eating disorder facilities or residential treatment

, You will likely be preoccupied with your loved ones health during this process. Make sure you do not neglect your own needs and health in the process. Try attending a support group for family and friends of teens with eating disorders. If you cannot find one in your area, most addiction support groups also include eating disorders as addiction behavior. Attending a support group will give you a place to voice anxieties or frustrations as well as help you remember it is not your fault.If you are hesitant about attending a support group, then make sure you are obtaining support from a trusted friend or an individual therapy session to ensure you have a place to talking about your feelings., You are often unaware of how the way in which you view yourself affects others. Complaining about your weight, body shape, or stating that you think you are fat will have far-reaching negative effects.It can not only do harm to your own self-image but will also be observed by younger individuals in your life. Examine your thoughts and feelings about your own body and begin to work on getting to a healthier, happier place with them.

, Make sure you are practicing what you preach and examining or changing your relationship to food, if necessary. If you are constantly dieting or using food to cope with emotional issues as well, it may be more difficult to help someone else.Use this as an opportunity to address any bad behaviors you have in relation to eating and exercising so that you can be the best example for others.

, Much like you are trying to help your teen do, focus more on your behavior rather than your appearance. Make lists of your strengths, achievements, and things you admire about yourself.Share your accomplishments with others, and be proud of yourself. Treat yourself well by taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Learn what it is.,
Research which therapies are used for anorexia.,
Explore how it works.,
Research risks and side effects.",How to Treat Anorexia with Brain Stimulation1," Brain stimulation includes several methods of stimulating the brain to control certain behaviors.It may include implanting electrodes in the brain through surgery, attaching them to the scalp, or using magnetic fields. The more you know about brain stimulation in general and as a treatment for anorexia, the better you will be able to decide if it’s an appropriate option for you.


The most common forms of brain stimulation include: deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
Refer to sources like the Mayo Clinic at http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/home/ovc-20156088 or the NIMH website at https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml for information about brain stimulation treatments.;
, Once you have a general understanding of what brain stimulation therapy is, you should learn more about which of the treatments are most commonly used for anorexia. For example, DBS is one of the most frequently used brain stimulation therapies for severe or chronic anorexia, while VNS is not as widely used for anorexia.Ask your medical professional for pamphlets or other handouts with information about brain stimulation treatments for anorexia.
Talk to people who’ve used brain stimulation to treat their anorexia. Ask which therapy they used and ask about their experience with the treatment. For example, you might ask, “Was it an effective treatment for you?”

, In general, specific parts of your brain are activated by electrodes, magnets, or in some other way. Once activated, these parts of the brain either stimulate or suppress certain behaviors.Each brain stimulation therapy is different, though, in how they stimulate the brain. Knowing how brain stimulation therapy works will help you decide which treatment will work for you or if it’s a possible treatment option for you at all. If you’ve already decided it is an option for you, understanding how it works will help you prepare yourself for the treatment you’ll be receiving.


Look at information provided by NIMH https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml about how each of the brain stimulation treatments work.
Some treatments, such as deep brain stimulation, require surgery. Other treatments don’t require surgery but do involve repeated sessions.

, Before undertaking any type of treatment you should have a clear understanding of what the possible risks and side effects might be. This is also true when treating anorexia with brain stimulation. Learning more about side effects and risks will help you decide if it’s a viable treatment option for you and help prepare you for the treatment.


NIMH https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml provides information about the risks and side effects of the most common brain stimulation therapies.
Consider each side effect and whether it’s something you can handle. For example, one side effect of ECT is memory loss. You could ask yourself, “Am I okay with some memory loss because of this treatment?”
Some of the brain stimulation treatments have more risks than others. For example, because it requires surgery, DBS has more risks than rTMS, which doesn’t require surgery.

For example, you may not be eligible for DBS if you have other health conditions that may cause complications during the surgery.

Knowing about the specific procedure used in the brain stimulation therapy will help you decide if it’s the right option for you. It will also prepare you for receiving the treatment.

, Almost every medical treatment has some side effects. Brain stimulation therapies are no exception. But, you can handle the side effects if you are aware of your body and emotions, document any side effects you have, and talk to your medical professional about alleviating them.


Be aware of changes in your body physically, emotionally and mentally. For instance, for the day or two after your treatment pay attention to any nausea, fatigue, confusion, or other side effects you may be experiencing.
Write about any side effects you notice in your treatment journal as a way of documenting them. For example, you might write, “I felt a little dizzy after the treatment today.”
Let your healthcare professional know that you are experiencing side effects and that you would like help managing them. For instance, you might say, “I’d like to talk about how I can manage the side effects of my treatment.”

, When you are treating anorexia with brain stimulation, your family and friends can support and encourage you to stick to your treatment plan. They can also help you with any day-to-day tasks that you can’t get to as you are completing your treatment.


Let the people close to you know specifically what you need. For instance, you might say, “Dad, could you watch my dog for a few days?”
Ask someone just to be with you when you are feeling down or nervous about your treatment. You don’t have to say or do anything, other than just be present.
Talk to someone close to you about how you are feeling emotionally and physically.

, Brain stimulation treatments can help you manage your anorexia, but there is no magic cure that will make the disorder go away completely. You still have to actively work to keep it under control. Continue doing the things you were doing to manage your anorexia before you started brain stimulation therapy.


Continue practicing healthy eating habits. For example, don’t start skipping breakfast because you feel the brain stimulation treatments are helping.
Keep working with your healthcare professional to address others issues in your life that may be contributing to your anorexia.

Prenatal nurses provide care to expectant mothers, new mothers, and their babies.


Prenatal nurses are also sometimes referred to as as perinatal nurses or registered nurses.
Certified nurse midwifery (CNF) requires a Master's degree.The term prenatal, which means ""from conception to birth,"" may be somewhat misleading because these nurses also provide care during and after the delivery. Perinatal refers to the weeks up to and directly after birth;
, Prenatal nurses perform the important task of helping to ensure women have a smooth pregnancy. They often perform the following tasks:Helping women understand and cope with the changes they will experience during pregnancy and childbirth.
Teaching expectant mothers about how to stay healthy during their pregnancy and defining healthy behaviors. It is imperative to explore lifestyle habits that may be dangerous to a developing fetus (illicit drug use, smoking, high blood pressure), family history of any genetic disorders, issues in pregnancy that could be passed down (pre-eclampsia/pregnancy induced hypertension, placental issues), or any other health concerns that could make the pregnancy a high risk.
Counseling families about childbirth options.

, Prenatal nurses also provide nursing care, support, and comfort to patients during and immediately after the delivery.


They teach parents about bonding with and caring for their new babies and any issues that may affect bonding.
This might involve helping new mothers and fathers learn about breastfeeding, umbilical cord care, proper positions for holding baby during feedings, instruction on diaper changing, tips for dealing with colicky and gassy babies, and many other conditions.
Other concerns may include postpartum depression, exploration of support concerns, housing concerns, or potential safety issues like unsafe environment, no home/housing available, etc.

, Prenatal nurses work in hospitals, birthing centers, community centers, adult education centers, and physician’s offices.


If you wish to work independently of these facilities and take on your own clients, you will need an advanced degree and this must be be in the scope of practice as defined by your state. You must obtain licensure in the state where you work. You will also need a significant amount of experience.

, Before making a commitment to become a prenatal nurse, it’s helpful to learn about the job outlook for this profession and understand the level of compensation prenatal nurses receive. Although you should do your own research about the availability of prenatal nursing positions in your area, there are some facts below that might help you in making your decision.The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that job growth for nurses (including prenatal nurses, but also other types of nurses as well) will be significantly higher than other occupations.
The demand for registered and specialized nurses is generally high, because there are labor shortages in metropolitan and rural areas.
Prenatal nursing is one of the highest-paid nursing fields.
Salaries generally range between $50,000 to $90,000 depending on educational level, geographic location, and the type of facility where a prenatal nurse works.
Major metropolitan areas generally offer higher salaries, but the cost of living in these places can also be higher.
Prenatal nurses working in private physician’s offices often earn higher salaries than those working in hospitals.

, Before specializing in prenatal nursing, you need to pursue and receive a bachelor’s of science degree in nursing, known as a BSN. In addition to completing general education requirements, BSN programs require students to take courses in anatomy, physiology, biology, nutrition, public health, emergency care, and other relevant subjects.While you can become a registered nurse with an associate’s degree in nursing (ADN), many employers prefer to hire applicants with BSNs.
If you are enrolled full time, a BSN degree usually takes about 3 to 4 years to complete.
If you already have an associate’s degree in nursing (ADN), many schools offer accelerated RN-BSN programs. Some employers offer tuition reimbursement programs.
It can be helpful to contact an advisor at a college in your area to discuss the specifics of their BSN programs and the steps they recommend to become a prenatal nurse.
If you are a busy parent or don’t live near colleges with nursing programs, you might consider investigating online BSN programs, but understand that even online programs usually require you to complete a certain number of clinical hours.If you are interested in prenatal nursing, talk with your program’s advisor about potential internship and volunteer opportunities in hospitals, doctor’s offices, and birthing centers so that you can gain a better understanding of what prenatal nurses do and acquire more hands-on experience in this area of specialization.

, To become a prenatal nurse, you first have to become a registered nurse, which means you need to pass an examination known as the NCLEX-RN. This examination assesses critical thinking skills needed to make nursing judgments..


Although the exam sounds daunting, your BSN degree is designed to prepare you for this test.
If you already have your RN certification before completing a BSN program, you do not have to take the NCLEX-RN.To take the exam, you have to contact the board of nursing in the area or region in which you wish to be licensed or registered.
This board will make sure you are eligible to take the exam, and provide you with details about the date, time, and format of the exam.
If you don’t pass the exam the first time, you can retake it in 45 days.Some states have additional licensure requirements, and these can usually be found on the National Council of State Boards of Nursing website.

, If you are interested in an advanced field of nursing, such as becoming a certified nurse midwife, you will also need to pursue a master’s degree in nursing and/or complete additional certification programs.


At this level of your education, you will usually have the opportunity to acquire more hands-on clinical practice in perinatal care.
Some schools offer Perinatal Nurse Specialist (PNS) and Perinatal Nurse Practitioner (PNP) certification programs so that students can obtain more specialized training in the area of prenatal nursing.
The American College of Midwives also offers certification programs to people who are currently in the nursing profession but would like to become a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM), who provides prenatal care., After your education is complete, you can begin to look for employment in various places such as hospitals, birthing centers, adult education centers and physician’s offices. Many graduate programs help students find employment after they have completed required coursework and certifications.
Prenatal nurses can also seek out your own pregnant clients and enter the workforce as an independent prenatal nurse working for yourself. However, many people choose to do this later on in their career after they have gained valuable experience working with trained staff in a professional setting.

, As a prenatal nurse, you will spend much of your time caring for pregnant women who are dealing with a great deal of stress and struggling to adjust to the changes that pregnancy brings.If you do not like babies, prenatal nursing might not be the nursing career for you.
You will have to empathize with your patients and be responsive to their needs so they have confidence in your abilities.

, As a prenatal nurse, being a good listener is of the utmost importance. Your patients will be communicating how they are feeling at each visit, and they will also be discussing very personal topics and sharing intimate details about their day-to-day lives.It is important that you listen to what your patients have to say, not only for diagnostic purposes, but also because it will help to make your patients feel more comfortable and trusting of your care.

, Prenatal nurses face difficult and stressful situations such as the delivery room. As a result, they need to work well under pressure.Their patients and the other healthcare professionals they are working with are counting on prenatal nurses to be calm and make decisions quickly.

, Prenatal nurses spend much of their time working with patients and other healthcare professionals, so excellent communication skills are a necessity.In many cases, prenatal nurses spend more time working directly with their patients and their families than doctors and due to this can become very close to patients. This can allow them to identify and assist in problem solving with the patients. As well as identifying risk factors that can be changed and/or that need to be monitored closely during pregnancy.
Prenatal nurses need to be able to convey complex information accurately, in a way that patients will understand.

, Prenatal nurses are often responsible for recording and maintaining accurate and detailed medical records.They should be good at taking notes and detail oriented.

, Prenatal nurses often have non-traditional work schedules because births can happen any time of day or night and they frequently deal with emergencies that occur during pregnancy. A flexible schedule and the ability to be available to your patients on short notice are important requirements for prenatal nurses.This can include working on holidays and weekends, and 10–12 hour shifts in the morning, afternoon, evening, or overnight.
It is also important to know that as a prenatal nurse, depending on the setting in which you work, you may be on call to your patients during their pregnancy. They may have questions for you at any time of the day or night and you will need to be available to answer those questions.
Because birth occurs on its own time schedule, you will need to be available and ready when your patients go into labor unexpectedly.

Meet the right prerequisites for physician assistant programs.,
Obtain healthcare experience.,
Open an account with the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA).,
Apply for an accredited physician’s assistant program.,
Obtain certification as a physician assistant.,
Obtain a state license.,
Maintain your certification.,
Apply for jobs as a physician assistant.",How to Become a Physician Assistant," You will need to graduate from an accredited physician assistant school. However, most programs require that you've met certain educational and experience requirements first.


Most physician assistant programs are very selective, and they require about two years of college coursework in specific areas. Research the entrance requirements for the physician assistant program you are interested in well in advance. Some programs require a bachelor’s degree (usually in the sciences).Generally, physician assistant programs want to see that you’ve taken courses in the sciences in such areas as chemistry, anatomy, microbiology, physiology, and biology. These courses prepare you to work in a health care setting upon graduation, such as a hospital or doctor’s office.It’s a good idea to start researching physician assistant programs when you are a freshman in college. That way you can make sure you take the right courses.;
, You will probably need to have healthcare experience before you apply for a physician assistant program. Most programs will require it.


You could get such experience by volunteering for non-profit organizations, such as the Peace Corps. Some physician assistant programs require a minimum number of hours in non-clinical volunteer work in addition to other health-related experience. Check with the specific program you are interested in as entrance requirements may vary.You will need to work in non-volunteer areas that give you healthcare experience also, such as a paramedic, a lab assistant, a medic, or a registered nurse., Most of the programs you'll be considering will ask that you apply through this service.CASPA applications take a long time to complete, so apply early. It helps to gather all of your educational and employment information before you apply.
Because it's centralized, CASPA simplifies the process of applying to multiple physician assistant programs.

, Usually, such programs will last about two to three academic years. At the end, you will be awarded a master’s degree. As of 2010, there were 154 such accredited PA programs in the United States.You will be taught in a classroom setting in areas of the sciences, including behavioral science, anatomy, pharmacology, medical ethics, and other classes.
Most programs require candidates to complete clinical rotations as well. These are often at least 2,000 hours, and they could place you in a number of real-life settings, including a family medicine office, or facilities specializing in things like emergency medicine or psychiatry. The clinical rotation usually occurs in the second year of the program.You may want to consider entering an accelerated four-year program. These enable you to obtain a bachelor’s degree and then a graduate level PA certificate in a four-year sequence. To be accepted into any physician assistant program, you will likely be asked for letters of recommendation, and you will need to meet a certain grade-point average threshold.

, You will qualify (and need to) become certified after you’ve graduated from the accredited PA program.


The certification exam is called PANCE. It stands for Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam. You will earn the title of PA-C or Physician Assistant –Certified if you pass it.
Before sitting for the exam, many people read books and other resources that are designed to help prepare people for taking the exam.You can take practice exams before you take the actual exam. If you don't pass this exam, you will not be able to work as a physician assistant.

, Requirements for state licenses may vary depending on where you live, but all states require that you passed the PANCE exam and graduate from an accredited physician assistant program. All states require licensing for physician assistants.It’s recommended that you obtain a state license application early, and start working on it. The requirements might include such things as fingerprinting and letters of reference. States often handle their licensing procedures through state license boards.
The American Academy of Physician Assistants has state chapters. Your state chapter should be able to help direct you in how to find out more about your state’s licensing requirements. Some states might require continuing education credits for licensing. Research your own state’s rules!

, Once you become a certified physician assistant, you will be asked to maintain your certification.In 2014, physician assistants started having to comply with a 10-year certification cycle divided into two 5-year segments. Physician assistants have to log 100 credits of continuing certification education every 5-year period.
The segments are shorter pre-2014; look up the rules for your own particular situation., The good news is that physician assistants are paid well. And the job is highly in demand due to an aging population. Most work full-time, and they can work long hours.


The average physician assistant is paid over $90,000.Physician assistants work in many health care settings, ranging from emergency medicine to doctor’s offices.
These programs are competitive; however, the government has reported that employment of physician assistants should grow 38 percent from 2012 through 2022. This is considered faster job growth than the average for most professions.

Taking advanced classes in biology, chemistry, and algebra - and earning high grades - can help you get into a college program that specializes in physical therapy assistance. Some PTA programs require a minimum average in algebra, so studying hard early on can help you go far in this field., Though it's not a requirement for getting into a PTA program, volunteering at a hospital or other health care facility will look great on a resume, and can help you decide if this career is right for you., The minimum college educational requirement for PTAs is an associate's degree in physical therapist assistant education. It's important to ensure that the program you choose is accredited if you want to pursue a career as a PTA.


In the United States, the only agency that grants accreditation status is the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE).You can find a database of CAPTE-accredited programs on the American Physical Therapy Association's website.
In Canada, accreditation is granted by the Physiotherapy Education Accreditation Canada (PEAC), and all physiotherapy programs across Canada are currently accredited by the PEAC.If you're unsure of the accrediting board in your place of residence, you can find out by searching online for the PTA accreditation board in your region.

Candidates have no way of knowing which questions are scored and which are un-scored, so candidates should treat each question as though it will be scored., Candidates will be issued a score on a scale between 200 and 800. In order to pass the exam, candidates must have earned a score of 600 or higher. Scores are reported to a candidate's jurisdiction roughly five business days after the exam, and scores will be made available for free to all candidates after 10 business days. Scores can be found and downloaded on the FSBPT website, under the ""Status of My Request"" tab., In addition to the National Physical Therapy Exam, some states also require candidates to complete and pass an additional state-wide exam and undergo a criminal background check.You can find your state's requirements by going to the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy website and clicking on ""Licensing Authorities Contact Information"".

, Some states require PTAs to take continuing education courses in order to maintain licensure. These requirements vary from state to state, and may not be required in jurisdictions outside the US.

Topics will include anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology, among others. In addition, students will need to learn about medical ethics and regulations about the practice of podiatry.


Podiatric medical school will also include hands on training. Students will need to complete several clinical rotations before graduating. These rotations are usually completed during the last two years of the program., The second part, covering clinical areas, is taken just prior to graduation.


As of 2015, the complete APMLE consists of three parts, consisting of four sections.The first two sections, considered one part, are written, testing that the candidate has the scientific and medical knowledge to work as a physician. The third section of the test evaluates the candidate's clinical skills, focusing on their skill at examining and communicating with patients.

, Residency allows future podiatrists to apply the knowledge they have learned in school in the real world.It also allows them to practice the skills they have learned in school with supervision.

Even positions that do not require phlebotomy school do require a high school diploma.Classes in the biological sciences will be useful for a phlebotomist. If possible, take anatomy classes to learn more about the workings of the human body.
If you did not complete your high school diploma, you can get your GED. This is an accepted equivalency for schools and jobs.
Some people are hired as a phlebotomist and trained on the job. Many offices employing phlebotomists will not hire you even for these positions without a high school diploma.;
, Most phlebotomy training schools are one year programs. You can take your classes usually at a technical or community college.If you research local community or technical colleges near you, it's likely that one will offer a phlebotomy program. Since you need hands-on experience taking blood, you will not find online only programs, though some may allow you to take non-lab hours online.
Some programs offer night classes. This may be especially useful if you're working at the same time.

, The top accreditation agency for phlebotomy is the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences. This will guarantee that your certification program will be useful wherever you move, since each state has slightly different educational requirements.


Your program should be accredited. You will be able to learn the best practices for the field so you are prepared for your job as a phlebotomist when you start.

, When you're applying to a phlebotomy training program, you'll need to submit an application, transcripts, recommendation letters, and a short essay. Your essay should tell the program why you want to be a phlebotomist.Certain programs may have different requirements, but, in general, these are what you will need to complete your application.


You will need to obtain transcripts from your high school or GED equivalent. It may also be a good idea to talk to high school teachers, career counselors, or former and current bosses for recommendation letters.
You'll also need to write a short essay about why you want to be a phlebotomist. When writing the essay, draw on any personal and professional experience you have working in the health care industry.

, Your training program will give you background in anatomy as well as blood collection, storage, and safety. You will also be doing plenty of lab work.You will learn both biological and procedural knowledge in your courses about how to draw and store blood properly. This will help prepare you to work as a phlebotomist.
Some programs can last significantly more or less time. Research each school to see how long their program is and which fits best into your time frame.

, Programs should offer a practicum along with classroom training. You may be required to get an internship or apprenticeship to complete your work experience hours.You will need work experience hours to qualify for additional certification. While certification is not always required, it does usually provide additional opportunities and salary.
In addition to your work experience, you'll also need to complete at least 100 successful venipunctures. This shows you are able to successfully draw blood from human subjects.

, Depending on the type of certification you want, there are different requirements. You'll need to meet all of their requirements before becoming a certified phlebotomy technician.Requirements differ depending on the specific certification, but the basics usually include high school graduate or GED, 20 hours of phlebotomy courses, and certificate of completion of an accredited phlebotomy training program.
Each certification is sponsored by a different agency. Make sure that agency is the best one for gaining licensing from your state.

, Some states do not require licensing for phlebotomists, but all employers will look for certification. Gaining certification will help you get a job and advance your career.You can obtain the follow certifications as a phlebotomist: Certified Phlebotomy Technician (CPT), Phlebotomy Technician (ASCP), Registered Phlebotomy Technician (RPT), and National Certified Phlebotomy Technician (NCPT). A CPT is the industry standard and comes in five different grades, each of which requires additional punctures and hours of advanced classes. ASCAP may be most useful for those working in laboratories. The RPT certification requires an exam, and NCPT requires additional work experience.
There are a variety of organizations that sponsor these certifications. These organizations include the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences, the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, American Association of Medical Personnel, American Medical Technologists, and the American Certification Agency for Healthcare Professionals.

, Some states require that any lab technician passes a license exam. Search for your state's requirements at your state's business or licensing bureau through the Secretary of State's office.At present, only California, Nevada, Louisiana, and Washington require all phlebotomists to be certified and licensed. However, being certified is always a good career move.Being certified and licensed allows you to offer better credentials, might allow you for great pay advances, and demonstrates that you're willing to go above and beyond for your career.

, Phlebotomists work a little bit of everywhere in the health care industry. Health care and medical offices always need to take blood, so it's a good place to start your job search.You can start your job search online. Try looking for health care or medical offices in your area.
It may also be a good idea to visit some local medical offices. Even if they don't have any openings, they may be able to point you towards some at other locations.

, These institutions have phlebotomists on hand to take blood for tests and other purposes. You can usually find these jobs looking on the hospital's or clinic's website.


Hospitals constantly need phlebotomists. The initial application process can usually be done entirely online.
Clinics also need phlebotomists. They may need to test blood there or take blood to send for additional tests elsewhere.

, Plasma businesses may also be looking for certified phlebotomists. Any offices that take blood as their primary business may be on the lookout for new phlebotomists.Offices such as the Red Cross are a great place to start. They take blood for donations everywhere and can also be a good company to work with.
Plasma donation centers also take a lot of blood. Depending on the center, you may need additional training or certification.

Determine how much protein you need.,
Be aware that it is possible to eat too much protein.,
Remember that not all protein sources are created equal.,
Learn the importance of spreading out your protein intake throughout the day.,
Create a protein-rich meal plan.",How to Add Protein to Your Diet1," There is a lot of debate about how much protein people need. The minimum recommendation to maintain health is .8g/kg of protein per kilogram of body weight (approximately .4 grams per pound of bodyweight), so a 150 pound (68kg) adult should try to consume at least 54 to 61 grams of protein per day. Protein recommendations for athletes or those wishing to build muscle mass or lose weight are generally much higher, at 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight.To determine the minimum amount of protein you need to stay healthy, multiply your bodyweight in pounds by .4 grams, or in kilograms by 0.8g grams.
To determine the minimum amount of protein you need to support an exercise habit, boost muscle mass, or lose weight, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2, which will give you your weight in kilograms. Multiply this number by 1.2 – 1.7g (if you are a power athlete) to find the number of grams of protein you should consume, or by 1.2 – 1.4g (if you are an endurance athlete). So, an athlete weighing 180 lbs. weighs 82 kg (180 / 2.2 = 82). To get the minimum 1.2g per kg of body weight, this athlete must eat 98.4g of protein (82 x 1.2 = 98.4).When in doubt, ask your doctor or a nutritionist for a specific recommendation.;
, Your body can only use a certain amount of protein at a time, and consuming excessive protein can lead to health issues.


Common symptoms of protein over-consumption include weight gain (from over-consumption of calories in general), dehydration, and kidney problems.Overconsumption of fatty meats and cheeses can also increase bad (LDL) cholesterol and your risk for heart disease.If you experience any of the above issues, consult with your doctor and consider cutting back on your protein intake.

, When planning your diet, focus on adding primarily lean protein sources that are low in salt and additives, and minimize your consumption of processed meats. Also remember that proteins from vegetable sources are not as readily digested by the body, and are considered ""incomplete,"" meaning they are missing one or more amino acid that the body needs.If you wish to increase your intake of vegetable-based proteins note that you may need to consume more grams of protein for your body to get what it needs, and ensure you get all of the amino acids you need by eating a variety of protein-rich foods., Your body can only absorb so much protein at a time, so consuming all of your daily protein in one sitting might leave you lacking. Moreover, studies have shown that adding protein to your diet throughout the day can not only decrease hunger, allowing dieters to lose more weight, but can also boost muscle retention and growth.When planning to add protein to your diet, be sure to think about ways to include protein at every meal and about incorporating protein-rich snacks.

, Creating a meal plan ahead of time is the best way to ensure that you get the protein you need spaced out properly during the day. Prepare protein-rich snacks and foods ahead of time.

Familiarize yourself with the essential amino acids.,
Determine the ideal amount of protein in your diet.,
Consume complete proteins by eating complementary plant-based foods.,
Introduce plant foods with high amounts of all 9 essential amino acids.,
Vary your diet as much as possible.",How to Get Enough Protein as a Vegan," All proteins - from both plant and animal sources - are made from the same 22 amino acids, only 9 of which your body cannot synthesize on its own. These 9 amino acids are called ""essential,"" and they are present in every plant-based food. However, most plants contain very low amounts of 1 or more amino acid, so this deficiency must be compensated by eating other foods that contain this amino acid, or by simply eating more of the first food.;
, The calories taken in from protein should account for roughly 20 percent of your total caloric intake. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends a daily intake of 59 grams of protein for men and 46 grams for women. This protein will have to come from plant sources exclusively within a vegan diet.

, The 2 major groups of protein-rich plant foods are legumes on 1 hand, and grains, nuts, and seeds on the other. Each of these groups is rich in the amino acids that are deficient in the other, so together they provide a balanced amino acid profile - a ""complete"" protein. Strive to combine grains, nuts, and seeds with different types of legumes over the course of your day.


Note that these complementary foods do not have to be consumed in the same sitting or even in the same day. Although this was the prevailing conception of complementary proteins for a long time, it is now known that your body can store different amino acids for days until they can be metabolized along with their complements.
Some examples of food pairings that will build complementary proteins include stir-fried soybeans over rice, hummus and pita bread, and corn and beans.

, There are 2 popular plant-based foods that provide complete proteins by themselves: soy and quinoa. Each of these foods is incredibly versatile within a vegan diet. Quinoa can be used in place of rice, oats, or pearled barley in many recipes (although it is not a cereal grain, but rather the seed of a broadleaf plant).

, Because complete proteins are not required in a single setting, the best way to get enough protein as a vegan is to eat a varied diet. Introduce different types of foods into your diet every day, such as leafy greens, grains, lentils and beans, nuts, tubers, fruits, and vegetables. Some vegetables, such as avocado and potato, contain a large amount of protein.

Include protein in every meal.,
Keep your meals balanced.,
Eat breakfast every day.,
Get more protein if you accidentally miss a meal.,
Make high-protein smoothies.",How to Increase Albumin1," Eating high quality protein is important to your nutrition in general, and vital to keeping albumin levels up. As a rule of thumb, make sure you have at least one high-protein serving in every meal. Lean beef, pork, and lamb are all good options, as are fish, chicken, turkey, and eggs.In a 3 ounce (85 gram) single-serving portion, lean beef burger contains 21 grams of protein, chicken contains 14-28 grams, cooked salmon, trout, or mackerel contains 15-21 grams, and pork chop contains 15-21 grams.
If you prefer not to eat meat, getting enough protein can be especially challenging. For advice about choosing the protein sources that will be best for you, talk to a dietitian.
Be sure to eat dialysis friendly proteins if you are on dialysis. These include lean beef, lean turkey, chicken, pork chops, eggs, fish, meat substitutes, tofu, and protein powders.;
, While you may need to focus on eating more protein, you still need to eat fruits, vegetables, and starches like bread, pasta, and rice. For example, add grated hard boiled eggs or tuna to sauces for pasta or rice dishes, or include shredded chicken or diced meat in soups and stews., Breakfast is an especially important meal, in part because it kick starts your metabolism for the day. You are also more likely to have a strong appetite when you first wake up. One good option is an omelet made with egg whites with cheese.While one egg contains about 6 grams of protein, egg whites are an even healthier source of protein. In fact, egg whites are 100% albumin. Two egg whites contain 7.2 grams of protein.

, It’s very important to avoid skipping meals. Strive to eat small frequent meals to maintain your energy levels. However, if you do miss a meal by accident, make sure to eat a larger portion of protein at your next meal.Eating smaller meals may also be helpful if you have a hard time eating regular sized portions.
A great between-meal or bedtime snack is cottage cheese. Try it with some fruit, such as apple sauce. (Cottage cheese is healthier than many other dairy products, as it is lower in potassium and phosphorus, which may pose a risk to those on dialysis with low albumin.)

, Smoothies are a quick, easy, and delicious way to get some extra protein. It’s best to use a liquid that is not high in phosphorus, so avoid cow’s milk. Almond milk or rice milk work well. Greek yogurt, pasteurized egg products or protein powder add the protein. Blend together with whatever fruit you favor.Ask a dietitian about what type of protein addition or supplement will be best for you. Both powdered and liquid forms are available.
Note that a cup of Greek yogurt contains over 20 grams of protein. Smoothies made with Greek yogurt are especially good with granola blended in as well.

See your doctor.,

Wait for your results.,
Read the measurements.,

Examine your HDL level.,
Assess your triglyceride level.,
Plug your numbers into the equation for total cholesterol.,
Calculate your total cholesterol.,
Assess your total cholesterol level.,
Have your doctor go over the results with you.,
Take steps to lower your cholesterol.",How to Calculate Total Cholesterol," Your doctor will have to order the blood panel (lipid profile or lipoprotein profile) needed to test your LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels—the three components that combine to form a complete cholesterol reading.LDL refers to low-density lipoprotein, and it is actually a combination reading of LDLs and VLDLs (very low-density lipoproteins). Over time, LDLs form a plaque buildup in your arteries, narrowing them and increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications. They are often referred to as “bad” cholesterol.
HDL refers to high-density lipoprotein. HDLs transport cholesterol in the bloodstream back to the liver and reduce the amount of cholesterol in your blood. This is why they are commonly called “good” cholesterol.
Triglycerides are another form of fat molecule found in your blood that can contribute to the narrowing and hardening of your arteries. Like LDLs, high levels of triglycerides can increase your risk for cardiovascular diseases and complications.;
, For an accurate reading of the various components, you’ll need to fast for nine to twelve hours before you have blood drawn.This is because an accurate reading requires minimum values that haven’t been elevated by a meal.


You can still drink water the entire time before fasting.

, The lab will have to run the proper tests on your blood sample before returning the results. Your doctor will typically ask you to schedule a follow-up appointment a week after you’ve had your blood drawn to go over your results.

, Your cholesterol level will be provided as a concentration of cholesterol in your blood. The number refers to milligrams of cholesterol in a deciliter of blood (mg/dL). The lab may omit the unit of measurement on your results, but this is to what the numbers refer.

, Your doctor will consider an LDL level lower than 100 mg/dL ideal. The complete guidelines for LDL levels, for a person with no other medical conditions, are as follows:Ideal - Less than 100 mg/dL
Near optimal/slightly elevated - 100 to 129 mg/dL
Borderline high - 130 to 159 mg/dL
High - 160 to 189 mg/dL
Severely high - Higher than 190 mg/dL

, You will see a separate number that indicates your HDL measurement. Your doctor will consider an HDL of 60 mg/dL (or greater) ideal. A complete breakdown of HDL measurements, for a person with no other medical conditions, is as follows:Ideal - At least 60 mg/dL
Borderline risk factor for heart disease - 41 to 59 mg/dL
High risk factor for heart disease - Less than 40 mg/dL

, Like high levels of LDL, high triglyceride levels can also increase your chances of atherosclerosis (artery narrowing and hardening), raising the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Your doctor will consider less than 150 mg/dL ideal, assuming you have no other medical conditions. The full breakdown of your triglyceride measurement is:Ideal - Less than 150 mg/dL
Elevated - 150 to 199 mg/dL
High - 200 to 499 mg/dL
Extremely high - Higher than 500 mg/dL

, Once you have these three numbers, you can use them in a simple equation to calculate your total cholesterol. The equation is:LDL + HDL + (triglycerides/5) = total cholesterol.
For instance, if you had an LDL of 100, HDL of 60, and triglyceride level of 150, then the equation would read: 100 + 60 + (150/5).

, With all of your numbers plugged into the equation, you can simply perform the division and addition components to reach your total cholesterol level.


For instance, calculating the previous example would be 100 + 60 + (150/5) = 100 + 60 + 30 = 190.
You can also find online calculators that will tally your total cholesterol from the individual numbers., Similar to the individual components, your total cholesterol will fall into a range of readings from ideal to high. Your doctor will consider a total cholesterol reading of less than 200 mg/dL ideal, assuming you have no other medical conditions. However, the full range of readings is:Ideal - Less than 200 mg/dL
Elevated - 200 to 239 mg/dL
High - 240 mg/dL or greater

, While total cholesterol is a useful tool to have, you should still go over the component parts with your doctor because the number can be misleading. For instance, 99 LDL + 60 HDL + (200/5 triglyceride) = 199 total cholesterol. A total cholesterol level of 199 is not cause for alarm, but 200 is high for a triglyceride reading, and your doctor would still want to discuss options to help control your triglycerides.

, If any of your individual readings or your total cholesterol is out of the optimal range, then your doctor will likely recommend making lifestyle changes to help reduce your cholesterol. These steps include:Reducing saturated fats, trans fats, salt, and sugar in your diet
Choosing healthy food options, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean meat protein
Getting at least thirty minutes of cardio exercise each day
Quitting smoking (if applicable)
Maintaining a healthy weight

Try sashimi or ceviche.,
Try carpaccio.,
Consider raw dairy products.",How to Get Enough Protein on a Raw Food Diet2," Although many people who follow a raw diet are vegans, both vegetarians and omnivores also follow the raw food diet. If you are an omnivore, you can enjoy raw fish dishes such as sashimi and ceviche. Both of these are high in protein and can provide a much needed boost to your plant-based protein sources.Choose sashimi, which is usually thinly sliced fish. In most cases, salmon and tuna are the types of fish used.Salmon sashimi has 5.6 g per ounce and white tuna has 7.2 g per ounce. You can also try sashimi made from eel at 6.7 g per ounce or sardine, which has 7 g per ounce.Make ceviche, which is a Latin American dish of raw fish or seafood marinated in citrus juice.A ¼ cup of ceviche has 13 g of protein., Carpaccio is an Italian delicacy that is made of thin slices of raw meat such as beef.A 3 ounce serving of beef carpaccio has 25 g of protein.Keep in mind that eating raw or undercooked meat can cause serious illness or even death., Milk, cheese, and other dairy products such as yogurt are all very high in protein, but for many raw dieters, they’re off limits because the process of pasteurization heats dairy to remove pathogenic bacteria.If you would like to boost your protein, consider trying raw dairy products.Animal milks have 8 g of protein per 8 ounces.Locate local farms and stores that sell raw milk and milk products by using an online sites such as Agrilicious at http://www.agrilicious.org/local/raw-milk. A Campaign for Real Milk can also help you find local farms that sell unpasteurized dairy products at http://www.realmilk.com/real-milk-finder/.
Raw, unpasteurized milk is illegal in some states.Vary your dairy options by choosing different milks and milk products such as cow, goat, and sheep.
Keep in mind that consuming unpasteurized dairy products can expose you to dangerous bacteria including Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. All of these can cause serious illness.Pregnant women are strongly discouraged from consuming raw dairy.

Ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian who may can help you create a meal plan to make sure you’re getting enough protein on a raw diet.


Be honest with your doctor about your plans to be on a raw diet as well as the reasons why. Ask any questions you may have about the diet’s safety for your personal health.

, Every individual needs protein to maintain his or her health and wellbeing. It helps you build muscle and make things like hair, blood, connective tissue, and antibodies. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of protein for an individual is 0.8 g per kilogram body weight. Aim to get your personal RDA every day.Calculate how much protein you need by using an online protein calculator, such as this one from United States Department of Agriculture: http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/. Keep in mind that the RDA is for a sedentary adult., For any person, it’s important to vary his or her food choices. This ensures you get the broad range of vital nutrients to maintain your health and wellbeing. As someone on a raw food diet, eating a variety of foods is especially important because there are many things you can’t eat. Aim to incorporate as many different (naturally) colored foods as you can at each meal.Try having a smoothie for breakfast with an avocado, some fresh berries, a handful of spinach or kale, and some spirulina. You can mix this with either fresh pressed juice or ice. For lunch, have a big mixed salad with foods like watercress, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, some pumpkin seeds and almonds. You can have sashimi for dinner with a cold soup such as gazpacho. If you don’t eat meat or dairy, have some peanut butter and a selection of cut fruits and vegetables.

Do your research.,
Eat a variety of plant-based proteins.,
Add quinoa to your diet.,
Add soy to your diet.,
Don't forget the legumes!,
Incorporate other plant-based protein sources.",How to Add Protein to Your Diet3," While it is absolutely possible to get the protein you need from a solely plant-based diet, it is a bit trickier and planning is essential to make sure you are getting enough of the right kinds of protein.


Since vegetable-based protein is not as readily utilized by the body as animal-based protein sources, you might also need to increase the number of grams of protein you consume to get the same effect. , Protein is made up of building blocks called amino acids. To be considered a ""complete"" protein, a protein source must have all eight of these acids; most plant-based sources of protein are missing at least one. While many used to believe it was necessary to combine incomplete proteins in specific combinations, scientists now agree that as long as you eat a variety of protein-rich foods, you will get all of the nutrients that you need., Quinoa is actually a seed, not a grain, and is rare in that it is a complete protein in and of itself.Quinoa is easy to prepare and is becoming increasingly popular and easy to find in stores and at many restaurants. You can eat quinoa for breakfast as a hot cereal, add it to salads, and incorporate it into sides and main courses, much as you would rice.

, Soy is an important protein source that studies have shown to be just as ""high quality"" in terms of how it effects your body as animal-based proteins.Eat tofu in a stir fry, or add some to a fruit smoothie for a creamy, protein-packed boost.

, Beans and peas are excellent sources of protein, as well as fiber, and many important vitamins and nutrients.Try a vegetarian chili, or a delicious lentil soup.
Hummus makes an excellent protein-rich snack or meal.
Peanuts are also legumes and are not just good dry-roasted or as peanut butter, but also in main-dish recipes such as African Peanut soup.

, Cereal grains, in particular oats and some varieties of wheat, contain a lot of protein. Some vegetables are also high in protein, including kale, mushrooms, broccoli rabe, artichokes, and corn.More high-protein vegetables include spinach, cauliflower, onions, asparagus, and potatoes.

Learn about the options.,
Try protein bars, a convenient way to consume more protein on the go.,
Add protein powder to blended beverages and other recipes.,
Try a prepared shake or protein beverage.",How to Add Protein to Your Diet4," There are many kinds of protein supplements on the market that can make it very easy to add protein to your diet. Learn the options and choose products that fit your lifestyle, and your nutritional goals.

, There are dozens of brands of protein bars on the market that come in hundreds of different varieties and flavors. Look for a bar that is high in protein, but also one that tastes good so you are likely to actually eat it. Make sure to read labels carefully if you have any food allergies or are trying to stay vegetarian or vegan, as different protein bars use different protein sources.


Some protein bars also contain quite a bit of fat and/or sugar, so if you are trying to minimize your calorie intake, pay attention to the total number of calories, not just the protein count.
You can also make your own protein bars at home, using ingredients like soy protein powder, nuts, dried fruits, and so forth. This gives you complete control over what you are putting in your body, and lets you experiment with different flavors., There are many kinds of protein powder. The most common include whey and casein powder (both dairy derivatives), soy powder, and egg protein powder.Some of these powders are flavored, and some are plain, and there are a wide variety of formulations available at your grocery store or local health food store. Ask friends or a staff person for a recommendation.


Protein powders aren't just for smoothies! You can also stir a few tablespoons into baking recipes, from pancakes to banana bread, add a few scoops to your veggie or traditional burger mix, add them to soup, or even lasagna., There are many kinds of protein shakes available at your grocery store that just need to be refrigerated and consumed. There are also an increasing number of new protein drinks that abandon the chalky, thick texture of a shake, while still offering a protein boost. Look for them on your grocery store shelves and give one a shot!"

Tell your dietitian about the food you enjoy.,
Talk to your dietitian about meat substitutes.,
Consider nutritional drinks and protein bars.,
Ask your dietitian about other nutritional supplements.,
Be honest with your dietitian.,
Develop a food plan together.,
Boost caloric intake with fats and sugars.",How to Increase Albumin2," One of the best ways to help your dietitian recommend changes in your diet is by describing what you usually eat. This will give them information they can use to advise changes, including specific additions you need to make to improve your diet.Your dietitian will be able to recommend specific additions to your diet, as well as ways of eating foods you like in a healthier way.

, One important topic to discuss with a dietitian is any eating preferences you have. For instance, if you don’t eat meat, other forms of protein become especially important.Your dietitian will help you identify high quality non-meat proteins. When selecting meat substitutes such as soy-based foods, be sure to choose options that are not too high in potassium, sodium, or phosphorus.

, While specific nutritional drinks for those undergoing dialysis can be helpful, only rely on these as a significant component of your diet under the guidance of a dietitian. Meanwhile, protein bars can be helpful meal replacements, but should not make up the majority of your diet.If you are on dialysis and selecting protein bars, choose those that have more than 15 grams of protein but less than 150 mg phosphorus and under 200 mg of both potassium and sodium.

, Depending on your overall health and nutrition, you may need to take nutritional supplements. The need to do so, as well as the type of supplement you should take, will vary depending on your diet and health. As such, follow the guidance of your dietitian in particular.Simply ask something like, “Is there any specific nutritional supplement I should be taking considering my current nutritional levels?”

, Many of the questions your dietitian will ask you are meant to help them identify potential barriers that may be preventing you from getting adequate nutrition. More to the point, your dietitian will recommend different courses of action based on the specific reasons you may not be getting enough protein., Maintaining a healthy diet requires a bit of planning, especially if you are receiving dialysis treatment or have other health complications. Even a very simple food plan can help you ensure you’re eating enough of what you need.Aside from specific hints about what and how to eat, ask for advice regarding how to maintain healthier dietary behavior.
At a minimum, develop and maintain a food plan to help make sure you eat protein with every meal.

, With the guidance of a dietitian, you may need to increase your caloric intake to help your body use the extra protein you’re eating. Your dietitian might even recommend using more butter while cooking, or putting more dressing on your salads.Many dairy products, including milk, contain too much potassium and phosphorus for those on dialysis who have low albumin. As such, these are not recommended sources of fats.

"
"
See a dentist regularly.,
Recognize signs of low albumin.,
Avoid skipping dialysis treatments.,
Eat when you’re hungry.,
Stick with it.",How to Increase Albumin3," Inflammation and infection can cause you to lose albumin, especially while you’re receiving dialysis treatments. Infections in your gums can be especially problematic. Ensure you’re not losing albumin through a mouth infection by visiting your dentist every six months for a cleaning and checkup.Note that dietary changes may be insufficient to raise your albumin levels if you have an oral infection such as peritonitis and are receiving dialysis.

, Especially if you have health complication such as kidney disease that puts you at risk of low albumin, it’s important to recognize signs and symptoms that your levels have dropped. These include persistent swelling, tiredness, feelings of weakness, prolonged infections, slow-healing wounds, and whiteness in your nails. Bring these symptoms to the attention of your medical team., If you are receiving dialysis treatments, it’s important to keep your treatment schedule. This is partly because failing to do so may hinder your ability to maintain healthy albumin levels., If you tend not to eat a lot, it’s especially important that you make sure to get at least one full meal every day, in addition to any smaller meals you regularly eat. If there is a certain part of the day where your appetite is stronger, such as the morning, make sure to eat a full meal at that time everyday., Changes to your albumin levels won’t happen overnight. In fact, it will likely take at least three weeks for your albumin levels to rise, as proteins build up slowly in your blood. Stick to any plans you’ve developed with your dietitian, however, and your efforts will start to pay off."

Limit your intake of saturated fats.,
Increase the soluble fiber you eat each day.,
Select foods that contain healthy fats.,
Add food products containing sterols or stanols to your diet.,
Drink, eat, and cook with low-fat or fat-free dairy products only.,
Go for Omega-3s.,

Raise your HDL levels.,
Find an LDL-lowering buddy.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Lower Your LDL Cholesterol," The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) strongly recommends following a low-cholesterol diet, minimizing saturated fats. And they sure know what they're talking about! The easiest way to do this is to limit the amount of processed goods in your diet and focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.


Just what are the main sources of saturated (and trans) fats? Think animals—beef, lamb, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The more vegetarian your diet, the lower your intake of saturated fats will be—so long as your veggies aren't slathered in butter! Just one tablespoon of the stuff has 7g of the stuff. The American Heart Association suggests saturated fat should be only 7% of your diet.;
, Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are excellent sources of fiber. These foods help to move cholesterol out of the body through stool rather than the body reabsorbing the cholesterol. You've probably heard grandma talking about it!


Oats, nuts, kidney beans, apples, pears, and flax are full of soluble fiber too. That's the kind that soaks up cholesterol, preventing it from staying in your body., Those found in fish, seeds, avocados, and nuts are fats that are good for you. You do need some, you know! You want to go for the polyunsaturated kind.But be careful: a handful of nuts is healthy; an entire container is not.


For oils choose olive, canola, or peanut. But make sure not to use these in addition—olive oil and the like should be a substitute for things like butter or margarine. And again: moderation is key. Even though they're chock full of healthy fats doesn't mean you can go overboard!

Extra-virgin olive oil is even better -- that means it's less processed. Aim for two tablespoons (30 g) a day to reap the benefits., These include special margarine, salad dressing, or vegetables and fruits in their natural states. They're a sort of a trendy thing, so read your labels! Companies are now even adding them to orange juice, granola bars, and cereals.Stanols and sterols sort of masquerade in the bloodstream as cholesterol (molecularly, they're very similar). Then when the cholesterol does come traveling through, your blood's all, ""No thanks. We're full up already. There's no room at the inn for you!"" And the cholesterol goes out with the rest of the waste. , The DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet, and the Ornish diet (all diets geared toward being heart-healthy) are all low in animal products, and that includes dairy. That's because dairy (and animal products in general) are high in bad fats and cholesterol.


Just because something is high in cholesterol doesn't mean you have to avoid it entirely. The occasional egg won't undo your progress. While doctors used to think this is how it worked, they now concentrate on bad fats.You can partially replace animal product protein with other sources, like beans and other vegetable proteins. Have yet to try almond milk? What better reason than your health?! And as for soy, consuming 25g of soy protein (that's about 2 1/2 cups of soy milk) a day can lower your LDL levels by 5-6%., If you are eating anything like an American, ""well balanced"" is probably what you are not eating; your Omega 3:Omega 6 ratio could be as high as 1:20, when it should be 1:1. A simple way to change this? Fish.


Mackerel, salmon, lake trout, albacore tuna, and halibut are all fatty fish that are great for you—their levels of fatty acids can actually lower blood pressure and reduce your chances of blood clots. Win! If you don't like fish, you can get similar stuff from ground flaxseed or canola oil. And as always: The real thing is better than a supplement., Dropping pounds may help to reduce bad cholesterol. Even a loss of 10lbs can start the lowering process along.A combination of diet and exercise will be the most efficient way to do this.


Fat is especially calorie-dense (9 calories per gram, whereas as carbs and protein only have 4).If you're counting calories for your waistline, cutting out fat is an easy way to keep the numbers down.

, Being physically inactive is a huge culprit when it comes to having high cholesterol. The recommended amount of exercise each day is between 30 and 60 minutes; 150 minutes is recommended each week (75 minutes if the activity is vigorous).You'll be healthier and feel healthier.


Choose activities that you enjoy most, like swimming, jogging, bicycling, hiking, walking, or dancing. If it's something you enjoy, you'll stick with it. Make sure it's convenient, too! You don't have to lift weights or go running—as long as you're moving, that's physical activity.

, For starters, if you don't drink, don't start. But if you do include alcohol in your socializing routine, keep it in—in serious moderation. Having just one drink a night (two if you're male) can help lower your cholesterol. But just the one!Too much alcohol, on the other hand, can serious raise your triglyceride levels.Anything more than the occasional drink will do damage to your system and put you at risk for alcoholism.
One drink is defined as 5oz of wine, 8oz of malt liquor, 12oz of beer, or 1.5oz of hard liquor., It is a well-known fact that smoking can decrease your good HDL cholesterol levels. Smoking can also make it more difficult to exercise, which may affect your cholesterol levels overall. And for your general health, it's a great, great idea to stop.


If you haven't already bombarded with the plethora of reasons you should quit smoking, you must be living under a rock. Smoking is a serious contributor to heart disease, cancer, and other serious diseases. It also negatively affects those around you.
It's not too late. In fact, as soon as you stop smoking, your lungs begin to repair themselves.And the same goes for your wallet!

, Everything is easier when you have an army of support behind you. Don't be ashamed of what you're going through; it's such a common thing nowadays that the American Heart Association is saying everyone 20 and older should get screened every 5 years. Twenty. So let your family and friends know because they can help.


Eating, exercising, and lifestyle habits are very much all social endeavors. Friends who smoke tempt you to smoke, friends who eat tempt you to eat, and friends who make plans drinking beer around the poker table keep you from working out. The only way they can accommodate you and help you succeed is if they know. And they'll back you 100%!

, The NIH has a great little booklet on understanding cholesterol that is very user-friendly. It can be found at here. It outlines the TLC diet, which this article has more or less done. After all, knowledge is power. When you know what you're fighting, you'll know how to fight it.


You're already on the right track—doing research on the internet. The next step should be your friends, family, and your doctor. Just make sure to check your sources!

, Increase the rate that your body sends LDL cholesterol to the liver for excretion or re-utilization. To do this, raise your high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the good cholesterol. HDL enables your body to transport cholesterol and triglycerides through the bloodstream. Sometimes, though not always, the two work in conjunction.


Dark chocolate, green tea, and vitamin D can also increase your HDL levels. While most people can safely consume 1 glass of red wine or another alcoholic beverage a day to raise their HDL levels also, it can be detrimental to alcoholics, older people, and those who are overweight or suffering with other illnesses. If alcohol ain't your cup of Cabernet, you've an excuse to eat chocolate!

, 1 out of every 3 adult Americans has high cholesterol.Basically, you need to know only a handful of other people to find someone going through the same thing you are! With odds like that, it's probable you have a friend that is fighting the same battle you are, so you might as well fight it together.


Design and plan meals geared toward fighting cholesterol. Become workout buddies. Find small opportunities (like going for a swim or walking the dog) to get active. When you have someone else to share your woes with, it feels that much more doable.

, They can inform you about managing your cholesterol with a cholesterol-lowering medication when eating right and getting proper exercise is not enough. You have plenty of options. And don't be afraid to ask questions!


Doctors generally like to see LDL cholesterol below 160, but they do consider other factors, like age, smoking and your family history, when determining the optimal level of LDL that you should have. You may or may not be a candidate for medication. Whatever your doctor thinks is probably best for you.
Statins are the most commonly prescribed form of medication for lowering cholesterol. If a healthy routine doesn't do it, these bad boys can lower your levels by 20 to 50%!"

Ezetimibe-simvastatin (Vytorin) is a combination drug which both reduces the absorption of cholesterol and reduces your body’s ability to make cholesterol. Side effects include digestive problems and muscle pain.

, The Food and Drug Administration has approved medications that can be injected by the patient at home one to two times per month. These medications increase the amount of cholesterol the liver absorbs. They are often given to people who have had heart attacks or strokes and are at a high risk for having them occur again. These medications include:Alirocumab (Praluent)
Evolocumab (Repatha)

Know what cholesterol is.,
Examine your diet.,
Keep your fat intake between 25 and 35% of your daily calories.,
Use olive oil for cooking instead of butter.,
Get at least 25 to 30 grams of fiber each day.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Choose fish over red meat.,
Eat avocados and nuts.,
Add whey protein to your diet.,
Eat plant sterols.,
Drink green tea.,
Eat six small meals a day.",How to Lower Your Cholesterol1," Cholesterol is an essential part of a balanced diet but too high cholesterol levels can impact your health negatively and contribute to heart disease. But not all cholesterol is the same:Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as the ""bad"" cholesterol, tends to accumulate in plaques inside the cardiac arteries, contributing to heart disease.High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also known as the “good” cholesterol, helps reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol in the body and may also contribute to a decreased risk of heart disease and stroke.;
, Most of the cholesterol you need is made by your body. However, food products contain additional cholesterol which contributes to increased levels in your body.Reduce your intake of animal-source foods that are high in cholesterol, including red meats, shellfish, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk.
In addition, you should avoid foods that contain saturated or trans fats as these increase the levels of LDL cholesterol as well.Build your diet around fresh produce, vegetable-sources of fat and protein and high-fiber foods.

, Fats are an important part of a balanced diet, but you need to moderate how much you eat and what types of fats you include in your diet. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are considered to be the good, heart-healthy fats, while saturated and trans fats are considered unhealthy..


Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats help lower LDL cholesterol, which is why you should eat more healthy sources of fat in order to decrease your risk of developing heart disease and stroke.Foods high in healthy fats include tofu, fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and river trout), avocado, nuts (such as walnuts, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts), beans (such as kidney beans, soybeans, and navy beans), and vegetable oils (such as olive, safflower, and flaxseed oil).
Saturated fats and trans fats increase your levels of LDL cholesterol, contributing to plaque-development inside your arteries.
Avoid foods that are fried and highly processed, and make sure that you moderate your intake of foods that are full of unhealthy fats, such as fried chicken, cookies, crackers, and full-fat dairy.
In addition, you should limit your intake of cholesterol from food to less than 300 mg a day. If your cholesterol is high, the recommended amount is less than 200 mg per day.

, Butter contains saturated fats that can raise LDL cholesterol. In contrast, olive oil contains antioxidants that can lower your LDL cholesterol without changing your HDL cholesterol.The FDA recommends about 2 tablespoons, or 23 grams, of olive oil a day to benefit from its heart-healthy benefits. Some research suggests that the cholesterol-lowering effects of olive oil are even better if you choose extra-virgin olive oil.

, Fiber is an essential part of a healthy diet that helps contribute to your heart health. Soluble fiber helps lower your cholesterol by binding with LDL cholesterol while it is still in your digestive system, keeping it from being absorbed in your bloodstream.Soluble fiber can be found from a variety of sources, including whole grain oatmeal, beans, nuts, and apples.Insoluble fiber is also an important for your diet. Although it does not help lower cholesterol like soluble fiber, it does add bulk to stool and promotes better digestive system health. Sources of insoluble fiber include wheat bran and whole grains., Complex carbohydrates are rich in nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber but they also help lower your cholesterol levels. In contrast, food high in simple sugars have been linked to elevated LDL cholesterol levels.Good sources of complex carbohydrates include oat bran, legumes, cabbage, whole grain pasta, and corn.
Many studies have shown a link between high consumption of sugars with increased cholesterol and plasma lipid levels. Limit your intake of sweets and baked goods., Fish contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids that do not contribute to LDL cholesterol levels. Dietary guidelines recommend having at least two servings of fish each week.The highest levels of omega-3 fatty acid are found in mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon.Red meat is high in LDL cholesterol and saturated fats. When choosing beef, opt for leaner cuts (such as top and bottom round roast, top sirloin and sirloin tip side steak) or choose a white-meat protein source, such as turkey or chicken, whenever possible to help manage your cholesterol level., Avocados and nuts are good vegetarian sources of monounsaturated fats that help lower LDL cholesterol levels. They are also packed with other healthy nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals.However, avocados and especially nuts are relatively high in calories and thus you should eat them in moderation. Consuming too many calories can make you overweight and being overweight puts you at higher risk for heart disease. A handful of nuts and/or one avocado a day are enough.

, Whey protein is derived from dairy and is shown to be effective at lowering levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.Whey protein is often offered in vanilla and chocolate flavors and can be added to a shake, oatmeal, or yogurt.
Caution: too much protein might not be good for you. Monitor your intake and limit your protein consumption to 15-25% of total daily calories per day or 0.8-1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. This translates to approximately 53 grams for a 140-lbs woman who does not exercise.If you exercise, are pregnant, or breastfeeding, your protein consumption is higher. If you are unsure how much to take, consult your doctor.

, Plant sterols help you manage your cholesterol level by blocking your body’s ability to absorb it, lowering LDL cholesterol levels by 6-15% without affecting the HDL cholesterol levels. Eating foods rich in plant sterols may be a good way to reduce your LDL cholesterol level and improve your heart health.Consuming sterols in recommended quantities of 2gm per day can lead to lowering LDL to that rate.
Sterols occur naturally in grains, fruits, legumes, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
Sterols are also added to many different kinds of foods, including orange juice, and yogurt.

, A clinical study indicated that drinking green tea may help lower your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Green tea also prevents your intestines from absorbing cholesterol and thus facilitates its excretion from your body. Green tea also has other health benefits and is thought to boost the immune system and decrease inflammation.Replace soda, juices, and other drinks with ice-cold green tea flavored with lime or sugar-free sweeteners.

, A British study showed that those eating six small meals a day resulted in significantly lower cholesterol than those eating two meals a day—despite the fact that those eating the six small meals actually consumed more calories and fat.


Break your daily calories between five or six meals. This will help keep you satisfied throughout the day and reduce unhealthy cravings.

Take fiber supplements.,
Reduce your intake of saturated and trans fat.,
Increase healthy cholesterol if you need to.",How to Lower Cholesterol Naturally1," Foods which are high in soluble fiber will naturally reduce your cholesterol.These are easy to find and taste wonderful, especially when well prepared.


Try eating oatmeal. Don’t dress it up with lots of butter or milk, as this will nullify the beneficial effects.
Try eating pumpernickel, rye, or other whole grain breads. These are a great source of fiber and are very filling.
Try high-fiber fruits like apples and pears. Who doesn’t like apples and pears? You can also eat prunes, which get a bad rep but actually taste like healthy candy.
Try beans. Kidney beans in particular are high in fiber.
Try walnuts and almonds. Both are rich in healthy fats which can help with your cholesterol.;

, This will help keep you from building more bad cholesterol. Instead of using butter and coconut oil, you can switch to using olive oil. Also avoid eating meat (except fish), full-fat dairy products, and egg yolks.


Trans fats are common in foods like margarine, so try to avoid that. It is really not a healthy alternative to butter.

, People oftentimes do not get enough healthy cholesterol. If your doctor recommends that you get more, consider changing your diet to accommodate this. The best way is to eat fish. Fish consist of the essential Omega-3 fatty acids which can help minimize the risk of heart disease. High amount of Omega-3 is found in salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna. Grilled or baked fish is definitely the ideal choice to go.

Understand that your lipid panel cholesterol test will include a profile on LDL, HDL and triglycerides, as well as a total cholesterol number.,
Know what your numbers mean.,
Seek routine cholesterol screenings every 5 years once you are 20 or older.,
Follow your doctor's recommended treatment plan.,
Wait 6 weeks after an illness to get an accurate cholesterol reading, as your levels may be abnormally high during that period.,
Know that some common medications and supplements can also increase cholesterol including some birth control pills, vitamin D, beta blockers, anabolic steroids and epinephrine.

",How to Understand Cholesterol Tests,"


LDL stands for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and is sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol."" LDLs are fats that can build up on your artery walls and lead to heart disease.
HDL stands for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and is sometimes referred to as ""good cholesterol."" It removes bad cholesterol and prevents it from accumulating in your arteries.
Triglycerides are the chemical form of fat that comes from from extra calories, sugar and alcohol, and is transported in the blood. A high level of triglycerides increases the risk for coronary artery disease.;
, Lipid panel -- LDL, HDL and triglycerides -- have an optimum range.


For LDL you want your number to be as low as possible, with less than 100 being ideal. When your level reaches 130, doctors determine that your LDL is borderline-high. Your LDL level is high when it surpasses 160.
A high number is good for your HDL. A level above 60 is ideal. A level of less than 50 in women and less than 40 in men could indicate a risk for heart disease.
Ideal triglyceride levels should be less than 150, while 200 is considered high.
Your total cholesterol number factors in your HDL, LDL and other parts of your cholesterol profile. Ideally the number should be under 200, while doctors consider a level of 240 or greater high.

,


Your doctor may recommend more frequent cholesterol testing based on certain risk factors such as your age, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or family history of heart disease. Pre-existing conditions are also a factor, particularly if you are overweight or have already had a heart attack.

, The doctor may prescribe medications or put you on a special diet and encourage you to exercise.

, Your cholesterol may also be high during pregnancy.

Talk to your doctor.,
Determine your daily caloric intake.,
Consider your activity level.,
Determine your optimal protein intake.,
Consume more protein if you are pregnant.,
Take breastfeeding into account.,
Watch out for warning signs.",How to Know if You're Getting Enough Protein1," Before you change your diet, you should talk to your doctor about how much protein you should be consuming. They will be able to help you determine the proper dietary interventions based on your health, lifestyle, and personal history.;
, How much protein you need depends on the number of calories you consume each day. The United States Department of Agriculture sets guidelines for estimated calorie needs based on age, gender, and level of physical activity. Check out the agency’s website for specific guidelines.A moderately active woman needs around 2000 calories per day.
A moderately active man needs around 2500 calories per day.

, Your dietary needs depend on the amount of exercise you get each day. For example, a 25-year-old woman who is moderately active should be consuming about 200 calories more per day than a woman who is sedentary. A 25-year old woman who is active will need an additional 200 calories each day.For example, a moderately active person is someone who walks between 1.5 and 3 miles or 2.5 to 5 kilometers per day.
An active person, for example, walks more than 3 miles or 5 kilometers per day.

, Healthy adults should get between 10% and 35% of their calories from protein. Once you figure out the recommended number of calories you should be consuming each day, you can calculate how much protein you should be consuming.If you are consuming 2000 calories each day, then 20% of those calories, or 400 calories, should come from protein.
Since one gram of protein equals 4 calories, you should aim for around 100 grams of protein in a 2000 calorie diet.

, Higher amounts of protein are necessary for pregnant women to support fetal development. Pregnant women should consume an additional 10 grams of protein each day., A lactating woman should be consuming more protein than a non-lactating woman of similar age and activity level. During the first six months of breastfeeding, a woman should consume an additional 15 grams of protein daily. After the first six months, an additional 12 grams of protein should be consumed., If you aren’t getting enough protein, your body might be trying to tell you with a variety of symptoms. Some common signs you should increase your protein intake include having trouble losing weight, low energy levels, poor concentration, mood problems, and wounds that are slow to heal.If you experience these symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor for a nutritional assessment.

Ask your doctor about resins.,
Ask your doctor about lipid-lowering medications.,
Consider PCSK9 inhibitors.",How to Lower Your Cholesterol3," If you suffer from high cholesterol and lifestyle changes are not enough to lower the levels, your doctor may suggest you take medications. Statins help lower LDL cholesterol and may also raise your HDL cholesterol.Statins are market under several brands including lovastatin (Altoprev, Mevacor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and fluvastatin (Lescol).
Side effects of statins are typically mild and include muscle aches and changes in digestive patterns.You should not take statins if you are pregnant.

, Selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (such as Zetia or ezetimibe) are relatively new drugs that work by keeping your intestines from absorbing cholesterol from food.Side effects of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors include headache, fatigue, and stomachache., Resins make your liver use up cholesterol to produce increased levels of bile, thus lowering your total cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol.Resins are marketed under Colestid (colestipol), Welchol (colesevelam) and Questran (cholestyramine sucrose).
Side effects of resins are generally mild and typically include gas, bloating, nausea, stomachache, and heartburn., Lipid-lowering medications help lower triglycerides and LDL cholesterol by inhibiting your body from processing them. Fibrates and niacins are two types of lipid-lowering medications.Side effects of lipid-lowering medications include gas, stomachache, and nausea., If your cholesterol level does not seem to respond to any of these treatment methods, you may want to be evaluated for a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, and may be a candidate for PCSK9 inhibitors.

Consider protein content.,
Choose lean sources of protein.,
Eat protein at every meal.",How to Know if You're Getting Enough Protein2," When you’re trying to optimize your protein intake, it’s important to familiarize yourself with how much protein certain foods contain. This will help you make healthy decisions and ensure you consume the proper amount of protein each day. For example:A 3.5 ounce serving of roasted chicken breast contains 31 grams of protein. Typically, an ounce of meat has around 7 grams of protein, as a basic guideline.
A 6 ounce serving of plain Greek yogurt has 17 grams of protein.
One egg contains 6 grams of protein.
A large ear of corn has 4 grams of protein.

, You can make the most of your protein by choosing sources that are lean. Turkey and chicken are great sources of lean poultry. Fish is also a great source of lean protein. If you are a vegetarian, beans, tofu, or tempeh are great sources of protein.Fattier cuts of meat, like hamburger and sausage, are higher in cholesterol and saturated fats and should be consumed in moderation.
Try consuming leaner cuts of beef and pork, like pork loin or top sirloin steak.

, Making sure protein is a part of every meal will help you ensure that you’re consuming an optimal amount of this important macronutrient.

If you are a vegetarian, go for a plant-based shake such as one that includes rice or soy protein., Seeds and nuts are wonderful sources of protein that can be eaten on the go or as a topping on everyday foods like salad. Try a handful of walnuts and almonds for an easy snack. You can also top your salad or smoothie with a sprinkling of chia, hemp, or pumpkin seeds.One serving of nuts is about one ounce.

, If you’re looking to add protein to your diet, a nutrition bar with a high protein content is a great place to start. Opt for bars that have at least 10 grams of protein and no more than 10 grams of sugar. Keep one in your purse or briefcase for a quick protein-rich pick-me-up at the office or after the gym.

, If you are concerned you’re not getting enough protein, or if you are just looking to add more to your diet, consider tracking your food intake on a nutrition app. Apps can help you determine exactly how much protein is in your daily meals and even alert you when you need to eat more. Some apps to consider are:MyFitnessPal
LoseIt
SparkPeople

, If an app doesn’t feel like the right fit, you can track your protein intake in a journal each day. Try writing down everything you eat each day. This will help you keep track of exactly what you’re eating and give you the tools to add more protein if you see a deficiency.

Watch for a white or gray discoloured ""arc"" in your eye.If you have this, it is called ""circumferential arcus."",
Be aware that elevated cholesterol usually presents with no signs or symptoms.The challenging thing when it comes to detecting elevated cholesterol levels is that almost everyone presents with no visible signs or symptoms.,
Know the risk factors for high cholesterol.Your chance of developing high cholesterol at some point in your life is higher in proportion to your risk factors.,
Ask your doctor for a lipid panel.Because high cholesterol almost always presents with no signs or symptoms, the fastest and easiest way to detect it is via a blood test.,
Learn how to interpret your blood test results.When your blood test results come back from the lab, you will want to know whether they are concerning or not.,
Be patient when getting rechecked.,
Receive screening at regular intervals.Because there is essentially no way to detect high cholesterol other than through blood tests, you will need repeat screening blood tests throughout your life.,
Make lifestyle changes.Depending upon how high your cholesterol levels are, your doctor will suggest lifestyle changes with or without medications to help lower your levels.,
Take a statin medication.If lifestyle changes alone are insufficient to adequately reduce your cholesterol levels, your doctor will recommend that you begin medical treatment.,

These yellow patches which may or may not be raised off the skin.
They tend to be located above or below the eye, and often in both locations.
They are a sign of cholesterol deposition under the skin.
Note, however, that this only occurs in certain high cholesterol syndromes, and that the majority of cases of high cholesterol present with no signs or symptoms a all.;
, If they occur in the palm, knees, and/or elbows, they may be associated with Type III hyperlipidemia.

, The part of the eye that is affected is the cornea, which is the transparent outer covering of the eye. It is easiest to see these lesions over the white area of the eye, as the discoloration tends to be most apparent there.

, Therefore, doctors rely on screening blood tests to pick up high cholesterol, and to prescribe appropriate treatment as needed.


Therefore, even if you have no signs or symptoms, it is advisable to ask your doctor to screen your cholesterol levels at least every five years with a simple blood test (and more frequently if you have a family history of high cholesterol and/or other risk factors).

, The more risk factors you have, the more frequently you should receive screening blood tests from your doctor. Risk factors to be aware of include:


Eating an unhealthy diet high in fat and sugar
Having a large waist circumference
Being overweight or obese
Living a sedentary life
Smoking
Being diagnosed with diabetes or cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease

, Specifically, a ""lipid panel"" evaluates your HDL (""good"") cholesterol, your LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, your total cholesterol, and your triglyceride levels (another type of fat).


It is a fasting blood test, meaning that you cannot eat or drink fluids other than water for nine to 12 hours prior to the blood test.
You may eat and/or drink immediately following the blood test.
For this reason, most people do the test first thing in the morning (following an overnight ""fast""), and eat breakfast after the blood test is over.

, Here's how to interpret your results:


HDL (""good"") cholesterol: below 40mg/dL for men or 50mg/dL for women is poor, 50–59mg/dL is better, and above 60mg/dL is best. Ironically, HDL cholesterol is the one value where the higher numbers are more desirable.
LDL (""bad"") cholesterol: below 70–129mg/dL is desirable (the recommended value for you will depend on your overall health and other cardiovascular risk factors). 130–159mg/dL is considered borderline high, and above 160mg/dL is high.
Total cholesterol: below 200mg/dL is desirable, 200–239mg/dL is borderline high, and above 240mg/dL is high.
Triglycerides: below 150mg/dL is desirable, 150–199mg/dL is borderline high, and above 200mg/dL is high.

, If you make changes to improve your cholesterol, you may be eager to get your levels rechecked to see how your new, healthier lifestyle has impacted your cholesterol. It can, however, take between two and three months to see the lab changes from diet or medication. Make sure allow your body time to adjust before you get retested and become frustrated or discouraged.

, It is generally recommended to have your cholesterol levels tested once every five years if your initial test comes back normal. If your initial test is borderline high or high, or if you have risk factors or other medical conditions that may predispose you to elevated cholesterol, your doctor will likely advise that you have more frequent screening blood tests.


For children, an initial test is recommended between the ages of nine and 11. A second test is recommended between the ages of 17–21.
Screening can then continue every five years thereafter, unless otherwise indicated.

, If your cholesterol levels are only borderline high, lifestyle changes alone may be enough to get you back in the normal range. Positive lifestyle changes you can make include:


Incorporating more aerobic exercise — three to five sessions of thirty minutes or more each week is recommended. Aerobic exercise includes things like swimming, biking, jogging, or brisk walking — anything that elevates your heart rate continuously for thirty minutes or more. Exercise specifically raises your HDL levels (good cholesterol), which helps to improve your overall cholesterol profile.
Eating a healthier diet. Specifically, consuming more fruits and vegetables and reducing fat consumption can help to lower your cholesterol levels. Fiber in particular is one of the mainstay dietary changes to lower cholesterol, so try increasing sources of soluble fiber, such as oatmeal, beans, peas, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, and strawberries.Losing weight if you are overweight or obese — talk to your doctor about healthy weight loss goals for you, and where your ideal body weight should be based on your height and build.

, The usual first-line medication is a ""statin,"" such as Atorvastatin (Lipitor).


Once you begin medical treatment, your doctor will advise follow-up blood tests to monitor your cholesterol profile and the degree of improvement.

, If you stop treatment for any reason, your high cholesterol levels are likely to return.


If you find that side effects of medication are a concern for you, you can ask your doctor for an alternative medication to try, as there are plenty of treatment options for elevated cholesterol.

Take health courses in high school.,
Research respiratory therapy programs.,
Find a school offering studies in respiratory therapy.,
Complete a two-year respiratory therapy training program.,
Complete a four-year Bachelor of Health degree.,
Take the national credentialing exam.,
Obtain a license if required by your state.,
Gain your cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) certification and maintain it.,
Apply for a job as a respiratory therapist.,
Do not limit yourself to hospitals when searching for jobs.,
Advance in your career.",How to Become a Respiratory Therapist," Complete as many courses in biology, health, health occupations, math and science as possible. Information gained from these courses will help make your college studies more manageable, and will be applicable to your work as a respiratory therapist.


Take all high school courses that are required for college entrance. To be a respiratory therapist, you will need acceptance to at least a two-year higher education program.As you graduate high school, a high class rank and GPA will help make you a stronger candidate for degree programs.;
, The Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) has accredited over 440 entry-level and advanced therapy programs in the United States.Look for programs that are located in your state, or in a state that you would like to live in.
Contact programs directly to find out their job-placement rates. Aim for placement in a program with successful job placement.

, Many two-year institutions offer respiratory therapy degrees.If you prefer not to study at a typical college or university, there are other places at which you can receive training:


Locate a hospital offering formal respiratory therapy training. A few hospitals offer training programs.
Search for a vocational or technical school that has a respiratory therapy training program.
Complete respiratory therapy training through a branch of the military.

, You will graduate from this with an Associate degree in respiratory care. An Associates degree is the typical degree one needs to become a respiratory therapist, and many professionals in the field do not pursue higher degrees.


This degree program will include participating in, and passing, classroom and clinical hands-on programs.
Your 2-year degree will also require you to complete clinical hours outside of the university, to gain practical medical experience., In this 4-year degree, you’ll specialize in Respiratory Care. You do not need both an Associate degree and a Bachelor degree—choose one or the other.


In your 4-year degree program, you’ll take courses related to clinical respiratory care, respiratory theory, and mechanical ventilation.A Bachelor’s degree in Respiratory Care will take longer than an Associate degree, and delay how quickly you can start working in the field. However, the 4-year degree will give you a competitive edge. Many employers who want to hire respiratory therapists would prefer to hire someone with a Bachelor’s degree.

, This exam, called the Therapist Multiple-Choice (TMC) Examination, is offered by the National Board for Respiratory Care.Once you pass this exam, you will earn your respiratory therapy credential.


The TMC exam will test your understanding of entry-level respiratory therapist skills.
The test comprises 160 multiple-choice questions that test the three following areas of knowledge: (1) Patient Data Evaluation and Recommendations, (2) Troubleshooting and Quality Control of Equipment and Infection Control, and (3) Initiation and Modification of Interventions.The TMC test costs $190 for first-time test takers, and $150 for repeat test-takers. The test can be taken at any of 190 testing centers across the United States.Those graduating from entry level or advanced programs accredited by CoARC are eligible to take the exam with the intent of earning a Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) license.

, This licensing normally occurs when you graduate, and an Associates degree in the field is technically the minimum qualification needed to be a licensed respiratory therapist.If you’re applying for a state license, you’ll need to fill out an application and pay a fee. These licenses often need to be renewed annually.Every state except Alaska currently licenses respiratory therapists.

, Most employers require that their respiratory therapists hold a CPR certificate. Since you will be working with patients who have lung and respiratory disorders, you may need to perform CPR on the job.


CPR certification is offered through the American Red Cross. Check their website for dates and locations where CPR training will be offered. The course is usually held in a public facility, and may only take a few hours to earn.Most Respiratory Therapy programs require CPR certification before students’ graduation.

, In a position as a respiratory therapist, you’ll work with a variety of patients (ranging from infants to the elderly) and perform many duties, including diagnostic and emergency services.


Respiratory care, anesthesiology and pulmonary medicine departments of hospitals offer the most positions for respiratory therapists. These are good places to begin when searching for a job.
Respiratory therapy has a positive outlook as a job field—it’s forecast to grow substantially within the coming decade., Hospitals make up more than 75% of respiratory therapy jobs. However, other health facilities, such as nursing homes and doctor’s offices, are increasingly making use of respiratory services.


At a doctor’s office, you will likely have regular hours, while at a hospital (or providing outpatient services), you may be on-call around the clock., To do this, you will need to earn a title of Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). This is considered the advanced-level credential in the respiratory therapy field, and the test will evaluate your higher-level respiratory therapist skills. The RRT test will consist of both a written examination and an in-person demonstration of your respiratory medical knowledge.You can earn your RRT title by graduating from an advanced program and passing both the TMC exam, as well as the Clinical Simulation Examination (CSE).You can register for the CSE through the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) website. The examination consists of 22 written questions.
You must earn your RRT title within three years of graduating from your respiratory therapy program. If you miss this deadline, you can also apply for an RRT title after you have had your CRT license for three years.You will increase your chances of earning a supervisor or instructor position if you advance in your education and become a Registered Respiratory Therapist. You can register for the tests to become an RRT through the NBRC website."

Eat garlic.,
Chomp on nuts and seeds.,
Go fish.,
Load up on fiber.,
Use healthy vegetable oils.,
Munch on raw fruits and veggies.",How to Reduce Cholesterol Without Medicines1," Garlic is an excellent substance to add to your diet to keep your cholesterol levels at a reasonable number. It can reduce cholesterol levels without causing any side effects, in addition to preventing blood clots, reducing blood pressure, and protecting against infections.Although it is best to take it in raw form, it is equally efficacious in other forms like pickles.


Next time you hit the supermarket, pick up a tub of freshly peeled garlic cloves, and challenge yourself to make sure it's gone before the ""best by"" date. Chop up and toss on pizza, in soups, or on side dishes.;
, Though they're all great, sunflower seeds are particularly efficacious in keeping the cholesterol levels down. They're full of linoleic acid that reduces plaque formation, keeping your blood flowing down arterial easy street.


Walnuts, almonds, and other nuts are good, too; it's not just the sunflower variety. They're generally all full of polyunsaturated fatty acids -- that's the good kind. As long as the nuts aren't coated in salt or sugar, you're good to go. Aim for a handful (1.5 oz; 43 g) a day., Eating fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and herring is ultra heart-healthy to due their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Those guys can lower your blood pressure and prevent your blood from clotting. If you've already had a heart attack, they can even reduce the risk of sudden death.If you're not quite a chef de cuisine, canned tuna isn't exempt from the omega-3 category. And to go even further, you could always take fish oil supplements -- once you've talked to your doctor, of course. The American Heart Association says the natural source, the fish itself, is better, but something is better than nothing. Alternative sources also include soybeans, canola, flaxseeds, walnuts, and their oils, for our herbivore friends., Not only are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains great for your waistline, but they're wonderfully full of heart-healthy antioxidants and cholesterol-lowering dietary fiber. There are different kinds of fiber, actually, and these three food groups are chock full of the soluble kind -- the kind that sits in your digestive tract and absorbs the cholesterol before it gets to your arteries. Talk about useful.It's practically a super-food, oatmeal is. And when it comes to cholesterol, it's full of the soluble fiber that lowers your LDL cholesterol. Aim for 5 to 10 grams (or more!) of fiber a day to reap the cholesterol-lowering effects. If you're curious, 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal ranks in at 6 grams of fiber. Not an oatmeal fan? Kidney beans, apples, pears, and prunes are also high-fiber foods., Always use oils in your food that are full of good fats, such as olive oil, sunflower oil, or walnut. Cutting down on your saturated and trans fats is imperative to lowering your cholesterol.


Olive oil is particularly masterful in lowering your LDL levels while not lowering your HDL levels (that's a very good thing). Replace other fats in your diet (butter, shortening, etc.) with olive oil to reap the benefits. Try it with sauteed vegetables, as a salad dressing, or on bread. Delicious, delicious, delicious.

If you do make the leap, know that extra-virgin olive oil is even better than the plain ol' regular kind. It's generally less processed and therefore has more nutrients and anti-oxidants. And when you see an olive oil that's light in color, know that that does not mean light in calories or fat -- it just means more processed., Raw vegetables are always a better source of fiber and antioxidants than cooked ones. When they're raw, they maintain all their vitamins and nutrients -- all the stuff that's good for you. The good stuff gets cooked away when heated.


Turn your main dishes into vegetarian ones -- casseroles, lasagnas, soups and stir-fries are all easy to make sans meat. And as for fruit, try to keep it fresh -- dried fruit often has more calories. If you do have a penchant for the dried kind, however, keep it to a handful.Spinach is a great source of lutein, which has recently been found to help shrug off cholesterol invaders. Shoot for 1/2 cup (100 g) a day to reap the benefits.What's more, fruits and veggies are low calorie and low fat. Cutting back on saturated fats (which can also be done by consuming soy products) helps your heart and reduces LDL cholesterol."
"
Keep fit.,
Lose weight.",How to Reduce Cholesterol Without Medicines2," Include as much exercise as your physical condition allows. Physical activity increases the body’s flexibility and helps pump the blood through your arteries. And of course, follow your doctor's advice too.


Choose a form of exercise you can do for 10-20 minutes at a time, with at least moderate intensity, such as walking, biking, swimming, jogging, or using an exercise machine at low speed.First, exercise stimulates enzymes that help move LDL from the blood (and blood-vessel walls) to the liver. From there, the cholesterol is converted into bile (for digestion) or excreted. So the more you exercise, the more LDL your body expels.Second, exercise increases the size of the protein particles that carry cholesterol through the blood.That's a good thing -- the smaller, denser ones burrow into the lining of your heart and start clogging away. How's that for a mental image?



, It doesn't have to be a lot, either. If you lose just 5 to 10% of your weight, your cholesterol levels could reduce greatly. Not to mention the scads of other health benefits!Watch your calories. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it: An increased caloric intake will lead to weight gain. Keep a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and low-fat dairy. Stick to good fats (like the ones in avocados, nuts, and olive oil) and cut out the processed junk.
Try to incorporate activity into your daily endeavors. Opt for the stairs instead of the elevator, make taking the dog for a walk a pre-dinner activity, and bike to do an errand or two. Exercise doesn't always have to be a formal ""workout"" session if your schedule or body doesn't allow for it.

Understand the nature of cholesterol.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Set a target.,
Quit smoking.",How to Reduce Cholesterol Without Medicines3," Cholesterol is a fatty substance which is essential ingredient of the body used in various metabolic activities of the body. However, when it exceeds the normal limits (150-200 mg/dL blood), it poses a serious threat to the arteries and heart. It can be successfully regulated and treated by means of slight changes in your diet.


Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as ""bad"" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein, or HDL, is known as ""good"" cholesterol. These two types of lipids, along with triglycerides and Lp(a) cholesterol, make up your total cholesterol count, which can be determined through a blood test., He or she should be your first opinion. They will be able to tell you what's a good number for you. Your family history and lifestyle will factor into their conclusion. What's more, they can help you stick to a plan.


Ask them what physical exercise and diet regimen you should be starting. They can help by giving you ideas and telling you the do's and don'ts of maintaining low cholesterol.

, For each person it's different -- so what's your ideal number? Your doctor will probably ask you a few questions to find out what's right for you. It all depends on your family history, your weight, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits (like smoking and drinking).For high-risk patients, a target LDL of less than 70 will likely be advised. If you fall into the moderate category, under 130 may be your number. And if you're one of the lucky ones and your risk is low, less than 160 is acceptable. Whatever branch you fall into, it's best to know earlier rather than later., If you smoke, stop. Apart from all the other reasons it's not good for you, it may help to raise your good cholesterol -- the HDL kind. Just 20 minutes after quitting, you'll see a change. Within a day, you're less likely to get a heart attack. If you make it a year, your risk of heart disease gets cut in half. And in 15 years, it's like you never smoked. So, yes, you still have time.A person's risk of heart disease and heart attack greatly increases with the number of cigarettes he or she smokes. People who smoke have a two to four times higher chance of having heart disease. And smokers continue to increase their risk of heart attack the longer they smoke. Women who smoke and also take birth control pills increase several times their risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease."

Give a strong interview.",How to Become an Audiologist," The best way to prepare for a career in audiology during high school is to take as many science courses as you can. Though your high school probably won't offer audiology courses, you can still get a head start by taking advanced courses and electives that will prepare you for a science-based major in college.If your school offers anatomy, physics, or genetics courses, you should take those classes.
Some high schools may have after-school clubs or interest groups related to science and healthcare. Find out about your school's offerings and join any relevant groups you can.;
, You'll need a bachelor's degree to enter graduate school or a doctoral program. Most doctoral programs require you to have a bachelor's degree in any field, and there is no required major for your degree. However, some masters programs may have specific requirements for your major.Some colleges offer undergraduate degrees in speech and hearing science. Majoring in this or a related field may increase the chances of your acceptance into a doctoral program, and can also help expedite your doctoral studies.If your school does not offer an audiology-specific degree, it would be helpful to earn your bachelor degree in some scientific field, such as biology, physics, or genetics.

, After four years, you should be eligible to graduate with a bachelor's degree. You'll need to study hard and earn good grades if you want to get accepted to a master's and/or doctoral program. Graduate programs are highly competitive, so do whatever you can (tutoring, extra studying, working one-on-one with your professors) to ensure that you earn good grades.

, Most doctoral programs in audiology allow you to enter the program with a bachelor's degree. However, some may require you to have a master's degree as well. In addition, some professional certification boards, such as the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA), require you to have a master's degree on top of the required doctoral degree.If you're interested in pursuing an ASHA certification, you will need a master's degree. Certification by the American Board of Audiology (ABA) does not require a master's degree.
The decision to pursue a master's degree is up to you. It largely depends on your career goals and your anticipated certification needs.

, Whether or not you pursue a master's degree, you will need a doctoral degree in audiology in order to practice as an audiologist. In order to get licensed in most regions in the U.S., your doctoral program must be accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (CAA).As of 2016, there are 73 accredited programs in the U.S. and two candidate programs that are up for accreditation.You can find a list of accredited programs, listed by state, at the CAA website., Earning a doctoral degree requires great dedication and effort. You will need to do well and earn good grades, as most doctoral programs have high standards of academic excellence. You may be able to complete your doctoral program in as little as three years of full-time study, depending on your undergraduate background.However, some programs may take longer. Four years is generally considered a common duration for doctoral studies., Each state has its own licensing requirements. However, the American Academy of Audiology has compiled a checklist of general information that is usually required knowledge on a given state's licensing exam. Search online for information about your state's specific requirements, as each state is different.Certification generally requires you to complete at least 300 hours of relevant, supervised clinical experience.You will need to earn a passing score on the exam, though each state's requirements and scoring may vary.

, Though you don't necessarily need to be board certified, getting the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) certification can increase your professional opportunities and advance your career.Getting board certified by ASHA requires you to complete and maintain a Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in either Audiology or Speech-Language Pathology. For a career as an audiologist, you will want the Audiology CCC.ASHA certification is recognized by the state regulatory agency in almost every U.S. state., You will need to register with ETS in order to take the ASHA Praxis II exam (Subject Assessment in Audiology: 5342).You can find test centers and testing dates by searching online by your ZIP Code, or find international test sites by searching for the country you reside in.The exam will take two hours to complete and is taken entirely on a computer.

, The exam is a mix of multiple choice and constructed-response questions. For multiple choice questions, it's best to limit your answers to one of the given options and eliminate the answers that you know are incorrect. For constructed-response questions, you'll need to answer the question as accurately and completely as possible. You can take the practice exams online at the ASHA website to get a good feel for the types of questions asked and the general format of the exam.There are five categories: Foundations (12 questions), Prevention and Identification (12 questions), Assessment (48 questions), Intervention (36 questions), and Professional Issues (12 questions).
The Foundations section is worth 10% of your grade. It covers acoustics, anatomy, physiology, etiology, psychometrics, counseling principles, and cultural linguistic diversity.
The Prevention and Identification section is worth 10% of your grade. It covers education and prevention, as well as screening and risk assessment.
The Assessment section is worth 40% of your grade. It covers planning, behavioral evaluation, physiologic evaluation, and other methods of assessment.
The Intervention section is worth 30% of your grade. It covers treatment planning, device selection, device verification, symptom management, and rehabilitation.
The Professional Issues section is worth 10% of your grade. It covers professional ethics, legal practice, and patient advocacy.

, You will receive a raw score, which tells you how many questions you answered correctly, as well as a scaled score that adjusts your score according to the difficulty of each question. For audiology, you must earn a minimum scaled score of 170 in order to pass the Praxis exam.It may take up to 16 days after the testing window closes before you receive your score.You will be able to download your scores through the Praxis website by creating a My Praxis account online.

, To apply for ASHA certification, you must hold both a doctoral degree and a masters degree from universities accredited by the CAA. You will need to complete a four-page application (with one page being completed and signed by your program's director), disclose any ethical problems, send official graduate transcripts, and pay the necessary dues and fees., In addition to your application materials, you will need to pay to become ASHA certified. You will then have to make annual payments to maintain that certification. How much you pay will depend upon your previous professional associations and educational experience.If you are or have been a member of the National Student Speech Language Hearing Association (NSSLHA), you may be eligible for a reduced fee of $289. Otherwise, recent graduates (within the last 12 months) must pay $461.
Anyone who did not graduate recently and is not affiliated with NSSLHA must pay $455 for certification or $511 for certification and ASHA membership.

, Once you've completed the application, passed the Praxis exam, and assembled your application packet, you'll need to submit it to ASHA for review. You should send your materials through the mail and address the package to American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, P.O. Box 1160, #313, Rockville, MD 20849., After your application has been received, it can take four to six weeks for your materials to be reviewed. During busy periods, it may take up to eight weeks for your application to be fully reviewed. If you're concerned about your application materials, you can contact the ASHA Action Center by calling 800-498-2071., You may want to get ABA certified, either as an alternative to ASHA certification or as a supplement to it. Getting board certified can help give you a competitive edge when you're up for promotions or job interviews. Board certification can also help you build professional connections and improve your professional credibility.The ABA certification is developed by practicing audiologists and designed for practicing professionals.Once certified, you will need to get re-certified every three years. In order to do so, you will need to complete 60 hours of approved continuing education training.You can find a list of continuing education opportunities through the ABA website., While you won't need a master's degree for ABA certification, you will need to meet certain other professional qualifications. The ABA certification is generally reserved for candidates who have already been practicing as audiologists for some time, and who have accrued a significant amount of hands-on experience on the job.You must hold a doctoral degree from an an accredited college or university. However, unlike the ASHA certification, you are not required to hold a masters degree as well.
You must currently hold a valid license to practice in your state.
You'll need at least 2,000 hours of mentored professional experience, with documentation to prove the hours and experience you report.
You must have some recent employment in your field.

, Your completed application and fees must be sent through the mail to American Board of Audiology – Certification, 11480 Commerce Park Drive, Suite 220, Reston, VA 20191.Your application packet will need to include the following:

your application fee of $100 for ABA members, or $145 for non-members (candidates applying within six months of graduation can pay a reduced fee of $35)

, Before you can apply to a job opening, you'll need to put together a resume. Your resume should detail your education and work experience (if any). When putting together a resume, it's best to focus on quality rather than quantity; in other words, don't jam up your resume with a lot of clutter and filler. Focus on relevant and meaningful experience, and be honest about your accomplishments and abilities.The American Academy of Audiology offers free resume-review services online, which can help strengthen your resume and boost your chances of success.List your education first if you're a recent graduate and don't have any professional experience yet. You should list education in reverse-chronological order, with your most recent degree (doctoral) listed first.
List your professional experience in reverse-chronological order.
Discuss your practicum assignments on your resume. This can help show employers what kind of experience you have working with various populations and equipment.
If you list accomplishments, make sure you list them as they relate to your career. For example, don't list coursework unless you taught that class, and make sure it's relevant to the specific job you're trying to get.
Explain any abbreviations you use when describing examinations and professional organizations. Otherwise an employer might get confused.

, Once you've put together your resume, you're ready to find and apply to jobs in your field. You can find jobs a number of ways. If you belong to any professional organizations, they often have job listings online available to their members (usually listed by state and/or by specialty).If you're not a member of any professional organization, you can still find job opportunities online or through your network connections.


Try searching through the American Academy of Audiology website's employment resources section. This section is free for anyone to use, and does not require any professional membership.You can also find jobs through HEARCareers, which is managed by the American Academy of Audiology.You may also want to try searching through professional job finder websites, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Monster.com.
If you have a close rapport with any of your professors from college or graduate school, you can ask them if they have any contacts who could help you find a job in your field.

, Once you've applied to a few jobs, you should get a call back for an interview with one or more employers. Dress professionally for the interview (suit and tie for men, skirt and blouse or business suit for women), and make sure you show up on time. In addition, you should take some time to prepare for the types of questions that might be asked during your interview.If the interviewer asks you to tell him/her about yourself, focus on your education and professional life.

Find a job as an EMT-B.,
Consider advancing to intermediate EMT, or EMT-II, level.,
Become a paramedic.",How to Become an EMT2," Once you're certified, look at job listings at local hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and private emergency services providers. The health care industry is growing, and there are plenty of opportunities for EMT-Bs.

, EMT-IIs take on more responsibilities than EMT-Bs, including administering IVs and using defibrillators to resuscitate people in cardiac arrest. The EMT-II certification process is similar to that of an EMT-B, but requires more coursework.

, Paramedics have more training and expertise than other EMTs. In addition to performing all the duties of EMT-Bs and EMT-IIs, paramedics may administer medication, read EKGs, and handle sophisticated medical equipment. Additional training and certifications are required for becoming a paramedic.

Understand what the job entails.,
Be willing to work under adverse conditions.,
Be ready to assume the highest responsibility.",How to Become an EMT3," EMTs work in hospitals, police or fire departments, or for private emergency care providers. They are dispatched to the scene of emergency situations by 911 operators. Upon arrival at the scene, EMTs have the following responsibilities:


Assess the situation. EMTs evaluate and make a clear record of the patient's physical state.
Determine whether the patient has pre-existing conditions. This is an important step that EMTs must take before treating the patient.
Administer CPR and First Aid, when necessary. EMTs are trained to know how to respond appropriately to a huge range of medical emergencies, from premature labor to poisonings to burns.
Transport the patient to the hospital. Using a stretcher and other emergency equipment, EMTs safely transport the patient from the scene of the emergency to the hospital. EMTs typically work in teams of two, with one EMT driving the ambulance and the other monitoring the patient's vital signs.
Transfer the patient to the hospital's care. At the hospital, the EMT assists with transferring the patient to the emergency room. The EMT provides a detailed report of the patient's condition to the hospital staff.
If necessary, provide additional medical treatment.

, There's no predicting when an emergency will occur, and EMTs provide service twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. EMTs are usually ""on call"" for a total of 40 - 50 hours a week.


In addition to being willing to work nights, EMTs also must be flexible enough to take on weekend and holiday hours.
EMTs often have to perform heavy lifting and other physically challenging tasks.
EMTs must be comfortable working in a range of settings, both inside and outside, and in all types of weather.
EMTs have to be ready to encounter dangerous situations, such as responding to an accident on an icy road.

, EMTs are usually the first professionals to interact with patients at emergency scenes. In addition to administering life-saving medical care, they must interact with family members and witnesses who may be very emotional. Know your capacity for handling extreme stress and holding up under pressure before pursuing a career as an EMT.

To be successful in research you need the following:


Research is rarely the easy option.,
A good question.,
Pragmatism.,
A skill base.,
A good mentor.",How to Encourage Young Doctors to Do Research," Remaining motivated can be difficult if you aren't enthused about what you are doing, and experiments, of their very nature, don't always give you the result you want or need. Many clinicians struggle early on in the course of research with the loss of immediate focus and purpose which clinical work provides. Try to focus on what you want to achieve. Enjoy the flexibility that life in research often brings. If things aren't working put them aside and come back to them later. Remember that answers may not be immediately apparent - often patterns in data become a lot clearer when you look at them after a break.;
,


Learning to ask the right question is important. Focus on subjects and topics which interest you. Avoid questions where you are not interested in the answer. Remember to always explain the importance of your question when you present your results.

,


Be strategic in your choice of research question. Choose supervisors, research centers and areas of study that are likely to complement your long term clinical career goals. Make sure you will have something to show for your trouble. Your plans should be practicable and that you should have a reasonable chance of success within the time period allotted for your project. Try to frame your research question in such a way as to include a 'null hypothesis' (i.e. that you may not observe the difference you might be looking for). Beware of projects where any other outcome than your predicted hypothesis will be a disaster.

,


Successful research requires the mastery of a range of skills which can either be taught or learnt in action. Formal training in research techniques can be very useful and is increasingly part of research degree programs. Some subjects can be hard to be enthused about in the absence of a clear context - try to have your research question in mind and apply what you learn to your own problem. You can learn research skills as you go along but you will need help. Be systematic - start with a good literature search so you know your subject. Make sure you have any approvals necessary in good time before you need to start - e.g. funding; ethics; licences; safety training. Think about statistics early and as part of the design of every experiment. Most statistical methods are easy at a mathematical level - the trick is to be sure you are using the right test and you will need advice early on to make sure you are correct. Good notes are important but you should also try to start preparing a manuscript as you go along.

,


Research doesn't well work without an audience. At the very least you need a good mentor to get you started. A good mentor should share your enthusiasm for the question you are asking. They will be able to guide you in the design of your project; help you to identify funding; stop you from going down blind alleys where appropriate; and keep you on time. Choosing a mentor with a successful track record in research can be helpful but does not always guarantee that they will be a good mentor. Make sure your mentor will be able to devote time to your project - you should be able to meet on at least a weekly basis to discuss your progress. If possible talk to other researchers in a potential mentors research group before deciding who to work with.

Reduce your estrogen intake to restore hormonal balance.,
Avoid consuming foods and herbs that are high in estrogen.,
Increase your intake of progesterone to balance your hormones.,
Add more vitamin B6 to your diet to increase progesterone levels.,
Increase your vitamin C intake.,
Take zinc to stimulate your pituitary gland.,
Eat foods rich in magnesium.,
Apply ice packs.",How to Treat Ovarian Cyst Pain Naturally1," Excess estrogen is often responsible for hormonal imbalance, which can cause ovulation disorders and lead to ovarian cysts.


Elevated estrogen levels can lead to the development of more ovarian cysts and cause pain in your ovaries.
If you are taking any hormonal estrogen supplements, stop taking them to allow your body to return to a hormonal equilibrium.
Consult with your doctor before making these changes.;
, Herbs to avoid include black cohosh and blue cohosh, lavender, licorice, dong quai, hops, rhodiola rose root, red clover blossom, saw palmetto berry, motherwort leaf, and tea tree oil.


Additionally, be aware of other common sources of estrogen, such as flax seeds, tofu, soybeans, sesame seeds, multi-grain bread, soymilk, garlic, hummus, dried apricots, and prunes.

, Progesterone is a naturally-occurring hormone that helps balance the level of estrogen in your body, and regulates the body's reproductive functions.


Elevated levels of estrogen in the body usually suggest a deficit of progesterone.
Balancing the levels of estrogen and progesterone through natural means could help shrink ovarian cysts and lessen the probability of recurrence.

, Vitamin B6 is essential to maintaining adequate levels of progesterone in your body.


B6 functions by breaking down excess estrogen in the liver to create hormonal balance.
Whole grains, walnuts, lean red meat, seafood, bananas, potatoes, beans, spinach and fortified cereals are all examples of foods rich in vitamin B6.
The recommended dose of vitamin B6 is 2 mg per day.

, Vitamin C improves hormone levels, such as progesterone, and increases fertility.


This is because vitamin C enhances the luteal phase, or the start of ovulation in women, wherein there is a surge in the levels of progesterone.
Take 750mg of vitamin C daily for six months to increase the production of progesterone in your body.

, Zinc is a mineral that signals the pituitary gland to release follicle stimulating hormones that promote ovulation and the production of adequate levels of progesterone.


Foods rich in zinc include shellfish, crabs, veal liver, dark chocolate, wheat germ, chickpeas, watermelon, lean red meats, pumpkins and squash seeds.
Your daily intake of zinc should not exceed 25 mg.

, Maintaining adequate levels of magnesium in your body can elevate your progesterone levels.


Good sources of magnesium are: halibut, okra, spinach, whole grain cereals, black beans, squash seeds, raw plantains, pumpkins, nuts, and dietary supplements.
The recommended daily intake of magnesium for women is 320 mg per day.

, Apply an ice pack wrapped in a damp towel to the area where you feel pain two or three times per day, for about 15-20 minutes.


The cold temperature can offer relief from pain by numbing the nerve endings.

Consider the effect of therapy dogs.,
Get the right kind of therapy dog.,
Find individuals who might benefit from a therapy dog.,
Schedule a visit.,
Feel comfortable around a therapy dog.,
Know what to expect from the handlers.,
Play with the dog.,
Schedule another visit.",How to Get a Therapy Dog," There are many different situations that qualify for therapy dogs. Most are in institutional settings, but other special situations may also warrant therapy dogs. If you or a loved one are in one of these institutions, continue to work towards getting a therapy dog. Therapy dog uses include:


Cheering up and elevating the moods of patients in hospitals and hospices
Countering grief and stress for mental health patients
Offering companionship and love to those in nursing homes and hospitals, especially children's wards
Being reading partners for children learning to read
Visiting libraries and schools to encourage children to socialize and read
Lifting morale in disaster situations;
, If you are looking into getting a therapy dog for you or someone you love, you need to make sure that the institution where you want the therapy dog is accepting of the concept. You may need to get them behind the idea by explaining why you want to have a therapy dog visit the facility.

, When you are trying to get a therapy dog, look for a certified therapy dog organization. These organizations ensure that the therapy dogs have been vetted and are suitable for the institution where you are. There are many different organizations that are certified by the American Kennel Club as well as other private certification organizations.


They also provide the owners and dogs with liability insurance as they go out into the institutions.Make sure you research these organizations online or ask a local veterinarian. The organization you want to get the therapy dog for may also already have a relationship with a therapy dog organization, so ask them as well.

, Therapy dog organizations are volunteer organizations that will never ask you to pay for their services. The organization's missions are to help people and provide comfort through animal interaction., Therapy dogs are beneficial for many different institutions. There have been studies done that prove that therapy dogs improve patients health by improving blood pressure, heart rate, and overall health. Therapy dogs also help improve depression, anxiety, loneliness, and quality of life.Therapy dogs are used in schools and libraries as reading aids because some children feel more comfortable reading to a dog than to a teacher., After you've contacted a therapy dog organization, you need to let them know what the purpose of the dog's visit will be. If you are getting a therapy dog for a hospital or hospice, the type of dog that will be allowed in these institutions may vary based on patient needs and allergies.If you are using the therapy dog for a school, library, or nursing home, the restrictions will be different.


All therapy dogs work well with children, adults, and seniors, so the needs of the patients or individuals are what has to be taken into account., Although you may be organizing a therapy dog for you or your loved ones, there may be others in the institution that might benefit from the therapy dog as well.


Depending on how many people would like visits from the therapy dog, you may need to coordinate to have more than one dog visit or to make multiple visits., Once you have found a proper organization and the right dog for your situation, schedule the visit. Talk to the institution where you want the dog to visit to find times where the dog will be most useful and cause the least disruption., Therapy dogs are very special dogs that go through a certification process that makes sure they are suitable for the task. Although therapy dogs are not considered service dogs, they should have many relevant qualities that make them fit to be therapy dogs. These include:


Being comfortable around all different kinds of people and dogs
Being well behaved, where they won't jump, growl, or bark
Obeying verbal commands from their handlers
Having up to date vaccinations
Enjoying being petted by strangers
Walking on a leash without pulling
Looking clean and well groomed
Staying for hours and remaining calm, When the therapy dog visits, his handler will be there with him. The therapy dog's handler accompanies him when he goes on visits. His handler, who is also his owner, stays with him and helps the dog interact with individuals.


The handlers also go through a process to make sure they are good fit for the kinds of situations where therapy dogs are needed.
The handler is a volunteer, just like the therapy dog. She is there with her dog to help make others' lives better., Once the therapy dog arrives, he will play and interact with all the individuals at the institution. The individuals are allowed to play games, throw toys, pet, groom, and generally interact in many different ways with the dog. As long as the health of the individual or the dog is not at risk, the dog is able to help in any way he can.


Depending on the health restrictions of the individuals, the therapy dog's activities may change.
If the dog is being used in a school or library setting, the children can read and play to the dog one on one or in a group., Once the therapy dog visit is over, you can schedule another visit with him. This should be less involved than the first visit, since you already have a relationship with the dog and the organization.


If you want to make it a regular occurrence, ask if you an schedule a regular visit with the therapy dog.

BLS classes will teach you how to check and clear a patient's airway, check for a pulse, and determine whether a patient has stopped breathing or lost their heart rate. You will also learn how to stabilize a patient who is unresponsive or has a limited response.

, An automatic external defibrillator, or AED, used to restart a patient's heart after that individual has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest.As an ambulance attendant, you will most likely need to operate an AED at some point in your career. For this reason, AED training is often a requirement to become an ambulance attendant.You'll learn how to assess whether it's safe to use an AED. For example, some environmental hazards, such as standing puddles and other sources of water, could transfer the electricity to the ambulance attendant and/or other bystanders.
Your class will teach you how to apply the electrode pads of an AED to a patient's chest, clear everyone away from the unresponsive body, and apply electric shock through the defibrillator.

, Most ambulatory workers must have some type of prior experience that is relevant to their field. Some employers may count your education towards their specific experience requirements. However, each employer/organization is different.Volunteering with a local ambulance outfit is a great way to gain valuable experience while training under a qualified ambulance attendant or EMT.You can find out about volunteer opportunities by contacting your local ambulatory/EMT organizations.
Find out if any hands-on training you received in school counts as experience. Some employers may count this training as experience while others may not.

, Much like any other job, your resume is the first impression an employer will have of you. You'll want to put together a resume which will show that your education, work experience, and training all meet the needs of a given employer.Include your contact information at the top of your resume, followed by your education and work experience.
List education and work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent degree (for education) and job (for work experience).
Make sure you list any relevant training and/or volunteer work in reverse chronological order. Include any first aid certifications you've received, and check that your certifications are still valid and up to date.

Eat whole grains daily.,
Add some healthy spices to your food.,
Meet your daily protein requirements, but avoid excessive red meat.,
Eat foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Treat Arthritis Pain Through Your Diet1," A colorful diet is recommended because the carotenoids and flavonoids that give fruit and vegetables their color are powerful antioxidants that help to fight inflammation. According to The Arthritis Foundation, you should try to consume roughly nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.Vegetables you should eat include: dried beans and peas, sweet potatoes, red cabbage, pumpkin, squash, carrots, and beets.
Fruits you should eat include: blueberries, cherries (especially bing), other colorful berries, watermelon, tomatoes, bananas, and oranges.;
, People who eat whole grains have lower levels of C-reactive proteins (CRP); these proteins indicate the amount of inflammation in your body.You should try to eat roughly three ounces of whole grains each day. Whole grain foods include:


Whole wheat bread
Oatmeal
Brown rice
Popcorn
Crackers
Wild rice
Tortillas
Whole grain pasta

, Certain spices contain properties that can help to reduce the inflammation caused by arthritis. These spices include:


Ginger extract (blocks COX-2, which is a chemical in your body that causes pain).
Garlic.
Turmeric.
Cinnamon and honey (Drink a mixture of hot water, ½ teaspoon of cinnamon powder and a tablespoon of honey every day before breakfast.)

, The recommended daily intake of protein is 50 grams and a 3-ounce piece of meat has 21 grams of protein.Eating excessive meat may exacerbate symptoms of gouty arthritis by depositing urate crystals within your joints.Although meat is the main source of protein in a non-vegetarian diet, other sources of proteins are milk, cereals, eggs and yogurt. You can, however, eat a 3-ounce serving of pasture-raised meat once or twice a week. Pasture-raised meat includes:


Poultry
Fish
Lamb
Rabbit

, Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of lipids essential for your well-being.Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation because the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in omega-3 fatty acids replaces the arachidonic acid, reducing your body’s production of arachidonic mediators, which can cause inflammation.The American Heart Association recommends that you eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids at least two times a week.These days many canned and processed foods are artificially enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, so read the ingredients before using processed foods. You can find omega-3 fatty acids and oils in:


Seafood: sardines, salmon, halibut, herring, mackerel, oysters, trout, and tuna.
Fresh vegetables: brussels sprouts, kale, mint, parsley, spinach, and watercress.
Oils: canola oil, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, mustard oil, soybean oil, and walnut oil.

, People with arthritis often develop deficiencies in vitamins C, D, B6, B12, and E levels. They also often become deficient in folic acid, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and calcium levels.Increasing your intake of antioxidants by taking dietary supplements may decrease the damage the arthritis causes to your joint lining, thereby reducing swelling and pain.


Your physician should be able to tell you which supplements will best meet your particular needs.

, Arthritis is slowed and its severity is lessened when fish oil supplements are added to your diet.Try to consume at least two to three grams of omega-3 fish oil daily.You can purchase fish oil at your local pharmacy. If you don’t like taking a spoonful of the oil, you can also take a fish oil supplement that you swallow like a pill.

, Staying hydrated can help to keep your joints lubricated, which means that your pain will be reduced. Everyone needs a different amount of water, but average adult women generally need to drink around 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day to stay hydrated.Adult men generally need to drink around 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day to stay hydrated., Green, white and oolong teas are full of polyphenols, which are plant-derived compounds that boost your immune system and reduce inflammation. A substance found in green tea (EGCG) might actually stop the progression of arthritis by blocking the Interleukin-1 cel, which is a pro-inflammatory cell that has the ability to damage cartilage.You should try to drink two to four cups of tea each day.

Arrive at your appointment early.,
Review your case with the endodontist.,
Discuss diagnosis and treatment.,
Make your final choice.",How to Choose an Endodontist," Some dentists’ offices have an on-site endodontist, while others work with one who visits on specific days. Ask your dentist, friends, or family to recommend a local endodontist. This may help you find someone you like and trust more quickly., You can also easily locate endodontists through websites such as the American Association of Endodontists and online reviews.Consider factors such as office hours and location. You may prefer someone who has extended or weekend hours or is close to your home.

, Being an endodontist requires specialized training beyond dental school. The number of endodontic procedures they perform can also be a good indicator of their skill level. Some things you may want to consider include:Education and training
Board certification
Experience in performing root canals and other oral surgeries
How long the endodontist has practiced the profession
Surgical technology and pain-relief options they offer, If your dentist suggests endodontic care for your teeth, make sure your insurance company will cover it. Endodontic care can be expensive and having at least some coverage may defray the cost. Your insurance may pay for all or part of endodontic care, depending on what type of policy you have.Ask if your policy requires endodontic care from an in-network doctor or if you can pay extra to see someone out of network. If your potential endodontists aren’t covered by your insurance, ask a representative to provide you a list of in-network doctors.

, Once you’ve compiled a list of potential endodontists, call their offices and ask if they are accepting new patients. Let the receptionist know important information such as your type of insurance and why you are seeking endodontic care. Mention if your dentist has recommended the doctor to you.Inquire if there is a waiting period for new patients. If the office is not accepting new patients or the waiting period is too long, ask if the office can suggest another endodontist.

, Most endodontists will meet with a patient before providing treatment. This gives them a chance to diagnose you and discuss treatment options. This consultation also gives you a chance to meet the doctor and figure out if they are a good fit with your needs.Ask the scheduler what paperwork and information you need for your preliminary endodontist visit.

, Confirm your appointment a day or two in advance. Most endodontists’ offices require that you will out paperwork before your appointment. Arriving early or on time gives you time to fill out paperwork, provide records from your dentist, and clarify insurance and payment information.Bring a list of all medications you take or have taken in the past month.
Contact the office as soon as possible if you need to reschedule or are running late.
Observe if the doctor and their staff treat you well and make you feel comfortable, An assistant may ask you questions about your history and symptoms before you meet the doctor. They may even take an initial set of X-rays. You will then meet with the endodontist, who will review any information you provided, including from your dentist or any diagnostic testing. This gives you a chance to get to know the doctor and see if they can provide the type of care you want and need.Let the endodontist know of any questions or concerns you have. Answer any questions they have as honestly as possible. This can ensure you get the right treatments.Look around the office and exam room at overall cleanliness. If the office doesn’t appear clean or sanitary, you may want to consider another doctor.

, The endodontist will discuss their diagnosis with you after evaluating your case and talking with you. They will then talk about treatment plans and the associated costs. The endodontist should discuss the benefits, options and risks of any treatments so that you can understand how they will help you. They may also review possible post-treatment decisions including crowns or bridges.Ask questions if you are unsure of something or would like to know about potential alternative treatments.
Be aware that some endodontists may ask if you want to proceed with treatment at your visit. Don’t feel pressured to agree if you’re not ready. Tell the doctor you want to think about your options before committing to treatment.

, Review the notes from your preliminary visits. Tally up any negatives and positives about each endodontist, their office, and suggested treatments to help you further narrow down your list. From this, you can choose the endodontist with whom you want to work."

Learn how to be organized.,
Figure out how you learn best.,
Create a study schedule.,
Prepare for the boards and for the application process.,
Be professional.,
Ask for guidance.,
Keep your body healthy.,
Recognize the difference between stress and depression.",How to Survive Medical School,"


Study materials. You will find it impossible to survive medical school without at least finding a way to keep your notes and books in order. Binders, color coding, and organized folders on your computer are some examples of how to do this.
Schedule. Always know where you need to be and when. Keep a schedule with you at all times with your lecture schedule, exams, rotation schedule, meeting times, etc.
Study space. If you study at home, make sure you have an area dedicated to studying. Keep this area free from clutter and from distractions (i.e. television).;
,


Use study tools.The value of study tools really comes into play during medical school. Everyone has a different style or different things that work for them, and don't be fooled into thinking that you're doing something wrong if you do it a different way yourself. Have a study system, and stick to it.
Consider studying with other people around your study area. This works well for some people and poorly for many others. Having study partners, much like exercise partners, may help you stay on target and avoid quitting early. Also, the company may keep you from feeling isolated and overwhelmed. Others however find that they get overly distracted when they study with others. Experiment and find out for yourself if you find it helpful.
If what you're doing isn't working, don't be afraid to try a different method.

,


It helps to plan out your work, even as far ahead as several weeks. This way you can avoid getting behind, which can be devastating in medical school.
Having a well-organized schedule will also allow you to plan out free time. Try to give yourself a half to a full day off each week. This will keep you focused during the rest of the week and keep you from getting burnt out.
Never cram. If you keep to your schedule, this won't be an issue.

,


Board exams. Sign up well in advance for the boards, as you will find that testing dates become very limited if you wait until a month or two prior to your preferred dates.
Residency application/interviews. This is something you need to stay vigilant about. Know the application schedule well, and be ready to submit your application as soon as possible. When you start getting invitations to interviews, respond immediately or you will find it very difficult to plan out your interview season.

,


Be on time. Part of surviving medical school is learning how to be professional, and being on time is a key aspect of this.
Dress professionally. No exceptions.
Treat everyone with respect. This not only goes for your professors and acquaintances , but your classmates as well. It's much more to your benefit to be a team player than it is to disregard others.

,


Your professors and Deans of Student Affairs and Academic Support are immensely valuable resources that you should take advantage of if you feel you are struggling.
Look to your seniors. Talking to those a year or two ahead of you can be very helpful since they were recently experiencing the same thing.
Find a mentor. Many schools assign faculty mentors to you, but if not, consider contacting a faculty member that you know or someone in your field of interest to meet with you.
Find a tutor. Most schools offer tutoring of some sort, and tutors can meet you at any level. Tutoring also doesn't mean that you are a poor student, because even the best students can benefit from having someone go through material with them at their own pace.

,


Medical school is in some ways as taxing on your body as it is on your mind. It may be difficult, but it's worth it to take the extra time to make a healthy meal or spend a few minutes in the gym or on walk.
Allow yourself time to relax. Know that it's OK to spend time with your friends and family, because medical school survival also involves taking the time to socialize when it's appropriate.
Get enough sleep. Whether for you that means 5 hours or 10, it's essential to get regular, restful sleep.

, Stress is a common and often necessary part of not only medical school but of life in general. However when stress begins to affect your quality of sleep, your eating habits, or your ability to function in general, stress is no longer a motivating factor but rather it is holding you back. Seek out support in your family, friends at school, old friends, and upper-level students if you begin to feel down or depressed.

Understand what measures you can take to avoid mouth cancer.",How to Tell if You Have Mouth Cancer," Mouth ulcers are very common and are not a surefire sign of mouth cancer in and of themselves. However, when mouth ulcers are combined with other symptoms and their development follows a certain pattern, they may indicate cancer.


Look for mouth ulcers which have not healed in over two or three weeks.Look for mouth ulcers that recur in the same areas of the mouth over and over again.
Look for mouth ulcers with irregular borders, that bleed at the slightest touch.;
, Look for color changes on the surface/sides of the tongue, lips and inside of the cheeks that last for more than two weeks.


These color changes may be red, white, grey or dark in color.
You may also notice velvety white and red patches inside your mouth., You might experience a numb sensation in any area of the mouth, face and neck region as a symptom of cancer.


You may also feel a non-stop pain/tenderness in a particular area of your mouth.
If you experience any of these two symptoms with or without swelling/lumps, then you should visit your doctor immediately, These crusted patches may feel rough to the touch, have irregular borders and bleed without provocation.

, Examine your teeth carefully to check for any changes in their alignment. Also look for any loose teeth, as this can also be an indication of mouth cancer.


One good way to tell if the alignment of your teeth has changed is to try wearing your dentures (if you use them). Difficulty in fitting the dentures inside your mouth is a good indication that your teeth have moved.

, Look for any abnormal lumps, swelling or bumps that are present on the side of your face or on your neck.


Press gently along the sides of your neck for any pain, tenderness or lumps. Visually examine the skin for any abnormal growths or moles.
Pull out your lower lip using your thumb and index finger and check for any lumps or irregular growths. Do the same for the upper lip.
Put your index finger inside your cheeks and your thumb outside and check for any pain, change in texture, swelling or lumps in the cheeks by gently rolling and squeezing the skin with your fingers.

, If you experience any difficulty while speaking or chewing food (in addition to the other symptoms) it may be an indication of mouth cancer. More specific symptoms include:


Being unable to swallow foods or liquids or feeling pain when swallowing.
Experiencing a loss of taste when eating.
Feeling as if something is caught in your throat when swallowing.
Difficulty moving the tongue and jaw due to stiffness.

, Cancer of the mouth can put pressure on the vocal chords, causing changes in the sound of your voice.


Usually, your voice will become more hoarse.
You may also feel pain in your throat while talking, eating or even at rest.

, Check for swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck by pressing on the lymph nodes, which are located at the base of your lower jaw, under your ear lobes.


The glands will feel swollen and painful to the touch. This is due to the fact that mouth cancer affects the drainage of the lymph nodes.
You may also experience pain in the ears, as the cancer causes pressure against the inside of the ears. This usually indicates that the cancer has spread and become more advanced.

, As mouth cancer often causes pain when eating or swallowing, you may find it difficult to maintain your normal eating patterns. This reduced food intake can lead to weight loss.


In addition to difficulty eating, the illness may cause a loss of appetite, which can contribute to further weight loss.

, It can be difficult to get a good view of the inside of your mouth in a wall mirror, so try using a small hand-held mirror to perform the self-examination — preferably one that fits inside your mouth.

, Light is also important in getting a good view of your mouth, so make sure to do the examination in a well-lit room, near a bright lamp.


You could also use a small, hand-held torch to illuminate the inside of your mouth.

, Clean your hands with anti-bacterial soap and dry them thoroughly before performing the self-exam, as you don't want to introduce any dirt or bacterial into your mouth.

, If you identify some of the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer described above, it is important that you make an appointment with your doctor or dentist as soon as possible in order to undergo testing and confirm the presence of cancer.


As with all types of cancer, early detection is key in successful treatment.

, If you have reassured yourself that you do not have mouth cancer but wish to prevent it from developing in future, there are a number of measures you can take:


Avoid smoking or using tobacco products.
Avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.Protect your lips from the sun using SPF.
See you dentist for a check-up every six months.

Familiarize yourself with the workplace.,
Know your job description.,
Relax and prepare for your first day.,
Go to your shift early.",How to Survive Your First Job As a Registered Nurse1," Whether it is a hospital, a clinic, or a home, it is important to know details, such as who your bosses are. Know their names, what they look like, their contact information, and where you will be working.


Know the terrain of the hospital. Familiarize yourself with the layout of the hospital, such as where the relevant place are, such as the laboratories, the operating rooms, and the ERs.
Orient yourself to your specific wing, ward, or working area. That way you'll know where to get things from in a hurry.
Try to do this even before your first day on the job. Knowing what the area looks like will help ease some of the fear or anxiety you may be feeling.;
, Obtain a copy of the policies so you can refer to it as needed. You may get a booklet or manual for orientation that may have all this for you, but it is not a bad idea to be prepared. Policies you may come across can change from hospital to hospital.


For example, you may need to know how long to monitor someone who is in labor, how often to document certain things, and how often to do the patient’s vital signs.
Most policies are developed over the best practice and evidence based medicine, therefore they may change. Your hospital may list policies on its internet portal., Pack your lunch and make your breakfast for the morning so you are not rushed. Have your scrubs cleaned and ready to wear. Have your work bag packed with essential nurse tools like pens, highlighter, paper, and stethoscope. You can also take time to relax. Hangout with your friends, sit around and watch TV, or do whatever else you normally do to relax.


Go to bed early because just like when you were a kid, you will be anxious for your first day.

, Make this a habit. Knowing how busy the unit is will help you establish what kind of day you will have. Bring your breakfast to work so you can eat and be ready for whatever the shift may bring. Typically, there is a clock in nurse's station near the locker room. Change into your scrubs from your home clothes if your institution requires that. Get a pair of very comfortable nursing shoes, such as tennis shoes or clogs.


Make sure you take care of your feet. Typical nursing shifts are 12 hours, but usually last at least 13.
You may or may not get a set lunch time. Some days you will be lucky to use the bathroom, other days, you could have two lunch breaks.

"
"
Socialize on the first day.,
Learn the paperwork.,
Familiarize yourself with bedside report.",How to Survive Your First Job As a Registered Nurse2," If you are a shy person, try to open up. Introduce yourself to everyone with a smile. Come across as friendly and ready to learn. You may feel stressed because other nurses may be stressed and vent about how their night was. You will become the same way. Nurses maintain a very professional attitude, but sometimes, to coworkers who understand, they may vent about the stresses of the day.


Do not be intimidated by this. Be prepared for report when you arrive to work and ready to work. , Obtain copies of the various forms to be filled out so you have an idea what they entail. Also get to know the computer system the hospital uses. Most hospitals are electronic. You will most likely go through a formal training of the system your hospital uses.


There are many manufacturers for different electronic medical records, but your class will specify your area., You can use any report sheet for yourself. Report sheets are sometimes referred to as the nurse’s brain. You will refer to it constantly during a shift and write all over it. Report sheets are the nurses way to communicate pertinent information in a format called SBAR to cover all aspects of the patient’s diagnosis and progress. You will go to your patient’s bedside with the off-going nurse and hear the reports on the patients.


SBAR stands for situation, background, assessment, and recommendation. It is a communication tool for nurses and doctors to be sure nothing is missed.A verbal report is also necessary. Some things that are not appropriate in front of family or visitors is said outside the room, such as information about an alcohol problem or being involved with a counselor. There should always be a verbal report. No sheet should ever just be given to the oncoming nurse without a verbal report with it. You can only fit so much on a small piece of paper. There may be more you need to know."
"
Do your rounds.,
Talk to them.,
Check your charts.,
Administer ordered medications and treatments.,
Do charts and other paperwork when you can.,
Get ready for the next day.",How to Survive Your First Job As a Registered Nurse3," Doing rounds is checking on each patient in your priority order. You will have to prioritize your patients after the report to decide who needs your attention first. Prioritizing is not an easy skill and can involve a lot of critical thinking skills for the RN. Prioritizing will also help you time manage safe and effectively.


For example, if Ms. Brown is sleeping and was just medicated and has no pain, but Mr. Smith has been bleeding through his post op dressing and vitals are unstable, he would be the first patient that needs your attention.

, Always assess your patient. It's important to verify the information given to you through verbal reporting and monitoring equipment so that you can appreciate any changes with the patient. Do not rely solely on what you see. Ask the patients how they are feeling. In other words, use the concepts of therapeutic communication and nonverbal communication to understand your patient’s needs. Therapeutic communication is a key tool to understanding your patient and helps your patient be open with you. Therapeutic communication uses words to come across as a caring individual. It does not put your patient down or make the conversation abrupt. These methods serve to build rapport and trust between you and the patient.


Nonverbal communication is the way most communication is done. Look at your patient, if he is rolling his eyes when you talk to him, or crossing his arms, it does not show that he is open to what you are saying. With these type of individuals, the key points of therapeutic communication like listening, asking open ended questions, and understanding can help them be more open to you., Look at the standing Doctor's Orders and the medication record. Verify allergies and understand your patient’s diagnoses. You should also check for other relevant information such as patient history, allergies, and special instructions like DNRs (Do Not Resuscitate) documents.

, Keep in mind the basic concepts of administering medications, the five rights of administration. The five rights are the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time. Ensure that you have the right:


Client. Check the client's ID tag. If the client is conscious and coherent, verify their name by approaching them with something like ""Mr. Robin Hood? It's time for your medications"".
Medication. Be extra careful to avoid mistaking a drug for another, especially if their names sound alike.
Dosage. Sometimes even the smallest mistake in dosage can have drastic effects. Check and counter-check the dose you have prepared against the dose ordered.
Route. A medication indicated for intramuscular injection should not be used intravenously. A suppository is not an oral med.
Time. Do your best to administer medications and treatments on schedule.
Documentation. Record the client's status before you gave the medication, as well as where, when, and how it was given. Indicate the dosage too. You should also indicate the client's reactions to the medications., Some of the time you get in between seeing patients you should use for tasks like this. It is very easy to get swamped by paperwork if you delay. Write down what you did for the patient, or bring the roll around computer around with you to constantly chart what you do. Do not get behind or you will be there for a long time after your shift.


Ensure that your charting is complete and accurate. A chart can become evidence in the event of a lawsuit. Remember to only chart the facts, not an opinion or diagnoses.
Note changes in a patient's condition, new doctor's orders, and any other relevant information to include in your end-of-shift report. It is important to let the next shift know about these things so nothing will be overlooked., When your first day on the job ends, think about what you've done. Remember the new things you've learned and try to analyze the mistakes that you've made. Make sure you get a good night's rest and prepare for the next day."
"
Be ready for night shift.,
Take care of yourself.,
Prepare for work.",How to Survive Your First Job As a Registered Nurse4," Most people do not want night shifts, but as the new nurse, you will have to be prepared to survive it. Some departments have no openings on day shift for many years, depending on the turnover of the nurses. To be ready, get enough sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours per day.


This can be very hard for nurses with 12 hour nights to do, so on your days off, you may need extra rest, or a nap before work.A lot of people get sales calls during the day, it can make your sleep very broken. Try to keep your phone off so you can rest.

, To keep yourself energized, you need to exercise. Exercising in the morning is ideal for a lot of people and can warm up your body. This will keep you more energized during your shift and help keep you awake. Don't over do it because you don't want to expend all your energy.


You should also eat well balanced small meals and healthy foods. Especially on night shift, nurses get tired and their bodies crave sugar. Avoid sugary beverages and caffeine loaded drinks that can leave you dehydrated and crashed later in the night.
The morning for a night shift nurse is not morning, but when you wake up., There are certain activities that will help you adjust your schedule. Shower before work to help you wake up. Try to stick to your normal morning routine, even if it is 3pm when you wake up. Keep your phone on silent. If you have a choice, try to not work one night on, one night off, and another night on. It will throw your body off very badly because it won’t know how to sleep.


Try to get your family to understand. They won’t understand, they never will. They need to know that your 2pm time is their 2am time. You need rest and they need to understand not to wake you and that you may miss certain events.

"
"
Ask often for feedback.,
Continue learning.,
Know the members of the health team.",How to Survive Your First Job As a Registered Nurse5," Usually after your orientation is over, your preceptor and manager will meet with you to see how you feel and comment on your needed improvements. No one is perfect. Expect criticism and don't take it personally. Everyone has room for improvement.


Internalizing all of this will make you a better nurse., Depending on your specialty, your hospital will send people conferences in the area. Try to go to these to help you advance your skills or hear the most up to date practices. You should try to attend as many as possible to help with your career.


You should always be reading about your work. Keep a book by your bed. Look up things you don’t know after your shift, or during them if you have time. If you kept your nursing school books, it is smart to keep them in visible sight. You can also visit websites that have evidence based practice guidelines updated all the time., Nursing is a team effort, and you will not survive for very long if you try to do everything on your own. Especially get to know your nurses aides, housekeepers, and charge nurses. Be kind to everyone. The most liked people are the people that are nice and treat everyone the same. If you are a secretary or the MD, you are a key part of the team. Greet everyone with a smile and if you ask them to help you. Let them know it is not because you cannot do it yourself.


Your nurse aide has her own very important tasks to do that you may not even know. Be respectful to everyone’s job, but know that they are there to help you if you are overwhelmed.
Treat physicians with respect and not like a friend. When giving them information about the patient, use the SBAR tool and have a pen ready for a verbal order. Giving them the SBAR gives the physician the full story of the patient.
Remember, you may have a handful of patients, but they have many more."

Know your rights.",How to Report HIPAA Violations3," HIPAA does not require everyone to comply with its rules. Only those entities that HIPAA considers a ""covered entity"" are capable of such a violation. ""Covered entities"" include healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses.The following entities are generally required to comply with HIPAA, and can therefore be investigated for a violation by OCR:Doctors, psychologists, chiropractors, dentists.
Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies.
Health-insurance companies, company health plans.
Government healthcare programs such as Medicaid or Medicare.

, Just as there are certain entities that are covered by HIPAA's provisions, there are those that are not bound by its rules and therefore incapable of violating them. OCR will not investigate a complaint filed against the following entities:Employers, life insurers, workers' compensation carriers.
Many schools/school districts.
Many state agencies, such as those dealing with child-protective services.
Many law-enforcement agencies.
Many municipal offices.

, The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects your privacy by regulating who is allowed to see or receive your healthcare information. The HIPAA Security Rule requires any covered entity that stores your healthcare information in electronic form to have taken the appropriate security measures to protect that information from unauthorized access.The following information is protected under HIPAA:Information placed into your medical record by a healthcare provider.
Conversations your doctor has with other healthcare professionals regarding your care or treatment.

Apply to multiple nursing programs.,
Get ready to study hard.,
Get some experience under your belt.,
Apply to multiple travel agencies.,
Pick a city you want to travel to.,
Get your travel license verified.",How to Study and Become a Travel Nurse," you will need to decide whether you want a Bachelors in Nursing Science (BSN) or an Associates of Applied Nursing Science degree (RN) first. A BSN is unnecessary for travel nursing in the US, but you may need it if you want to travel abroad.;
, Many schools have waiting lists so it is advisable that you fill out applications to several programs. Some programs will have different prerequisites and different admission criteria so look for the programs that best suit your academic achievements. While you wait to be accepted into nursing school, you can take some required classes like chem 1, algebra, and medical terminology. Every program is different, so make sure to read the prerequisite list carefully.

, Once you are accepted, prepare to take lots of tests. Time management is key to studying for these tests, as there may be as many as 2-3 per week. you must plan out your time and schedule strict blocks of time specifically for study. Avoid a cram session the night before your tests. Studying an hour everyday is preferable to cramming for 5 hours right before the test. These study habits will help lock the information into your long term memory, which is important because you will need it for the NCLEX exam after you graduate. Plan out the week before the test to use your time most effectively.

, Once you graduate and become licensed, you will need to pick an area of nursing that interests you and a hospital you like. Work in this area for at least 2 years. Most travel agencies will not take nurses with less than 2 years experience in their area of expertise.

, There are many different travel agencies around, and they all serve different areas of the country as well as have different pay and benefits., Now that you have a few agencies working for you, you can go anywhere in the US that you want, from Alaska to the virgin islands.

, Some states require you to re-license when you are working out of the state you were originally licensed in. Your travel agent will give you all the details for this and usually pay for any fees associated with it.

Know the stages of yellow fever.,
Be aware of the geographical component to yellow fever.,
Understand how yellow fever is transmitted.,
Stay away from mosquito-infested areas.,
Do your research.,
Get vaccinated.,
Avoid standing water.,
Keep cool.,
Cover your skin.,
Use mosquito repellant.,
Avoid peak hours of mosquito activity.,
Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned rooms or houses.,
Sleep under a mosquito net.,
Consider spraying insecticides.",How to Protect Against Yellow Fever," For the first few days after infection, a person with yellow fever will experience flu-like symptoms: fever, backache, headache, weakness, chills, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and an irritable mood. Most patients begin to recover after this stage. Around 15% of patients, however, experience a second, more dangerous stage, characterized by more fever, nausea, and vomiting and, in addition, jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes, the symptom that gives yellow fever its name) and bleeding (from the eyes, nose, or mouth, or into your vomit or feces), which can lead to shock and organ failure.


The presence of jaundice during the second stage of yellow fever indicates that the liver has been affected. This symptom is a serious one.
Left untreated, half of all patients who enter the second stage will not survive it. It is therefore crucial to recognize the symptoms and seek immediate medical treatment.;
, Yellow fever is much more common in tropical and sub-tropical climates, where the high temperature, humidity, and rainfall permit abundant growth of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which typically spreads the disease. In particular, if you want to avoid yellow fever, consider avoiding sub-Saharan/West Africa, especially between July and October, and South America.


African countries where yellow fever is likely to occur include: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, South Sudan, Togo, and Uganda.
South American countries where yellow fever is likely to occur include: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

, The germ that causes yellow fever is a particular virus, a flavivirus, which is usually transmitted through a mosquito bite. Typically, a female mosquito (most often the Aedes aegypti mosquito) bites a human, breaks through the skin, injects the virus into the person’s bloodstream, seeps up another load of blood, and then bites into another human, repeating the process.


In Africa and South America, mosquitoes can also transmit yellow fever from monkeys to humans and from apes to humans.

, mosquitoes are found on every continent except Antarctica, If possible, avoid jungles, forests, and other tropical and sub-tropical zones, especially sub-Saharan/West Africa and South America.

, If you are planning to travel to a potentially dangerous area, consult organizations like the Center for Disease Control to investigate particular locations and evaluate your risk. You’ll find information about places where yellow fever is prevalent and places where yellow fever is resistant to drugs.

, If you plan to be in a dangerous area, talk to your doctor about getting the vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine is called the 17D vaccine; it’s a live, attenuated vaccine that causes the body to produce antibodies against yellow fever. It is generally safe and gives maximum immunity against yellow fever within 7-10 days of vaccination. Your immunity will last up to ten years.


Some people should not get the vaccine. People with weakened immune systems, people with allergies to eggs or to the vaccine itself, and children under nine months old should not be vaccinated. Pregnant women should not be vaccinated until there is a yellow fever outbreak. Extra care should be given when people older than 60 get the vaccine.
Once you get the yellow fever vaccine, you will be issued an International Certificate of Vaccination (or “yellow card”).
Side effects of the vaccine include headaches, muscle pain, fever, and chills, and, in a small number of people, severe and more dangerous problems, including allergic reactions, neurological diseases, and organ failure.

, mosquitoes like still water, so if you are in a mosquito-infested area, try to avoid lakes, swamps, stagnant creeks, marshes, and bogs. mosquitoes typically lay their eggs in these locations, and many species then stay in the vicinity.


mosquitoes can also lay eggs in smaller containers, like flowerpots, bird baths, and drainage ditches, as long as there is sufficient water. The eggs of the Aedes aegypti mosquito can even stay in dry places for months, waiting for water; then, when water appears, they hatch. Therefore, be cautious of any man-made sources of standing water as well: whenever possible, keep pools, ditches, tires, containers, storm drains, and any low places on a piece of property covered.

, mosquitoes are attracted to warm-blooded creatures. Avoid wearing dark clothes in the sunlight, as they absorb more heat, and don’t exercise too strenuously, as you will get warmer and breathe more heavily, attracting mosquitoes with the carbon dioxide you exhale.

, Wear long sleeves, long pants, and loose clothing, and look for fabric that’s not too thin – mosquitoes can bite you through very thin material.


Consider purchasing special camping clothes, which are made from lightweight but sturdy fabric.

, There are a variety of products on the market to repel mosquitoes, and they come in creams, lotions, sprays, and sticks. Apply directly to your skin when outdoors, and, if you will also be using sunscreen, be sure to put the sunscreen on first, then the mosquito repellant. Avoid applying repellant around your eyes, mouth, and hands, and do not apply to irritated or broken areas of skin.


Look for products containing 15% picaridin, which is a very effective repellant.
Look for products containing 30%-50% DEET, an oil that will keep mosquitoes away. These products are effective for a few hours after application. Do not apply products with DEET to babies under six months of age.
Products vary, so follow the directions on the label. Make sure to help small children; do not allow them to handle mosquito repellants themselves.

, The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a daytime insect, most active from two hours after sunrise to a few hours before sunset. Research local species of mosquitoes, and try to adjust your activities accordingly.

, Fine-mesh aluminum or wire screens should cover windows and doorways. To be safest, keep doors and windows closed as well.

, Mosquito nets have very small holes that allow air to pass through but keep insects out. Secure the net to one or more surfaces, and hang it in such a way that it does not touch you – mosquitoes can bite you through it.


Consider looking for mosquito nets that are pretreated with insect repellants. These are typically used for malaria control, but they may work to prevent yellow fever as well.
Remember to check your mosquito net periodically for holes, and fix them immediately if you see any.

, Malathion, permethrin, and other insecticides will kill many mosquitoes, as will other commercial preparations made for inside spaces, but they are also very poisonous and should not be used by just anyone – you need to be properly trained and equipped with protective clothing.

Consider an appeal.",How to Undergo the Ohio Board of Nursing Disciplinary Process," An investigator will contact you when a complaint is filed. Any member of the public may file a complaint. Also, your employer could file a complaint if your conduct was grounds for disciplinary action by the Ohio Board of Nursing.After the complaint is filed, an investigator or compliance agent receives the complaint. He or she gathers information from the person complaining and often reaches out to the nurse for information as well.
Compliance at this stage is generally voluntary. Instead of providing information, you should get a lawyer.;
, Hiring a qualified lawyer is critical to your defense. As soon as you are contacted by the Compliance Agent, you should get referrals and meet with different attorneys. Find one with experience in defending nurses before the Ohio Board.


See Find an Ohio Nursing Board Defense Attorney for more information.

, The person filing a complaint might have alleged that you committed a crime. If so, you could be criminally prosecuted as well. The following crimes can result in the Board disciplining you:You were convicted of or pled guilty to a misdemeanor committed in the course of practicing as a nurse.
You were convicted of or pled guilty to a felony or other crime involving gross immorality or moral turpitude. This crime does not have to have been committed in the course of practice.
You sold or gave away drugs or therapeutic devices for illegitimate reasons.
You illegally took drugs, including prescription drugs for which you have no prescription.
You assaulted or harmed a patient or prevented them from getting assistance.
You stole money or objects of value.

, Not all violations are crimes. Instead, the Board is empowered to investigate and take action against a host of infractions and other violations. For example, the Board can impose sanctions for the following:You engaged in the practice of nursing while your license was suspended or had lapsed.
You practiced outside your authorized scope of practice.
You aided or abetted unlicensed practice.
You failed to establish and maintain boundaries, e.g., by getting too involved in the personal lives of patients or by having a sexual relationship with a patient.
You are impaired by drugs, alcohol, or other chemical substances.
You have a mental or physical impairment which prevents you from meeting acceptable standards of safe nursing care.
You did not meet acceptable and prevailing standards of care. In other words, you exhibited a lack of competence.
You were sanctioned by another state for a violation (other than failing to renew your license).

, Not every complaint results in disciplinary action. After reviewing the evidence, the Board might feel there isn’t enough evidence to proceed. However, the violation also could be considered “minor” under the nursing regulations.You and your attorney should analyze whether your conduct might qualify as minor.

, The Board might believe there is sufficient evidence to proceed and that the violation is not minor. In that case, the Board will send you a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing or a Notice of Suspension.This notice will lay out the law or rules you allegedly violated.You should read this notice carefully.


The notice should tell you how to request an administrative hearing.
Give your lawyer a copy of the letter as soon as you get it.

, Follow the directions set forth in your Notice for requesting an administrative hearing. Don’t delay. If you miss the deadline, then the Board will consider that you have waived your right to an administrative hearing. In this situation, they can go ahead and impose discipline.You have 30 days to request a hearing. The clock starts running the day the notice was mailed, not the day you received it., The Board has the power to require you to undergo a mental or physical exam, or both. The Board might request these exams if they reasonably believe you have an impairment that affects your ability to provide competent care.You also have to pay for the exams, if they are required.

, In some situations, the Board will offer you a consent agreement.This agreement takes the place of a contested administrative hearing. If you are offered a consent agreement, your lawyer should receive it.

, A consent agreement generally requires that you make certain admissions. It is like a settlement agreement in that respect. Before agreeing to a consent agreement, you should carefully analyze the admissions.


You might not understand the practical consequences of some admissions. For example, the admission might prevent you from seeking a license in a different state later on.
Talk with your attorney so that you understand the full consequences of signing the consent agreement., You also will have to agree to certain discipline as part of the consent agreement. Generally, the Board might require any of the following:Fines.
Reprimand. A reprimand is a written punishment.
Probation. You might be placed on probation for a set amount of time. The Board can also require that you meet certain requirements while on probation, such as pass drug tests.
Suspension. For very serious violations, the Board might insist that you agree to have your license suspended.
Revocation. The Board can permanently bar you from ever practicing as a nurse again., The Board can also impose other restrictions on your right to practice, which might be temporary or permanent.For example, the Board could require the following:continuing education
periodic drug screening
psychological or dependency evaluations and counseling
restrictions on future practice, such as being barred from working in a financial position

, A consent agreement is only valid if the Nursing Board votes to adopt it.If the Board rejects it, then the case returns to the Compliance Unit.


If it is accepted, then there is no appeal.

, The administrative hearing is contested. An Ohio Assistant Attorney General will represent the Nursing Board. You can also have your lawyer represent you. Both sides will argue the case to a Hearing Examiner.You should find evidence that is helpful to your case.


No two cases are alike, so you should talk with your lawyer about what evidence would be helpful in your case.
For example, the Board might have alleged that you weren’t honest when applying to have your license renewed.In this case, you might want character witnesses to testify since your good character is in dispute. These witnesses could be other nurses or supervisors, or people you know outside of work.

, If you have a lawyer, then he or she should handle the hearing. Hearings are open to the public and anyone may attend. Each side may call witnesses and introduce documents into evidence.The Board has the burden of proof in your case, and you are presumed innocent.However, the Board does not have to find you guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt,” as they would in a criminal court. Instead, the standard is “preponderance of the evidence.” This means that it is more likely than not that you committed the offense.
After all evidence is presented to the Hearing Examiner, the Examiner writes up a report and recommendation. The Examiner then forwards the report to the full Hearing Board., The full Nursing Board will consider the Hearing Examiner’s report at one of their regularly scheduled meetings. You or your lawyer can make an objection to the Examiner’s report within 10 days of it being issued.The Board will then take up the issue and make a decision.


The Board could agree to adopt the Hearing Examiner’s findings and proposed discipline. The Board may also reject the Hearing Examiner’s recommended discipline and impose something more appropriate.The Board may increase the punishment because of “aggravating factors,” such as your lack of truthfulness or selfish motives.
The Board may also lower the punishment because of “mitigating factors,” such as a clean prior disciplinary record or your full and free cooperation with the Board.

, If the Nursing Board decides against you, then you can bring an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.Before filing an appeal, however, you should talk with your lawyer about whether an appeal is worthwhile.


You should analyze whether an appeal would be successful. The Court of Common Pleas won’t overturn a decision unless the Court finds the Board’s decision wasn’t supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.
Discuss how long an appeal would take. If your punishment is a brief suspension, then you might want to serve the suspension.
Also talk about cost. Your lawyer will have to do more work to prepare your case to present it to the judge. You might not want to spend the money.

Reflect on your decision to become a health coach.,
Think about your choice of becoming a health coach.,
Research all programs that are offered(either online or not), to find the right health coach training program.,
Enroll in a school that teaches you to become a health coach.",How to Start a Career As a Health Coach," Is health coaching a good match for you? Being a health coach requires a unique combination of knowledge, skills, enthusiasm, and compassion. When coaching your clients, your role is multi-faceted. You act as a coach on the latest nutrition science and offer objective advice on how to eat, exercise, and relax for optimal health. Beyond that, you are your client’s emotional ally, and you’re there to listen and respond to the challenges, problems, and concerns that affect their overall wellness. Your passion for nutrition and wellness should be balanced by patience and true compassion for people of all backgrounds.;
, Is self-employment a good option for you? While a health coach can find employment in gyms, spas, companies, doctors’ offices, and wellness centers, most health coaches are self-employed and run their own private health coaching practices. Many health coaches love the flexibility of being their own bosses, setting their own schedules, and forging the path of their own success. However, owning your own practice requires significant initiative, marketing savvy, discipline, organizational skills, and business knowledge. It is often crucial for health coaches to get ongoing business training to create and develop a successful practice.

, Once you’ve decided that health coaching is the right career path for you, it’s time to research programs. Some questions to consider when researching a health coach training program are: Does the program require prerequisite courses? Are the courses online or in a live-classroom setting? What certifications and affiliations does the school have? How long does the program take to complete? Does the program offer education in a wide variety of health topics? Does the training cover counseling skills? Does the curriculum include business training? Will you receive ongoing support after you complete the program? What do other graduates have to say about the program? When making your decision, ask for references and testimonials. A program that boasts an especially loyal student base is doing something right.

, Start your studies and begin your practice. Strive to build your health coaching practice while you’re still in school. A good health coaching program will help you establish an “earn while you learn” practice so that you can start building a client base and gain experience even before you finish your studies. Once you graduate, be sure to take advantage of every opportunity your school has to offer to alumni – web-inars, training sessions, conferences, and other online courses.

Achieve three things that people over 100 years of age (hopefully enjoying longevity) have in common, then you may be surprised what factors are tied to this.,
See that two things in common are healthy levels of blood sugar and insulin in the blood.,
Recall that high blood sugar, as in diabetes, is well known to slow the healing of injuries and complicate infections (especially in feet and legs) -- and as many people get older they have problems with circulation in the legs and feet.,
Raise your immunity by up to 92 percent instead of reducing it (""decreased ability to destroy bacteria"") as the chart below illustrates:


More ""Teaspoons of Sugar Consumed"" lowers the ""Number of Bacteria Destroyed"" by ""Each White Blood Cell"" with ""Percent (n%) Decreased Ability to Destroy Bacteria (Lower Immunity)""

0 teaspoons sugar ... 14 Bacteria Destroyed ... 0% Lower Immunity,
6 teaspoons sugar ... 10 Bacteria Destroyed ... 25% Lower Immunity,
12 teaspoons sugar ... 5.5 Bacteria Destroyed ... 60% Lower Immunity,
18 teaspoons sugar ... 2 Bacteria Destroyed ... 85% Lower Immunity,
24 teaspoons sugar ... 1 Bacteria Destroyed ... 92% Lower Immunity.



,
Avoid consuming things such as ""liquid"" sugar, like candy in your small 12 ounce can of sweetened soda which gives you about 9 teaspoons of sugar into your system, and 20 ounces yield 15 teaspoons of sugar.,
Avoid, if possible, depending on depleted food values from mass production in your groceries: as your farm soils are often not rich in micro-nutrients and mineral nutrients compared to what they used to be.,
Consider using supplements such as vitamins, minerals and additionally natural compounds such as gymnema sylvestre, banana leaf extract, cinnamon and biotin and some patented ones (Studies indicate that Chromium Polynicotinate may be preferable over chromium picolinate by up to 300% better results.).",How to Improve Nutrition for Longer Life1," Review a recent survey of centenarians that revealed people over 100 have these three things in common:


Low sugar for their age,
Relatively low insulin,
Low triglycerides for their age.

, High insulin is often connected to insulin resistance which is exaggerated by over consumption of rich foods, sugars and bad fats that together raise triglycerides, raise sugar as well as that insulin in your blood.


Realize that high sugar levels affect the third thing in common -- triglycerides for 100 year old persons: plus your sugar consumption lowers your immunity which would be important to living longer and healthier (or not), also -- more on bacterial disease/immunity in the table below.

, Diabetic sufferers may lose toes, feet, leg(s) in part due to this problem. Avoid ingesting much sugar or carbohydrates because they are acid-forming in your body. Too much acid is bad news for your health and your


heart, cholesterol, triglycerides,
digestion, gallbladder, skin and the aging process.

,, Read the labels. Simple sugar is produced by the body from digesting more complex carbohydrates, alcohols, fats and protein for energy, so consuming much sugar is not necessary but is avoidable, especially by low carb food choices. Do ""not"" be an ""average American who consumes roughly 32 teaspoons of sugar each day"". America has a lot of sugar on its hands, in the diet. Most people are in the dark about effects of sugar consumption being high.

, Also void ""hidden"" sugars such as:


high fructose corn syrup,
carbohydrates,
Maltodextrins and
glucose polymers.

, Build a better diet to help you control blood sugar safely, naturally and effectively.

"
"
Focus on adding foods that your body will digest slowly, so that energy (blood sugar) enters your blood slowly and steadily.",How to Improve Nutrition for Longer Life2," But foods you choose must be nutritious -- examples:Beans nutritious (red, pinto, green, black, lentils, etc.), low-fat, high-protein food, high fiber foods will naturally slow down your digestion to even out your energy and feelings of health.



 


Whole grains, also, are nutrient-rich, high-fiber, and low-sugar -- ""low on the glycemic index"": which means they digest slowly (compared to bad stuff: the refined/processed grain products, i.e.: avoid white flour, including large amounts of ""refined white noodles"") to keep your energy/blood sugar steady and healthy.






Fresh fruits and vegetables are often high-fiber, low-calorie, high-water content, and for all those reasons: they help manage your weight, too; plus they're rich in antioxidants (and so they help anti-inflammatory, anti-blood-vessel-damage).






So, fill half your plate with broccoli, leafy greens, green beans, zucchini, bell peppers, onions, squash, eggplant, and more (Greens help with blood sugar!).


Add a rich, juicy piece of delicious, fresh, ripe fruit as a satisfying end to your meals.






Fish can protect your heart with other healthful lean protein for your diet. Fish brings the extra benefit of heart-healthy omega-3 (which are ""fatty acids"") to your healthier table.






Low-fat dairy is a lean protein. New research suggests that higher dairy intake may help prevent type 2 diabetes onset!






Nuts -- This is the snack that really satisfies. Next time you get a craving for potato chips, grab a handful of nuts instead -- preferably unsalted. Nuts fill you up with fiber and load you up on omega-3 fatty acids as well.





;
"
"
Give up eating your fill, and no: ""cleaning your plate."",
Switch to whole grains.,
Take extreme measures, such as ""no"" red meat: except you are allowed one serving per week as recommended by some most cautious doctors (and zero, one or two eggs, per week) -- cut-out fried foods like:

French fries, onion rings, and






Fried fish/chicken (fried meats).,
Achieve better natural control over your diet and blood sugar levels to enhance your health and longevity.",How to Improve Nutrition for Longer Life3," Stop letting your overflowing plate end-up ""filling your waistline to overflowing"".

, Eat less of the troubling refined foods to lower your blood sugar: Subtract refined grains such as white breads, white pasta, white rice, refined-flour pastries digested quickly, sending your blood sugar swinging high:Cut sugary sweet goods, because like refined flour, sugar is digested quickly. Dumping glucose (simple sugar) into your blood. Make sugar a rare treat, with sugar's richly fattening calories.
Cut red fatty meats (eat extremely lean meat/beef) to reduce your saturated fat intake: the kind of fats that are bad-for-your-heart, blood vessels, and your waistline.

To avoid heart surgery, realize that cholesterol kills so many people, and it will often hurt you without your knowing -- until it's too late.



, Yes, these are avoidable.







, Avoid eating too much of anything -- ""no"" extra healthful foods either: all overeating is bad for your body and health.


Eating more calories than you need means ""more blood sugar than you can ever use"" (and increasing fat, gaining weight -- and suffering with worse health).

Establish a healthy menu that contains food an elderly individual should be eating.,
Establish a healthy, daily eating schedule.,
Determine the health challenges an elderly individual may be facing.,
Obtain the supplements or appliances needed to accommodate an elderly person's challenges.",How to Help the Elderly With Nutrition1," An elderly person should be eating foods that are high in vitamins and nutrients, especially if they expend less energy on a daily basis and do not require a high caloric intake.


Choose a variety of foods from the food pyramid that include fruits, vegetables, grains, and foods rich in protein and calcium; such as tuna, beans, nuts, eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese.





;
, Eating healthy and nutritious foods throughout the day can help maintain an elderly person's high energy and metabolism levels.


Verify that an elderly person eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily without skipping any of these meals.






Allow an elderly person to eat snacks that are high in nutrition between major meals; such as fruit, almonds, raisins, cottage cheese, or peanut butter, instead of potato chips, sweets, and other types of junk food.







, Information about certain health challenges can help you with choosing certain foods for an elderly person's diet. For example, if a certain medication causes most foods to lose flavor, an elderly person may face challenges with generating an appetite.


Consult with an elderly person's health care provider or caretaker to determine the types of health problems a certain individual is experiencing that may be affecting their nutrition.







, These items can potentially enhance an elderly person's eating experience, especially if health challenges make certain eating tasks difficult.


Use a blender to turn fruits into smoothies or cook vegetables using a steamer if an elderly person has difficulty chewing certain fruits and vegetables; such as apples or broccoli.






Buy flavoring that is higher in nutrition than processed sugars or table salt to spice up and enhance the flavors of foods; such as olive oil, garlic, sea salt, and other spices. Some elderly individuals can lose their sense of taste or appetite due to prescriptions drugs and medications.

Listen to the way your teen talks about health.,
Notice whether you see your teen eat.,
Observe bathroom habits.,
Recognize food rituals.,
Identify risk factors.,
Look for dramatic weight fluctuations.,
Identify the signs of anorexia nervosa.,
Recognize the signs of bulimia nervosa.,
Know what binge eating disorder looks like.,
Talk to your teen.,
Speak to a specialist.,
Seek treatment for your teen.,
Promote healthy attitudes towards food and fitness.,
Encourage self-esteem.",How to Spot Early Eating Disorder Warning Signs in Teens," If your teen obsesses about food, healthy eating, and excessive exercise, they may have an unhealthy fixation on body image. This does not necessarily mean your teen has an eating disorder, but it does suggest a possible risk of developing an eating disorder in the future.If your teen complains about being fat or worries about being overweight, they may have body image issues.
Teens frequently check themselves in the mirror before going out. However, if your teen obsesses over the way they look, even when they're just staying at home, there may be some developing body image issues to look out for.
Notice whether your teen talks about their eating habits. Expressions of frustration or shame may be disguised as sarcasm - for example, frequently saying things like, ""Wow, I eat like a total slob. It must be disgusting to watch me eat."";
, Irregular or inconsistent eating habits are a common sign of a developing eating disorder.Some teens may claim they've already eaten, or they might take their food to their room claiming that they'll eat alone. Other teens may skip meals altogether, claiming that they're not hungry or making excuses for a lack of appetite.Note that patterns and repetition are key here. Teens may have fluctuating appetites depending on their metabolism and activity levels, so if your teen skips a meal once it doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem.

, Teens with certain types of eating disorders like bulimia tend to purge after eating a meal. This may involve inducing vomiting or inducing a bowel movement.If your teen consistently goes to the bathroom during or immediately after eating, it may be a sign that your teen is purging themself of food.
Some teens may take dietary supplements or laxatives to purge food or regulate the appetite. Be on the lookout for any frequent medicine or supplement use, or frequent trips to the bathroom.

, Teens with eating disorders are often very preoccupied with food. They may eat very small portions, or they may follow strict self-imposed habits while eating. These may include cutting food into tiny pieces, chewing a single bite for extremely long periods of time, generally eating too slowly, or following fad diets.Teens with eating disorders may stick to eating the same foods most of the time.

, While social pressure can influence the development of an eating disorder, some teens are more predisposed towards this illness than others. Think about your family history, especially your teen's mental health history, and assess whether they are at an elevated risk of developing an eating disorder.Keep in mind that while boys and girls can develop an eating disorder, they are more common in girls.
Teens with a family history of anxiety, depression, or addiction are more likely to have a biological predisposition towards eating disorders.
Obsessive-compulsive tendencies, as well as an inclination towards perfectionism, can suggest a possible risk of developing an eating disorder.
If your teen has a close relative who's had an eating disorder, this may increase their chances of developing one as well.

, Teens who struggle with an eating disorder are likely to exhibit noticeable fluctuations in weight, which may include both losing and gaining weight. A teen experiencing weight fluctuations may dress in layers or wear unusually baggy clothes. This may be done to cover up the recent weight loss, or to keep warm if the adolescent does not have sufficient body fat. Teens with an eating disorder may also feel that no amount of weight loss is ever ""enough."", Anorexia nervosa is essentially self-starvation.Teens with anorexia may severely limit the overall amount of food they eat, or they may cut out certain food groups, like carbohydrates or fats.


You may notice your teen has dry, yellowish, or pale skin, and brittle hair and nails. They may also have a growth of soft hair, like peach fuzz, on their body.
Constipation, abdominal pain, and either a lack or a surplus of energy at any given time are all physical symptoms of anorexia.They may complain of being cold, dizzy, or tired frequently.
Teen girls who have started menstruating may start to miss periods or have them irregularly if they have developed anorexia.
Food rituals are most common among teens with anorexia. They may eat foods in a certain order or manner, or refuse to eat entire categories of food altogether.

, Binge eating (consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time) and purging (voiding the body) are the two biggest signs of bulimia. Purging may be performed through induced vomiting or induced bowel movements.They may complain of stomach aches, heartburn, or a sore throat.
Teens who have developed bulimia may develop cuts or calluses on their hands and knuckles from sticking their hands down their throat to induce vomiting.
Someone with bulimia may also use excessive mints, gum, or mouthwash to cover the smell of vomit.
A teen who has bulimia may have discolored teeth, cavities, dry skin, and swelling in certain parts of the body. They may also have thinning or brittle hair., Binge eating is the consumption of abnormally large quantities of food in a relatively short period of time. Binge eating may be accompanied by purging in teens who have developed bulimia nervosa. However, some teens may suffer from binge eating disorder, which involves overeating without purging.Look for hidden food wrappers and hoarded ""stashes"" of food as a clear sign of binge eating.
Teens often have fluctuating appetites, but someone who binge eats may eat without any control, even past the point of feeling full.
Look for weight fluctuations, including mild to severe obesity.

, If you're concerned your teen may have an eating disorder, the first step is talking to your teen about your concerns. This requires a good deal of tact, since teens may quickly get defensive or even aggressive if confronted about an eating disorder.Let your teen know about any concerning behavior you've seen or heard.
Use ""I"" statements and avoid direct accusations. For example, instead of saying, ""You have an eating disorder,"" say something like, ""I've noticed that your eating habits have been a little different, and I'm getting concerned. Can you tell me what's up?""
You may need to approach your teen several times before you get an honest answer. It's not uncommon for teens to lie about not having an eating disorder and insist that everything is fine.

, The first step towards helping your teen is to educate yourself on eating disorders and how to treat them. The National Eating Disorders Association has a hotline where parents and teens can reach out to get help. They can be reached in the United States by calling (800) 931-2237., Many teens struggling with eating disorder need professional treatment. Find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and/or obsessive-compulsive thinking.Your teen's doctor can identify and manage the physical complications of an eating disorder and help guide you to other resources, therapists, or specialists.
Find a therapist by searching online, checking your local phone book, or asking your teen's doctor for a recommendation.
In addition to counseling, you may also want to schedule a nutritionist appointment.
A nutritionist can work with your teen to make healthy choices and figure out a nutritious diet that will manage weight fluctuations without sacrificing sustenance., Some teens develop negative attitudes towards certain types of food due to environmental cues. If you're worried about your adolescent developing an eating disorder, try to be more conscious about the way you talk about food and fitness around your teen.Don't refer to some foods as ""good"" and others as ""bad,"" as this can set your teen up for feelings of guilt. Never use food as a bribe, reward, or punishment.
Don't force teens to eat everything on their plate if they are full, but make sure they've eaten enough food to sustain their growing bodies.
Focus on healthy eating and healthy exercise habits. Encourage sports and regular exercise without letting your teen become obsessive with their workout habits.

, Many teens with eating disorders have a distorted image of their own body. It's normal for teens to feel a little insecure in their growing, changing bodies, but it's important to reinforce a positive body image and a strong sense of self-esteem.Never tease your teens about their appearance.
Be critical about the way advertisements and media depict ""attractive"" bodies.
Display a respectful acceptance of all body types, including your own. If you are critical of your own body, your teen may engage in similar behaviors.
Help your teen develop healthy, effective coping strategies, like managing stress and talking about your problems with others.

Watch out for a loss of appetite.,
Keep track of any weight loss.Chronic battle of the body against leukemia triggers a cascade of inflammatory cells.,
Be aware if your child is experiencing night sweats.,
Look for lumps in the groin, underarms, and neck.,
Identify any pains or aches on the left side of the abdomen.,
Put your child through chemotherapy.,
Sign your child up for a stem cell transplant.,
Put your child on a neutropenic diet.",How to Prevent Leukemia in Children," Studies show that people exposed to a high dose of radiation are at risk for leukemia. A classic example is the Hiroshima bombing survivors. Their exposure to atomic bomb radiation increased their chances of getting leukemia dramatically.


Even low doses of radiation in x-rays, CT scans, or radiotherapy increase chances of developing leukemia. Therefore, you should avoid repeated exposure to these tests and treatments as much as possible.
Health care professionals must be responsible in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure for patients.;
, Benzene is a chemical base for producing other chemicals such as gasoline, lubricants, and pesticides. It carries a sweet odor that can be absorbed easily once inhaled. It can also penetrate the skin upon exposure. Rates of leukemia, specifically AML, are higher in people exposed to benzene.


Chronic exposure causes sufficient amounts of benzene to wreak havoc in the body. Avoid working in places with repeated exposure to benzene such as gasoline stations and cigarette factories.
New safety regulations have prompted lessening of benzene content in products such as gasoline. Still, it is best to lessen frequenting gasoline stations and crude oil mills.

, Smoking induces benzene exposure because benzene is emitted in cigarette smoke. Other radioactive chemicals are also found in cigarettes.


Second-hand smoking exposes a person to benzene as well.
The best advice for smokers is to quit smoking now and save other’s lives too. For non-smokers, avoid cigarette smoke at all cost.

, Children treated with chemo for other forms of cancer have a higher risk of developing a secondary cancer like Acute Myeloid Leukemia which develops within 5-10 years of treatment.


Alkylating agents are mostly the culprit for secondary cancer caused by chemotherapy. This drug attaches a disruptive alkyl group that damages the DNA of cells.
There is an increased incidence of leukemia with this group of drugs.
It is advisable to discuss the treatment plan carefully with a doctor when undergoing chemotherapy.

, Some studies have found that mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may increase the risk of leukemia developing in their unborn child.

, Encouraging children to make healthier choices will make their bodies strong and are less likely to develop cancer. According to MD Anderson Cancer Center you may try the following alternatives to help your children eat healthy.


Add different fruits and vegetables to your kid’s meal.
Prepare ready to eat fruits and vegetables for snacks.
Puree vegetables and add as sauces over pastas.

, Exercise keeps the body in good shape as well as improves overall immunity. Make sure to get your kids at least 60 minutes of physical activity.


Limit TV and video games.
Encourage bike or walking early morning.
Sign up kids for classes such as basketball clinics or dance lessons.

, The body recuperates best during sleep. Repair of damaged cells commence during this time to restore good health. #*Adequate sleep will ensure a healthy body and a well-oiled immune system, which is important to combat illnesses.


In general, children need a lot of sleep. one to three year olds need 12 to 14 hours, four to six year olds need 10 to 12 hours, seven to twelve year olds need 10 to 11 hours and teenagers need 8 to 9., Fatigue is the most common symptom. Paleness of the face and skin and difficult of breathing with mild exertion may accompany fatigue. These symptoms indicate that the red blood cells do not carry sufficient amounts of oxygen to the rest of the body. The lungs, other vital organs, and muscles compensate for less oxygen by working more diligently. This is a very taxing process to sustain and causes general feeling of fatigue.

, Fever actually protects the body from harmful processes within. The constant fighting of the body against leukemia cells trigger persistent fever.

, The bone marrow is the soft tissue core inside the bone. Bone pain is a result of the saturation of bone marrows with leukemia cells.

, Easy bruising , frequent bleeding of gums and nose, pinpoint red spots in the skin. These are symptoms of low amounts of normal platelet in the body.

, Soft, small lumps may be found in any part of the body. The lumps are by-products of leukemic cells seeping under the affected area.

, The spleen is the graveyard for dead blood cells. Leukemia increase the death rate of blood cells and congest the spleen. Consequently, the spleen becomes enlarged. The close proximity of the spleen to the stomach plays a role in loss of appetite. The enlarged spleen presses on the stomach to mimic a feeling of fullness. This explains the loss of appetite.

, One inflammatory cell is named tumor necrosis factor (cachectin). Cachectin is responsible for weight loss.

, Fever is a response of the body against harmful leukemia cells. Chronic fever alters the ability of the brain to regulate body temperature. The brain’s faulty regulatory process perceives the normal body temperature to be too hot and uses night sweating as a means of releasing heat.

, The lumps signify swelling of the lymph glands. The lymph glands are the policemen of the body. They detain unwanted bacteria, virus, and foreign substance such as cancer cells and prime them for removal. In this case, lymph glands trap leukemia cells and try to eliminate them.

, The spleen becomes too stretched and enlarged that pain is produced. This is often complained in the left side of the abdomen where the spleen is usually located.

, According to the American Cancer Society, the main treatment for childhood leukemia is chemotherapy. For children who have higher risk for leukemia, chemotherapy is given along with stem cell transplant.


Chemotherapy can only potentially treat ALL and AML cases. Chemotherapy is most successful in ALL where 50% of cases are cured. CML and CLL do not respond well to chemotherapeutic drugs.
The main drawback of chemotherapy drugs is that it kills both normal and cancer cells. There may also be setbacks when cancer cells recur despite treatment. The main medications used in chemotherapy are cytarabine and anthracycline.
Cytarabine works by disturbing the DNA synthesis of healthy and cancer cells. Therefore, new cell production is put to a halt. Anthracycline damages DNA proteins and disrupts DNA synthesis of healthy and leukemia cells.

, A healthy donor’s stem cell can be transplanted into a leukemia patient by way of the bone marrow. In this way, new multipotent stem cells encourage the growth of new, healthy blood cells.


Bone marrow is the only stem cell transplant source without controversy. Other stem cell sources (such as embryos) are met with mixed opinions in the medical field.

, This is a special type of diet which aims to protect the patient from foods that harbor bacteria and potentially cause infection. The blood cells of patients are not well-equipped to ward off infection efficiently. Some basic tips to follow for neutropenic diet are:


Avoid fresh fruits and raw vegetables. Bacteria may be present in the skin and leaves. Fruits that can be peeled off such as banana, grapefruit, and oranges are safe to eat. Cooked vegetables, canned fruits and vegetables, and juices are safe for consumption.
Always cook the meat and fish well-done. This ensures that no potential threat such as Salmonella can infect a patient.
Consume only pasteurized dairy products. Pasteurization is the gold standard of eliminating harmful substances in dairy products.
Avoid salad bars, deli counters, and sashimi counters. Opt for cooked food all the time.
Make sure that water is safe for drinking. Distilled, boiled, reverse osmosis or filtered water is advisable.

Make sure your child always carries her inhaler with her.,
Keep a list of triggers on hand and update it as needed.,
Develop an Asthma Action Plan.",How to Reduce Asthma Risk in Children," Allergens are substances that can cause allergic reactions. Airborne allergens are allergens that travel through the air, such as dust, animal fur, pollen from trees, and grass. You should look for any possible sources of airborne allergens in your home. This could be dusty floors or windowsills, fur from the family pet, and pollen from indoor plants or flowers.You should also note irritants like cigarette smoke and air pollution. Check your household cleaning products for any irritating chemicals and fragrances. These airborne irritants can trigger asthma attacks.
There are also other allergens, such as cockroaches and mold, that should be noted and removed. These allergens can trigger asthma attacks in your child if they are not addressed and eliminated.;
, Asthma can be triggered by exercise and physical activities as these put stress on your child’s respiratory system. While it is important that your child get enough physical exercise to stay healthy, you should also monitor her exercise to ensure it is not irritating her asthma.Studies suggest that doing physical activity can actually reduce the frequency of your child’s asthma attacks in the long term. But it is important to find a balance. You want your child to do enough physical activity to stay healthy without triggering her asthma.

, The chemicals used to preserve foods can trigger asthma. Sulfites are one of the most common preservatives, often found in a number of foods and drinks. Read food labels to ensure they do not contain preservatives that will trigger an asthma attack in your child.

, Respiratory infections, such as a bad cold or a viral infection in the lungs, can lead to asthma attacks. If you suspect your child might have other health conditions that are putting her at a greater risk of an asthma attack, you should bring her to the doctor for a check up. The doctor can examine her and determine if she requires medication to treat the infection.Other health conditions like heartburn and sleep apnea can also trigger asthma. Heartburn is also known as acid reflux and can develop due to a poor diet or digestive issues. Sleep apnea is a condition where the person has shallow or interrupted breathing while sleeping, often due to enlarged tonsils or adenoids, which can disrupt your sleep and also trigger breathing conditions like asthma., Asthma attacks can be triggered by some medications such as aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers.Beta-blockers are often prescribed for heart issues. Your doctor should avoid prescribing NSAIDs or beta-blockers for your child as they have shown to trigger asthma attacks and other health issues for individuals with asthma.However, do not stop administering your child's medications without talking to your child's doctor first.
You should also avoid giving your child aspirin as it can trigger asthma attacks.

, Emotional stress can act as a trigger for asthma. You should check in periodically with your child to ensure she is not experiencing any stress from school or trauma at home. You should also monitor your child’s behavior and note any signs of stress or trauma., Smoke from cigarettes and cigars can be a major asthma trigger for your child. Set a no smoking rule in your home. If you live in a housing complex or an apartment building that is not smoke-free, work with your neighbors and your landlord to advocate for a smoke-free environment in the building.You can also use the policy brief supplied by the American Lung Association to help create a smoke free environment in the entire building or complex., Using natural fibers in your home can greatly reduce asthma triggers as dust and allergens are less likely to get trapped in natural fibers.You should wash all bedding, towels, rugs, and curtains at least once a week in hot water and dry them on high heat to remove any allergens.
You should also avoid using down-filled pillows and comforters as they can carry allergens. Put a mattress cover on your child’s mattress to prevent allergens from burrowing in her mattress. You should also use pillow covers on your child’s pillows to protect her from allergens in her pillows.

, Switching to all-natural cleaning products will help to reduce the number of chemical allergens in your home. Go for unscented products as they are usually less irritating.You should also try to keep your house clean and dust free. Use a damp cloth to get rid of dust on all flat surfaces in your home. Vacuum once a week with a vacuum that has a HEPA filter to really make sure there is no dust lying around in your home. This will greatly reduce your child’s risk of an asthma attack., Mold can be a major asthma trigger for your child. You should take steps to keep your home well-ventilated and dry as this will reduce the development of mold.Set up a dehumidifier in any spots that prone to dampness in your home, such as the bathroom or the basement.
If you cannot keep certain areas well ventilated, you should use an ozonator or a 100 W bulb on the area at all times to keep the area warm and dry. This will prevent mold from developing.
Check shower curtains, the back of doors, and walls for any mold. Remove the mold by using a solution of one part chlorine bleach and nine parts water (1 cup bleach combined with nine cups water).
You should also check your houseplants periodically to ensure there is no mold developing in the soil. If there is mold, replace the soil or repot the plant.

, Carpeting is a big carrier of chemicals, dust, mold, and dander from pets. If possible, replace your carpet with tile flooring and natural fiber rugs. Natural fiber rugs are easier to keep clean than carpeting.If you cannot afford to pull out carpet and replace it, make an effort to keep the carpet clean. Use a steam cleaner on the carpets at least twice a month and vacuum the carpet with a good vacuum on a daily basis so allergens do not build up in the carpet.

, Pests like cockroaches can carry allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. You should make sure your home is cockroach-free. This may mean getting your home professionally treated for roaches through a pest removal service.You should specify that there individuals with asthma in your home and ensure the service is familiar with exterminating pests in asthma-prone homes. The service should not use aerosol sprays or any other chemicals that could trigger asthma attacks.

, These materials can collect dust and other allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. Try not to let paper materials sit in your home for long periods of time. Set up a recycling bin outside for paper materials or in an area where your child does not spend a lot of time., One way to do this is to check local reports about pollen and ozone counts. Pollen counts tend to be the highest between five and ten am, depending on where you are located. You may want to keep your child indoors during these times and check local air quality before you let your child go outside to ensure it is not too polluted.If you are not sure which allergens are causing your child’s asthma, you may ask your child’s doctor to skin-test her for common triggers. These could include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and air pollution. You could then limit your child’s exposure to their allergens to reduce her risk of an asthma attack.
Since one common trigger for asthma is an upper respiratory infection like the flu, get your child vaccinated for the flu every year. (Adults with asthma should be vaccinated against the flu as well.)

, Asthma can be triggered by food allergies and food sensitivities. You should remove these foods from your child’s diet so she is not triggered.You can also determine which foods are acting as triggers by keeping a food diary. Note the foods your child eats during the day and any reactions she has to the food. If the reaction is negative or asthma inducing, you should eliminate that food from her diet.
Your doctor can order blood tests for food allergies if it is unclear which foods are causing the problem.

, If your child is triggered by animal dander and animal fur, you should let her interact with only pets and animals that are hypoallergenic. This may mean replacing the family pet with a hypoallergenic pet or only allowing your child to play with friends’ pets that are hypoallergenic., Your child should get into the habit of carrying her asthma inhaler with her at all times, especially when she will be exercising. Her inhaler may be necessary when she is doing exercise, such as playing a sport or going for a run.You should not totally limit your child’s exercise as she needs to stay healthy. But you should make sure she has her inhaler in case of any issues and does not push herself too hard when doing exercise, as this could lead to an asthma attack.

, If you haven’t already, you should start a daily diary that records your child’s asthma symptoms. You should also note any possible triggers, from environmental to emotional. Update the dairy if you notice any other triggers as this will allow you to stay on top of your child’s asthma triggers and reduce her risk of an attack., An Asthma Action Plan can be developed with your doctor and is a good way to develop a plan of action in the event of an asthma attack. An Asthma Action Plan can also help you to track your child’s asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them so your child does not have an asthma attack.The Asthma Action Plan will be broken down into three zones: the Green Zone, the Yellow Zone, and the Red Zone. These zones will help keep track of the severity of your child's asthma. The Green Zone is the normal, safe zone, where there are no issues with your child's breathing. The Yellow Zone is the warning zone, where your child is experiencing some asthma symptoms but is not yet experiencing a full on asthma attack. The Red Zone is the severe zone, where your child is having an asthma attack. If you cannot get your child's asthma under control using an inhaler or other techniques, you may need to take her to emergency care.
You should give everyone in your family a copy of the Asthma Action Plan so everyone around your child is aware of the steps they can take to prevent your child from having an asthma attack.

Minimize stress.",How to Prevent Renal Artery Stenosis," Atherosclerosis – the accumulation of plaque in one or both renal arteries, leading the artery walls to narrow and harden – is by far the most common cause of renal artery stenosis. This plaque can be fat, cholesterol, or calcium deposits.


Atherosclerosis is responsible for 90% of all known cases of RAS.;
, Though most cases of renal artery stenosis occur because of atherosclerosis, some cases also develop due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). FMD is a disease that can cause abnormal cell growth on the renal arteries. This abnormal growth can narrow your arteries.

, Your age and gender play a role in determining your risk of renal artery stenosis.


For RAS caused by atherosclerosis, men and people over 50 years old carry the highest risk.
For RAS caused by fibromuscular dysplasia, women and people between 24 and 55 years of age carry the highest risk.

, For renal artery stenosis caused by atherosclerosis (which, remember, is fully 90% of all cases), your health history can reveal important risk factors. If you have a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol or triglycerides, or diabetes, or if you are obese, your risk of RAS increases.


There is also evidence that a family history of early heart disease puts you at a higher risk of RAS.

, Atherosclerosis-related renal artery stenosis is also more likely to develop in people who smoke, drink, eat an unhealthy diet, and do not exercise.


In particular, a diet high in fat, sodium, sugar, and cholesterol has been shown to increase your risk of RAS.

, For many patients, the first sign of RAS is high blood pressure (hypertension). RAS is only one of many possible causes of high blood pressure, but it should be considered, especially if you have any of the risk factors, have no family history of hypertension, and do not respond to the standard high blood pressure medications. When RAS leads to high blood pressure, the condition is called reno-vascular hypertension (RVH).


Blood pressure is represented by two figures, separated by a slash (for example, 120/80 mm Hg). The first figure is the systolic pressure, and the second is the diastolic pressure. Hypertension is technically defined as a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg.

, Aside from hypertension, the other major sign of renal artery stenosis is a decrease in your kidney function. Poor kidney function is usually diagnosed at the doctor’s office, but you can be aware of possible signs that your kidneys aren’t working as they should. These include:


an increase or decrease in urination
headaches
swelling (edema) in your ankles
fluid retention
drowsiness, fatigue, and trouble concentrating
nausea and vomiting
dry or itchy skin

, Most people with renal artery stenosis do not notice any symptoms at all until the RAS has become very severe. The best way to diagnose RAS is to get regular medical care.

, Get a yearly physical to make sure that your blood pressure and kidney function seem normal. Because most cases of RAS have no symptoms, this simple preventative measure is crucial.

, A nutritious diet can decrease your risk of developing renal artery stenosis. Consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products. Eat healthy fats (like olive oil, corn oil, safflower oil, and canola oil) in moderation. In addition, limit your intake of the following items:


salt and high-sodium foods (like canned foods, salty snacks, and frozen meals)
sugary foods (like desserts and many baked goods)
saturated fats (like those in red meat, whole milk, butter, and lard)
trans-fatty acids (like those in packaged baked goods, fried chips, and doughnuts)
hydrogenated vegetable oils (like margarine)

, You don’t have to do anything extremely strenuous; it’s fine to start by just taking a 30-minute walk three or four times a week. But moderate exercise can help you lower your risk of developing RAS.


Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program, especially if you have any health problems or are obese.
If your schedule is very busy, you can incorporate exercise in small chunks of time: a ten-minute walk during your break, five minutes of jogging in place several times a day, etc.

, Having a body mass index (BMI) in the healthy range is very important for overall health and will lower your risk of developing renal artery stenosis. The diet and exercise information above will help you lose or maintain your weight, but you should also consult your physician about the best weight-loss options for your specific circumstances.

, Smoking increases your risk of developing RAS, so if you smoke, quit.


The process of quitting can be difficult, so consider the variety of products and medications that can help you. Talk to your doctor about the best choices for your specific circumstances, and look into support groups in your area.

, High levels of alcohol consumption can increase your risk, so limit your intake to one drink per night, at most.

, Everyone has some stress from time to time, but you can minimize its impact by staying calm, exercising regularly, practicing yoga or tai chi, listening to soothing music, and taking time to pray or meditate regularly.

The History of the Subjective portion of the S.O.A.P notes include the Etiology or MOI (Mechanism Of Injury), c.c. (Chief Complaint), Symptoms, Description of pain, and past history.


The history is the major portion of the note. This will help when it comes to objective to determine and narrow down the list of potential injuries.
When asking questions, try to avoid questions with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers or questions that could lead them to an answer, such as ""that hurt didn't it"".

, This portion of a S.O.A.P note consists of what you, the clinician can observes. It can be measurable. The Objective portion of the S.O.A.P note includes vision, palpation - soft and bony, girth, ROM (Range of Motion) - AROM, PROM and RROM which stands for Active, Passive and Resistive Range of Motion, manual muscle tests, neurological assessment, circulation, and special tests.


If any special tests are given, which can including bony and soft tissue palpation, neurological exams, and other tests, then they should be documented here.
This is where you should narrow down the list of injuries and determine what it could be, and allow you to see if the problem could me muscular or more ligamentous.

, The likely diagnosis should be included in this section of the note. If a conclusive diagnosis has not been made yet, some possible diagnoses can be charted. It may include additional diagnoses that need to be ruled out.


The assessment may also include information on various diagnostic tests that may be ordered, such as x-rays, blood work and referrals to other specialist.
The type of injury, whether it is chronic, acute, or reoccurring, should be documented.

, This is what steps will be taken to treat the patient. It should include what type of treatments will be given, such as medication, therapies, and surgeries. It may also list long-term treatment plans and recommended changes to lifestyle, as well as short and long term goals for the patient. You can also list any goals that you would like to accomplish with the treatment such as to increase strength or range of motion as well as to reduce pain.

Identify your problem areas.,
Take your measurements.,
Calculate Your BMI (Body Mass Index) to determine your ideal weight.",How to Get the Perfect Beach Body1," Be honest with yourself. Do you really need to lose weight in order to be healthy? Are you already in a healthy weight range, but wish to drop a few pounds and tone up? Are you underweight? Knowing this will help you determine the right diet and exercise options for you.


In order to lose weight, you absolutely must change your diet. Working out will help facilitate weight-loss by boosting your metabolism.For muscle toning only, focus your efforts on exercise, keeping your calorie intake the same.;
,


If you don't already know it, measure your height.
Use a tape measure to determine the circumference of your target area(s). Suggested areas: upper arm, chest, waist, hips, and thigh.
Weigh yourself. For the most accurate measurement, use a digital scale and weigh yourself in the morning before you have eaten anything.

,


BMI measures body fat based on your height and weight. It is designed to help you determine the ideal weight range for your height.
It can be calculated manually, or online using a BMI Calculator. Either way, you will need to know your height and weight. Use the following formula:
Caution: Since muscle weighs more than fat, the BMI formula underestimates the amount of fat in a person with very low muscle mass, and overestimates the amount of fat in a person with high muscle mass.

Check for eye problems.,
Look for signs of malnutrition.,
See your physician.",How to Identify Nutrient Deficits1," If a child is not getting enough nutrients, they will not grow at a normal rate. The rate of growth for a particular child varies with their age. For instance, most people grow rapidly from infants to toddlers, then slow their growth until puberty, when they experience another period of rapid growth. If your child does not grow rapidly during these sensitive periods, they might be suffering a nutrient deficit.See a doctor regularly to ensure your child is growing at a normal rate.;
, Nutrient deficits — especially deficits of vitamin B5, vitamin B6, folic acid, and essential fatty acids — lead to unusual problems with the hair. For instance, hair loss is common, and may manifest as thinning around the temples or reduced volume. You might also experience premature graying or even whitening. Check the shower drain and your hairbrush regularly. If there is more hair than there normally is, you might need more nutrients., Osteoporosis — a condition in which holes develop within bones, compromising their integrity — is a common consequence of a calcium-deficient diet. There are often no symptoms associated with osteoporosis, but it makes you more prone to breaks and fractures. When you see a doctor for these injuries, they will be able to detect osteoporosis through a series of painless medical tests that measure bone density at the hip, spine, and wrist., Inflammation of the gums, especially, is an early indicator of periodontal disease, which may in turn indicate a nutrient deficit. If your gums are puffy, red, tender, and bleed when you floss or brush, you might not be getting enough nutrients. In advanced cases, you might have loose teeth. See a dentist if you experience any of these dental problems.See a dentist at least twice each year for a regular dental checkup. Your dentist will be able to refer you to a nutritionist if they believe it is necessary.

, People who do not receive adequate levels of nutrients are more prone to colds and viral infections. A nutrient-deficient immune system cannot fight off illnesses that a healthy one can, leading to a greater frequency of illnesses, more severe illnesses, or both.Nutrient-deficient people might, for instance, experience:


Sore throat
Coughing
Fever
Sneezing
Runny nose
Other respiratory tract infections (like pneumonia and bronchitis) and flu-like symptoms, Muscle spasms are any involuntary contraction or vibration of the muscle tissue. If you suddenly develop facial tics — for instance, a sudden upturning of the mouth, or scrunching up of the nose — you might be nutrient deficient. Eye twitches (closing your eyes with excess force or experiencing difficulty in keeping your eyelids stable) could also indicate you need more nutrients. Painful cramps in your legs (especially your calves or thighs) are also reported in some cases of nutrient deficits.You might be experiencing a magnesium deficit, since magnesium helps regulate the neuromuscular system that allows our muscles to relax.
Deficits of B vitamins and calcium might also contribute to muscle spasms., Some kinds of nutrient deficiencies — especially iodine deficiency — lead to imbalances in the thyroid and an inability to produce and regulate hormones properly. Signs that your thyroid might be acting up include weight gain, decreased libido, goiter (swelling of the thyroid gland that usually produces a large bump in the neck), hair loss, and infertility., In a developing child, a vitamin A deficit could lead to blindness or visual impairment. If your child cannot see well, or suffers from night blindness (an inability to see in the dark), they might not be getting enough vitamin A. Other eye problems like cataracts and macular degeneration also occur in people who have a deficit of vitamin C, vitamin E, zeaxanthin, and zinc.You can detect macular degeneration and cataracts by paying attention to any loss of quality in your vision. Blurriness, clouded vision, and increased sensitivity to light are common symptoms.

, Nutrient deficiencies are one form of malnutrition. Signs of this condition include, notably, sunken eyes and a bony frame with visible ribs. The skin of a nutrient deficient person will be leathery, dry, and inelastic. Jaundice (yellowing skin) could also occur. Finally, a malnourished person will usually feel lethargic and have low energy levels overall.Malnutrition usually indicates that someone is not getting enough calories or is not getting a balanced diet. Malnutrition might also indicate that someone is getting too many calories.

, The many symptoms of nutrient deficits are also symptoms of many other conditions and diseases, so it is important you see your physician and get an accurate diagnosis of what is causing your symptoms. Doctors can draw and analyze your blood to determine concentrations of key nutrients. Some doctors might conduct a cellular analysis as well as (or instead of) a blood analysis. If you suspect you or your child has a nutrient deficit, see a doctor and explain why you’re concerned about your nutrient levels.Your doctors might not need to conduct a blood analysis if signs and symptoms of a nutrient deficit are obvious enough.
Your doctor might run tests to look for levels of specific nutrients, or just do a general screening for major nutrients.

Look for cognitive impairment.,
Notice impaired motor skills.,
Look for mood disorders.",How to Identify Nutrient Deficits2," Cognitive impairments is when memory and thinking skills are affected and interfere with everyday life. Examples of cognitive impairment include poor memory, trouble thinking clearly, and understanding abstract concepts.Other examples of cognitive impairment include learning disabilities, lower IQ scores, poor social skills, attention deficit disorder, and a reduced ability to problem-solve.
It’s difficult to detect nutrient deficits in this way because by the time you detect them, it’s already too late for the individual who did not receive enough nutrients growing up.
It’s also hard to know if the cognitive impairment was a result of nutrient deficits or was caused by genetics or some other factor.

, Motor skills include any action that uses your limbs or body. Walking, grabbing, and dancing are just a few of the many motor skills that most people take for granted. But if a child is raised with a nutrient deficit, they may not be able to accomplish these basic tasks, or other skills involving coordination and balance.Walking up and down stairs might be hard.
You might not be able to drive a car.
Writing by hand or using a keyboard could prove difficult.

, Deficits of magnesium or vitamin C sometimes contribute to depression or irritability. If you’ve felt down for an extended period and have difficulty enjoying the daily activities that you used to, you might be depressed. You might also have suicidal thoughts or an overall negative outlook on life. Many people with depression experience unpleasant intrusive thoughts like, “I am not good enough” or “Nobody likes me.” Adjusting your intake of essential nutrients could be a first step in overcoming your depression. Talk to a psychotherapist if you are depressed. They can help you cope with your depression and recommend solutions.

Schedule a dental appointment, too, if your nutrient deficit is causing dental problems. It is important to correct your nutrient deficit as soon as possible to ensure you have a healthy, full life. Ask your doctors what you can do to ensure you’re getting all the nutrients you need., A healthy diet built on a cornerstone of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is the surest way to meet all your nutritional needs. A small amount of lean protein (not exceeding 20% of your daily calories) will also help you maintain good health.


Lean proteins include nuts, peanut butter, soy beans, and tofu.
Vegetables like broccoli, celery, and carrots are great with hummus. You could also try a fresh summer salad with spinach, radish, and arugula.
Fruits are great for a snack or mixed in with granola. Try a banana or blueberries instead of candy and chips.
Seek public assistance if you’re having difficulty accessing food for any reason. Contact local food banks, soup kitchens, and local food aid organizations if you don’t have enough money to feed yourself or your family three balanced meals daily., Multivitamins are widely available for children of any age. Children who receive supplements in appropriate doses enjoy decreased mortality and better health. If you or your child are deficient in a particular nutrient, obtain a commercially available version of it and administer it as needed. Most supplemental vitamins and minerals are available as pills, though some might be available as a liquid.


Check the label to figure out how much you should be taking. Usually, you will take one capsule daily.
Vitamins and supplements are almost always water-soluble, meaning you will pass excess in your urine and cannot overdose on them.
Always follow the manufacturer's directions when using supplements.
If correcting nutrient deficits in children, don’t use gummy vitamins. They don’t offer the same level of absorption that regular chewable or capsule vitamins do.

",How to Help Someone Eat Less Sugar and Make Better Food Choices,"


Some people go to sweets as a comfort food to ease the pain of other problems going on in their lives.
Some people are ignorant of the workings of the human body and the role of nutrition.
Some people such as those trying to quit smoking may start consuming large amounts of candy for the oral fixation they crave as they recover from nicotine addiction.
Some people may have their sweets limited throughout the year so on certain holidays they tend to binge eat sweets.;
,, This includes small snacks, gum, candy, etc. Have them list the size of the portions. Once the diary has been handed over you should try to calculate the daily intake of sugar, calories, proteins and other essential nutritional amounts.


Explain what the extra calories is doing to their overall weight. For example, someone would need to run 2 miles (3.2 km) to burn off the calories in one sweetened soda or a small bag of M&M's.
Help them replace the empty calories they got from sugar with nutritious options.

, Encourage a trip to the dentist to fix any decay.

, If you do grocery shopping for anyone eating to much sugar you should take a step back and refocus. You can't attack one member of the household when the bad foods are purchased and brought in on a weekly basis. Start shopping healthy for the whole family. Don't buy fruity or high sugar cereals and opt for Special K or other health cereals. Don't buy candy, flavored drink mixes or anything with lots of sugar, or high fructose corn syrup as an ingredient.


Empty the cupboards, throw out all the candy, PopTarts, sweet foods, sugar drinks and mixes. Buy everyone a water bottle. Get sugar free sweeteners like stevia or use honey to sweeten teas and cereals. Eliminate all sodas and avoid the diet versions of sodas. They may not have sugar but the are loaded with harmful chemicals. It's best to look for more natural diet options.

, Most schools have a nutritionist on hand and they can help you help your children while at school for the day. They can help your child make smart ordering decisions and discuss the benefits of eating better. See if the assistance is available for your student.

, Your local YMCA, community center, diabetics association or hospital may offer a class.

, If there are no appropriate and healthy options available as a student meal parents should complain to the school boards. In the mean time parents and families should work to make sure the student is eating as much food from home as possible. Instead of eating a cinnamon roll for breakfast at school they should take a packed breakfast from home or eat breakfast at home.

, Since the water is warm, this shouldn't be hard at all. Make sure that your hands, feet, and face are all wet, since most of your heat and cold receptors are there. After a few moments, turn the temperature down slightly and shower as normal.

, Remember, you aren't trying to shock yourself - this is the gradual method of getting used to cold water! At this point you should be finishing up your shower just in time to adjust to your second temperature change. If you find yourself comfortable though, or needing more time to shower, feel free to drop the temperature a third time.

, Each day you should find that the temperature drops are a little bit easier. This indicates that your body is getting used to the process and is doing a better job of thermoregulation., Once you have a few days or a week of this process under your belt and the temperature drops aren't as intimidating, lower the starting temperature of your shower. You'll now start the shower at the temperature of your first temperature drop... and your last temperature drop will be colder than you've ever had it before.

, The exact timing will be different for everyone, depending on how fit you are and how much body fat you have.Ironically, the best body type for this is one that is both in shape and fat! Whenever you are ready, continue to lower your starting temperature again. Before you know it, you'll be comfortable at temperatures that were downright shocking to you before.

Do not weigh yourself everyday. This will drive you crazy. Everybody's weight fluctuates naturally day-to-day, which can mostly be attributed to water weight.
Remember that muscle weighs more than fat. If you are exercising a lot, you are probably gaining some muscle. Thus, your measurements are more important than the number on the scale.

This method is short and sweet, and is especially great for both swimmers and athletes who will be using ice baths to help them recover from activity.Once your water is ready, get your mind ready for the shock.

, Since most of your sensory receptors are in these areas they are the most important to overcoming the shock.This is an easy way to get started if you don't yet have the mental strength to jump right in quite yet.


If you can't dip these areas in the water, splash cold water over these areas instead.

, Just go for it. Jump right in and make sure that your entire body is covered head to toe in cold water. Leaving any areas dry and warm will detract from adjustment, as your body will have something to compare the cold water to.

, If you are swimming this will be easy, but it can be harder in a shower or bath. Shift your weight and move your feet. Any muscle movement will help kick-start the body's process of thermoregulation and adjustment.

, At first it will be tempting to jump out of the water or turn the temperature up. Don't let yourself. You can build a mental wall against the cold until your body fully adjusts and embraces it. Each time you build this wall and endure the cold it gets easier, both psychologically and physically, due to increasingly efficient thermoregulation. "

Lower your environment's temperature.,
Raise your core temperature to make cold feel better.",How to Get Used to Cold Water3," Normal human body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.The human body has three types of sensory receptors in the skin: pain receptors, heat receptors, and cold receptors. Heat receptors start to perceive heat above 30 degrees Celsius (and up to around 45 degrees, where pain receptors take over). Cold receptors perceive cold when temperature drops below 35 degrees.As you can see, there is a 5 degree overlap zone that will trigger both heat and cold receptors.
You feel cold more acutely than you feel heat because your body has 4 times the number of cold receptors as heat receptors.Many of these are located in the face, ears, hands, and feet.
Cold receptors stop functioning below 5 degrees Celsius, when you stop feeling cold and start feeling numb.Your core body temperature can vary slightly, depending on hormonal changes and health. , When your temperature exceeds 37 degrees (98.6% Fahrenheit) your blood vessels will dilate, allowing more blood to reach the surface of the skin to be cooled. When your temperature drops, blood vessels contract to conserve body heat.As you regularly experience this sensation, your body will become more efficient at thermoregulation (the temperature control process)., Part of the difficulty of getting in a cold shower (particularly in the morning when you have been in bed) is that the shock is exacerbated because your surrounding environment was previously warm. If you lower the temperature of your environment the cold water will be less shocking.


Turn the thermostat down a degree or two. This will even save you money in the winter.
Have a fan in the bathroom or bedroom. Increased circulation of air under 37 degrees will accustom your body's cold receptors to being activated.
Don't bundle up as tight at night. This can be especially helpful if you are having trouble with cold morning showers. The warmer you bundle up, the colder the shower will feel!

, There are times when the cold can feel good, like when you jump into a pool on a hot summer day or drink a cold beverage after strenuous sports activity. This is because your body is elevated to over 37 degrees and is struggling to lower its temperature. If you raise your body's temperature, you can not only make cold water easier to adjust to, but you can also make it refreshing.


Consider high intensity exercise before a cold shower. Interval or circuit training is especially effective.
Your cold shower will have the added benefit of helping your muscles recover!"

Talk to your doctor before taking any herbal supplements.",How to Have Healthy Kidneys," Staying properly hydrated is one of the best ways to keep your kidneys healthy. Without adequate water, your kidneys can lose some of their ability to filter your blood, and may even become damaged over the course of your lifetime.Drinking water helps your kidneys flush sodium, urea, toxins, and waste out of your body.By staying properly hydrated, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
Increasing your fluid intake to approximately 2 liters (around eight and a half 8-fluid-ounce cups) of water each day can help maintain proper kidney function. You may wish to increase your intake even further if you are outside in the heat or do not have air conditioning in the summer months.
Some individuals may need more or less water, depending on factors like regional climate, level of physical activity, and certain medications taken on a regular basis.
Talk to your doctor about your specific hydration needs.;
, If you're overweight or if you live a sedentary lifestyle, you may be at risk of developing kidney disease. That's because regular exercise and staying fit lowers your blood pressure and may help prevent diabetes and heart disease, which can reduce your risk of developing chronic kidney disease.If you're currently overweight, talk to your doctor about a healthy weight-loss plan involving a restricted diet and increased exercise.You may also want to ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian, who can help you plan meals that will help you achieve your weight loss goals while ensuring you get all the nutrients and vitamins your body needs.
Make sure your doctor determines that it's safe for you to begin an exercise regimen, especially if you're new to exercise.
Be sure to drink more water than usual if you plan on working out so that you do not become dehydrated.

, You may be aware of the impact smoking can have on your lungs, throat, and mouth, but you may not realize that smoking can also damage other parts of your body. Smoking can also cause high blood pressure, which may lead to chronic kidney disease, and smoking increases your risk for kidney cancer.Nicotine has been shown to damage the blood vessels in your body.
Damaged blood vessels can reduce the flow of blood to your kidneys, which forces the kidneys to operate at a diminished level.
If you're currently a smoker, talk to your doctor about finding ways to quit smoking.
If you don't smoke, don't start. Ask your doctor about the negative health impact that smoking can have on your body, including your kidneys.

, The symptoms of kidney disease tend to develop slowly over time. They are often misdiagnosed due to the fact that each of these symptoms can potentially be caused by other health problems. Once symptoms begin to show up, the kidney disease is often in a more advanced stage.See your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any of the following symptoms:


Nausea
Vomiting
Lack of appetite
Weakness/fatigue
Difficulty sleeping
Changes in your urination frequency
Cognitive impairments
Muscle cramping/twitching
Frequent hiccups
Swollen feet/ankles
Persistent body itches
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
High blood pressure and difficulty controlling blood pressure

, Many people have kidney disease and don't realize it. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors for developing kidney disease and how to reduce that risk.Having high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol significantly increases your risk of developing kidney disease.If you have a family history of chronic kidney disease and/or are over the age of 50, it's important to get tested on a regular basis.
Your doctor may test your blood pressure, take a urine sample (to look for traces of blood, infection, or protein), and check your blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to determine how much urea nitrogen is in your blood.Your doctor may also check your serum creatinine levels to test for kidney disease. Healthy creatinine levels fall between 0.84 and 1.21 milligrams per deciliter.If you have a pre-existing medical condition which increases the risk of kidney disease, your doctor may check your blood pressure and run blood and urine tests during each regular office visit to monitor your kidneys., Dietary changes should start with an awareness of the foods you eat every day. Certain foods contain high levels of sodium and other ingredients that can affect your kidneys and cause high blood pressure, which in turn can cause kidney disease over time.Limit how much processed food and prepared (restaurant) food you eat. These foods can be bad for your kidneys and for your overall health.Fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products are the best foods to maintain your health.

, One of the most important dietary changes you can make is reducing how much salt you consume. Your kidneys work hard to balance the sodium levels in your body. Too much sodium can cause high blood pressure, which may lead to kidney disease over time.Keep your salt consumption at or below 2,300 mg.Try the DASH diet as a way to eat healthy and lower your sodium.
Try purchasing and eating low-sodium versions of your favorite foods. They taste just as great, but without all the extra salt.

, Alcohol gets filtered out of your blood as a toxin. Drinking too much alcohol, or drinking in excess too often, can put additional stress on your kidneys and reduce their ability to function.Guidelines for moderate drinking are one or less drinks per day for women and two or less for men. One drink is 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor.Remember to drink water whenever you drink alcohol so you don't get dehydrated.
Try to drink a full glass of water after each alcoholic beverage you drink. This can help keep you hydrated and prevent drinking in excess.

, It's perfectly safe to take over-the-counter (OTC) medications when you need them for an emergency or with the OK of your doctor; however, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or aspirin on a regular basis over long periods of time has been linked to kidney damage.NSAIDs have been shown to cause elevated blood pressure in some individuals.Over time, high blood pressure can cause chronic kidney disease.
Try skin creams/lotions and heat therapy to treat painful muscles and joints instead of taking NSAIDs. When used properly, these topical options are safe and won't affect your kidneys.
If you experience chronic pain or arthritis, talk to your doctor about other ways to control and manage your pain without damaging your kidneys.

, Some indigestion medications, such as Aludrox (Drug) and Maalox, contain aluminum, magnesium, and/or magnesium citrate.These ingredients can cause hypermagnesemia, an electrolyte imbalance, in individuals with chronic kidney disease.Your kidneys work hard to balance your electrolyte levels.
Aluminum and magnesium can make it more difficult for your kidneys to operate normally.
Instead of aluminum or magnesium, take calcium carbonate medications like Gaviscon, TUMS, Remegel (Tablets), or Rennie, as these will not upset your electrolyte levels.

, You may not think of allergy and cold medicine as having an effect on your kidneys; however, you should ask your doctor about any medication you're taking, whether by prescription or over-the-counter, if you have concerns about your kidney health.If you are taking medication for kidney disease, certain medications (including OTC meds and supplements) can react negatively if taken at the same time.


Avoid decongestants if you have high blood pressure, as this combination could cause problems for your kidneys.
Many cough/cold medicines contain high levels of aspirin, a NSAID. Taking NSAIDs can elevate your blood pressure, which may cause damage to your kidneys.
Most antihistamine tablets, sprays, and eye drops are safe to use, including eye drops that contain sodium cromoglycate (Drug).
If you're experiencing congestion, use a room vaporizer to inhale steam mixed with menthol or eucalyptus. Soothe sore throats with a homemade syrup made of honey and lemon.
Do not take medications containing cetirizine, such as Zyrtec, if you have kidney problems.
In individuals with renal insufficiency or chronic kidney disease, cetirizine can take significantly longer to work its way out of your system.This may cause additional stress on your kidneys over time.

, You need strong, healthy kidneys to remove vitamin A from the body. If you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), then you will need to be very careful with your vitamin A consumption. While it should not be avoided, talk with your doctor about taking a special renal multivitamin which will help you meet all your vitamin requirements.Make sure your vitamins are not in the form of effervescent tablets, as these tend to contain a lot of salt (up to one gram in each tablet). Too much sodium in your diet can elevate your blood pressure, which may cause further damage to your kidneys over time.

, You should let your doctor know about anything you put into your body on a regular basis. Your doctor will know about the prescription medications you're on, but he or she may not know about your usual diet or any vitamins and herbal supplements you take.Many herbal extracts and supplements contain ingredients that could damage your kidneys.Vitamins and supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, meaning there aren't very clear guidelines on what can and can't be added to them, nor is there testing to ensure they don't contain toxic additives.
Some supplements could have harmful interactions with other medications you're taking.
Tell your doctor about any herbal supplements, extracts, or vitamins you're taking or considering.

Provide a good example for your children.,
Don't put pressure on your child to eat.,
Be patient.,
Do not punish the child if they refuse to eat.",How to Get Your Kids to Eat Almost Anything," Children learn from an early age and are very easy to influence through the use of routine and the introduction of good habits. Once your kids get into the habit of being adventurous and trying new foods, you'll find it a lot easier to broaden their horizons and expand their taste buds.;
, One of the best habits you can teach your kids is that they always have to sit at the table when eating. Do not let them eat food in front of the television or alone in their rooms.


Let your kids know that if they want to eat at all, they have to sit at the table. Tell them that they can't go back to watching TV or outside to play until they have finished all of the food sitting in front of them.
If they refuse to eat, make them sit at the table for a while, then let them go. However, don't offer them a snack or to make them other food instead. They need to learn that they will go hungry unless they eat the food that's put in front of them.

, Mealtimes should be an opportunity for the family to sit and talk to each other. Avoid having the television or radio on in the background, or letting your child play with a cell phone or video game throughout the meal.


Once your child accepts the fact that there are no distractions allowed during mealtimes, they will be more willing to come and sit at the table and eat their plate of food quickly.
Avoiding distractions at the table also provides a good opportunity for you to catch up with your child, to ask them questions about school, about their friends and their lives in general.

, Establishing a firm routine when it comes to meals and snacks is a good idea, as your child will know when to expect food and will be hungry enough to eat it when the assigned time arrives.


For example, you could offer your child three meals per day and two snacks. Aside from these pre-arranged eating times, don't allow your child to have anything else to eat - only give them water.
This will ensure that your child is hungry and willing to eat come mealtimes, no matter what food you put in front of them.

, When introducing a new food, serve it alongside at least one of your child's favorites. For example, try serving broccoli with mashed potatoes, or some salad along with a slice of pizza.


Serving a new food along with an old favorite will help your child to accept the new food and make them more enthusiastic about sitting at the table in the first place.
For kids who are more resistant, you could make a rule that they will only be allowed to eat their favorite food (such as the pizza) when they have eaten all of the new type of food (such as the salad).

, If your child is pretty picky with food, try to reduce the number of snacks they eat during the day. This will hopefully create an appetite and desire for a varied diet.


A child who eats too many snacks between meals probably will not be hungry come mealtimes and therefore will not be willing to eat something new.
Limit snacks to two or three per day, and try to make them something healthy, like apple slices, a yogurt or a handful of nuts.

, Mealtimes should be fun and interactive. They shouldn't be stressful, or always end up with the child crying or complaining about something they don't want to eat. Eating should be an enjoyable experience for everyone at the table.


Compare the taste of different foods (fish is salty, cheese is creamy, etc), talk about the diversity of colors (orange carrots, green Brussels sprouts, purple beets, etc) or ask your child to guess the taste of a certain food based on its smell.
You could also try serving the food in an interesting way. For example, you could make a face on your child's plate, using spaghetti for hair, meatballs for eyes, a carrot for the nose and ketchup for the mouth.

, Include your child in the preparation of food and discuss the reasons why you put certain foods together, in terms of complimentary flavors and colors. Being involved in the cooking process will make your child much more curious to test out the finished product.


Another great way to get your child interested and involved in the food preparation process is to allow them to grow or pick out their own food. For example, you could try growing your own tomato plant and give your child the responsibility of watering it each day and checking to see if the tomatoes are ripe.
You could also try bringing your child to a produce farm and allow them to pick their own apples, berries, etc. This will make them much more excited about eating them.

, If your child does not want to try a certain food, try offering a small prize. If they promise to eat everything on their plate, you could reward them with a small dessert after their meal, or to bring them somewhere nice, like the park or to visit a friend.

, One mistake that a lot of parents make is that they tell their children that eating a certain food will make them big, healthy and strong.


While this can be effective for getting the child to eat, it makes eating seem like something a child has to do, rather than something they should enjoy doing.
Instead, try to focus on all of the fantastic and varied flavors that food has to offer. Teach your kids to take pleasure in mealtimes and to embrace the opportunity to try new things. Once your child develops a zest for eating and trying new things, they will be willing to eat almost anything you put in front of them!

, Having firm rules in place will provide structure to your mealtimes and help you to broaden your kid's taste buds. For example, one of the most important rules you could set is: everyone has to eat what is served, or at least try it. Do not allow your child to refuse a certain food if they have not even tried it.


Make sure your child is aware that there will be no substitute meals if they do not eat what's in front of them.
Giving in to a child's tears and outbursts you will not help you to achieve your goal. Be patient and firm in your rules, and results will eventually follow.

, Children look to their parents for many reasons, including to see what they eat and how they relate to a particular type of food.


If you do not eat a certain type of food or make faces while you eat something you don't like, how can you expect your child to eat it? Let your child know that the mealtime rules apply to everyone, not just them.
Therefore, you should try to be a good role model by eating what your child eats, when your child eats it.

, In terms of mealtimes, you as the parent decide what will be served, when it will be served and where it will be served. After that, it's up to the child whether they're going to eat or not.


If your child chooses not to eat what you served them, do not force them to eat it - this will only make the child more resistant and cause you further stress. However, you shouldn't offer to make the child their favorite food instead, as this will significantly reduce their incentive to try something new.
Don't allow your child to eat again until the next meal is served. This will teach them to be less picky about what they eat - ""hunger is the best sauce"", as the saying goes.

, You child will not learn to accept and enjoy new foods overnight. Being adventurous with food is a habit that has to be formed, just like any other habit. Be patient and do not give up on your quest to teach your child how and why they should eat healthy and diverse foods.


Remember to give your child enough time to accept a new food. Don't just try a food once, then give up if your child says they don't like it.
Serve it as part of a meal at least three times before you give in - sometimes it takes kids a while to warm up to a new food and realize that they actually enjoy it.

, Do not punish your child if they refuse to eat a certain food - this can make them even more averse to eating it.


Instead, calmly explain to the child that they will not be given anything else to eat until the next meal, and that they will be very hungry if they don't eat now.
Make it clear that it's the child's own decision to go hungry - they are not being punished. If you persist with this techniques, children will eventually give in and eat what's in front of them.

Complete a certified nursing assistant (CNA) training program.,
Become a licensed practical nurse (LPN).,
Explore how to become a Registered Nurse (RN).,
Consider pursuing a master of science degree in nursing (MSN).",How to Prepare for Nursing School1," CNAs work as aides to nurses, completing tasks such as cleaning, filing, or scheduling. You can receive your CNA certificate after approximately 72 hours of training., Earning an LPN degree typically takes one year of full-time study or two years if the courses are taken part time. LPNs are considered dependent practitioners, meaning they are always under the direction and supervision of another professional, such as a registered nurse. With this degree, you can administer medications, collect vital signs, and collect specimens from patients.In Texas and California, LPNs are referred to as LVNs (licensed vocational nurses).
Classes in an LPN program are heavily focused on anatomy and physiology, and the majority of the curriculum is clinical practice.
LPN degrees are offered at a range of settings, such as technical schools, hospitals, community colleges, and privately owned nursing schools.

, RNs can perform a variety of jobs within the healthcare world, including trauma nurses, occupational health nurses, psychiatric nurses, or intensive care nurses. To achieve this certification, you will need to either complete an associate of science in nursing (ASN) or an associate’s degree in nursing, which typically takes two years at a community college. Another option is to pursue a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), which is a four-year degree.Attaining an associate’s degree in nursing is the quickest way to become a nurse, but BSNs typically hold supervisory positions, so the extra schooling may be of interest to you.
If you have an associate’s degree, you may be eligible for an accelerated RN-to-BSN degree program, in which you receive credit for skills learned through work experience and previous schooling. This typically takes two years to complete.

, To further specialize in the nursing field, you can complete an MSN program in fields such as nurse-midwifery, nursing education, or geriatrics. You will also be able to teach at the college level if you hold an MSN degree, which usually takes about two years to complete.Nursing professions collectively known as advanced practice nurses, like nurse anesthetists, nursing administrator, or clinical nurse specialist, require a MSN."

Pack low-carb swiss chard wraps for lunch.",How to Get More Greens in Your Diet," You may be surprised that breakfast can be a great meal time to include a serving of greens. Get your day off to a healthy and nutritious start by tossing greens (raw or cooked) into some of your typical breakfast recipes.Sautéed greens work well as a base for poached or sunny side up eggs. They're also great mixed into scrambled eggs or into a frittata. Use olive oil to sauté the greens, and add a healthy fat.
If you love quick breakfasts, you can add sautéed greens into a breakfast burrito.Raw greens can be pureed into a breakfast smoothie or juiced for a glass of nutrient-dense vegetable juice.;
, Another way to add greens to your meals is by blending them into foods. Baked goods (both savory and sweet) are great vehicles to add greens to.When you puree or chop greens and add them to baked goods, it's an easy way to get in an extra hit of nutrition and boost the overall nutrient content of the food.
In addition, if you have any picky eaters in the house, blending greens into baked goods is a great way to sneak them.
You can add pureed or finely chopped greens into foods like: meatloaf, meatballs, lasagna, mac and cheese, casseroles, burritos or enchiladas, muffins and quick breads.

, One of the great qualities about greens is that they don't require a lot of cooking time — especially if you mix them into already hot foods and liquids. If you're making a batch of soup or stew, consider throwing a few handfuls of greens at the end of the cooking process. Tossing greens into soups and stews is a very quick and easy way to add more to your diet. They wilt very quickly and become soft and very tender.
You can add both frozen or raw, chopped greens into soups and stews. Both work very well; however, you'll need to add much more raw greens than frozen as these have already been cooked down.
Consider adding greens to soups or stews like: white bean soup, Italian wedding soup, beef and barley soup, vegetarian chili or chicken tortilla soup.

, Greens do have a unique flavor — some are spicy, some are bitter and some even are a little sweet. These flavors lend themselves well to different sauces or marinades.You don't always have to have greens as a salad or sautéed. They can add a lot of flavor to different sauces or marinades — just like herbs would.
To help dark greens blend seamlessly into different sauces or marinades, you'll need to puree them or process them in a food processor. Many times, as you're making the sauce or marinade, you'll need to use a food processor or blender. As you add in other ingredients, also add in your greens.
Ideas for dark greens include: pesto, chimichurri sauce, tomato sauce, salsa and salad dressings.

, It's always a great idea to look for ways to add more nutrition to each meal. Since greens are so nutrient-dense, adding these to common meals and dishes can help boost their overall nutrient content.

Think of foods where you could add a few vegetables or greens. Take advantage of that opportunity to add greens to your meals.
For example, you can add a hefty handful of greens to your sandwich, sub, hamburger or wrap.
You can also consider using dark greens (especially big leafy ones like kale or collard greens) as your actual wrap. Ditch the bread and use a nutrient-dense dark green for increased nutrition.
Other opportunities to add greens to dishes include: sautéed greens on top of pizza, wilted greens tossed into spaghetti and chopped greens into grain salads.

, Adding greens to your meals can be difficult — especially if you're in a rush when you're about to prepare meals. Make it easier to add greens to your diet by doing some prep work in advance.


When you get home from the grocery store, begin to do some prep work. You can have greens ready to go for meals during the week and save yourself some extra time.
Most greens, especially those that are coming from the farmers market or are bought in bulk, need to be thoroughly cleaned before using.Toss them in water and run them through a salad spinner in advance. You'll have cleaned and ready to go greens at your fingertips.
Also consider chopping or cutting up greens in advance. Once they are chopped, you can store them in the refrigerator to use whenever you're ready. Note that some greens will ned some special preparation — you'll need to remove the thick middle stem from collard greens, for instance. Simply fold the leaf in half, and cut down the stem.
Store your greens in a zip top bag in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. Cleaned greens will store well for a few days.

, Fresh greens are incredibly versatile. If they're prepped and ready to use, they're a great option to have on hand.


Stock up on fresh, raw greens weekly at the grocery store. Having them available is a easy way to either cook up a quick side dish or serve a salad.
There are many choices now in the grocery for greens that are already washed, chopped, and ready to use.
Fresh greens can be used in a pinch as a salad. You have to do little to no prep work with fresh greens. Tossed with some dressing (try olive oil and balsamic vinegar) and a lean protein, you have a great meal in a few minutes.

, Another option that can help you increase your intake of greens is by purchasing frozen greens. These are already cooked and chopped so they're ready to be reheated into meals.


Frozen vegetables are a great alternative to fresh. If you can't find fresh greens that look great at the store or market, consider purchasing frozen.
Frozen greens are minimally processed. They're generally picked at the peak of freshness, quickly cooked and frozen. In addition, unseasoned greens have no added seasonings or salt.Frozen greens keep well in the freezer. You can take out a small portion and reheat or cook as needed. They're also a great option if you need larger quantities of greens to wilt into soups, stews or use in baked goods.

, A simple trick to help you get in a serving of greens quickly, is by cooking greens in advance. This is especially great if you enjoy wilted or sautéed greens.


After you've washed and prepped your greens, consider wilting up a batch for the week. You'll have them to use in recipes or to serve as a simple side.
Wilted greens only take a few minutes to make. You can sauté them with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and any other seasonings you like.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you need them. Reheat them in a pan or microwave and you have a great serving of greens ready to eat.

, Start off your day with a punch of extra nutrition. Mix in your favorite greens into your morning scrambled for your first serving of these nutrient packed veggies.Start by heating a little bit of olive oil in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. Either add in 1/4 cup of frozen greens (like spinach) or 1 cup of fresh greens.
Cook the greens until they're wilted and heated through.
Crack one to two eggs into the pan and lightly scrambled them with a wooden spoon or spatula. Mix together until the eggs and greens are combined.
Cook your greens and eggs until the eggs are cooked through — about two to three minutes. Sprinkle on a little of your favorite cheese and serve.

, If you need a boost in the afternoon, blend up a fruit and greens smoothie. You'll never even know you've blended greens into these sweet drinks.


Start by adding 1/2 cup of either milk, water or 100% juice to the cylinder of a blender.
Then add in 1/2 cup of your favorite frozen fruit. You can do frozen berries, bananas or even mango. For more protein, add in 1/4 cup of greek yogurt.
Blend the smoothie for a few seconds until the ingredients just begin to combine. Then add in 1 cup of spinach or kale. Spinach is a little more sweet and less bitter than kale.
Blend again until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the drink has a smooth and creamy consistency. Drink immediately.

, If you enjoy crunchy, salty snacks, swap out your potato chips for kale chips. These are crispy and crunchy and will satisfy your afternoon snack craving.Start by preheating an oven to 350F. Also prep your kale. Wash and thoroughly dry each kale leaf.
Rip kale into chip-sized pieces or about the size of your palm. They'll shrink a little bit in the oven. Toss with some olive oil and your favorite spices (like salt and pepper or garlic and parmesan cheese).
Bake kale chips for about 15 minutes in the oven. Keep an eye on them because they can burn easily. Eat immediately!

, If you enjoy classic Caesar salads, you're bound to like a kale Caesar. Almost identical, this salad uses nutrient rich kale instead of romaine lettuce leaves.


Start by washing a bunch of kale. Tuscan or dino kale is a great version to use as it's a little more tender than curly leaf kale.Finely shred the kale leaves and toss with your favorite Caesar salad dressing. Allow the kale and dressing to sit together, mixed, for about 30 minutes. This helps tenderize the kale leaves.
Toss in toppings like shaved parmesan cheese, croutons and anchovies. Serve immediately.

, If you're watching your waistline or just want to try a different take on your lunchtime wrap, try using a lettuce leaf as a wrap. Big, dark greens are great for this.


Start by thoroughly washing one Swiss chard leaf (you could also use a collard green leaf). With a paring knife, gently and carefully cut out the thick rib or stem from the leaf and discard.
Spread about 1/4 cup of hummus on the leaf. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
Layer on 1/2 of thinly sliced avocado, 2 tablespoons of feta cheese, two to three slices of tomato and a few thin slices of cucumber.
Roll your lettuce wrap like you would a burrito. Cut in half and serve immediately.

Meet some future classmates.,
Familiarize yourself with the NCLEX exams.,
Set good study habits.,
Join or start a study group.,
Develop strong organizational skills.,
Take care of your logistical needs.",How to Prepare for Nursing School3," If your school hosts social events or get-togethers before classes start, plan to attend them. Nursing school can be stressful, and it will be helpful to have a set of peers who understand and can help you through the challenges you’ll face as a nursing student., Every nurse will need to pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) prior to working in the field. Review a study guide for the NCLEX before you start your studies and as you progress through school. This will help you understand the types of questions asked and the subjects that are featured on the exams.


There are different versions for registered nurses (NCLEX-RN) and licensed practical nurses (NCLEX-PN).
You will not have to worry about the NCLEX if you plan to become a CNA. CNAs do not take the NCLEX. They take a separate exam for CNAs.

, It is easy to become overwhelmed with the sheer volume of work involved in nursing school, as well as the wealth of knowledge you need to master. Schedule study time in your planner and develop good habits, like studying a little each day and reviewing your notes during your down time.Your professors will undoubtedly assign numerous chapters to read each week. Instead of trying to memorize all of them, focus more attention on the material covered in class.Keep in mind that you will using what you learn when treating patients. You may understand and master the material better if you think, “How will this information help me treat patients?”

, Your school may already have study groups set up, or you could form one with some friends. With a study group, you can compare notes, study for tests, and practice demonstrating skills.You will retain more knowledge and be less stressed if you study, either with a group or alone, on a regular basis rather than cram the night before exams., Nursing school involves learning a lot of material, sometimes in a short period of time. Since you will also be busy with other aspects of your life, you will need to figure out a way to remain organized and on top of things. Use either a daily planner, a wall calendar, or an online scheduling program to block out time for studying, projects, and all of the reading you will need to do.Use the alerts on your smart phone to keep track of upcoming exams and paper deadlines.
Keep all of your nursing gear in one place at home, so you always know where it is.
Organize other aspects of your life as well, like scheduling time for errands and household chores.

, Your outside life won’t stop just because you’re busy with nursing school. Be sure to have solid plans for your living arrangements, transportation, and income stream before starting your program.


If you can, live at home with your parents or find a roommate to share expenses with. This type of living situation can also be helpful because household chores won’t fall only on you.
If you plan to work during school, be upfront with your supervisor about your schedule. It will typically change every 8 weeks, so flexibility is a must for your job.

Be aware of the emotional issues you may face.,
Start or continue your exercise program.,
Remember to eat well, even when busy.,
Make a plan for managing stress.",How to Prepare for Nursing School4," Nursing school can be grueling and emotionally taxing, and these feelings can be amplified when you begin to deal with patients in your clinical rotations. Essential coping skills can include confiding in fellow students or a therapist if you become overwhelmed emotionally. Taking the time to find joy and humor each day, even if you’re surrounded by very sick patients, can help as well.Remind yourself that your patients are depending on you, and that you are impacting their lives in profound ways. This can be helpful on days that you feel sad or upset by your job.
Remember that even the best nursing care cannot solve every issue.

, Not only can exercise help relieve stress and anxiety, but it will also keep you in shape physically. Nursing school can involve physically taxing work, like lifting or moving patients. To keep in shape for these demands, you should aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise five times a week to reap the most benefits.Incorporate strength training, particularly for your core, and flexibility exercises into your routine to prepare you for the physical demands of lifting and moving patients.
Some students find it useful to combine study sessions with exercise, like comparing notes with a classmate while taking a walk or a job.

, On days when you’re rushing from class to clinicals, sitting down for a meal may be the last thing on your mind. But you won’t study effectively or treat patients well if you’re not properly nourished. Plan your meals on the weekend and then shop accordingly to help you have healthy food throughout the week.Keep healthy snacks on you at all times. Good options include granola bars, nuts, fresh or dehydrated fruits, and beef jerky.
You can turn some study sessions into healthy potluck gatherings.

, Be sure to plan enough time in your schedule for life outside of school, and incorporate things that make you happy into your daily life. The rigors of nursing school can be stressful, so you want to have outlets so you can bring your best self to school each day.Think about things that boost your mood, like taking time for a relaxing cup of coffee or tea or chatting with a friend. Remember to incorporate those into your days as often as possible to keep yourself emotionally healthy.
If possible, take advantage of a school break by getting away, even if it’s just a day trip. A change of scenery can be beneficial in clearing your mind and lifting your spirits.

Find out if there are any clinical trials in your region.,
Ask a cancer organization about trials.,
Ask the medical researchers about the treatment.,
Learn about the possible side effects.",How to Participate in T Cell Cancer Therapy Trials1," You should determine whether there are any T Cell cancer therapy trials in your country or region, since there are only a few major studies underway. Given the limited number of trials currently underway for this therapy and limited location sites (such as Britain and the United States), it could be difficult to secure participation in one of these trials., You should contact cancer specialists such as researchers, university medical departments or cancer support groups that focus on your specific type of cancer. Some of the support groups for specific types of cancer have information lines that will give you advice about clinical trials over the phone.For instance, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has an informational telephone line that offers advice for cancer patients. Call: 800-955-4572.You can search for National Cancer Institute supported clinical trials via their website at: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search

If there is a major university in your region, you could contact the medical department and inquire about any clinical trials underway at that institution.

, If you are getting chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy, the doctors will take blood from your body in order to extract T cells, which are sent to a laboratory. Your T-cells will then be genetically engineered to create more chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which will theoretically allow your body’s T cells to target tumor cells. After the CAR T-cells are multiplied in the lab, they will be reinserted into your body at the medical facility. Given the complexity of this treatment, you should ask your doctor about the details:“How long will I be at the hospital?”
“How much blood will be taken?”
“How long will I have to wait while my T-cells are at the lab?”
""How will it feel when the T-cells are reinserted back into my body?""

, You should be aware that T Cell cancer therapy trials can involve very serious side effects, which often take numerous medical experts to keep under control.Although research is underway to reduce the severity of side effects, you should know that this treatment option is only worthwhile if you have exhausted other options. If you choose it, you should know about some of the side effects. For instance, side effects of CAR T-Cell therapy include:Cytokine release syndrome, which can cause high fevers, low blood pressure, poor lung function and other serious symptoms.
B-cell aplasia, which destroys normal B cells in your blood.
Tumor Lysis syndrome, which is a life-threatening complication. This is a dangerous side effect but can be effectively managed.

Go through the informed consent process.,
Secure caregiver assistance for the duration of the trial.",How to Participate in T Cell Cancer Therapy Trials2," Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy remain central to the treatment of many cancers. Although research on T Cell cancer therapy is highly promising, this form of therapy has only recently undergone testing in humans and has not yet received federal approval in the U.S. So, you should make sure you have explored all of the standard treatment options for your type of cancer. Typically, doctors will only let you participate in these trials if all other options have been pursued with no success. Ask your doctor:""Have we explored all available treatment options for my cancer?”
“Do you think we’re at the point where I need to look at clinical trials?”

, Your doctor may have colleagues who are conducting T Cell cancer therapy, so you should ask them who they know and how you could get involved. Try asking:“Who do you know who is involved in T Cell cancer research?”
“Do you think you could help me enroll in a T Cell cancer therapy trial?”
“What are the risks of participating in one of these trials?”

, On a notepad or device, write down all of the possible benefits you can see from participating in the trial. Early research results are very promising on the effectiveness of T Cell cancer therapy.One of the benefits of participating in a trial is that you would be one of the first to benefit from a new and more effective cancer treatment. You may also receive the benefit of extra follow up treatment following the trial. In addition, you would be helping society find a cure for cancer., The downsides of participating in a clinical trial include the fact that the new treatment, T Cell therapy, may not be as good as older cancer treatments. In addition, even if the new treatment is better for most people, it may not be better for your body specifically. Finally, you may experience many specific side effects of T Cell cancer therapy such as cytokine release syndrome and B cell aplasia. It will also be pretty time intensive and emotionally exhausting. , You should weigh the benefits and risks of participating in T Cell cancer therapy trials, and then make an informed decision., If you weigh the benefits and risks and still want to participate in the T Cell cancer therapy trial, you will need to go through informed consent. Your doctor will tell you about all of the specific benefits and risks of the trial. You should ask any questions you have about the trial. Be curious and ask lots of questions about the benefits, risks, side effects and other details of participating in the trial., Find a professional caregiver to help you for the duration of the clinical trial. Although this is not always required by trials, it is a good precaution because of the intensity of these trials."

It allows you to help many people on a daily basis, and allows you to connect with people in a positive way.However, this degree of personal contact may not be for everyone. Think about whether or not you will be comfortable doing this type of work day in and day out.


Remember that you will possibly have to deal with customers who think that massage therapists provide “additional” services, which is certainly not the case. Ethics plays an important role in becoming a professional therapist, so be prepared to deal with this aspect of the work.
You should also keep in mind that massage therapists spend several hours each day on their feet. This can be very tiresome for some, so be prepared for this reality.;
, How much a massage therapist makes can vary based on a large number of factors. However, the median salary for this profession is about $18.00/hour. Is this enough to keep you in the lifestyle that you desire?Remember that how much you make also depends on how many customers you have, and that, depending on many factors, you may have more or fewer customers at different times throughout the year.
Keep in mind that money should not be the biggest reason for choosing a career. You should choose something that you feel passionate about, and that you would enjoy doing day in and day out. However, it is also important to have a realistic idea of whether or not you can live on a massage therapist salary.

, Massage therapists exist in many environments. Many open their own private practice, while others choose to work in other environments such as hospitals, therapy clinics, health clubs, or even on cruise ships.

Do you want to travel a lot? If so, doing something like working on a cruise ship will allow you to earn a living while also travelling the world.

, There are approximately 300 accredited programs in the United States.

Accreditation is provided by the United States Department of Education (USDE), but there are several additional accrediting bodies, which includes: the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA), the National Accrediting Commission of Cosmetology Arts and Sciences (NACCAS), the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT), and the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools (ABHES).In order to understand which accrediting body is most relevant for you, it is best to look at the requirements for the state in which you plan to work. You can find a list of the requirements for your state here.

, Most massage therapy programs will only require you to have a high school diploma, but some might prefer that you have additional experience with holistic medicine, anatomy, physiology, and/or biology.


Be sure to find out the minimum requirements of any program you are interested before applying. If you don’t meet the minimum requirements, you are likely wasting your time in applying.

, Before you choose a program, know how you will cover the costs. Depending on a range of factors, your program could cost you between $6,000 and $11,000 in order to achieve certification, and this may or may not include miscellaneous costs such as a massage table or text books.Many accredited programs are able to offer financial aid, so be sure to enquire about this with any programs you are potentially interested in.

, How long a program lasts will depend on how many hours of training you will receive during the program. Almost all states have a minimum number of training hours that typically ranges between 330 and 1,100 hours. This means that your program could take weeks or up to two years before you are qualified to work., Different programs may have different types of massage therapy that they focus on. While nearly all accredited programs will have core educational requirements that you must meet, if you are interested in a specific type of massage, search for a school that will help you meet your goals.


For example, if you are interested in sports massage, you might want to seek out a program that focuses on this type of massage, or that will allow you to take extra hours to specialize in this type of massage.

, Not only will you learn how to give a massage during your program, you will also learn other things. You will need to learn about human anatomy and physiology in order to do your job well, but you may also learn about how to run your own business, hygiene, professional ethics, limitations of massage therapy, etc.If at any point you find yourself struggling to be successful in your program, contact your teachers immediately. They can probably offer ways to help you understand, and keep up with any course work. If you fall seriously behind, and don’t ask for help, you may fail the program.

, Once you have completed your program, you will need to meet the licensure/certification requirements in your state. Nearly all US states have some requirements. Look for your states requirements here.In most cases, you will be required to take either the National Certification Exam in Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB) or the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLex), which is an exam administered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards.

, If you have never run a business before, it may be a good idea to work at an already established massage therapy clinic for a few months or years. This will give you a good idea about what to expect regarding the daily running of a massage therapy business.


There are many chain massage establishments, which are popping up all over the US. Search the internet for massage therapy in your city, and you will likely come across a few of them.

, Another way to gain some experience is to look for a position at a health club. Many health clubs offer massage as part of their membership.


This might be particularly interesting for you if you are interested in doing massage for athletes. Although not everyone who gets a massage at a health club is an athlete, you may come across more clients who use massage as part of a sports injury recovery program.

, Although probably the most work-intensive option, opening your own business will allow you a lot of control over when you work, how much money you earn, and what kind of services you offer.


Be aware though, that you will need to spend significant time getting your business set up. Massage therapists will face many of the same challenges as other small business owners, in addition to other requirements of the state, such as health certificates, health inspections, etc.

Uterine massages aren't necessary for everyone, though. Talk to your obstetrician, doula, or other birthing professional about when and why they would recommend a uterine massage.Massage will typically be recommended if you had a long or complicated active labor, or if you lose more blood than anticipated during and immediately after labor.
Massages may also occur every fifteen minutes or so for the first two to three hours after birth to help the uterus contract down.;
, Work with your birthing professional well in advance of your due date to create a medication plan to go along with your birthing plan. This way you will know well in advance if you anticipate being put on any medications that make uterine massage ineffective. Uterine massage is not recommended after childbirth if you received prophylactic oxytocin.There is little evidence to suggest sustained uterine massage would be harmful for those who received oxytocin. It simply may not be effective, and may cause some discomfort.Be prepared to be flexible with your medication plan. If complications arise during your delivery that necessitate extra treatment, it may be necessary to change what medications you receive.

, A uterus massage isn’t the same type of massage that you might get for your shoulders or back. It typically involves your delivery professional placing one hand up the birth canal and the other on top of your uterus on the outside of your body. They may then either compress the area for a few minutes, or use back-and-forth motions to massage the area.Ask your birthing professional about which technique their staff practices and why. Get as much information as you feel you need to help you become comfortable with this process.
Some doulas and midwives may practice other forms of uterine massage that come down through vernacular traditions. There is little scientific evidence either for or against such treatments. Discuss the process and potential pros and cons prior to giving birth.

, The realities of childbirth are that you will probably do this during labor and may not even realize it, but if you don’t, try to find a way to empty your bladder prior to massage. A full bladder may push the uterus off to the side, which makes the massage process both uncomfortable and ineffective., Uterine massages may take place immediately after birth, or may take places several minutes to several hours after delivery. Subsequently, it is a good idea to practice deep breathing and muscle relaxation immediately prior to and during the massage. Relax your muscle and take slow, calm breaths to help with the potential discomfort.If you still have a pain management drug such as your epidural in your system, you may not notice any discomfort.

, If your birthing professional opts to perform a uterine massage, trust that there is a good reason for it.It may cause some discomfort, but it is important that you allow your birthing team to perform the massage as they see necessary, since it could help keep you healthy and safe after birth., Just as you did through labor, you may choose to have a partner with you during the after-birth process, including the massage. Hold their hand or ask them to distract you to provide some comfort during the massage process.

, Your birthing professional may encourage you to massage your abdomen in the hours and days after birth. If, however, they do not directly tell you that you should self-massage, consult them before starting to do so.There may be a reason your birthing professional would not encourage self-massage. It is always important to consult with them first, or you could risk unnecessary pain and damage to your uterus.

, Once you're flat on your back, place your flat palms on your abdomen at about where your belly button is located. If your uterus is hard, meaning that you feel resistance when you press down, you should not need to massage the area. If the area is soft and you feel little resistance, a massage may be recommended., Take one hand and cup it slightly. Slowly move it in a circular motion over your lower abdomen. Do this until you feel your uterus contract.


The uterus should feel firm when it contracts. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it will not last too long., Your birthing professional will work with you to determine how many times a day you should massage your abdomen, and for how long. Follow their recommendations, and let them know if you experience any extreme pain or heavy bleeding during the massage.

Eat more slowly.,
Take a brief walk.,
Sip some herbal tea.,
Drink some water.",How to Recover from Eating Too Much1," Eating slowly and in a relaxed atmosphere will help you digest your food more comfortably, giving your digestive enzymes more time to break down the food. Chewing your food thoroughly not only chops it down into more easily digestible chunks, but the more time it is in your mouth the more contact it will have with the saliva which begins your body’s digestive work.Eat at a more sedate pace, and make meals a social occasion and opportunity to chat and catch up with family and friends.
If you are talking, you will eat more slowly and your digestion will be smoother and easier.;
, After a big meal you will probably feel like having a lie down and maybe a nap, but the evidence suggests that taking a short walk for fifteen or twenty minutes is a great way to aid digestion. After heavy eating your blood sugar will generally rise and then fall, and going for a walk after eating can help you stabilise your blood sugar levels.


A walk a little after eating can help you clear the glucose from your blood and get you feeling back to normal., Various herbal teas can be good digestive aids. Ginger tea is an especially good choice. You can make it from a ginger tea bag, or by placing a few slices of ginger root in a cup of boiling water. Some other teas to try that promote good digestion include chamomile, peppermint, and cinnamon.You can add a few squeezes of lemon and shakes of cayenne pepper to ginger tea to make a concoction that will help speed up your metabolism, and tackle your bloated feeling.
The cayenne pepper can help quicken your metabolism, while the lemon helps you feel less bloated., Drinking water after a meal can help you feel a bit refreshed, but it can also help your digestion. The water can aid the passage of the food through your digestive system. Drink a glass around twenty minutes after you have finished eating.Consider drinking a cup of hot water rather than cold water."
"
Try to relax.,
Do some stretches.,
Cut out carbohydrates from your next meal.",How to Recover from Eating Too Much2," After eating a large meal try not to give yourself a hard time. It’s very common to overeat occasionally, especially at big occasions such as holidays and birthdays. Try to relax and allow your body to get on with digesting the food. Follow a quick walk and a cup of ginger tea with some time spent just relaxing on the sofa.

, One way to try to relax after a big meal and stabilise your system is to perform some simple yoga stretches.Some gentle stretching can help calm your body and ease digestion. Start by sitting on the floor in with your legs crossed, and then slowly turn to your left and hold. Take five deep breaths and then turn your body back to the centre. Twist to your right, hold, and take five deep breaths.Do this a few times, but don’t push too hard. Keep the movements slow and controlled and concentrate on your breathing.

, If you have eaten a large meal that contained a significant amount of carbohydrates, you can help avoid storing too much of that as fat, but cutting the carbs out of your next meal. For example, if you have a big meal in the evening, have a carbohydrate-free breakfast in the morning.Go for some fruit with yoghurt rather than bread or breakfast cereal."

Evaluate whether you binge eat regularly.,
Consider the causes of Binge Eating Disorder.,
Seek help if you suspect you may suffer from BED.",How to Recover from Eating Too Much3," Occasional binge eating is normal and most people eat too much every now and again, but if you find you are binge eating regularly you may be damaging your health. If you feel compelled to binge eat, you may have an eating disorder which can be diagnosed and treated. The characteristics and symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder include:Feeling powerless to stop eating, or out of control of your eating.
Frequent episodes of uncontrollable eating.
Feeling very distressed or upset during or after binge eating.
No regular attempts to vomit after eating, as occurs in those who suffer from bulimia.

, The exact causes of BED are unknown, but there are thought to be a number of potential contributory factors. It is thought that those who suffer from BED are often depressed, or have been depressed in the past. People struggling with their emotions sometimes binge eat, as do some people who are dieting, or skipping meals.


There is also thought to be biological factor. The disorder can often appear in several members of the same family, and there may be a genetic influence., Lots of people overeat, and just because you do this doesn’t mean that you have an eating disorder. If you binge regularly or excessively, however, you should visit your doctor. It is especially important to do this if your eating is making you feel depressed, or impacting your physical or mental health.Your doctor will ask you about your eating habits and your general wellbeing.
A doctor can make a diagnosis and may refer to a counsellor, psychiatrist or psychologist.
You may also work with a nutritionist who helps you devise a meal plan.
The underlying causes of BED may also be treated with SSRIs or anticonvulsant medications.
Sometimes, bariatric surgery (such as gastric bypass surgery) can sometimes be helpful for those with BED.

Carrots, garlic, and spinach contain beta carotene, and Vitamin E.;
, Drinking plenty of water can raise immunity levels in your body. Water flushes toxins out of your blood and helps with the digestion of food.Water also helps the body produce lymph, which carries white blood cells around your body to flight illness.
Your body also uses water to clean your eyes and body to keep away any disease-causing microbes.

, Yogurt is especially good for boosting your immune system. However, dairy products can be detrimental to your immune system, so don’t consume too much milk and cheese.


Yogurt contains probiotics, which strengthen the immune system and can help you fight off colds., You can find complete protein in foods such as eggs, fish, and shellfish. These proteins can help build the amino acids in your body.These proteins are better for you than fatty proteins and red meat, which can also have negative effects on your immune system.

, Oats and barley, in particular, can boost your immunity and may make antibiotics work more effectively. Whole wheat foods can also be beneficial in contrast to breads with less rich substance.Whole grains contain benzoxazinoids or BX, which is a substance that can boost your immune system by subduing bacteria., Drinks like artificially sweetened juice and cola can dehydrate you. Unlike water, these drinks act like food and need water to remove excess waste left over after digestion.Sugary drinks can compromise your immune system. They act against white blood cells as soon as the excess sugar reaches your blood stream., Alcohol can actually suppress your immune system, especially during any binges or when you are already sick. Chronic alcohol use can also lead to long-term diseases.Moderate alcohol use, such as a daily glass of red wine, can improve your immune system. However, that's often because of the other chemicals in alcoholic beverages and not the alcohol itself."

Go for baobab.,
Try spirulina.,
Buy flax seed powder.,
Try camu powder.,
Consider acai powder.",How to Use Superfood Powders1," There are two choices when deciding on a superfood powder. You can take a single ingredient powder, like maca, spirulina, or flax seed powder. You may also choose a powder that combines multiple vitamins, minerals, and superfoods together into one powder.Multi-ingredient powders often contain vegetables, like spinach, broccoli, and wheatgrass.

See why you should supplement with Omega 3~6~9.,
Seek the best source of Omega 3~6~9, as per the directions in Choose Fish Oil Supplements.,
Understand that taking Omega 3~6~9 (which is available as one capsule) will feel like ""speed"", with none of the ill effects in the proper dosage.,
In the absence of sufficient Omega-3, your body will use whatever it can, resulting in poor cell wall formation.,
Understand the argument against supplementing with Omega 3~6~9.",How to Supplement Your Diet with Omega Acids," Most Americans, at least, are vastly disconnected from their hereditary (grass~fed beef and chickens, eggs, cold water fatty fish) sources of Omega 3. If your body isn't getting enough Omega 3, it is going to be sending you ""hunger"" signals constantly.;
, With the understanding that any is better than none (and, that there are more sources of Omega 3 than just fish oil, although it is largely preferred).


It never hurts to vary your sources, and probably the cheapest way to supplement with Omega 3~6~9, other than a powdered, whole~food vitamin, is to take cod liver oil, and use olive oil daily.

, This stuff is powerful, and label directions should be followed.


Caffeine impact will be affected, as per label directions, when included with Omega 3~6~9.
The recommended dosages on the label are typically pretty high unless taken with a fatty food, which will ameliorate heart ""flutters""; this stuff is best taken with a good breakfast, especially at first.
As indicated on the label, if you take this too late in the day, you won't sleep that night. There is an adjustment period for many people; thinner people seem to notice more pronounced effects, and Omega 369 will help normalize the weight of skinny people, also.

A dim memory, now, is not sleeping great the first few nights in transitioning onto this stuff, period~and, feeling so juiced otherwise, it didn't matter! In a year, you'll be able to gulp a cap down right before bed, and sleep like a baby.



, If your cells can't ""breathe"" well, nutrients can't get in as well, and waste can't get out, resulting in greatly reduced health. Mitochondrial output decreases. The way your body metabolizes cholesterol is also directly affected, and many other bodily process deficiencies are now being linked to Omega 3 (and Vitamin D) deficiency.


It takes about seven years to replace every cell in your body, and your entire body is just a collection of cells. However, damage occurs in each renovation due to chemicals and sunburn damage.

, These arguments seem to pertain mostly to Omega 3, and revolve around vitamin A and D toxicity from ingesting too much; but this is pretty rare. Supplementing with Omega 3~6~9 combo should largely ameliorate these concerns, as the effects are quite marked, up to the recommended dosage.

Purchase snacks that come in single-serving portions.,
Consider getting a healthy snack subscription box.",How to Store Healthy Snacks in Your Work Desk," It’s always a good idea to have some cutlery in your desk drawer so you’re prepared to eat a snack when the mood strikes. Plastic utensils work well for many foods, but if you prefer harder snacks that you usually cut, such as apples, you may want to include a sharp knife to make cutting easier.Most snacks can be eaten with your hands, but you may need a spoon for oatmeal and cereal. A butter knife comes in handy for covering crackers and other items with spreads or cutting soft items, such as cheese.
You may want to include some paper plates and napkins in your drawer as well.;
, If there are certain seasonings or spices that you often use on your snacks, keep them in your snack drawer too. For example, you might throw in a few packets of black pepper or include a container of cinnamon to sprinkle over snacks.If you enjoy having salad as a snack, you may want to keep a bottle of olive oil or vinegar in your desk.

, Peanut butter and other nut butters, such as almond or cashew butter, can make a healthy snack because they’re high in protein and can fill you up quickly. Best of all, they can be stored at room temperature, so you easily keep a jar in your desk drawer.For the healthiest option, choose a natural nut butter. It won’t have as much sugar as highly processed versions.
You can spread nut butter on crackers, rice cakes, and fruit slices, or even eat a spoonful straight from the jar.

, Crackers and rice cakes are easy to store in a desk drawer as long as you keep them in airtight packaging. They also pair well with nut butters, hummus, and other healthy spreads. Choose whole grain or vegetable-based crackers for the healthiest option, and opt for unflavored rice cakes to keep the sugar and sodium low.Mini rice cakes are often the best option when you’re trying to eat healthy because you can control your portion more easily.
It’s a good idea to divide crackers and rice cakes into portions ahead of time rather than storing them in a sleeve or bag. That will reduce your risk of eating more than one serving size at a time. Buy small packets or use plastic containers to divide them yourself.

, You might think of oatmeal as a healthy breakfast, but it can also be a filling, healthy snack. Keep a few packets of plain, instant oatmeal, which has less sugar, in your desk. You can mix it up in a mug and use the office microwave to heat it.If plain oatmeal seems too bland, sprinkle a little cinnamon over it for added flavor.
You can also mix dried fruit and nuts into the oatmeal to dress it up.

, Granola and protein bars can be a healthy, satisfying snack, and they are very easy to toss in your desk drawer. Just be sure to read the labels and only choose bars with whole food ingredients, such as nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.If you have a difficult time controlling your portions, only keep enough granola or proteins bars in your desk for the week. That may help deter you from overeating.

, If you enjoy healthy snacks that are perishable, such as fruit, veggies, and cheese, there’s no way to safely keep them in a desk drawer. Instead, purchase a small, insulated cooler that you can keep under or beside your desk to stash your snacks.Other perishable, healthy snacks that you might keep in a cooler include yogurt, hummus, and cottage cheese.
Keep in mind that coolers are only designed to keep items cold for a day or two at most. As a result, you can’t store your snacks in it indefinitely. It’s best to only bring enough perishable snacks for that day rather than try to stock the cooler for the week.
To ensure that they keep your snacks cold, it’s a good idea to chill the cooler itself before you pack it with snacks. If it fits in the refrigerator, you can chill it in there. Otherwise, add some ice and let it sit overnight.
Depending on your workplace, you might see if you could bring in a mini fridge that could be shared with co-workers. Label and date any snacks that store inside.

, Ice is usually too messy to keep the perishable snacks in your desk cooler cold all day. Instead, add some cold packs to the cooler to help keep the food chilled. The packs are filled with a water or refrigerant gel or liquid, and you simply freeze them in your freezer overnight so they’re ready to go to work in the cooler in the morning.If you don’t have any cold packs, freeze a bottle or two of water in your freezer overnight. Toss them in the cooler and they’ll help keep your snacks cool all day.

, Fruit makes a very healthy snack that can often satisfy a sweet craving. However, to ensure that it stays fresh in your desk at work, it’s best to opt for fruits that can be eaten whole, such as apples, bananas, oranges, berries, grapes, plums, and apricots.You don’t have to keep bananas, apples or oranges in a cooler, many fruits are usually fine at room temperature as long as they are not too ripe.
Berries, grapes, plums, and apricots are best kept cold.

, If you like snacking on vegetables, it’s best to choose vegetables that aren’t too juicy so you can cut them ahead of time and they’ll stay fresh in a cooler. Carrots, peppers, celery, and broccoli are good options. Avoid slicing tomatoes and cucumbers because they tend to get mushy if you cut them ahead of time.If you like tomatoes as a healthy snack, opt for small grape or cherry tomatoes that you can eat whole.
Vegetables that you can leave whole, such as snap peas and fresh green beans, are also good options for work snacks.

, Plastic bags with airtight zippers are ideal for storing snacks that aren’t particularly fragile.Consult the packaging for your snacks to determine the appropriate serving size, and fill the bags with that amount so you know exactly how much you’re eating.You can store items in a plastic zippered bag in your desk drawer or in the cooler that you keep at your desk.

, There are many healthy snacks that fit well in plastic bags and won't be crushed if you throw the bag in your drawer or cooler with other items. Dried fruits, nuts, and seeds are all ideal options, as are small whole fruits, such as berries and grapes, or cut vegetables.Dried fruits that you may want to snack on from plastic bags include raisins, dried cranberries, figs, and apricots. They don’t have to be kept cold.
Nuts that you may want to snack on from plastic bags include almonds, walnuts, pistachios, or cashews. They can be stored at room temperature
Seeds also store well in plastic bags at room temperature and can make a healthy snack. Try sunflower or pumpkins seeds.
You can also mix your favorite nuts, dried fruit, and seeds to create your own healthy trail mix to snack on.
If you're storing fruit or vegetables in plastic bags, it's best to keep them in your cooler.

, Some softer snacks may get crushed in your desk drawer or cooler if you store them in plastic bags. For items such as berries, grapes, and small tomatoes, choose hard plastic containers that will protect the foods while keeping them airtight.Make sure to wash your plastic containers daily to prevent any possible contamination of your snacks.

, If you plan to bring multiple snacks to work and don’t want them to mix together, opt for a bento style storage box. Bento boxes are traditionally used for separating the components of a Japanese meal, so lunch boxes inspired by them have dividers that form compartments to sort your snacks.For example, you might store nuts, fruit, and cottage cheese in your bento box and place it in your desk cooler to stay fresh for your afternoon snack at work.

, If you're busy, you may not have time to portion your snacks yourself. Fortunately, you can find many healthy snacks that come in smaller bags or containers so you only get one serving, which keeps you from eating too much.Many single-serving snacks are divided into portions based on the calorie count. For example, it might be a 100-calorie pack of crackers.
Nuts, whole grain crackers, and pretzels are just some of the healthy single-serving packaged snack options.

, These subscription boxes tend to have snacks already portioned into serving sized packages. You might even have the box sent directly to your office."

Get enough sleep every night.,
Avoid sleep deprivation.,
Take a walk or have moderate exercise on a regular basis.,
Make sure to not overdo exercising.",How to Improve Your Immunity3," Sleep helps to restore your body and keep your immune system strong. Keeping your body well rested will help you to stay healthy. The amount of sleep you need depends upon your age. Younger children and teenagers need more than 7-9 hours of sleep, whereas people over 55 often need less. On average, it's best to sleep 7-9 hours per night.

, When you don't get enough sleep, your T-cells go down. This can make it easier for you to catch a cold or the flu.Lack of sleep can make it more likely you'll get a fever as well.
Sleep deprivation can make vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, less effective in preventing illness.

, Exercise decreases your risk for heart disease, flushes out bad toxins, and helps white blood cells circulate at a higher rate. It can also help reduce hormones associated with stress.If you're at a healthy weight, try to get 15-30 minutes of moderate exercise a day. For people who are overweight, it may be useful to get more exercise, since excess weight can suppress your immune system., Too much exercise can actually temporarily hurt your immune system.Since your body needs to recover from intense exercise, your immune system's defenses may not be as strong after more strenuous exercise.If you're just had an intense workout, like a marathon, stay away from anybody who is sick, since you are more susceptible after exercising.
Anytime you feel a little ill, stay away from intense exercise. It may make you more likely to become ill if you ignore your body's warning and work out anyway.

Determine whether you worry excessively about everyday things, or things beyond your control.,
Examine your sleeping habits.,
Determine whether you have irrational fears or phobias about situations that are otherwise viewed as common or normal.,
Verify whether you have muscle tension, or tightness in your back, neck, and shoulders.,
Consider whether you frequently experience chronic indigestion.,
Ask yourself whether you feel self-conscious in everyday public settings.,
Determine whether you’ve recently experienced a panic attack.,
Consider whether you constantly strive for perfection in all aspects of your life.,
Ask yourself whether you obsess about certain thoughts, tasks, or situations until you feel they become resolved.,
Determine whether you exhibit one or more physical signs of anxiety on an ongoing basis.,
Find out whether you’re experiencing any health problems that could be causing your anxiety.,
Meet with your healthcare provider to seek a professional opinion in regards to whether you suffer from anxiety.",How to Know if You Have Anxiety," For example, if you worry about your safety every time you drive a car, or worry about whether you can complete all tasks before leaving work at the end of every day, you may be suffering from anxiety.;
, If you have anxiety, you may have difficulty falling asleep at night, or wake up one or more times throughout the night as a result of thinking about things that worry you. Having a restless night of sleep may be considered normal if you have a job interview the next day or are anticipating an exciting event. However, staying awake due to worrying about problems is a sign of anxiety.

, For example, if you worry about having to talk to people in a social setting, or are scared about having to leave your home, you may suffer from anxiety, or a specific type of anxiety disorder, such as social anxiety or agoraphobia.

, Signs of muscle tension are often associated with anxiety since your body naturally tenses up in times of stress, especially if you tend to clench your jaw and fists. If you’re unsure whether you’re suffering from muscle tension, consider making an appointment with a chiropractor, massage therapist, or healthcare provider for an examination, and to ease your muscle tension.

, If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, bloating, gas, diarrhea, cramping, constipation, or related symptoms, it’s possible you’re also suffering from anxiety.

, Anxiety in a social setting is often classified as social anxiety disorder, which is when you feel that everyone is watching and judging you based on your appearance and actions. If you constantly feel self-conscious when spending time in public, you may have anxiety., A panic attack is classified as sudden emotions of fear and helplessness, and is often accompanied by physical symptoms such as breathing problems, shaking, sweating, dizziness, and chest pain. Having one panic attack may not indicate that you suffer from anxiety, but experiencing one or more panic attacks on a regular basis could indicate anxiety.

, This is called perfectionism, which is a mind-set in which you constantly judge yourself and are too hard on yourself when you feel you’ve done something wrong or made a mistake. If you constantly strive for perfection, or frequently feel upset or disappointed when things in your life aren’t “perfect,” you may be suffering from anxiety.

, Being obsessive about things on a regular basis can indicate you suffer from anxiety, or an anxiety disorder known as obsessive-compulsive disorder. For example, if your car stereo breaks or malfunctions, and you spend hours trying to resolve the problem while feeling panicked about fixing it, you may have anxiety.

, Anxiety can affect your body physically in addition to mentally. Common physical symptoms of anxiety include an increased heart rate, rapid breathing or hyperventilation, trembling, sweating, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation, and feeling weak, tired, or fatigued. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine whether your physical symptoms are related to anxiety, or to another underlying cause., Examples of health problems that have been linked to anxiety include diabetes, heart disease, asthma, thyroid problems, drug abuse or withdrawal, irritable bowel syndrome, tumors, premenstrual syndrome, or withdrawal from certain medications. Anxiety is also a common side effect of many prescribed medications. If anxiety is being caused by prescription medications, talk to your healthcare provider about a different course of treatment that doesn’t require medication.

, Your physician, psychiatrist, or therapist can perform an examination and speak with you to help determine whether you suffer from anxiety or an anxiety disorder. If you are diagnosed with anxiety, your healthcare provider can recommend the proper course of treatment to help resolve and lessen anxiety problems.

Add the powder to a smoothie.,
Try the powder in a juice.,
Sprinkle the powder over food.",How to Use Superfood Powders2," One of the most common ways people take superfood powder is by adding them to smoothies. Some of the powders, like spirulina, have unpleasant tastes by themselves. Adding it to a fruit smoothie can help mask the flavor while providing additional nutrients.Make sure your smoothie is healthy. Add fresh fruits instead of canned or fruit in heavy syrup. If you want a dairy element, try Greek yogurt or low-fat milk. Don’t add sugar-filled juices or ice cream.

, If you are into juicing, you may want to add the the superfood powder into your fresh juice. After juicing your fruits and vegetables, stir in your superfood powder. The taste of the powder should blend in with the taste of your juice.If you purchase juice, you can blend it in with that, too. Just make sure you are buying 100% natural juice without added sugars to get the most health benefits.

, Another way you can get your daily teaspoon or tablespoon of superfood powder is to sprinkle it over your meals and snacks. Try maca or acai powder over yogurt, or sprinkle some baobab over your cereal or oatmeal.You may want to try adding the powder to quinoa, sprinkling it on top of vegetables, or mixing it into your soups.
Some powders, such as spirulina, are delicious when sprinkled over fresh-popped popcorn. Popcorn is a whole grain, so if you prepare it without adding salt or fat (butter), it is a very healthy snack.

Start with smaller doses.,
Take around a tablespoon each day.,
Be consistent.,
Be aware of the price.",How to Use Superfood Powders3," Though most superfood powders have few known side effects, they should be taken in moderation. You never want to take too much of a superfood powder. All of the nutrition benefits can be absorbed with a smaller dose. When you begin adding them to your diet, start with smaller doses.Starting with ½ teaspoon once or twice each day is advisable.

, After you have taken superfood powders for awhile, you can take between two teaspoons to a full tablespoon each day. It is not recommended to take more than a tablespoon each day, as too much can cause problems in your gut, such as gastrointestinal distress.If you are taking multiple superfood powders, stick to one or two each day.
You may want to take the supplements for a few days, then not take them for a few days. This can help you avoid taking too much.

, When you choose a superfood powder, make sure to read the label. It will provide suggestions on how to take the powder, how often to take it, and what dosage to take. You shouldn’t just be consistent with how you take the powder, but also with how often you take.Don’t just take the powder a few times and then forget about it. Even if you don’t take it every day, get on a schedule. For example, you may follow the recommended dosage on the label and take two teaspoons. You may do this every other day.

, Superfood powders range from approximately $20 to $150 per bottle. Powders are expensive because it takes a lot of the item (e.g., acai berries) to dry and grind into powder. You get a much higher dose of nutrients from the powder than you would from the whole food. Marketing costs also drive up the prices of superfood powders. However, most powders for 100 to 300 grams range from around $20 to $40.When choosing a bottle of superfood powder, you can research the cost of the ingredients to get a rough idea of how much it might cost to make the powder. Most powders cost $5-$25 to make.
Look at the size of the bottle. Larger bottles are going to be more expensive than smaller bottles. Determine the cost per serving so you can do a comparison to other brands.
Compare and shop around. You may find that some brands are unnecessarily expensive for no reason, or that a cheaper brand does not have the same amount of nutrients as others.

Define fiber by type.,
Know what foods contain insoluble and soluble fiber.,
Identify key components of food that contribute to soluble and insoluble fiber.",How to Understand the Difference Between Soluble and Insoluble Fiber," Total fiber, according to the Institute of Medicine, should be broken into two categories, functional fiber and dietary fiber.


Functional fiber is a carbohydrate that is not digested and has physiological health benefits, such as blood sugar stability. Functional fiber can come from plant or animal sources or it can be synthetic. Some examples of functional fiber are gums, pectins, polydextrose and inulin.
Dietary fiber is composed of a carbohydrate and lignin (non-carbohydrate or woody components of fruits or vegetables; cellulose is an example of a lignin) that are not digested by the body and are not used for energy. Dietary fiber is also known as roughage and helps with elimination of waste and the bulking of stools. Soluble and insoluble fiber are two categories of dietary fiber. The Institute of Medicine recommends 14 g of fiber per 1000 calories to get the maximum health benefits from fiber.
Soluble fiber is dietary fiber that will dissolve in liquid. It will form a gel in the body that has been linked to the slowing of fat absorption and the feeling of fullness. Some of the soluble fibers are more viscous than others and form thicker gels, which work very well at the slowing of fat absorption and the formation of fat to an extent. Some of the health benefits of soluble fiber are regulated blood glucose levels, lower LDL cholesterol, and lower risk of heart disease. With the exception of psyllium fiber, it does not have a laxative effect.
Insoluble fiber is dietary fiber that does not dissolve easily in liquid or form a gel. It does add bulk to stool to ease the passing of waste and it also helps food digest and pass through intestines and stomach quicker. Insoluble fiber has a laxative effect. Some health benefits of insoluble fiber include a lower risk of heart disease and regulation of caloric intake.;
, There are many foods that contain fiber, including all whole fruits and vegetables, but the amounts of insoluble and soluble fiber may vary. Since this information does not have to be listed on the nutrition facts panel it is useful to know keys foods containing each type of fiber.


Soluble fiber can be found in, but is not limited to, nuts, whole wheat flours, peas, oats, bran, citrus, apple, strawberry and barley.
Insoluble fiber can be found in, but is not limited to, cabbage, carrots, apple skin, beets, potato skin, whole wheat, sweet potatoes, turnips, brussel sprouts and cauliflower.

, Since many foods contain fiber, it is important to know the key attributes in a food that is high in fiber. Most foods containing fiber contain both soluble and insoluble fiber to certain degrees, with some having a higher degree of one fiber or the other.


The food is a whole grain, nut, legume or seed. These foods contain both soluble and insoluble fibers. Be sure to purchase 100% whole grain when buying ready to eat products. With whole grains, nuts or seeds it can be more beneficial to purchase these already ground because they are often harder for the body to digest completely, and, in order to get the benefit from the fiber, they must be small enough to participate in biochemical processes.
The food looks fibrous. Foods like sweet potatoes and carrots look very fibrous. This is good indication that the food is high in fiber.
The food is a whole fruit or vegetable. Processed fruits and vegetables tend to retain soluble nutrients, but lose the fiber. The best way to get the fiber from fruits and vegetables is to eat them whole. They don’t have to be raw and frozen whole vegetables work just as well as fresh.
The food becomes soft and creates a “sauce” when cooked. Foods like beans, oats and rice contain starch and fiber that are responsible for the creamy consistency. This is a good indication the food will be high in soluble fiber.
The food is a fruit, vegetable or whole grain and does not dissolve readily in your mouth. A good example of this is potato skin; it is edible, but requires extra chewing. The same is true for many fruits, like pears and apples. This is a good indication the food contains fair amounts of insoluble fiber.
Many processed foods have added fiber, either to replace what was lost during processing or add extra health benefits. If these foods do not state added fiber on the label, check the nutrition facts panel and ingredient statement to find out. The food should contain 1 or more g of dietary fiber. This can be naturally occurring or it can be added. The added fiber is considered functional fiber, but may also be classified as dietary fiber. Some of the added fibers, that are mostly soluble, are cellulose, gums (guar gum, carrageenan, etc.), inulin, and pectin. Some of the added fibers, that are mostly insoluble, are polydextrose and bran.

Be forgiving to yourself.,
Avoid ""recovering"" by being overly restrictive and strict.,
Do something positive and motivating for yourself.,
Talk it out.,
Get back to appropriate portion sizes.,
Cook satisfying meals and snacks at home.,
Drink enough water.,
Get back on the scale — but only two days later.,
Get extra sleep.,
Clean out the fridge.,
Avoid becoming overly hungry.,
Go for a quick workout.,
Have an eating plan in mind before your event.,
Remove yourself from the food.",How to Recover After Overeating During Big Events," The absolute first step to take after overeating is to forgive yourself and continue to be forgiving to yourself.Everyone slips up on occasion and either eats something really high calorie or overindulges and eats too much.


Remind yourself that you're only human. You'll make mistakes on occasion and that's perfectly OK. It's unrealistic to expect that you'll never make these types of mistakes.
Treat yourself like a friend. What would you say to a friend in your situation? Instead of engaging in harsh, negative self-talk, talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend.
On the same note, also be positive. It's not a good idea to say negative, mean or degrading things to yourself for making the mistake. This may make you feel worse and encourage you to continue to overeat.Instead of, ""Well that was really dumb."" Say something like, ""Although I overate, I enjoyed all the food I had and am excited to get back on track with my next meal."";
, Another thing to avoid doing after overeating is being overly restrictive with yourself or setting up strict rules or guidelines.This can seriously backfire and set you up for another slip-up.


Skipping meals or eating overly small portions is too restrictive and not a healthy behavior to indulge in. It's counterproductive to your goal. If you skip or do not eat enough, you'll feel more hungry and more tempted to eat larger portions or junk food.Force yourself to get back onto a regular healthy eating track. Always eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and make sure portions are appropriate. For example, foregoing your typical spinach salad with grilled chicken and vegetables at lunch for a small yogurt is too restrictive.

, If you're feeling down about overeating at a big event, consider doing something positive for yourself to help get your spirits up.


If you're feeling angry, depressed, sad, guilty or embarrassed, try engaging in activities that can help relax you and make you feel happy. This will help encourage you to get back on track.
Try doing some sort of activity that's relaxing and enjoyable. Maybe take a hike with friends, go for a walk with your dog or go out dancing. You'll be getting in some physical activity while making yourself feel better.
Physical activity can help release endorphins in your system. Endorphins are a group of hormones in the brain that help us feel good. If you are in a foul mood, go for a walk, a run, a bike ride to feel better! It is a natural and safe anti-depressant, anti-anxiety fix.
You may also want to consider buying yourself new music for a workout playlist, a new workout shirt or outfit to get you motivated and excited to get back to physical activity.
In addition, maybe going to the grocery store and stocking up on fresh, nutritious foods can get you motivated to cook healthy meals at home.

, It's no surprise that talking to others can help you feel supported and encouraged after overeating at a big event. Talk to your support group to help you get back on track and recover.


Studies have shown that going through weight loss or trying to maintain a healthy weight is easier when you have a support group.Talk to your family, friends or coworkers about your slip-up and how you're planning to get yourself back on track.
You can also journal. Although this isn't ""talking"" per say, writing out your thoughts and feelings about your recent overeating episode may make you feel a bit better.
Seek out the help of a behavioral specialist or therapist if needed. If you find yourself having more difficulty getting back on track and recovering after a big event, consider getting more advice and guidance from a therapist.
At times depression and anxiety can present themselves in ongoing feelings of anger, loss of motivation, lack of enjoyment, or feelings of hopelessness.

, After overeating at a big event, it can be difficult to go back to eating your normal, typical-sized meals; however, this is one of the most crucial steps to recovering after overeating.


When you're measuring portion sizes of foods or of your total meal, this can help prevent another episode of overeating. Immediately getting back on track with portion sizes will give you a big step on your road to recovery.
Eating appropriate sized portions can help you maintain a healthy weight or lose weight (or get back on track with your weight loss). It's typical for main meals to be between 1 and 2 cups total.
Also measure each food group. Measure out: 3-4 oz of lean protein or about 1/2 cup of proteins like beans or dairy foods, 1/2 cup or 1 oz of grains, 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens or 1/2 cup of fruit.Use a food scale, measuring cups or small plates and bowls to help you stick to your portion size.

, Cooking at home and limiting meals out is a great way to ensure you're getting a nutritious meal. Plus, it's easier to stick to appropriate portions as well.


Getting back to healthy eating after overindulging is important. Cook at home so you can control what goes into your meals and how much you serve yourself.
Always include lean protein in your meals. A 3-4 oz serving of foods like poultry, eggs, lean beef, seafood, legumes or low-fat dairy will help give you energy and keep you satisfied.Also heap on the fruits and vegetables. These naturally low calorie foods are high in fiber, water content and vitamins. They'll help bulk up your meals, keep you hydrated and satisfied.Make half of your meal fruit or vegetable.
If you're going to include a serving of grains, go for 1/2 cup or 1 oz of 100% whole grains. These are higher in fiber which also helps keep you satisfied., Drinking enough water is always important for maintaining adequate health; however, it's a great way to help you recover from a day of overeating as well.


Drinking enough water throughout the day after you've overeaten can help you feel more full and less hungry. It fills your stomach with zero calories and helps keep hunger at bay.Aim to drink at least 64 oz or eight glasses of water daily. You may even want to drink up to 13 glasses of water the day after overeating to help fill your stomach and prevent feeling hungry., Although getting on the scale might not be something you want to see, it's important to get back on track with keeping yourself accountable.


Getting on the scale the morning after an overeating session might be a little upsetting to you. There's a good chance your weight might be up slightly from overindulging in salty foods. Instead, get on two days after your big event.Getting on the scale will help you face the facts and get you into a good ""head game"" to getting yourself to recovery from your day of overeating.Continue to weigh yourself once a week to stay on top of your weight and stay accountable. Avoid weighing yourself daily, as weight fluctuates. Weighing yourself too often can be counterproductive.

, It's important to get adequate sleep every night or as often as possible. There are many connections between weight gain, obesity and sleep deficiencies.


Even if you overate at a big event today, try to go to bed earlier tonight so you get enough sleep.
Research shows that those people who do not get enough sleep each night are more likely to be overweight or obese.Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.When you do not sleep enough you may feel hungrier throughout the day and have more difficulty saying ""no"" to junk foods.

, One good thing you can do after overeating at a big event (especially if you hosted the event) is to clean out your kitchen of all the leftovers.


If you are aiming to recover from overeating and there are tons of tempting leftovers sitting around, you may find it more difficult to get back on track. If the foods you want to avoid are there, it's easier to give into eating them.If you have a ton of leftovers or have other tempting foods at home, consider giving them away. Bring leftover sweets to your office, donate unopened goods to a food kitchen or toss away things that others may not want.

, Manage your hunger and blood sugar levels before a big event by having a small snack or beverage first. If you go into a meal or event too hungry, you might overeat and are more likely to go for the high calorie foods.Try drinking a large glass of water. An easy no-calorie trick to help you feel less hungry and even a touch satisfied is by drinking a large glass of water right before your meal.Have a cup of broth or low-calorie vegetable soup. Like water, these items can help you feel satisfied and less hungry before your event.
Have a snack two to three hours prior to your event. If you go too long between meals — more than five hours — you might feel too hungry. Plan a small snack like a piece of fruit, a hard boiled egg, 2 oz of nuts of a small yogurt. This can quell your appetite prior to your event., In addition to making changes to your diet, exercising has also been shown to help suppress appetite in the short term.Studies have shown that if you engage in moderate-intensity physical activity, that you can actually suppress your appetite and feel less hungry.Try going for a 30 minute walk or fit in a 20 minute workout at the gym before your big event. This might help decrease your overall appetite and help you manage how much you eat.

, Whenever you know you'll be going to a special event with food and there's a chance that you will overeat, go with an eating plan in mind.


If you have a plan of what you're going to eat, how much you're going to eat and how you're going regulate yourself you're more likely to stick with that instead of ""figuring it out when you get there.""
Stick with the smaller salad plate or appetizer plates instead of the larger dinner plates so you cannot put as much food on your plate. In addition, if you're going to a potluck, picnic or other ""buffet style"" event, plan to limit yourself to two trips with a small salad plate or appetizer plate.
Fill up on low calorie foods first. Have some salad, fresh fruit, raw vegetables or a broth-based soup first to help fill up your stomach for only a few calories.
Always have a non-alcoholic drink in hand. This keeps your hand and mouth busy and makes it more difficult to hold a plate in your hand. Sip on some water, sparkling water or unsweetened coffee or tea.

, When you're at a big event or special meal where there's a lot of food, sometimes the best thing you can do to prevent overeating is leaving the area.


If you're having trouble not thinking about going back for seconds or trying one more thing, leave the room with the food. Many times if it's out of sight, it's out of mind.If you're at a sit down dinner, refuse seconds or ask for your leftovers to be boxed up or taken away so they're not sitting right in front of you. You can even ask for a to-go box as soon as your meal arrives and put half of your food in the box.
If you're at a potluck or happy hour, try focusing on talking to friends and sit or stand far away from the food so you cannot physically reach it.

Balance calories.,
Increase the food intakes from some of the plate.,
Increase your intake of fruit and vegetables.,
Choose a variety of protein foods from the suggested sources.,
Reduce your food intake for food items high in sodium and sugar.,
Use oils prudently.,
Understand empty calories and how to avoid them.,
Get some exercise.",How to Use MyPlate," Spend some time having a look around the site. You'll find:


A fully searchable site.

Supertracker and other tools.;
, As shown in the image here, you can see that the four basic food groups consist of: fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins. Dairy has been placed to one side in a small bowl.

, MyPlate recommends that you enjoy your food but eat less of it and that you avoid eating oversized portions.

, The new recommendations are:


Make half your plate fruit and vegetables. Vary the types of vegetables for interest and an expanded amount of nutrients.
Make at least half of your grains whole grains.
If you drink or use milk, change to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. Ensure that you get calcium-rich foods in your diet (choose high quality low-fat or fat-free dairy]).
Choose lean protein.

, It is recommended that half your plate consist of fruit and vegetables.

, Protein includes meat, poultry, and seafood, and vegetarian choices like beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds. It is recommended that you select a variety, including 8 ounces of seafood a week.

, The recommendations are to take the time to compare the sodium content between brands in foods such as soup, bread, and frozen meals and to favor the lower sodium content food. Replace sugary drinks with water.

, Oils are not a food group but they provide essential nutrients.Avoid any margarine that has trans fats. Realize that you already obtain oils from eating nuts, fish, cooking oil, and salad dressings, so be careful about your daily intake.


See the Daily Allowance chart for details on your oil allowance per day depending on your needs, age, and gender: .

, MyPlate explains that empty calories are abundant in the American diet. They are calories from solid fats and from added sugars. They're in a lot of favorite, comfort, fast foods such as cakes, pies, cookies, pastries, donuts, sodas, energy drinks, sports drinks, fruit drinks, ice cream, pizza, cheese, sausages, hot dogs, bacon and ribs. Soda and candies are all empty calories. It is recommended that a small amount of empty calories is okay but not as a replacement for the nutrients your body needs. Keep these empty calories for occasional treats.

, Physical activity is a key component of the MyPlate approach. Moving your body is important for your good health. MyPlate recommends both moderate exercise and vigorous exercise choices; you can choose either or, or mix them up. Light intensity activities do not count toward your physical activity needs because your heart rate doesn't increase (housework or shopping, for example).

See the list of moderate and vigorous activities here: .

Figure out why they don't like particular foods.,
Start a food log.,
Stay away from threats.,
Ditch bribes.,
Create a relaxed and supportive environment.,
Support your partner.",How to Teach Someone Not to Be a Picky Eater1," Texture, smell, or taste can all be problems for the picky eater, so you need to figure out which of these is the cause of pickiness. By identifying the source of pickiness, one can develop helpful solutions; if the texture is a problem, one might try switching from raw to cooked or vice versa.For example, if your teenager doesn't like carrots because they are too crunchy, you could try roasting or steaming them so that they're softer.
For example, if someone doesn't like vegetables with bitter flavors, you could try directing them towards sweeter vegetables such as winter squash or sweet potatoes.;
, Using a small notebook or a specialized computer application, start a food journal in order to keep track of your child's response to new foods and their level of nutritional intake.Since picky eating can result in nutritional deficiencies,it is important to keep a regular record of what your child is consuming and where there is a deficiency such as not enough protein or iron.


There are numerous applications now available for food journalling or logging. These applications have been developed for a wide variety of purposes, so it is important to review the application and make sure it is easy to use.If the application looks overwhelming, you can always use the old fashioned pen and paper notebook.

, Threats are another root cause of picky eating because they increase the anxiety around eating, which makes picky eating worse. For example, parents who threaten their children with negative consequences for not eating tend to make the picky eating worse., Resist any attempt to bribe the picky eater since this can easily lead to increased social anxiety around the dinner table.For instance, don't reward children with desert because this can lead to an excessive preference for sweet foods., Since eating can be less enjoyable for picky eaters,one should make every effort to reduce their anxiety about food and eating with a relaxing atmosphere. It can help to create a casual atmosphere around the dinner table while also avoiding engagement with television or other media while eating.Light candles at the dinner table. A few candles at the dinner table can help create that relaxing atmosphere you want for your family.Turn off the television. Television commercials often contain unhealthy messages about food, and have been shown to wet the appetite for snacks and other calorie dense but low nutrient foods.Although you may not be able to avoid television advertising entirely, at least turn it off during mealtime.
Ask children to turn off games and ipads. By making sure games and ipads are off during mealtime, the family can focus on the experience of eating a healthy dinner., Parents need to work together to support healthy eating habits amongst children.Lack of spousal support for healthy eating has been associated with unhealthy relationships to food amongst children.Work together to model healthy eating practices. Parents can model the kind of relationship to food that they would like to see in their children. Children will copy the behaviour of parents, so you can shape your child's relationship to food by modelling the kind of healthy relationship to food and eating that you would like to see in your children.

Have a pity party.,
Do not replace a single thing with a gluten-free alternative!,
Look at your current diet and through your pantry and refrigerator to find the foods and meals you already eat that are gluten-free.,
Give yourself permission to eat things that you may have restricted from your diet before your diagnosis.,
Look at your current menus and meals and find ways to eliminate gluten from your diet.,
Really consider what are your favorite parts of your current meals.,
Clear out any and all foods that have gluten, wheat, wheat flour, oats, oat flour, rye, semolina, or modified food starch from your pantry.,
Plan and prepare your meals ahead of time.,
When you feel courageous, add a gluten-free alternative to a meal.",How to Transition Into a Gluten Free Lifestyle Relatively Painlessly," Get a party hat or tiara, a CD that makes you feel sad, a box of your favorite ""now off limits"" treats, and tissues. Eat yourself sick while you glare at your restricted list and really wallow in how sad you feel about this life change. You may have many times in the future where you'll feel sorry for yourself, but this initial wallow takes the edge off.

, Gluten-free (GF) alternatives, such as pastas, flours, bakery goods, breads, waffles, etc., are an acquired taste and trying to replace familiar foods with them may only make you feel discouraged. Your mouth needs time to adjust to different flavors so, unless you were raised with a widely varied diet, steer clear of alternatives for awhile.

, You may need to keep a food journal for a week or two if you haven't already. Be sure to list condiments, ice creams, produce, snacks, and other foods. This list will be helpful as you create menus around your new restrictions and give you encouragement that you're already on the right track!

, Potato chips may not be appropriate for other people, but they are a staple in a GF diet. You will need to find treats for yourself as you adjust to this diet. Count calories after you are comfortable with your new way of eating, manage your portions instead. It's all about taking baby steps!

,


Replace bread in sandwiches with green leaf lettuce and add your favorite fixings and condiments. Have breakfast burritos with corn tortillas instead of toast and eggs; to up the ""yummy"" factor in otherwise dry corn tortillas, spray with non-stick spray, salt if desired, and warm in a frying pay until pliable.
Look for GF hot and cold cereals(must not have barley malt) and have those handy for a snack or meal. Replace bread and crackers with potato chips, tortilla or corn chips, rice cakes or popcorn. For example, chicken or tuna salad on rice cakes or scooped onto potato chips is delicious. Fondue dips well with popcorn or tortilla chips and Fritos make excellent croutons in salads. Popcorn is a filling side dish with soup.
Drop bakery goods for awhile, and find other gluten-free treats instead. Treat yourself to exotic chocolates, ice creams, or candies that are GF. Have pasta toppings on rice, polenta, or baked potatoes (to make easy baked potatoes just wash and scrub the potatoes, wrap individually in foil, and bake in a crockpot for about 7 hours on low - perfect every time!).
Be on the lookout for meals on your current menus or the menus of friends and family that are naturally gluten-free (roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, for example) and make them a staple on your new menus.
Surf the internet, watch cooking shows and browse magazines for ideas and adapt them as you see fit. Bento boxes (Japanese lunches) are excellent and leaves room for creative and enjoyable meals often leaving others envious! A good example of a Bento Box is cubed or sliced luncheon meat or salami, cubed cheese, mixed olives, cucumber/tomato/bell pepper salad vinaigrette, chips and chocolates.

, Also, make sure your presentation is enticing, which makes the food more enjoyable and makes you feel spoiled.

, This will allow you to see how close you are to living gluten-free already. If you have family members living with you who are not gluten-free, you might consider giving the ""offending edibles"" to them to be put in another part of the house while you learn to live and think gluten-free.

, Being caught hungry without a plan is a recipe for disaster! Keep a few GF soups in your larder in case of extreme hunger and no plan. It helps to outline and pack any meals you're eating at home and away from home, including snacks. An example could be:


Breakfast: corn tortilla breakfast burritos, sliced apples, and coffee. #*Lunch: ""lettuce"" with turkey, cheese, avocado slices, tomato, mayo and mustard, 1 oz. chips, and 2 chocolates.
Dinner: BBQ chicken on potatoes, coleslaw, and chocolate sundaes.
Snacks: 1 oz. almonds and popcorn.

, Celebrate your courage even if you didn't care for the item - you stepped outside your comfort zone! Well done! Your mouth may not be ready for it now, but try it again in a few months to see if your mouth has adjusted to flavor alternatives. You may have to find ways to make GF alternatives more enticing. For example, rice bread is not delicious unless it has been toasted - and even then it's best open-faced as it doesn't lend itself to ""sandwich style"" eating(rice bread doesn't have the same ""give"" that wheat bread has).

Avoid cooking a separate meal for picky eaters.,
Serve meals at the same time each day.,
Ditch milk, juice and snacks between meals.,
Serve small and diverse portions.,
Practice patience.",How to Teach Someone Not to Be a Picky Eater2," By cooking one dinner per day, rather than a main meal for adults and side meals for children, you can encourage your children to remain open to new foods. Children will be challenged to try foods that adults enjoy, and will therefore be more likely to develop into adults with an openness to diverse food items as opposed to adults with a picky eating habit. As an additional benefit, you will have more time to invest into cooking a tasty and diverse menu with your family., By serving meals at regular intervals, you can ensure your family has an adequate appetite. Choose a time that works for everyone in the family, allows for adequate meal preparation time, and minimizes the time window for snacking., Serving snacks between meal times may lead to a lack of appetite at meal time.If the picky eater is not hungry, they will be less likely to try something new. So, you should focus on creating good healthy meals for picky eaters, and avoid multiple snack times.

, Give small portions of food so that your child will eat appropriate portions and will need to request additional servings based on their appetite.While keeping portions small, remember to include lots of diversity on the plate so that there are opportunities for picky eaters to try new things. You might try integrating small portions of a food item that your child has previously rejected and they may eventually grow over their dislike for this item., It will take time for picky eaters, especially children, to try new foods so don’t give up! It may take ten or fifteen tries before a picky eater tries a new food."

Try making tapas.Consider the ingredient that is challenging for the picky eater and try to create different tapas dishes with the same ingredient, including both raw and cooked versions in the various tapas.,
Cook with your picky eater.For instance, make burritos with your children so that they have a sense of agency in choosing ingredients and trying new foods.,
Set an example by showing your enjoyment of new or different foods.By seeing your enjoyment of a new meal or a different cuisine, the picky eater may relax and learn from your behaviour.,
Talk about healthy food and nutrition options.",How to Teach Someone Not to Be a Picky Eater3," The picky eater may simply prefer a food cooked as opposed to raw or vice versa, and the tapa experiment may allow you to figure out this preference.,,


Express your enjoyment of food. Smile and smack your lips to arouse their curiosity about the food item.

, Choose a different food topic each night, such as raw food diets or organic vs conventional produce, and bring conversations about food and farming into the family dining experience. In this way, you can build some food education into your overall plan for reforming picky eating.3


Watch a cooking show and discuss the ingredients used in the show with your family to stimulate curiosity about different ingredients and approaches to cooking.

Use the pills responsibly.",How to Use Appetite Suppressants to Help with Overeating," Overeating cannot be treated like flu. It is a bad habit, like smoking or drinking alcohol, not a disease. You should quit your habit, not just lose weight, or it will come back again quickly. You will need to change your lifestyle, not your pills.;
, Appetite suppressants are mostly quite powerful medicine, they may cause great impact on your body, and so consulting your doctor about your overall health state and possible pills prescriptions is definitely a wise idea.

, Pills will not do the job alone. You will need to eat less, move more, and spend time doing some physical acts like cycling, jogging, swimming and/or playing sports instead of sitting on a sofa in the evening.

, Changes are harsh. Sometimes your wish to drop all this hard work and go eat another portion of your favorite meal will be overwhelming. Many people give up in the very beginning, after doing merely several exercises and dieting for a couple of days. They continue growing fat and ugly and say this is their constitution or metabolism. Pathetic, aren’t they? Do not be one of these people, as it is your health and well-being, so – stick to the plan.

, Taking your pills and watching movies all day long will not help you a bit. Pills are you supporters; they will assist you in doing harsh work of burning your fat down, not doing it instead of you.

For example, if you are ordering sausage, it probably contains over 500 milligrams of salt, which is the reason why you should eat it occasionally. , Most fast food restaurants have this information available online. When you view the nutrition information, look mainly at the sodium intake to find how much salt is in the specific dish you plan to order. For example, it is best to avoid Firehouse Subs since their sandwiches are extremely high in salt (and they go over the guidelines). , When you make homemade pizza, for instance, the ingredients are bound to be high in sodium (such as cheese, pizza and olives). The recipe might also call for sea salt, which can make your meal even saltier, so this is a good thing to be aware of. Look at the nutrition labels for each ingredient and add up the numbers of milligrams. Diluting your sodium might be a good option if the recipe, in total, is high in sodium.

, There are plenty of applications available for mobile devices, such as Sodium Tracker and Sodium 101. Several applications allow you to set a sodium goal and add up the amount of sodium in certain meals to reach your total intake.

Many times we feel hungry when we're actually not physically hungry at all. We might be bored, thirsty, upset, stressed or just in the mood to eat a tasty snack.Since there are a variety of reasons outside of true physical hunger that can cue you to eat, a quick self scan can help you out.
Take a minute to think: Is my stomach growling? Does my stomach feel empty? When was my last meal or snack? Do I feel stressed, anxious or upset? Am I bored? Asking yourself these questions can help you determine whether or not you're truly hungry.
If you are physically hungry, have a planned snack or wait until your next meal to eat. You can also apply some tricks to help calm your hunger down.
If you're not truly hungry, find another activity to distract yourself with until your craving or desire to eat goes away.;
, Many times, people feel hungry and want to snack or eat but are actually just thirsty. The signals of thirst and hunger feel similar and are easy to confuse.Water can help fill your stomach which may help stave off hunger pains. It helps fill your stomach and send signals to your brain that you're full.
Drink a full two glasses if your stomach is growling. Or consider carrying a water bottle throughout the day so you can continuously sip throughout the day. This will also help prevent dehydration throughout the day.
Warm or hot water may make you feel even more satisfied than plain water. The flavor and warmth mimic a meal. Hot coffee or tea are good options. However, if you're watching your weight, stick to sugar-free options.

, Brushing your teeth is a very quick way to curb your appetite in just a few short seconds. You're much less likely to snack if you've just brushed your teeth.Toothpaste provides an intense flavor that can help cut cravings immediately. In addition, most foods do not taste as good right after you've brushed your teeth.
Try keeping a travel toothbrush around if you get hungry during a long day away from home.

, Pay attention to the symptoms of your hunger. If you think you're hungry, but aren't experiencing any typical hunger sensations you may be craving food for another reason.


Eating out of boredom is very common. Change your mind by participating in another activity. This can help distract your brain and mind for a bit and allow the craving to pass.Go for a quick walk, talk to a friend, read a good book, do some household chores or surf the internet. One study even reports fewer cravings when the participants played tetris., Some studies have shown that chewing on gum or sucking on a mint helps immediately decrease feelings of hunger.The chewing or suck sensation paired with a flavor tells your brain that you're satisfied and is thought to be the reason why this trick works so well.Stick to sugar-free gums and mints.

, Although there are a variety of tricks to control your hunger in an instant, eating breakfast daily has been shown to reduce your feelings of hunger all day long.Skipping breakfast may set you up for feeling much more hungry throughout the day. In addition, those who skipped breakfast ended up eating more calories throughout the day in one study. People who routinely skip breakfast may increase their insulin response, which promotes weight gain.One study shows that eating a breakfast that contains fat, protein, and carbohydrates reduces your hunger throughout the day.Examples of hunger preventing breakfasts include: scrambled eggs with low-fat cheese and whole grain toast, whole grain waffle with peanut butter and fruit or oatmeal with nuts and dried fruit.

, Protein is involved in many important roles in your body. However, one notable thing about protein is that it helps you feel satisfied longer compared to other nutrients.Eating protein can also reduce your cravings for sugary or high-fat foods.Choose lean sources of protein (especially if you're watching your weight) at each meal and snack. This will help make sure that you eat an adequate amount but also give you that satisfying punch you need throughout the day.
Lean protein options include: seafood, poultry, lean beef, pork, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes and tofu.

Protein helps your muscles absorb energy and grow., There have been a variety of studies that have shown that people feel more satisfied and satiated with a higher fiber diet compared to those who ate a low-fiber diet.There are a variety of mechanisms thought to contribute to fiber's filling effect. One is that fibrous foods require more chewing which could slow your rate of ingestion and help you feel more satisfied. Fiber is also bulky and may make you physically feel fuller.Vegetables, fruits and whole grains are filled with fiber. These foods will typically fill you up for longer than other foods.
Salads or vegetable soups are especially effective because they contain good amounts of fiber and few calories.
Fiber also helps you regulate blood sugar, which can help you control hunger pangs., There will be plenty of times when you're not physically hungry, but have a craving for a snack or treat. The occasional indulgence is OK, especially if you choose to satisfy your craving in a healthy manner.


There are a variety of healthy alternatives to typical cravings like sweets, salty or crunchy foods. Make a smart choice if you're craving a snack.
Eat fruit to satisfy a sweet tooth. An apple or orange provides fiber and vitamins, along with some sugar to satisfy your sweet cravings.
Go for a small portion of salted nuts if you're craving a salty, crunchy treat.
Eat raw vegetables with dip or hummus to satisfy a savory, crunchy craving.

, If you want to keep hunger at bay, it's important to eat regularly throughout the day. If you skip meals or go too long between meals without eating, you'll feel a heightened sense of hunger.For long term results, find a meal schedule that works for you. Some people report less hunger when they schedule three meals a day. Others become hungry more quickly. These people prefer to eat 5-6 small meals a day.

Usually, emotional hunger comes on suddenly and feels urgent. You may be able to only think about eating and satisfying your craving right away. This is different than physical hunger, which usually comes on gradually, unless you haven’t eaten in a long time.When you are emotionally hungry, you may also crave specific comfort foods, such as fatty foods, foods high in carbs, or foods high in sugar. You may also find yourself eating without thinking, where you eat a whole bag of chips or several pieces of cake without paying attention to what you are doing.
After an episode of emotional eating, you may not feel satisfied or even full. You may try to eat more and more until you are uncomfortably full. You may also feel a sense of regret, guilt, or shame after you have eaten. This may be because you realize you are eating for emotional reasons, rather than nutritional reasons.;
, Though emotions come into play with binge eating, binge eating usually involves eating unusually large amounts of food within a specific amount of time. Individuals with a binge eating disorder often feel they cannot control their behavior and eat even when they are full or not hungry. They may also eat rapidly during binge episodes and eat alone or in secret. They may have feelings of shame or guilt while they are eating or after they have eaten.Many people with a binge eating disorder are overweight or obese, through you can also be at a normal weight and have this disorder. Individuals who binge eat may try dieting and weight loss programs frequently but have a hard time maintaining a healthy weight due to their disorder.
Unlike bulimia, individuals who binge eat do not vomit up their food, use laxatives, or exercise excessively to get rid of the food they just consumed. Often, binge eating occurs due to certain triggers and a binge eating episode can last several hours, depending on the severity of the episode.

, To stop your emotional eating, you first need to determine the root causes or triggers of your eating. Identifying possible causes will then help you to better manage them and prevent you from eating emotionally in the future. Common causes of emotional eating include:Stress: Stress can be a big trigger for emotional eating, as high levels of stress leads to a spike in your hormones and your cortisol levels. Chronic stress can make you crave salty, sweet, and high-fat foods to give you a burst of energy and relief.
Intense feelings and thoughts: Feelings like anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, loneliness, resentment and shame can all lead to emotional eating. You may use eating as a way to numb yourself from these emotions or to avoid processing these emotions.
Boredom: Being bored and unoccupied can lead to emotional eating, especially if you also feel unfulfilled and empty. You may try to fill this void with eating.
Childhood eating habits: You may have memories of food from when you were a child that are attached to negative feelings or from being taught to view food as a reward. Maybe your parents always gave you ice cream or sweets when you behaved properly or took you out for pizza when you did well academically or needed a pick me up.
Social pressures: If you tend to use food as a way to connect with others socially, you may have an emotional relationship with food. Though getting together with friends for a meal is a good stress reliever and often a good way to enjoy food, it can also lead to overeating. You may overeat in social situations due to nervousness or as an attempt to blend in with everyone else who is eating. Your family and friends may also pressure you into overeating or indulging in unhealthy foods during your meals together.

, To get a better understanding of your emotional eating triggers, you may want to keep a food diary. Write down your meals for the day as well as how much you eat, when you eat, how you feel when you eat, and how hungry you felt. Be specific and consistent about keeping the diary as this may allow you to recognize patterns in your eating. These patterns can help you better understand how your mood affects how much you eat and what you eat.For example, you may notice that every time you come home from work after a long day, you eat a whole bag of chips or a pint of ice cream. This could point to a pattern of emotional eating that is triggered by the stress in your workplace.

, Sometimes it can help to talk to those close to you about your eating habits as a way to understand your habits better. It can be hard to recognize your own emotional habits, especially around food. Do not be afraid to talk to your close friends and family about your struggles with eating. Ask them if they think you may eat based on emotion and if they notice any triggers or patterns in your behavior.You should also see your family and friends as support systems for you to lean on as you work to stop your emotional eating. Rather than feel ashamed or embarrassed by your eating, you should try to be honest about your struggles and talk openly about them to those you trust around you. This will help you feel less guilty about your eating and help you feel supported.
It may also help to eat in front of your friends and family, especially if they have healthy eating habits. Choose healthy options when you eat with family and friends and try to model your behavior after their healthy eating habits.

, Though you may be able to recognize your triggers on your own through self analysis and through talking to those close to you, you may also want to reach out for a professional opinion on your eating. You can talk to your family doctor about your emotional eating and get a referral for a therapist. You can also talk to a counselor at school or in the workplace.You may need to be assessed by a mental health professional before you can enter therapy or counseling. The therapist may also give you diet suggestions to help you stay healthy as you work through your food triggers and the causes of your emotional eating.

, To get a better handle on your diet, you should sit down and write out a grocery list before you head to the grocery store. Consider choosing four to five healthy meals for the week and writing down the ingredients for these meals so you know exactly what you are getting and do not impulse buy when you are at the store. Think about the nutritional value of the items on your list. Go for more fruits, vegetables, healthy sources of protein, and healthy sources of dairy.


Bring the list with you when you go shopping and stick to the getting only the items on your list. Stay in the outer areas of the grocery store, such as the produce and fresh food sections. Try not to spend time in the center or middle aisles, as they are often stocked with processed and prepackaged foods. You should also avoid picking up any of the unhealthy snacks at the check-out counter.

, Make a meal plan where you account for the majority of your meals for the week. Include any snacks you will eat throughout the day and try to limit yourself to only the foods noted in your meal plan.Keep in mind it is important that your meal plan is reasonable and healthy. Rather than deprive yourself of all your favorite foods, see if you can integrate it into your meal plan in healthier ways. For example, if you love fried chicken, maybe you can include chicken in your meal plan and prepare it in healthier ways, such as baking or broiling it. This way, you can still enjoy this food without overindulging.
Avoid skipping meals, as this can lead to more intense hunger and overeating when you do sit down to eat. Keep your meal plan consistent and have at least three meals a day at the same times every day.You should also let yourself enjoy a treat once and awhile, as cutting yourself off entirely can lead to even more feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety. You may have on small treat once a week as a way to keep your diet healthy but also enjoyable and reasonable.

, Another way to determine if you are eating based on emotion is to do the broccoli test, where you ask yourself when you are feeling hungry, “Am I so hungry I would eat broccoli right now?” If the answer is yes, you are likely physically hungry. If you answer no to this question, you are likely eating emotionally.This test is one way of taking a moment to consider your craving before you act on it. You can also take a few deep breaths and acknowledge your food craving, rather than act on it right away. Try to take five minutes to consider why you are craving a certain food and whether or not you are acting on emotion instead of actual hunger.

, Make your meals an occasion and savor every bite. Start with a small portion of food on a plate of nine inches or less. Pause for one to two minutes before you begin eating to contemplate your food and show appreciation for it. Then, take small bites and chew slowly. Try to taste the food completely before you swallow it.Eating mindfully will help you avoid emotional eating because you end up focusing on the experience of the food and the act of eating it. Bringing all your senses to the table when you eat will also allow you to appreciate the flavors, textures, smells, and appearance of the food.

, Rather than cut out snacking completely, you should replace unhealthy foods in your pantry with healthy alternatives. Go for unseasoned nuts and unsalted popcorn instead of potato chips. Cut up fruits and vegetables and place them on a platter with healthy, fat-free dip. This way, when you feel a food craving coming on, you can reach for healthy snacks.You should also remove any tempting foods from your home, such as bags of chips, cookies, candy, or any processed or prepackaged foods. Taking these foods out of your space means that when you do feel a craving coming on, it is that much harder to satisfy the craving with unhealthy snacks.

, Stress reducing foods like herbals teas or fresh fruits can be a good alternative to unhealthy snacks. If you notice your emotional eating is triggered by stress, go for foods that will help you feel calm and relaxed.If you tend to get late night food cravings due to stress, you should try snacking on dark cherries. They can increase the levels of melatonin in your body, allowing you to relax and get a better sleep.
You can also add fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, to your diet to help you combat feelings of depression and anxiety.

, Doing physical activities like walking or running can help you to release any stress or anxiety you may be feeling. This can then help you to avoid emotional eating, as your energy will be focused on burning calories and increasing your endorphin levels. Try to do cardio activity at least once a day for 30 minutes to 1 hour, as this will help you stay healthy mentally and physically.Doing physical activity where you work up a sweat has also been shown to help with depression and insomnia, which can be triggers for emotional eating.

, Stress can be a big trigger for emotional eating. Rather than let stress overtake you and cause you to overeat, you may want to try a relaxing activity like yoga or Tai Chi. Sign up for a weekly yoga class with a friend, where you can breathe and stretch out any tension or stress you may be feeling. Doing this can help you to maintain a balanced mood and feel less of a need to reach for food as a way to stress release., Another way you can relax is to do self caring actions at home. You can also focus on self care when you feel a food craving come on, such as taking a bath, reading a book, going for a walk, or meditating. Channeling your energy into a healthy, caring act for yourself, rather than emotional eating, will likely make you feel better in the long run., If you decide to talk to a therapist or a counselor about your emotional eating, you should schedule weekly sessions where you reflect on your eating habits for the week and any coping mechanisms shown to you by the therapist. Maintaining constant communication with your therapist as you work through your food issues will allow you to feel supported and safe."

Balance your calories.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Eat high-calorie foods in moderation.,
Eat until you're satisfied.,
Drink adequate fluids.",How to Stay Thin1," When you were losing weight you may have been focused on following a low-calorie diet or making sure you had a daily calorie deficit to help you lose weight. Now that you're maintaining your weight, you'll need to balance your calories differently.


In general, when you want to maintain your weight, you'll need to consume roughly the same amount of calories from food as you burn through daily activity. For example, if your total calorie burn during the day is around 1,800 calories, you'll need to eat about 1,800 calories to maintain your weight.
You can use a food journal or smart phone app to help you count your calories throughout the day.
Use online calculators to help provide you with an estimate of how many calories you should consume to maintain your weight.
Keep your total calorie intake in mind or note it in a food journal. If your weight changes, you can make adjustments to your current average caloric intake.;
, Eating a balanced diet will help you maintain your weight loss long-term. This type of diet will provide you with all the essential nutrients your body needs.A balanced diet includes foods from all food groups each day and throughout the week. Unless you have an allergy or cultural/religious reason to avoid foods, it's ideal to include all foods in your diet.
It's also important to eat a wide variety of foods within each food group. Every fruit, vegetable or protein source offers you a different set of vital nutrients.

, When you're trying to maintain your weight, you'll be able to indulge more often in your favorite, more decadent foods. You may have restricted these more when you were actively losing weight.


While you can snack or have a favorite treat, it's still important to only eat these foods in moderation. If you go back to having them on a daily or more regular basis, you run the risk of gaining your weight back.Consider using the 80/20 rule. This is a general rule sometimes suggested by health professionals. Aim to eat healthy, nutritious foods 80% of the time and have a more indulgent treat 20% of the time., When you were dieting you may have been counting calories, points or measuring portions on a regular basis. In maintenance mode, you might not want to do this type of monitoring and don't necessarily have to if you only eat until you're satisfied.


If you eat until you're satisfied, not full or stuffed, you take in less calories.This can help you stick to smaller portions and a lower calorie diet.
When you're eating, think about eating until you are 80% full. This may help you get a better idea of what satisfied is. It takes about 20 minutes for your body to register that you have eaten, so eat slowly at a table.
Satisfied may feel like a lack of hunger, a decrease in the desire to eat and a feeling that you'll be satisfied for the next few hours.

, Drinking more water may be one of the new behaviors you've picked up during your weight loss plan. Being adequately hydrated can help you keep extra pounds at bay.Drinking enough water throughout the day has shown to decrease your hunger levels and desire to snack.Aim for at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) daily; however, some health experts even recommend consuming up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily.Choose beverages that are sugar-free and caffeine-free like water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.

Exercise regularly.,
Manage stress.,
Sleep seven to nine hours nightly.,
Continue with successful aspects of previous diets.,
Surround yourself with support.",How to Stay Thin2," One of the best ways to maintain your weight long-term is to be active. Studies have shown that those who exercise on a regular basis maintain their weight easier compared to those who are not active.Regular physical activity actually helps you maintain your weight much more than it does for weight loss.
Include at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity daily and two to three days of strength training throughout the week., Taking care of stress is another important item to keep in mind when you're trying to maintain your weight. Stress can make healthy eating and sticking to healthy habits more difficult.High amounts of stress can cause increased appetite and cravings for more indulgent foods.If you're feeling stressed, try to engage in other activities to help calm you down or make you feel more relaxed. You can: go for walk, talk to a friend, read a good book, take a long shower, or listen to good music.
If you find that stress is something that you encounter frequently and it makes it harder for you to maintain your weight, it may be helpful to see a behavioral specialist or therapist. They'll be able to give you more guidance to stress management.

, Sleep is important for your general health and many studies have shown that lack of sleep has a significant affect on your appetite and hunger levels.When you don't sleep enough you may experience increased hunger throughout the day.This may make it difficult to make healthy choices, follow portion sizes or pass up on a snack.
Try to hit the sack early enough that you can get in the recommended seven to nine hours of shut eye each night.
Go to bed earlier, set your alarm later (if you can) and shut off all lights and electronics.

, You may have tried a variety of different diets in the past. What made you successful in some of those diets may be behaviors that you need to continue in order to maintain your weight loss. Maintaining weight less about dieting and more about making permanent changes to your lifestyle — how you eat, your relationship with food, etc. Even if you are no longer following a diet to the letter, try to stick with the concepts that made you successful (making half your plate a fruit or vegetable, eating only lean proteins, etc.).


If you completely give up the good habits you picked up and learned through diets and go back to old habits, you're at risk for regaining your weight.
Think about the small lifestyle changes you made that helped you lose weight. It might include measuring portions, writing a food journal, keeping tempting trigger foods out of your house or being active regularly. Keep these changes in place.
If they feel too difficult to keep in place or not fit into your lifestyle, change them as needed so they can continue to be an easy to keep change in your life.

, Support is important for both weight loss and maintenance; however, the type of support you need may differ.


When you surround yourself with others who are physically active, eat well and engage in other healthy behaviors, you're more likely to do so yourself.Find friends or family members that have the same mindset or life goals as you do. You may find it easier to continue with your healthy lifestyle when you surround yourself with these types of people.
You may also want to find an online support group. This will be helpful if you don't have many friends or family members with the same healthy mindset.

Weigh yourself regularly.,
Keep a journal.,
Measure yourself.",How to Stay Thin3," Getting on the scale might have been an exciting part of your weight loss. While it may not be as exciting, weighing yourself weekly or even daily is extremely important for weight maintenance.

People who successfully keep weight off after dieting weigh themselves frequently.If you rarely check-in with your weight you won't notice little fluctuations. More consistent weighing will allow you to catch a small unwanted weight gain or loss and allow you to make the appropriate changes quickly.
If your target weight is 150 pounds, you'll need to give yourself a weight range. Every time you step on the scale it won't be exactly 150 pounds. It might fluctuate between 148 – 153 pounds, which is appropriate. Give yourself an appropriate weight range with strict limits. If your upper limit is 153 pounds, if you weigh that amount, you'll need to review food journals, exercise journals and behaviors so that you can get your weight down into a safer part of your range.
Since your weight fluctuates throughout the day, weighing yourself at the same time every day, wearing the same clothes (or no clothes, if possible) will help you get the most accurate weight.

, Keeping a journal is great for weight loss. It's equally good for long-term weight maintenance and accountability.Food journals help keep you honest and mindful of the choices you're making. Even if you're not as accurate as you once were, the habit of regular journaling can help keep you on track.
Food journals are also a great thing to have on hand if you notice your weight changing. You can return to your journal and review your most recent food choices. You might notice you're snacking more or going out to eat more and can change these behaviors.
You can also track your exercise in your journal. Seeing these trends may also be helpful long-term.

, One method for checking up on yourself is to keep track of body measurements. These measurements give you a different perspective on your size and weight.


You may have tracked these prior to your weight loss and know how different they've become. Many times even slight weight gain will be noticed if you're continually measuring yourself.
Measure your bust and hips (for women only), abdomen, thighs and upper arms. These are the most typical places to measure and where you'll see results if you've lost or gained weight.

There are several ways to ensure that you always have a few healthy, fast meals ready to go. Buy a slow cooker. You can fill it up in the morning and enjoy a hot, savory meal at night.
Cook a week’s worth of meals at once. Divide the food into portions so you’ll be able to quickly reheat and enjoy on busy weeknights.
Consider a meal delivery service. Some companies such as Freshly and Green Chef specialize in delivering fresh, healthy, ready-to-cook meals designed for busy people who want to eat healthy. ;
, If you already have a healthy lunch with you right at your desk, you won’t be tempted to eat an unhealthy vending-machine lunch! Lean turkey sandwiches, grilled or boiled chicken breast, and tuna salad with light mayonnaise are healthy options you can prepare quickly after dinner the night before., Never skip breakfast, no matter how busy you are! Skipping breakfast will decrease your productivity by making you tired, lethargic, and prone to stress. Buy quick, healthy breakfast options like fresh fruit, granola, or instant oatmeal. , Having a variety of healthy snacks on hand will prevent you from indulging in junk food when you need an energy boost. Granola bars, nuts, fresh fruit, trail mix, baby carrots, and baked chips are good options., Alcohol and restaurant food are both high in calories, low in nutritional content, and can make you tired and sluggish. If you still want to go out with your friends, consider bringing a healthy snack along, drinking seltzer instead of alcohol, or limiting yourself to one drink or one half-portion of a meal. , You will save a lot of calories and feel better physically by switching to water for most of your liquid intake. Too much caffeine and sugar in your drinks can increase your exhaustion and decrease your energy levels.

Try sugar-free water flavorings.
Buy a reusable water bottle and keep it filled. If you always have water nearby, you’re much more likely to drink it.
Avoid sodas and other unhealthy drinks., It might seem impossible to find the time to make regular gym visits, but setting a specific appointment at the gym can motivate you to go. By making a formal appointment at your gym and putting it in your planner, you are much more likely to attend., Set your alarm for a half-hour earlier and use that time to get in a quick workout. If you get your workout done early in the day rather than saving it for the end, you are less likely to put it off or cancel it altogether. , If you are completely unable to schedule specific workout times, look at your routine and see how you can add exercising to the schedule you already have. You don’t need to block out an hour at the gym every day to add more fitness to your routine!

Park your car at the back of the lot and walk into the building.
Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Get up every half hour and take a quick walk around the office.
Do chores like folding laundry or organizing your desk while standing up., Take some time to think about all of your obligations. Are some of them not actually productive or helpful? Have you taken on too much responsibility? If so, consider cutting back on your obligations in favor of spending more time focused on your health.

For example, if you work full-time, attend night classes, and belong to three clubs, take a break from one of the clubs until school is out of session., Staying positive will decrease your stress and exhaustion levels, making it easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite a busy schedule. When you become tired or irritated at work or school, think about things that you enjoy.

Imagine yourself enjoying your next day off.
Think about how much healthier your lifestyle is now.
Think about the money you save by not eating out or getting pizza delivered., You will be less stressed and more motivated to continue eating healthy and exercising if you have a goal to work towards. Rewards can be anything you enjoy, but be careful to avoid giving yourself junk food rewards!

Use the money you save eating in to buy a specific item you want, like a new shirt or video game.
Reward exercise with a fun outdoors activity. If you’ve been parking your car a little further out every day for two weeks, plan a short hike to test your new fitness regimen.
Watch a new TV show in the evening on days when you get up early and exercise.

, When you’re juggling a busy schedule, cutting back on sleep can seem like a good idea, but it will actually make you less healthy and more stressed out! Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep, so take a look at your schedule and see what you can change to ensure that you get into bed at a reasonable hour. "

Scan the ""front-of-pack"" labels.,
Review the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list.,
Familiarize yourself with the many names for sugar.,
Be aware of artificial sweeteners.,
Consider limiting sugar alcohols.,
Skip the sweet treats.,
Ditch the sweetened beverages.,
Watch our for sugary condiments.,
Choose unsweetened drinks.,
Avoid sweetened breakfast foods.,
Be wary of ""healthy"" foods with added sugars.",How to Spot Hidden Sugars in Your Food," Many times, people pick up different food packages due to the information that is advertised on front of the box or package. This marketing or ""front-of-pack"" labeling can provide information to the types of ingredients or the nutritive value of foods.


One common sugar related claim you'll see on boxes and packages is ""sugar-free"", ""zero sugar"" or ""sugarless"". All of these claims have identical meanings: there is 0.5 g or less of sugar in each serving of the food.If you're looking for foods with absolutely no sugar, choose foods with these claims on the front.
Another common sugar claim is ""no added sugar."" This means that no additional sugars have been added to the product during processing; however, the product contains a natural source of sugar.""No added sugar"" can be used as a marketing trick since the food may not be actually low in total sugar, since they may contain a lot of sugar naturally.
Another term you may see is ""unsweetened."" This claim can fall into either of the above categories. For example, unsweetened tea doesn't have any added sugar or artificial sweeteners; however, unsweetened applesauce has no added sugar, but does contain natural sugar.;
, Regardless of what the package says on the front, it's always important review and verify the claims by looking at the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list. This will provide you the real story.


The first place you should look is the ""total sugar"" on the nutrition fact panel. This is listed under the heading ""total carbohydrates"" on the label.
The amount of sugar listed here is the total amount of sugar in one serving of the food. It will include both added sugars and natural sugars.If you're avoiding added sugars specifically, you'll need to review the ingredient list since the nutrition fact panel doesn't differentiate between the types of sugar.
When you're reading the ingredient label, note that the first listed ingredient is the one in the highest amount while the last ingredient is found in the smallest amount.

, Food manufacturers have gotten very clever about putting a variety of sweeteners in foods — there are over 60 different names for sugar. There are new names, confusing names and ones that you may have never heard of; however, they're all considered added sugars.


Look beyond your current knowledge of added sugars. There are many more names for sugar besides the common versions like: sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup.
Other names for added sweeteners include: anhydrous dextrose, confectioners sugar, corn syrup solids, dextrose, fructose, honey, molasses, agave syrup, maple syrup, invert sugar, maltose, malt syrup, brown rice syrup, cane juice, sugar in the raw, nectars, sucrose, fruit juices, fruit concentrate, and many more.
If you see any of these names in your ingredient list, you'll know there is a source of added sugar in your food.

, Although you may only be avoiding added sugars that add calories to foods, note that many food companies are also adding artificial sweeteners. If you're not interested in any added sugars or highly processed artificial sweeteners, you'll need to avoid foods that are sweet but labeled as sugar-free.


To provide consumers with lower calorie, reduced sugar or sugar-free products, food companies are using artificial sweeteners and/or sugar alcohols. These provide sweetness to foods without adding calories.Artificial sweeteners will also be listed in the ingredient label. These may include: acesulfame potassium, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose or stevia.
Foods typically containing artificial sweeteners include: baked goods, sodas, drink mixes, canned fruit, jams and jellies, dairy products, candy and puddings.Research has shown that small quantities of artificial sugars present no risk to those who consume them., Like artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols are used to sweeten foods without adding too many calories.


Unlike artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols generally do have a calorie value associated with them; however, it's minimal.Sugar alcohols are found frequently in sugar-free gums, candies or mints. In addition, they can be found in: ice creams, cookies or sugar-free puddings.
Sugar alcohols included may be: erythritol, isomalt, Lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, or xylitol.
Be aware the sugar alcohols can have a laxative effect, especially when consumed in larger quantities. If you're noticing this effect, you may want to limit how many items with sugar alcohols you ingest., An easy way to avoid added sugars and even artificial sweeteners is by avoiding or limiting sweet treats.


Foods like candy, cookies, cakes, pies, ice cream and breakfast pastries all contain added sugars. In addition to having added sugars, these foods are also typically high in calories and fat.
If you're craving a sweet treat, keep it to a small portion and only have these foods every once in awhile — not every day.
In addition, try substituting more nutritious foods that are naturally sweet for these types of processed sweets. For example, have a small bowl of fruit or an individual yogurt.
You can also try making some of your favorite sweet treats at home from scratch. You can control how much sugar is used and what types of sugar you use. For example, bake cookies, muffins, cupcakes or pies from scratch instead of buying a store bought version.

, Another big source of added sugars in many people's diet is from sweetened beverages.


Sugary beverages are not only high in sugar, but can be dangerous to your overall health. Sweetened beverages don't fill you up and people frequently don't count them in their total calorie intake for the day.You may end up eating more food, more calories and more sugar by drinking sweetened or sugary beverages on a regular basis.
Typical sweetened beverages include: sodas, coffee drinks, smoothies, sports drinks, energy drinks, fruit juices and fruit juice cocktail, yogurt drinks and sweet tea.
Replace these drinks for diet versions, sugar-free options or unsweetened options. Try: water, sugar-free flavored water, sparkling water and unsweetened decaf coffee and iced tea.

, You may be surprised that outside the typical sweet treats and sweetened beverages there are other sneaky foods that you'll find a significant amount of added sugars.


Many condiments have a significant amount of added sugar. It's used either to sweetened the item or to replace ingredients that are removed to make condiments ""low-fat"" or ""low-calorie.""
Be aware of added sugars in these common condiments: tomato sauce, salsa, fat-free salad dressings, barbecue sauce,

, Most people know that sweetened beverages are higher in calories and aren't the best choice; however, there are some specific beverages that are overly high in added sugars and should be limited or avoided if you're minimizing added sugars in your diet. Be aware of:


Coffee drinks like: blended drinks or coffee milkshakes, coffees with whipped cream or sweetened drizzles.
Smoothie drinks like: Naked protein smoothies, smoothies made at fast food restaurants and even those that are made at ""health food"" stores.
Juice drinks like: Naked juices, Odwalla juices or juices like Capri Sun.
""All natural sodas"" like: Pepsi natural and Coke Life.

, Outside the obvious pancakes and syrup, there are a variety of other foods that are also high in added sugars. Avoid things like:


Sugary cereals like: Fruit Loops, Cocoa Krispies, Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, Cap'n Crunch, etc.
Pastries like: muffins (even ""healthier"" muffins like bran muffins), banana bread or pumpkin bread.

, Like condiments, you may be surprised to find a good amount of added sugars in foods you may think of as ""healthy"" or ""nutritious.""


The added sugars in some of these foods may be in smaller amounts and they might be more natural sources of added sugars, however they still count as added sugar in your diet.
Foods like smoothies, yogurt, breakfast cereals, multigrain crackers and bread, canned soups, granola bars and dried fruit can have added sugars.
Make sure to read the labels, even on these seemingly healthy foods, to make sure you're not consuming added sugars.

Designate a fruit-cutting board.,
Be aware of pesticides.",How to Snack on Frozen Fruit3," If the package is labeled “prewashed,” you don't need to wash the fruit again, although you can if you like. Do not wash berries until you are ready to eat (or freeze) them.Wash your hands well, along with your counter tops, sink, and cutting board.
Wash fruit in cold or lukewarm running water. Warm or hot water may damage fruit.
Scrub whole fruit (like apples and pears) gently with a soft-bristled brush, or just rub the fruit with your fingers.
Use a commercial fruit-washing solution, if you like, but water should be sufficient.
If you want to soak your fruit, use 3 parts water to 1 part vinegar and soak in the sink for 5 to 10 minutes. This may help extend the life of the fruit, but is entirely optional., When freezing fruit, be careful not to stack wet pieces on top of each other. You'll wind up with a big brick of frozen fruit that is difficult to eat – and even more difficult to share.


Wash your fruit before cutting it into pieces.
Pat the pieces dry with a paper towel. You can leave a little moisture, but the pieces should not be completely wet.
Arrange your fruit pieces on a cookie sheet or large serving plate, on top of a layer of wax paper.
Be sure the pieces aren't wedged too close together, or stacked on top of each other.
Once your fruit pieces are completely frozen, you can transfer them into a tupperware container or a larger zip-lock freezer bag, and they won't stick together.

, Before freezing, skewer your fruit with toothpicks or popsicle sticks. Once frozen, your snacks will have little “handles” – making them easier to manage.


Insert one end of a popsicle stick into larger fruit pieces like banana halves.
Use toothpicks in smaller treats like melon cubes, or mini popsicles made in ice cube trays. (Decorative toothpicks are especially festive – you can find these in the baking supplies section at the grocery store.)

, Most fruits should be refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (about 4.5 degrees Celsius) or below. However, don't refrigerate tropical fruits, like mangoes, because the cool temperatures can cause shriveling, darkening, and an unpleasant flavor.Refrigerate cherries, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Don't wash them until you are ready to eat (or freeze) them, as water may damage them.
Store apples up to a week on your kitchen counter, or longer in the refrigerator.

Sip on water.,
Distract yourself.,
Repeat a mantra.,
Brush your teeth.,
Give yourself 10 – 20 minutes.",How to Stave Off Hunger1," High-intensity cardiovascular exercise can actually suppress your appetite. Studies show that this effect may last up to two hours after your workout.


On average, roughly 60 minutes of high intensity exercise can reduce your appetite. Exercise helps reduce ghrelin which is a hormone signaling your body that you're hungry;.It may help even further if you perform the exercise in intervals. Perform short bursts of intense exercise for five to 10 minutes, taking five to 10 minute rests in between.
Even moderate amounts of exercise at lower intensities may help suppress appetite. Try going for a short power walk in between meals to help cut down on your hunger pangs.;
, People who chew gum for at least one hour every morning consume an average of 67 fewer calories compared to people who didn't chew gum.Chewing gum also burns roughly 11 calories per hour.


The chewing motion tricks the nerve pathways connecting your jaw and your brain into believing that you've eaten more than you really have. As a result, your brain feels less hungry.Sugarless mint gum could be your best option. Peppermint is believed to suppress the appetite, and sugarless gum contains fewer calories than its sugar-rich counterpart.

, Drink a glass of ice cold water the next time you feel a hunger craving. Water puts weight in your stomach without adding calories.


Also, if you're dehydrated, your body may send thirst signals which feel and seem almost identical to hunger signals.Stay hydrated by sipping water all day long.
Aim for about eight to 13 glasses of hydrating fluids daily.Anything from water, decaf coffee or tea and flavored water will help keep you hydrated throughout the day.
If you need something with taste, consider adding a lemon wedge, lime wedge, or orange wedge.
Decaf peppermint tea can also work well. Peppermint is commonly believed to help suppress the appetite.

, While you might feel hungry due to a physical need for food, oftentimes, you start feeling hungry when you start feeling bored. Keeping your brain distracted can prevent it from believing that your body is hungry.There are a variety of ways to distract yourself from being hungry. Try: cleaning, reading a book or magazine, taking a hot shower or bath, calling a friend or watching a movie.
Physical activity is often best since it prevents your mind from over-thinking and triggering emotional responses that could evoke hunger. The activity does not need to be especially strenuous, though.
Avoid activities that include food or remind you of eating. For example, skip cooking shows or TV programs featuring food. This may only increase your hunger or food cravings.

, A mantra is a line or saying you can repeat to yourself as an effort to push through a difficult situation. Find one to encourage you through your hunger and repeat it whenever you sense your resolve weakening. A few examples include:""A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.""
""Nothing changes if nothing changes.""

""Nothing tastes as good as healthy feels.""


""Eat to live. Don't live to eat.""
""You can't wish yourself healthy.""

, Brush your teeth with mint-flavored toothpaste when you get a craving, especially for something sweet. The sweet, minty taste can trick your mind into thinking that your body has consumed something sweet.As previously noted, the taste of mint can also act as an appetite suppressant for many people, which is another possible reason why this practice can be helpful.
Many foods taste ""off"" or not good after you've brushed your teeth.
Brushing your teeth also may symbolize the end of your day and ""bedtime"" routine. Your mind may be more focused on getting ready for sleep rather than eating.

, Most cravings only last between five and 20 minutes.Timing your cravings may help you manage them more appropriately.


Counting down the minutes until a craving disappears can remind you that it is only a temporary thing, which may make it easier to resist.
Engage in your other distracting activities during this time. Pick up a book, give your friend a call or go for a walk. When you're done, you may notice the craving has diminished, has become more manageable or has gone away completely.

Rinse them in water three or four times to make sure that they are completely clean.If you are making a sprouted green gram salad, you should use about 1 cup of green gram per person.So if you are making a salad to serve two, sprout 2 cups of the beans.
You will be able to buy the beans from local grocery and health food stores.;
, Once you have thoroughly washed the beans you need to place them into a bowl and cover them with water. The water should completely cover the beans, with the beans about an inch below the surface of the water.


Do not use tap water for this. Soak the beans in water that has been boiled and then cooled to ensure it contains no contaminants.
Leave the beans to soak for at least seven or eight hours. You might want to leave them overnight.
After you have soaked the beans, put them in a sieve or colander and rinse them thoroughly until the water runs clear., Transfer your beans to a clean and dry container that you can close. After putting the beans in, close the lid and place the container somewhere warm. Leave them again for seven or eight hours, or overnight. After a day check them to see if they have sprouted.


If you leave them overnight you will most likely find the beans sprouting in the morning.If the beans haven't sprouted after a day, rinse them and drain them before returning them to the container.Most mung beans will sprout within 24 hours. If it takes longer than two days for the beans to sprout, then don't eat them raw. Cook before using.

, Once your green gram has sprouted nicely they are ready to eat in whatever way you like. Be sure you rinse them thoroughly again before you eat them, especially if you are having them raw in a salad.


Green gram is often used in Indian cuisine as a base for dal, curry, and salads. You can also make a delicious Haleem stew with mutton and green gram.In Filipino cuisine, green gram is eaten with sautéed meat, garlic, onions and bay leaves.
In Indonesia, green gram is made into a dessert by cooking the beans with sugar, coconut milk, and ginger."

Eat a high-protein breakfast.,
Plan ahead.,
Know how low to cut your calorie intake.,
Pair up complex carbohydrates with exercise.,
Consume high-fiber foods.,
Take your time.",How to Stave Off Hunger2," Breakfast provides your body with the nutrients it needs to last until mid-day. A protein-rich breakfast will help you feel satisfied for long periods of time.Protein takes longer to digest and absorb compared to other nutrients (like carbohydrates). Consuming protein-rich foods at breakfast helps your meal stick with you longer.Examples of protein rich breakfasts include: scrambled eggs with Canadian bacon and low-fat cheese, greek yogurt with nuts and fruit or a breakfast smoothie with protein powder, yogurt, milk and fruit.
Skipping it will make you feel hungry well before lunch and could throw off your body's rhythm for the rest of the day.
The recommendation for daily protein intake is 46 grams per day for women and 56 grams per day for men.

, Whether you're attempting to lose weight or just trying to manage hunger cravings, it may be helpful to plan out your day of meals and snacks. Try keeping a journal of the food that you eat so that you are aware of what goes into your body. There are some good apps for your phone, like My Fitness Pal, that nutritionists recommend to keep track of calories.


If you're eating irregular meals, this might increase your hunger throughout the day. Try to eat regularly scheduled meals and snacks.
Keep healthy snacks handy. If you get too hungry or are forced to wait longer before your next meal, having a planned snack can help tame your appetite and prevent overeating at meal time. Unbuttered popcorn is a good healthy snack to keep around.
Schedule a meal or a small snack roughly 30 minutes before the time you usually feel hungry. Eating the food you need before you feel hungry may prevent you from overeating.
Avoid avoid skipping any meals. Your body continuously burns calories to get you through your daily activities. As a result, you need to continuously consume calories to keep your supply of fuel stocked.

, If your calories are too low, your body may feel hungry all the time.


As a general rule, women should never eat fewer than 1,200 calories per day and men should never eat fewer than 1,500 per day.For weight loss, do not attempt to cut more than about 500 – 750 calories daily. If you want to burn more calories, try to do so through exercise. Cutting calories by 500 calories a day for seven days means that you will lose about 1 pound in a week.
The physiologic responses caused by the stress your body undergoes when deprived of nutrition can cause your body to break down its muscles in order to fuel the body with enough glucose.This is called gluconeogenesis and it is your body's response to low glucose levels.

, Complex carbohydrates take longer to break down, so they provide you with a steadier form of energy. Eating complex carbohydrates 30 to 60 minutes before you exercise will give your body the fuel it needs to make it through your workout.Complex carbohydrates are higher in fiber which makes them take longer to digest. This will help you feel satisfied longer.
If you don't give your body enough fuel for your workout, you could feel hungry afterward. Giving your body the energy it needs will reduce the risk of feeling hungry after you finish exercising.One carbohydrate of notable mention is the potato. Potato starch resists digestive enzymes, so they stay in your intestines longer than many other foods do. If potatoes seem too heavy for your pre-workout meal, you can still enjoy them during another meal to enjoy the same benefits.Pasta is another carbohydrate that is complex and good for energy stores.

, Studies have shown that a fiber-rich diet can help you manage your hunger and food cravings.It's typically recommended to consume 25 – 38 g of fiber daily (for women and men respectively).Try to consume a fiber-rich food at each meal or stack to help tame your appetite throughout the day. Items to include: whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.
On this note, one food worth looking at is grapefruit. This fruit has a low glycemic index and can actually help lower your post-meal levels of insulin overall. Grapefruits are also high in water content, so they don't have as many calories as many other foods of a comparable size.Foods that are simple sugars or simple carbohydrates cause your blood sugar to spike. When your blood sugar levels suddenly drop back down, you will go back to feeling hungry, tired, and irritable.Foods that are high in simple carbohydrates include most baked goods, like cookies, donuts, and cakes. Candy, sweetened beverages and other sugary snacks are also among the biggest culprits.

, Try not to rush through your meals. Sit down and let yourself eat slowly. Doing so can cause you to consume fewer calories while still making you feel less hungry afterward.People who eat slowly may consume roughly 88 fewer calories than those who eat quickly.Pacing yourself allows you to sense when your stomach feels full. Eating quickly, on the other hand, can cause you to eat past the point of fullness before you have a chance to detect that point.Eating slowly also causes you to drink more in between bites. The extra water can make you feel fuller for a longer period of time.

Wash and soak the beans.,
Dampen a clean muslin or cotton cloth.,
Put the green gram on the cloth.,
Store the beans overnight.,
Check for sprouts.",How to Sprout Green Gram2," Thoroughly wash the beans, rinse them, and transfer them to a large bowl. Cover them in distilled water (again, do not use tap water), ensuring that they are fully submerged and there is about an inch of water between the beans and the surface of the water. Leave them to soak for seven or eight hours, or overnight.


Rinse the beans after the soak in a sieve or fine colander, making sure that the water runs clear when you are finished.
Put the beans to one side while you prepare the next step.

, Instead of using a container to sprout the green gram in, this method requires you to wrap the beans in a dampened cloth. Begin by stretching the cloth on a flat surface and splashing it with a little water. You don't want the cloth to be sodden, so squeeze out any excess water.


If you do not have a muslin cloth, a cheesecloth or thin cotton cloth will also work.

, Place the cloth over a bowl so you can transfer the beans to the cloth without any rolling away from you. Scoop the beans onto cloth over the bowl and then tie the top of the cloth so that the beans are contained in a bundle. Allow the bundle to hang over the bowl or sink so that any excess water can drip off., Once any excess water has drained off, take the bundle and place it in a clean and dry container. The cloth should still be a little damp, but there should not be any standing water in the container. If you leave the green gram to sit in standing water they will most likely go bad.


Cover the container with a lid and leave the green gram somewhere at room temperature overnight to sprout.Check the cloth in the morning and sprinkle some more water on it if it has dried out.

, When the green gram has developed short shoots, it is ready to eat. Drain the beans completely and rinse them one more time before you eat them. You can eat green gram raw, steamed or microwaved, in a salad, stew or on its own.Once germinated, the sprouts can be preserved in a container in the refrigerator for three or four days.


If you want longer sprouts you can return them to a cloth or container and leave them for a few more hours."

Arrange your fridge’s shelves for health and food safety.",How to Stock Your Fridge with Healthy Food," Stock your fridge with leafy greens, tomatoes, carrots, and peppers. Veggies do well with a bit of moisture, so keep them in a drawer set for high humidity.It’s recommended that women consume about two cups of vegetables daily. Men should consume about three cups. Veggies should comprise at least a fourth of your total food consumption.When purchasing lettuce, go for darker, leafier varieties, like romaine. These contain more nutrients.
Remember, there’s no need to keep onions or potatoes in the fridge: just store them separately in a cool dark place.Storing them together will make the potatoes develop eyes.
Mushrooms are a great addition to your fridge, and can be added to a wide variety of dishes, including stir fries, pasta dishes, and omelets.;
, Milk, cheeses, and yogurt are all packed with calcium and vitamin D. Keep your fridge stocked with dairy to ensure healthy, strong bones.Most milk, cheeses, and yogurt contain between 20-30% of your daily required calcium, which is 1,000 to 1,200 mg for most adults. Do your best to get three servings of dairy per day.
Go for opaque milk cartons. Opacity will keep milk fresh longer than transparent containers.
If you don’t like the taste of milk or other dairy products, go for soy or rice products fortified with calcium. In moderation, you can also try chocolate and other flavored milks for tasty calcium sources.

, Stock your fridge with leaner choices such as tofu, chicken, turkey, fish, and 90-95% lean beef. Remember to store meat products in the coldest part of your fridge and on the lowest shelf.Eggs are a great, versatile source of protein. Keep them on a lower shelf to ensure they stay fresh longer., Avoid the temptation of ice cream, candy, and other unhealthy snacks by swapping them for healthy options like hummus and fruit.Keep oranges, apples, and other fruits in low humidity drawers.
Try eating hummus with baby carrots or sliced cucumber for an extra healthy snack option.

, Since sodas contain nearly no nutritional value, do your best to keep them away from your fridge. Instead, keep a pitcher of water handy, and if you need a fizzy fix, try keeping carbonated water in the fridge. Try adding flavor using mint leaves or slices of lemon, orange, or cucumber., Keep low-calorie condiments, such as mustard, salsa, and vinegar on hand. Choose a few non-creamy dressings for salads as well as a favorite marinade or two for grilling lean meats., Establish the fruits, veggies, dairy, and proteins that you like best and keep them routinely stocked. Go to the grocery store regularly, such as every few days or once a week. Before you go to the store, take an inventory of your fridge and pantry and make a list of the items that are out of stock or running low.Use a pen and pad to make a written list or, if you prefer, use your smartphone's notepad or other convenient list app.
Be thorough when you take your inventory so you don't waste your trip to the store.
Do your best to commit to your list and avoid making impulse purchases. Being prepared with a written list will help you avoid the temptation that comes with wandering through aisles.

, Do your best to limit how much you purchase from the store's middle aisles. Most grocery stores include the produce section, meat and seafood departments, and dairy refrigerators on their perimeters. Fresh foods are typically better for you than the canned and boxed items you'll find in the aisles and frozen food department.Buying fresh foods will help you reduce fat and sodium from your diet. Buy your fruits, veggies, dairy, and proteins, then grab your whole grains and head for the checkout line.
Avoiding junk foods, soda, and prepackaged foods will be great for your budget in addition to your health.

, Check online for a nearby farmer's market to find fresh, quality produce that's affordable and seasonal. Many markets set up shop weekly, and some will sell items at a discounted price toward the end of the market's hours of operation. Similarly, community supported agriculture (CSA) groups source produce directly from local farmers, usually on a weekly basis and for a flat rate.Fruits and veggies are best tasting and cheapest when they're in season and freshly picked. Your taste buds and wallet will both love weekly trips to a local farmer's market or a regular delivery from a CSA group.
Search online for a nearby CSA and check their website to find out how to join. Alternatively, consult your neighbors or friends in the area who might be knowledgeable about local farms and CSA groups.Remember that you always can choose your items at the farmer's market, but usually a CSA will package a set amount of seasonal produce for you without your direct input. Carefully read the terms of any CSA group before joining to avoid getting stuck with 20 pounds a week of veggies that you don't like., Joining a warehouse or club store can help you cut your grocery budget in the long run. Furthermore, buying items like cereals, pastas, beans, rice, and other long-lasting or non-perishable items can help save time, provided that you have a little extra storage space.For meats sold in bulk, separate the package into meal-sized portions and refrigerate a few for immediate use. Freeze the rest of your portioned meats for later use. For example, dividing 36 drumsticks into smaller sets before freezing will avoid the inconvenience of having to thaw the entire package when you only needed a few pieces.
Many warehouse and club stores also carry seasonal produce in bulk, which is especially helpful for households with enough people to avoid spoilage and uneaten items.

, Remember that losing weight is about eating plenty of healthy foods, not just eating less food. Try committing to a set of fridge rules, such as “no trans fats or no high sugar foods allowed.”Double up on the fruits and veggies, but cut down on juices. Eliminate those calories from juices by swapping for water.
Always go for non- or low-fat options for milk, yogurt, and other potentially high-calorie items instead of skipping out on them altogether.
Try keeping a motivational message or picture on your fridge door that you’ll see before opening it up for a snack.

, Keep plenty of quick, go-to snacks on hand, like fruits or fat-free Greek yogurt. Go for sugar-free jams and fruit spreads. Get calcium from low-fat or skim milk and yogurt, and keep cheese consumption low.Keep cabbage on hand for a low-sugar source of vitamin C.
Go for fruits that are smaller than the size of your fist for diabetic-friendly portion.

, If someone in your family has a serious food allergy, try to eliminate that item from your fridge. Keep allergens like milk, eggs, or wheat products only if the allergen can be carefully sealed and separated from items everyone in the household consumes.Ask a doctor for more information about the severity of an allergy. For some, a reaction is so severe that they cannot come into any contact whatsoever with the allergen, so it must be completely eliminated from the fridge or pantry.

, If you or someone in your household has specific dietary needs, it's a good idea to talk to a medical professional. A registered dietitian nutritionist can help you develop a meal plan that best fits your health needs. Ask your regular doctor or a local health clinic for a referral, and check with your insurance provider about your coverage options.Weight management issues, digestive issues (such as celiac and Crohn's diseases), diabetes, food allergies, cancer, and heart disease are all conditions that benefit from consulting a registered dietitian.

, Setting aside time once a week for food prep will keep your meals easy, organized, and properly portioned. Invest in tupperware containers with multiple compartments, and measure out quantities that are consistent with your dietary needs.For example, measure, cut, and store cup-sized servings, like three medium stalks of broccoli or a green pepper.
If you’re on a strict weight-loss diet, measure out a quarter-cup sized healthy snack, like fruit or carrot sticks with a separate container for a tablespoon of peanut butter.
Try to divide leftovers into healthy portions using multi-compartment tupperware instead of storing large quantities of individual items together.

, In addition to keeping healthy portions, proper containers will keep your food fresher and safe to eat. Always keep food covered or wrapped tightly, in tightly sealed bags, or in airtight storage containers.Eat ready-to-eat foods like lunch meats as soon as possible, preferably within a day or two of purchase.
Keep your food safe and healthy to eat by limiting the amount of time you keep the door open. Opening the door too many times or for too long a period of time can increase the temperature and encourage pathogen growth.

, Keep meat products on bottom shelf so drippings don’t get on other food items. Store leftovers and ready to eat items on the top shelf. Maintain a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) or lower, and keep some space between food items to maintain temperature.Keep eggs and milk in colder parts of the fridge, like toward the back and on lower shelves. Avoid storing these items in the door to avoid bacteria growth.
Remember to set your high and low humidity drawers for veggies and fruit, respectively.

Determine your budget.,
Search online for snack boxes.,
Choose a snack box ""focus."",
Look up nutritional information.,
Consider choosing a customizable subscription.,
Choose small portions.,
Review sign-up terms and conditions.,
Log-on regularly.,
Evaluate your snack box.,
Plan to cancel in advance if needed.",How to Select a Healthy Snack Subscription Box," One of the first things you'll need to consider when signing up for a snack box subscription is your overall budget. These fun subscriptions can get pricey over time.


Review multiple sites and their costs. Subscriptions can range between $12 a month to over $70.Also consider how frequently you're choosing to get your boxes shipped. If it's only $15 per box, but ships two times a month, you'll be shelling out $30 monthly for your subscription. Some companies will offer a cheaper price per box, if you sign-up for multiple months at a time.
Snack boxes are a great idea if you like the variety, enjoy getting a treat in the mail or find it convenient to have healthy snacks shipped right to your home. However, you may find it cheaper to buy similar snacks in bulk or make them yourself at home.;
, If you're interested in signing up for a possible snack box subscription service, you'll need to look up a variety of different sites, brands and even reviews of the products.


Since these subscriptions have been so popular, it's easy to find them online with a quick search. Look up ""snack box subscription services"" or ""mail order snack boxes"" online. This will come up with a large listing of different service brands.
You can take the time to review each brand that comes up for pricing, variation of snacks, etc.
However, there are many, many different snack box subscription services. It may be helpful to look for review articles. Many blogs and online newspapers offer reviews of multiple different snack box subscriptions telling readers about the pros and cons and which services would match well with certain likes or dislikes.
Narrow your choices down to two or three services and make the final decision based on what's best for your tastes, timing and budget.

, When you're looking at different snack box subscription services, you'll notice that there are many different types with different focuses. There are international boxes, sweet boxes or organic boxes. Choose the type of healthy snack box that fits you best.


You can choose organic and natural snacks if organic principles are important to you. Look for snack subscriptions that advertise organic or additive-free products. But remember that just because something is labeled organic doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy.
You can stick to 100% vegan or vegetarian based snack boxes. If you prefer to leave out the meat or animal products, choose a subscription box that only features plant-based treats.
There are also high protein or low-carb options to try. If you're trying to stick to a high-protein diet or looking to add a hit of protein to your active day, try choosing a snack box that offers high-protein or low-carb snacks.
If you have food allergies, see which companies are able to accommodate this. For instance, if you are allergic to soy, can you specify a soy-free box? \

, Choose companies that are transparent about the nutritional content of all of their snacks. Make sure the snacks will fit with your current diet and nutrition goals.

For example, if you have diabetes and must eat a snack each afternoon, brownie bites would not be helpful for your goal of blood sugar control. Or if you are trying to lose weight, a subscription that is sending you snacks with 500 calories a pop would not be helpful.

, Snack box subscriptions also vary in how much they allow you customize items or choose what types of snacks are included in your box.


Some snack boxes are 100% customizable. That means, you log-in regularly and choose exactly what types of treats are going to be in your box. This is great if you're hands on and enjoy rifling through a bunch of different options.
Other subscriptions are only semi-customizable. Either through a rating system or your profile preferences, the subscription will change up what's included in your box.
There are a few subscription services that are not customizable.These are great if you like a surprise every month!

, Snack box subscriptions can also be tailored by size. You can order a larger box or larger portions or servings of different snacks.


If you're trying to be healthy and stick to healthier foods, it might be wise to order a smaller box (it'll probably be cheaper as well). It may be less tempting than to have to go through a large box of treats throughout the month.
You can also choose single servings of your snacks or larger packages that contain multiple servings. If you're the type to eat a whole bag or box of an item, it might be ""safer"" to go with smaller, individually wrapped snacks.

, Like with any other type of subscription, it's also important to thoroughly read all the terms and conditions. This way, you'll know exactly what to expect.


Some snack box subscriptions offer you discounts when you sign-up for multiple months or several boxes worth of the subscription. Review whether you pay 100% up front or month-by-month.Read the fine print. Sometimes even when you sign up for a multi-month subscription, the company will continue to charge your credit card after that time is up.
Review how to cancel your subscription.

, Most snack box subscription services do require you to be involved somewhat regularly. Sign on to your account at least once a month to review your subscription.Check in regularly to select your snacks. Depending on how ""customizable"" your subscription is, you'll probably want to log-on and manually select your snacks or genres of snacks.
Also monitor your billing and payment of the subscription. Make sure you fully understand when and how you're being billed.
Be interactive with your subscription. ""Like"" and ""dislike"" snacks on your profile or log-in page, as many sites take your thoughts into consideration when sending or recommending different items to you., Getting a snack box in the mail can be fun and exciting; however, it's important to evaluate your snack box service after a few months of orders to make sure it's still right for you. Ask yourself:


Do I like the snacks that are sent to me? Are they good quality?
Is the price fair? Am I getting a good deal for the snacks that are sent or is there a possibility of finding a cheaper service or making these snacks at home?
Am I using the service fully? Am I actually eating the snacks or do they get left uneaten or given away to friends or co-workers?

, Although snack subscriptions are fun and tasty, you may eventually want to cancel this service. Make sure you understand how to cancel your subscription to avoid any unwanted fees.


Most snack subscription services will require you to manually cancel your account. You'll need to log-on to cancel, email or call the company to cancel your account.
Also to check to see how much advance notice they require. If you cancel the day before your next box ships, the company might send the box anyways and still charge your card.
If you only want to stop the subscription for a month or two, many offer the option to ""skip"" a month. You can keep your subscription but take a month or so off.

Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Eat lots of lean protein.,
Consume spices that boost GSH.,
Eat foods rich in alpha lipoic acid.,
Eat foods rich in selenium.,
Get plenty of exercise.",How to Raise Your Glutathione Level1," Several of these foods have been shown to be good natural sources of glutathione, but their GSH content is destroyed by overcooking or processing. To get the most glutathione out of your fruits and veggies, eat them fresh whenever possible.Fruits and vegetables high in glutathione include broccoli, avocado, okra, spinach, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, mustard greens, cabbage, asparagus, grapefruit, apples, oranges, and cherries (though there are many more).Despite the benefits of these foods, you should always strive for a balanced diet. Overdoing it on the fruits and vegetables can create problems for your digestive system if you do not also get enough dietary protein.;
, Three amino acids contribute to glutathione's makeup (so-called ""precursors""): cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. Lean protein sources, especially meats, contain naturally high levels of these amino acids, especially cysteine (which is also the most important one). If your diet includes lots of these lean proteins, your body will produce more glutathione.High-quality sources of lean protein include poultry and egg yolks, milk, and yogurt. To get as much cysteine from your diet as possible (and therefore increase your body's glutathione production), you should try to eat at least two servings of lean protein per day.

, Some spices include chemical compounds (such as curcumin) that promote glutathione production.These include turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, and cardamom.Eating foods that already contain high levels of multiple glutathione-promoting spices can help you to further boost your glutathione without much extra effort. Many curry dishes fall into this category.
Cinnamon can be added to many desserts or sweet foods to add a flavorful kick while also contributing to higher glutathione levels. It's a win-win!

, Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) promotes natural glutathione production. ALA is also an antioxidant and can regenerate other antioxidants that have been ""used up,"" including Vitamin C and E, helping to renew their ability to scavenge free radicals in your cells.Foods containing high levels of ALA include: liver, peas, spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes. Several of these foods (such as Brussels sprouts) are also naturally high in glutathione, so these are particularly good options.For a high dose of dietary ALA and glutathione, look for recipes that combine some of these food items, such as stews, salads, or casseroles.

, Selenium is a mineral with antioxidant abilities that contributes to GSH production. In addition to being naturally present in many foods, food items from selenium-rich environments will have higher levels. Selenium is also essential for the production of enzymes containing glutathione.Many meats have high selenium content, especially crab, tuna, liver, fish, and poultry; however, their selenium content depends on where the animal was raised and the natural selenium content of the soil and water in its habitat.Several plants are good sources of selenium, as well. The ones with the highest selenium content are grown in soil with naturally high selenium levels. Good plant sources include: Brazil nuts, pinto beans, mushrooms, many seeds, brown rice, cabbage, broccoli, and spinach., Physical activity increases your metabolism, which boosts natural glutathione production. Aerobic exercises (those that get your heart rate up for an extended period) are best for improving metabolism. These include brisk walking, jogging, running, cycling, circuit training, and swimming, among others.Check with your doctor before beginning an exercise routine if you are at all concerned about your current level of health and/or physical fitness.
Adopt an exercise routine that fits your lifestyle and fitness level. Don't try to go too hard right away or you might get discouraged and be less likely to stick with it. Start with 20 minutes of exercise three days per week and move up from there as your fitness improves.

Use low-fat or fat free instead of whole fat dairy.,
Supplement butter with unsweetened applesauce.,
Supplement butter with fruit and vegetable purees.,
Mix flaxseed and water to replace eggs.",How to Reduce Fat in a Recipe1," When a recipe calls for milk, use fat-free skim milk, 2% milk, or 1% milk instead of whole milk. These milk varieties are specifically processed to reduce the fat content. Cream cheese, sour cream, yogurt, and cheese also come in low-fat varieties.It’s worth noting that low-fat dairy products may slightly alter the taste or consistency of your dishes.;
, Butter keeps baked goods moist and binds them together, but applesauce can serve the same function with less fat. Replace half of the butter with applesauce. If the recipe calls for ½ cup (118 ml) of butter, use ¼ cup (60 ml) butter and ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce.This works especially well in cakes, but can be used in most baked goods. Experiment with applesauce in your favorite baked goods and see if people who taste them can tell the difference.

, Pureed bananas, peaches, prunes, pumpkin, and squash can substitute for half of the butter in baked goods. Use ripe fruit so they are soft and sweet. Mash the fruit or use a blender or food processor to puree the fruit completely.This works best for rich baked goods like chocolate cake and spiced muffins. Experiment to see which fruit works best in the recipes you usually make.
Even if you only replace ¼ of the butter with fruit, you’ll reduce the fat and make your baked goods healthier.

, For each egg that a recipe calls for, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Use a blend or coffee grinder to grind the flaxseed before you mix it with the water. Blend the mixture to produce a fluffy, sticky substance. Then stir the flaxseed mixture into the recipe when the egg is called for.Use in baked goods that can handle the nutty taste of flaxseed. Examples are pancakes, waffles, muffins, carrot cake, and oatmeal cookies.

Take a multivitamin that promotes glutathione.,
Take MSM supplements.,
Consider glutathione inhalants.,
Get glutathione injections.,
Use transdermal glutathione products.",How to Raise Your Glutathione Level2," The multivitamin itself will not likely contain glutathione, but many have several vitamins and minerals that improve glutathione production. It can be difficult to get enough of certain vitamins from your diet, so a multivitamin is a good complement to a healthy diet. Find a multivitamin that includes:Vitamin C
Vitamin E
Vitamin B1
Vitamin B2
Vitamin B6
Vitamin B12
Folate
Selenium
Magnesium
Zinc
ALA supplements are also available, but check with your doctor to determine the appropriate dosage for you.

, MSM (or Methylsulfonylmethane ) is a mineral compound that provides a source of sulfur, which is necessary for producing both ALA and Vitamin B1, which in turn increase glutathione levels.If you are not getting enough sulfur in your diet, ask your doctor about supplementing with MSM.


Sulfur is what gives glutathione its antioxidant abilities, so any other method you use to boost glutathione will be useless if your sulfur levels are too low. MSM is just one way to obtain sulfur; it can also be acquired from eating several types of raw fruits and vegetables.MSM is also believed by some people to provide relief from pain and some other symptoms of arthritis and various other joint conditions; however, there is not much scientific research to support this., Your doctor may recommend a nebulizer inhaler to deliver this form of glutathione supplement; however, it is usually only recommended for people with genetic conditions that cause glutathione deficiency.Some lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, are believed by some to be helped by glutathione inhalants, but evidence to support this is sparse.You should not use glutathione inhalants without a doctor's prescription or recommendation.
Do not use this form of glutathione supplement as an alternative to dietary or oral supplementary glutathione or its precursors. There are better ways to boost your glutathione levels if you are not severely deficient!

, This type of glutathione supplementation is only recommended for individuals with medically diagnosed illnesses known to be helped by glutathione. Injections are done intravenously and should not be attempted by anyone but a licensed medical professional.The most well-supported use of glutathione injections is relief from the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. This is something that an oncologist (cancer doctor) must prescribe.
No other purpose for glutathione injection is broadly accepted by the medical community as effective; however, some people believe it to be useful for lots of other illnesses, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, some forms of anemia, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and male infertility.

, Transdermal glutathione is applied to the skin and absorbed over a short period of time. There is some evidence that glutathione creams improve certain skin conditions and generally make the skin look more youthful.This type of glutathione supplementation usually comes in the form of a cream or patch and is available through online pharmacies without a prescription.


There is no medical or scientific evidence to suggest glutathione levels in the body can be significantly improved by transdermal creams or patches.
Although no prescription is required for transdermal glutathione, it is best to talk to your doctor before using glutathione creams.
There is a chance you could experience a rash or skin irritation when taking glutathione this way.

Choose lean cuts of meat.,
Choose meat with little visible fat.,
Trim the fat off before you cook meat.,
Cook meat ahead of time and scrape off the hardened fat.,
Use less meat than the recipe calls for.",How to Reduce Fat in a Recipe2," Removing meat from your diet can significantly reduce fat, but if you aren’t willing to do that, choose leaner meat. Most store-bought meat will have a label that says the lean percentage. The higher the lean percentage, the less fat there is. If you can’t tell by looking at the label of the meat, don’t be afraid to ask an employee which meats are leanest.

Cooking meat releases most of the fat anyway. Buying lean means you can reduce even more fat overall.

, Compare the various packed selections and choose ones that don’t have much fat on them. It will save you time in preparation because you won’t have to cut the fat off yourself. This is especially helpful when buying steaks, roasts, and pork chops, as these tend to have sections of fat left on., Although some fat melts off of the meat when you cook it, the meat still soaks in the fat as it cooks. Use a sharp knife and cut off as much of the fat as you can before you cook the meat. Don’t bother slicing into the red muscle part of the meat, just trim the fat that is around the edges.Remove the skin from poultry before you eat it, as this also contains extra fat.
The muscle itself still contains fat, so some fat will still be in the meat.

, If you have time, cook the meat at least a couple of hours before you add it to a dish. Set it in the refrigerator so that the cooked off fat can harden, then scrape the excess fat off and discard it. This works well for large chunks of meat, like a roast, but may not work as well for ground meat., When meat is part of a recipe and not the main dish, reduce fat by using less meat. Even a ¼ or ⅓ less meat in the dish will reduce the overall fat. You can replace the meat and bolster the dish by adding extra vegetables to fill out the quantity of the recipe."

Use a non-stick cooking pan instead of cooking with oil.,
Measure oil instead of pouring it from the bottle into the pan.,
Steam vegetables instead of pan frying.",How to Reduce Fat in a Recipe3," When you cook in a skillet, you typically spray it or pour some oil into the pan to keep the food from sticking. Switch to a non-stick pan that removes the necessity for oil. Even if you don’t use much oil, you’re adding fat to the recipe that is unnecessary when a non-stick pan achieves the same purpose.Copper skillets are a great non-stick option. Teflon coated pans are another good option.
Cooking without oil may require you to change the way you cook the food.

, Recipes that instruct you to add oil to the pan typically list a specific amount, but you may be in the practice of simply pouring oil into the pan. Start following the measuring instructions and even try using a little less oil than you are instructed.If your recipe does not list an amount, try using less than you think you need and see if it ends up being enough. Experiment to find the right measurement when one isn’t given.

, Place vegetables one layer thick in a flat pan and add just enough water to cover the bottom. Cover the dish with a lid and heat for a few minutes in the microwave. Then let the dish sit for another 4-5 minutes. The vegetables will get tender without the fat of butter or oil.Steam vegetables in a steamer or in the oven if you don’t want to use a microwave.

Make healthy snacks available.,
Let them choose what to eat.,
Let your kids see you making healthy choices.,
Show them how to indulge.,
Sit down to meals together.,
Talk about fullness, and work on portion control.,
Be adventurous.,
Avoid cooking separate meals.,
Skip food labeling.,
Avoid talking about weight.",How to Role Model Healthy Eating," As you go around the store, talk about why you are choosing things from each section and how they contribute to your overall diet. It can also help to let kids make some choices, such as choosing a vegetable for dinner or a fruit to go with their lunches.You can also point out healthy choices you are making, such as, ""We're buying whole-wheat pasta because it's healthier for us. It has more fiber."" You could also say things like, ""We're picking the low-fat version of this yogurt because we don't want too much fat in our diet."";
, Cooking is an important life skill, and you should encourage your kids to learn how to prepare their own healthy meals. Plus, being in the kitchen with you as you plan and cook the meal will help them to realize what goes into making a balanced and healthy plate.Let them make choices in the kitchen, within limits. For instance, you could offer them the choice between two vegetables.
As you cook, discuss the choices you're making. You could say, ""Tonight we're going to have chicken breast, which is a healthy, lean protein, along with whole wheat pasta and broccoli, a vegetable. We'll add some marinara to the pasta to add flavor and another serving of vegetables. We always like to have a lean protein, a grain (preferably a whole grain), and at least one serving of vegetables, but the more vegetables we eat, the better.""
You can also talk about why you might pair something less healthy with something healthier, like ""Because we're having pizza, which is higher in fat than some other things we eat, we're going to have a light salad on the side.""

, Children ages 2 – 12 consume an estimated 30% of their daily calories in the form of sweet and salty snacks. Children have small stomachs, so they will eat smaller meals and may need to snack often.Keep healthy snacks on-hand that your kids can grab quickly. If you make it easy for you and them to choose healthy food, you're both more likely to do it. Plus, if your kids see you are making an effort to provide healthy snacks, they're more likely to choose them.Snacks should include lean protein, fruits, vegetables and dairy. Keep portion sizes small — the snack should not be a meal replacement.
For instance, have small baggies of fresh veggies and hummus dip on hand or celery sticks to dip into peanut butter. You could also have fruit on the counter that's already been washed. Yogurt also makes a quick, healthy snack, as does cheese with whole-grain crackers.
Buy less nutritious foods only on occasion. While you don't want to ban fatty, salty, or sugary foods altogether, make them something you only buy once in awhile as a treat, rather than something you keep on hand all the time. Your kids won't feel deprived, but you also won't be filling them with less nutritious snacks all the time., While you may choose what is provided at a certain meal, let your kids choose what to eat. You don't want to make meals a battleground, as that can give your kids anxiety around food. In fact, it's fine if kids choose not to eat, as they know when the next meal will be.When your kids do eat their veggies, make sure to praise them for doing so as positive reinforcement., When you reach for a snack, pick up some veggies or fruit or another healthy option. Your kids need to see you enjoying healthy options. Watching you munch on some raw carrots, for instance, may inspire them to try some themselves.If you're out somewhere and you choose a healthy food over a less healthy one, talk about why you made that choice. For instance, you could say, ""I'm going to pick carrot sticks over a brownie because I haven't had any vegetables today, and I should include them in my diet. Plus, I had some sugar in my morning coffee, so I should limit my sugar now."", That is, you of course want a treat every now and then, too, which you can do in front of your kids and still be a good role model. However, make sure you do so in moderation and only occasionally. Show your kids how to savor treats and then go back to the healthier stuff.For example, say you get a craving for chocolate. You could say, ""I really want some chocolate tonight. However, I'm only going to eat a couple of small pieces because that's all I need to satisfy my craving. Eating just a little bit and really savoring it helps me enjoy it more.""
You could also say, ""We're going to eat ice cream for dessert, so let's eat a really healthy dinner of salad with beans for protein.""

, Your child can't see your eating habits if you're not eating together. Often, kids who eat meals with their parents and siblings will eat more of the healthier foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and dairy. Try to eat at least one meal a day together, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner.Don't use mealtimes to have serious discussions about behavior or other problems. If you create tension at mealtime, your kids won't want to come to eat, making it more difficult to model healthy eating., When you do sit down to dinner, make sure you are serving correct portion sizes. If you're not sure what servings should be, make sure to research them, including information on each person in your family, as the amount a person needs can change with sex and age. Also, be sure to talk about things like how you stop eating when you get full.For instance, as you get near the end of your plate, you could say, ""I don't think I'm going to finish those last bites because I'm getting full.""

, You can't expect your kids to try new foods if you're not willing to do so yourself. Make sure your kids see you trying out new things and experimenting with new foods, both in the kitchen and out at restaurants. When they see you being adventurous, they may be more willing to branch out themselves.When you're trying a new food, describe the experience out loud, so your kids will get a better picture. Ask the kids if they want to try it, as they may be more willing when you're trying something new for the first time.Offer new foods to your kids one at time. One way to make it more comfortable is to serve a new food with something your kids like.

, When your kids are young, they may want foods like chicken nuggets and hot dogs on a regular basis. However, you don't need to be a short-order cook. Instead, cook one healthy meal that the whole family eats. Your children may balk at first, but when they see the rest of you enjoying it (and they get hungry enough), they'll start trying different foods.Plus, by not cooking them special foods, you're exposing them to a larger variety of foods so they can develop a wider palette.

, Labeling certain foods as ""bad"" may seem like a good way to keep your kids from eating them. However, often foods that are restricted become the ones your kids will gravitate to when given the chance. A better option is to teach eating everything in moderation, making sure to keep your diet balanced., While you may be concerned about your weight or even your children's weight, it's not a good idea to talk about it in front of them. Doing so can cause them to develop body image issues. Instead, place your focus on eating healthy foods and developing healthy bodies by exercising."

Think about why you want to quit eating junk food.,
Make a commitment to yourself.,
Throw away your junk food.,
Stock your kitchen with healthy foods.,
Drink more water during the day.",How to Quit Junk Food1," Once you have considered the damage that eating junk food can do to your body and the risks it can pose to your health, you should think about why you want to quit eating junk food. Maybe you are concerned about your weight and want to make a big change to get to a healthy weight. Or maybe you are an avid athlete and you want to improve your performance by putting better fuel into your body. No matter what your reason is, it is a good idea to really think about it.


Try writing out your reason or reasons for wanting to quit eating junk food. Getting your thoughts down on paper can help you to increase your motivation to quit eating junk food and really make a change.;
, Once you have identified your motivation, you should make a commitment to yourself. You can do this by writing out a contract specifying the types of foods that you do not want to eat any more. You should also include details about food that you will eat instead or how you will deal with junk food cravings. It is also a good idea to list your reasons for wanting to make these changes. After you are finished writing up your contract, read it over and then sign and date it.Make sure to be very specific in your contract so that you understand what you are committing yourself to.
Post your contract somewhere that you will see it every day, such as on a mirror or on your refrigerator.

, After you have committed to stop eating junk, toss out anything that you have in your house. Keeping junk food around when you are trying to avoid it is a recipe for failure, so it is best to get rid of it right away. Stop buying junk food as well and ask those that you live with to keep junk food out of common areas so that you will be less tempted to eat it.Out of sight; out of mind. Most times, junk food is consumed on a basis of convenience and boredom. If junk food isn't in your house, you are less likely to leave home and seek it out.

, To make sure that you are not tempted to go out and get some junk food when you are feeling hungry, keep your kitchen stocked with plenty of healthy choices. Buy whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, milk, eggs, and whole grains. An easy way to steer clear of unhealthy choices at the grocery store is to avoid the inner aisles of the grocery store and get most of your food from the outer ring instead.The best way to ensure healthy eating is to be prepared and have those foods readily available to you. Consider meal prepping too!
Prepare healthy snacks ahead of time so that you always have a quick, healthy option on hand. Put fresh fruit or vegetable slices into plastic bags in the fridge. Keep some nuts and dried fruit in your gym bag. Or, stock your fridge at work with fat free Greek yogurt and string cheese.

, Water keeps you hydrated and helps you to feel full in between meals. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep yourself from reaching for junk food. Staying hydrated with water will also help to prevent you from grabbing a can of soda or some other unhealthy sugary beverage."

Tell a friend about your commitment.,
Develop mindful eating habits.,
Learn to think critically about food advertisements.",How to Quit Junk Food2," It is important to get support from friends and family when you are trying to make a major life change. Make sure that you tell people about your commitment to quit eating junk food and ask for their support. You will be much more likely to be successful if you ask for help than if you try to go it alone.This is also a way to have others hold you accountable. It is much easier to quit when no one is watching.

, You may be reaching for junk food because you tend to eat mindlessly. To change your tendency to reach for junk, try to practice mindful eating habits. Pay attention to the smell, look, and taste of your food. Try to eat slowly and avoid eating while you are distracted or feeling stressed.


Ask yourself some questions before you reach for food. As yourself: 1) am I really hungry or is there a different reason why I want to eat something right now? 2) what do I want to eat? Asking yourself these questions can help prevent you from reaching for junk food or eating something that you do not really want to eat., People are more likely to overeat and reach for junk food after watching fast food or junk food advertisements. Since ads are difficult to avoid while watching TV, teach yourself to see these commercials with a critical eye. Don’t just accept what the ad is telling you.Ask questions about the ad and consider the way the ad presented the food. Was anything exaggerated? If so, what?

Learn about healthy cooking techniques.,
Start an exercise routine.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Quit Junk Food3," If you eat junk food because you don’t know how to cook, now is a good time to learn. Knowing how to cook healthy food that you actually want to eat will help keep you from turning to junk food at meal times. If you are new to healthy cooking, buy yourself a cookbook with easy to follow, appetizing healthy recipes. Consider this: a vegetable is a healthy food until it is coated in batter and deep fried. You really can ruin a healthy food by the cooking method you choose. Focus on grilling, baking, broiling, steaming and sauteeing.

, Getting into an exercise routine can provide multiple health benefits from burning more calories to reducing your risk of developing certain medical conditions. If you are quitting junk food as part of a larger goal to get healthy, then you should also consider starting an exercise routine. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise every day. Walking is a great option if you are just getting started., Not getting enough sleep can affect your impulse control and decision making abilities, which can lead to poor food choices. People who are sleep deprived are more likely to reach for fatty and sugary foods and to consume more calories overall.Research has shown that those who get less sleep end up craving more carbohydrates. Avoid this by getting adequate sleep each night.
To avoid reaching for junk food, make sure that you are getting between 7-9 hours of sleep every night. Everyone is different, so you may require more or less sleep depending on your age and activity level."

Think about the purpose of food.,
Consider the problems associated with junk food.,
Learn how eating junk affects your health.",How to Quit Junk Food4," How do you think about food? If you look at food as fuel for your body, you may be less likely to reach for junk foods. Think about the benefits of eating healthy foods like fruit, whole grains, and lean proteins instead of junk food. Healthy options provide better fuel for your body so that you can exercise, think, and function at your best., Knowing about some of the problems associated with junk food may help you to quit eating it. Not only is junk food usually much higher in sugar, fat, and calories than healthy foods, it also lacks nutritional value and does not provide the same level of satiety as healthy foods.Nutritional Value. A food’s nutritional value refers to the amount of vitamins and minerals that a food provides. Vitamins and minerals are a natural part of healthy foods, but they are stripped out of junk foods when the ingredients are processed.
Satiety. Junk foods do not provide the long lasting satiety (a feeling of fullness) that healthy foods can provide, so you are more likely to eat more calories overall by choosing junk foods.

, Eating junk food increase your caloric intake, which may lead to weight gain. If you become overweight or even obese, you will be at a higher risk of developing certain medical conditions. Some of the conditions associated with obesity include:Stroke
High Blood Pressure
Heart Disease
Some Cancers
Diabetes
Sleep Apnea
Gallbladder Disease
Gout
OsteoarthritisDepression"

Soak the ham before heating it.,
Drain the ham drippings while it heats.,
Serve the ham with neutralizing sides.,
Slice the ham very thinly.",How to Reduce Salt in Cooked Ham1," Place the ham in a large bowl or pot and pour cold water over it until it is covered. Let it soak overnight to give time for the salt to soak out into the water. Remove the ham from the water and pat it dry with a paper towel before heating it in the oven., Prepare your ham with your choice of glaze or seasonings and place it in the oven to cook. After 20 minutes of baking, remove the ham from the oven and carefully pour off the pan drippings, which will be very salty. If desired, add more glaze or seasonings and place the ham back in the oven., Offset the saltiness of your ham by serving it with neutralizing side dishes. Potatoes, rice, and pasta are bland enough to round out the overall flavor of your meal. Avoid using pre-packaged side dishes, which are likely to be high in sodium on their own., To reduce the intensity of the ham's saltiness, cut it into very thin slices before serving it. Thick slices of ham can overpower a meal with their salt-heavy taste. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the ham as evenly as possible."

Pour vinegar on the ham.,
Squeeze a lemon onto the ham.,
Cover the ham with a creamy sauce.,
Drizzle honey on the ham.,
Baste the ham with oil or butter.",How to Reduce Salt in Cooked Ham2," Add a teaspoon of distilled vinegar to your over-salted cooked ham before storing it. The acidity of the vinegar will counteract the saltiness and even out the flavour. Pour the vinegar over the ham slowly to cover it evenly.Avoid adding too much vinegar to the ham, which will create a sour flavor.

, Cut a small lemon in half and squeeze both parts over the ham. Disburse the lemon juice evenly so that the ham is evenly covered. The tanginess of the lemon will offset the extra saltiness.Do this before serving the ham, or before storing it.

, Adding a creamy sauce (e.g., hollandaise sauce) to your ham will help to mask its saltiness. The creamy component will make the dish taste milder and balance out the flavour. Pour the sauce over sliced pieces of ham before serving it., Pour honey on your ham to reduce its saltiness. Salty and sugary flavors balance each other out, and honey complements ham perfectly. Add enough honey to coat the ham entirely (approximately 1 cup for a 5 lb/0.5 kg ham).You can also drizzle honey on sliced pieces of ham before serving it.

, Adding an extra source of fat (e.g., oil or butter) to your ham will add an extra layer of flavour to ""absorb"" the saltiness of the meat. Baste your ham with a basting brush dipped in olive oil or melted butter, coating the entire ham. Be sure to use unsalted butter to avoid adding to the saltiness.For best results, baste the ham halfway through heating it.

Learn as much as you can about the detox process.,
Take note of how you feel before the detox.,
Stock your kitchen with foods you will use during your detox.,
Change your eating habits in preparation for your detox diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Prepare for a Detox," This will help you plan to detox your body in a way that is best for you, as well as mentally prepare you for what to expect. Take the following things into consideration:


Side effects. As your body releases toxic stores from its tissues, those toxins are released into the bloodstream and may cause any combination of a number of side effects such as rashes, head and body aches, foul breath, body odor, insomnia, mood swings, diarrhea, constipation and flu-like symptoms. Be prepared for these symptoms and commit to persevering through the discomfort.
Types of detox. There is no 1 right way for how to detox, but all detox plans center on a change of eating habits. You may opt for a fasting detox, any of a number of special detox diets or a combination of both. Prepare to detox with a plan you think you can stick to.
Length of detox. A detox may last for as long as you choose, depending on the type of detox you opt for, but you should be able to notice changes in the way you feel as early on as 2 to 3 days.;
, Record these notes in a detox journal. Be sure to include both mental and physical perceptions, as you will want to use them to assess the progress of your detox.

, Additionally, throw out or hide foods that are not included in your detox diet. If your detox plan includes supplements, make sure you have the supplements you will need on hand.

, Scale down the amount of processed and fatty foods that you eat in favor of fresh fruits and vegetables, get into the habit of drinking a glass of water every 2 to 3 hours and cut back on caffeine, refined sugar and alcohol. The sooner you begin to acclimate your body to the changes in diet required by a detox, the more comfortable you will be as you detox your body.

, Smoking introduces a number of harmful toxins into your system, and is detrimental to any detox plan.

, You will undergo physical, emotional, and mental changes as you detox your body, and these changes may cause sleep disturbances. Make sure you are well rested before you begin your detox.

The American Heart Association recommends that children ages 2 through 18 consume no more than 25g of sugar per day or about 6 teaspoons.Start a food journal or a running list of how much sugar your child consumes. You can tally up the whole day or track their sugar intake meal by meal.
If your child is consuming more than 25g of sugar daily, it's a good idea to start working on reducing how much they currently eat. If they're already under the 25g limit, you can continue to monitor their diet to make sure this doesn't increase.;
, When trying to reduce sugar in your child's diet, the first place you should look is the food label on the packaged items you purchase from the grocery store.


The nutrition facts panel is required on every packaged item. One of the first items you'll notice here is the serving size. Make sure that you're only providing your child one serving or accounting for giving them 2 or more servings.The total sugar is listed under ""carbohydrates"" on the nutrition fact panel. Scan down and look at how many grams of sugar are in each serving.
Note that the current labeling laws do not require companies to disclose the number of grams of sugar that come from a natural source or are added sugars., The nutrition facts panel unfortunately doesn't tell you where the sugar is coming from and whether or not it's a natural or added sugar. However, the ingredient list will give you more specific information.


The ingredient list will show you if there are only natural sugars or added sugars. If you see added sugars listed here, you'll know that some of the sugar is not coming from a natural source.Examples of added sugar names include: high fructose corn syrup, cane juice, evaporated cane juice, rice syrup, sugar, corn syrup solids, maltose, malt syrup, molasses, honey, maple syrup, sucrose or granulated sugar.You will also see if there are any artificial sweeteners here as well. Items like aspartame, sucralose, truvia or stevia may be listed here. Note, artificial sweeteners are considered non-nutritive so are not accounted for in the nutrition fact panel or total sugar.

, If your child consumes some meals and snacks away from home, you'll need to account for the sugar from those foods and make an effort to be aware of exactly what they're eating.


Many children eat a school lunch and even a snack at school as well. All schools have menus of available items for all meals, snacks and beverages served at school. Make sure you have an updated list at all times.
The USDA does have guidelines on what schools can and cannot serve. The rules for sugar are that ""less than or equal to 35% of the food's weight can come from sugar.""
If your child enjoys buying lunch from school occasionally, allow them to do so on a day where the lunch or snack is a lower sugar item.

, The largest source of sugar (especially refined sugar) in children's diets are sweetened beverages, candy, grain-based sweets and dairy-containing desserts. Limiting these items can help you make a big cut in your child's overall sugar consumption.Limit or avoid these types of items: ice cream, popsicles, milkshakes, cookies, cakes/pies, sugary cereals, breakfast pastries, candy, brownies, pancakes/waffles and muffins.
One easy way to limit how often your child eats these types of foods is by eliminating them from your home. Stop purchasing these items so your child won't have access to them. Or only keep one or two items in your house.
Cut out sweetened beverages like: fruit juice cocktails, fruit drinks, sodas, energy drinks and sports drinks. Older children should avoid sweetened teas or coffee drinks as well.

, Meal plans are a great tool to help anyone improve their diet - especially your child's diet. This will be a guideline and layout for you to follow during the week to make sure all the items you're serving fit into your child's eating plan.


Whenever you have some free time during the week, sit down and write out a meal plan for you, your family and children. Write out what you're planning on serving your child (or having on hand for them) for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and drinks.
The meal plan will also provide you with a grocery list you can use at the store to help keep you on track and prevent you from purchasing quick and easy processed foods.

, It can be tricky to avoid sugar in processed foods, school foods or restaurant meals. If you make more items from scratch you can have much better control of your child's sugar intake.Try to make most of your child's meals and snacks (and your own) at home and from scratch. In addition, try to think of some of their favorite items that you can learn to make from home as well. For example, if your child loves granola bars, then you might research a low-sugar granola bar recipe that you can make at home.
When you're making these types of items at home, you can modify the recipes to make them low-sugar so that your child will be eating a little healthier, be eating less sugar, and still enjoying some of their favorite foods.
When cooking from home you can control exactly what ingredients you're using - and specifically how much added or natural sugar you're using. This will allow you to control how much sugar your child is getting from these foods.Homemade items also make it a little easier to track their total sugar intake everyday. School foods and packaged goods may be more tricky to track.

, Since kids do love their sweets and the occasional snack, it's best to find nutritious substitutes instead of denying them a snack or a treat on occasion.


If your child wants a sweet in the afternoon or after dinner, skip the fruit roll-ups or gummy candies and go for a more nutritious snack like sliced fruit sprinkled with cinnamon, no sugar added applesauce or Greek yogurt with fruit.
In your meal plan, make sure to include some low-sugar and nutritious snacks or treats.

, If your child typically goes for sweetened beverages, offer up a more nutritious choice. Ideally, your child should not be drinking any sugary beverages because they add sugar and calories without much nutrition. Encourage your child to drink water for most of their fluids and avoid giving them things like soda, juice, and chocolate milk.

To add flavor to water, you can add in a few berries, a slice of lemon or lime, or a couple of melon cubes to add a little flavor to the water.

, When you're making more foods from scratch and making your child's favorite sweets at home, use more natural sources of sweeteners. They still count as sugar but are not as processed.


Try sweeteners like pure maple syrup, raw honey (only if your child is over 2 years old), molasses, agave syrup and stevia.Many of these sweeteners are minimally processed and also do have some health benefits. For example, maple syrup has antioxidants, potassium, magnesium and zinc.

, Talking to other moms is an important part of monitoring your child's sugar intake. If your child plays at others' houses and is being served food by other parents, make sure to talk to them as well.


If your child has a play date with a friend, talk to the mom, dad or guardian of that child about your desire to monitor your child's sugar intake. Explain to them that you want to reduce the sugar in your child's diet.
Ask them if they're going to serve a meal or snacks to your child. You may want to suggest items that you know are OK for your child to eat, or even bring snacks to share.
It may be a little bit more polite to bring over a tray of dark chocolate covered strawberries or bananas instead of saying your child can't eat any of the foods at their friend's house.

, If your child wants a sweet treat, get them hooked on dark chocolate covered fruit. Dark chocolate is naturally low in sugar and high in antioxidants. The fruit is a source of natural sugar but has fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.Slice bananas in half width-wise. If you want, you can stick a popsicle stick half way up into the halved banana for a ""popsicle"" type treat.
Melt dark chocolate gently over the stove or in the microwave. Dip the banana almost all the way in the dark chocolate. Lay flat on a piece of wax paper to cool.
If you'd like, you can roll the banana with the melted chocolate in chopped nuts for an added crunch.
Freeze bananas for longer storage time or just stick in the refrigerator until the chocolate has completely hardened.
You can also do chocolate dipped strawberries as well. Follow the same recipe and either freeze or store in the refrigerator.

, A great afternoon treat for kids is trail mix or granola. When these items are homemade, they're lower in sugar but still contain a great source of protein and fiber.To make your own trail mix, toss together your child's favorite nuts (roasted and unsalted are a great choice) and dried fruit. However, choose dried fruit that doesn't have added sugar to it so the overall sugar content remains on the lower side.
To make granola, toast 100% whole grain oats with spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. You can drizzle on a little canola oil to help the oats toast.
Toss the toasted oats with your child's favorite unsalted nuts and unsweetened dried fruit.
Store trail mix and granola in air-tight containers and keep closed.

, In addition to chocolate covered banana pops, you can also make your own popsicles for your child. These are great in the summer and are a much healthier choice compared to an ice cream sandwich.


Purchase and set up a popsicle mold. You'll need to have the sticks and top ready to go so you can put the popsicle mixture directly into the freezer to set.
For a simple recipe, you can take your child's favorite fresh fruit and blend to a pureed consistency. Add a little water if you need to thin it out. If you'd like to, you can also strain out any seeds (from strawberries or other berries). Fill popsicle molds and freeze.
You can also make a creamier fruit popsicle by blending pureed fruit with low-fat greek yogurt for a fun twist on a fruit popsicle.

, Applesauce is a childhood favorite. Making your own from scratch allows you to control the total sugar. However, the sweetness from the apple is enough to make this treat appealing to kids.


Peel a bunch of apples to start with. Use any kind you like, however honey crisp apples are naturally very sweet so your child will be less likely to notice there's no added sugar.Cook in a large pot over medium-low heat with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a little water (just to thin it out).
After cooking for about 30 minutes, the apples should be tender and falling apart. You can either keep your applesauce a little chunky or puree it in a food processor for a thinner texture.
Sprinkle in any spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger or clove for a spiced applesauce. Store in the refrigerator in an air tight container.
You can use this applesauce in other recipes as well. For example, many baked goods like muffins, quick breads or pancakes use applesauce as a natural sweetener.

, Another fun sweet treat for kids are fruit kabobs with homemade peanut butter dip. It's a great way for kids to eat their fruit and get all the wonderful nutrients that fruit contains.Slice up your child's favorite fruit into 2"" or bite sized pieces. You need to be able to spear them on a kabob skewer without them falling off. Good fruits to try include: grapes, strawberries, pineapple chunks, cut apples or sliced bananas.
Spear about 5-6 chunks of fruit per kabob stick. You may need to sprinkle them with a little lemon juice to keep them from browning.
Mix together plain Greek yogurt with all natural, no sugar added peanut butter. Mix until thoroughly combined. Taste and adjust for seasonings - you may want more peanut butter flavor, need a little water to thin it out or feel like it'd be a little more flavorful with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
Serve the fruit kabobs with the peanut butter dip immediately. Store in the refrigerator covered if you're child isn't ready to eat at that moment.

Consume more calcium.,
Choose dietary sources of calcium.,
Consume more vitamin D. Vitamin D helps improve your body’s ability to absorb calcium, and is necessary for bone growth.Men and women under 70 should get at least 600IU of vitamin D daily; people over 70 should increase this to 800IU daily.Vitamin D does not occur naturally in many foods.,
Watch your salt intake.,
Be aware of phytates.,
Get enough protein.,
Limit your soft drink consumption.",How to Prevent Osteoporosis1," Getting sufficient calcium is the single most important thing you can do to grow healthy bones and maintain bone strength.Many Americans, especially women, do not get enough calcium in their daily diets.The recommended daily intake of calcium varies depending on your age and sex.Adult males under 70 should consume at least 1,000mg of calcium per day. Men over 70 should consume at least 1,200mg per day.
Adult females under 50 should consume at least 1,000mg of calcium per day. Women over 50 should consume at least 1,200mg per day. Pregnant or lactating women should consume at least 1,300mg of calcium daily.
Calcium is available in dietary supplements. The two main forms are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate should be taken with food. Calcium citrate can be helpful for those with inflammatory bowel disease or absorption disorders, as it does not require food.If you get enough calcium from your diet, don’t take calcium supplements unless recommended by your doctor. Too much calcium may have unpleasant side effects, including the possibility of kidney stones.Magnesium is an important mineral for bone and overall body health. Foods rich in magnesium include whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables. However, magnesium competes with calcium for absorption, and if your calcium levels are already low it may cause a calcium deficiency. If you get enough calcium in your diet, you probably don’t have to worry about magnesium having a negative effect.;
, You're less likely to consume too much calcium if you get your daily intake from dietary sources. These sources may also be more easily absorbed by your body.Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt are very rich sources of calcium.Milk is often also enriched with vitamins A and D. Fortified soy milk also provides calcium, as do other calcium-fortified beverages like juice.
Vegetable sources rich in calcium include turnip greens, Chinese cabbage (bok choy), kale, and broccoli. Surprisingly, spinach is not as good a source of calcium, because its “bioavailability” (how the body extracts the nutrient) is low due to its oxalic acid content.Canned sardines are a good source of calcium because you eat the bones. Sardines are also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which promote things like brain health.They contain vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium.
Many cereals are fortified with calcium. Choose whole-grain breakfast cereals that have been fortified with calcium and other nutrients and are low in sugar.

, Fatty fish, such as swordfish, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are the best sources of natural vitamin D (and also provide omega-3 fatty acids). Beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks contain small amounts of vitamin D.Milk is commonly fortified with vitamins A and D. Many beverages and cereals are also enriched with vitamin D.
You can check the nutritional content of many foods by consulting the USDA National Nutrient Database here.
Vitamin D is also available as a dietary supplement. It is available in two forms, D2 and D3. Both seem equally potent in regular doses, although D2 may be less potent in high doses. For people who live in areas with less sunshine or who have dark skin, taking higher doses of vitamin D supplements may be necessary.It is rare to develop vitamin D toxicity through supplements.

, Very high sodium consumption increases the amount of calcium excreted in your urine.Aim to consume no more than 2,400mg of sodium per day.Canned and processed foods tend to be high in salt; look for “reduced sodium” or “no salt added” labels.

, Phytates, or phytic acid, interfere with your body’s ability to absorb calcium from the foods you eat. They’re commonly found in grains and legumes, such as wheat bran and beans, as well as nuts like hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, and cashews. These foods are very good for you, so this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them. There are some things you can do to reduce the phytate level in the foods you eat.


Soak dried beans in water for several hours, then cook them in fresh water.If you eat 100% wheat bran, it should be consumed 2 or more hours before or after taking calcium supplements.
Fermentation and malting reduce phytate levels, so breads such as sourdough or other types that use fermented or malted grains pose no problems to calcium absorption.

, Many older adults don’t get enough protein in their diets.About 50% of your bone volume is made of protein.Adult women should get at least 46 grams of protein daily, while adult men should get at least 56 grams daily.However, extremely high-protein diets such as the “Atkins diet” may be associated with increased risk of osteoporosis or bone fracture.Some other studies indicate that high-protein diets don’t have any effect on bone health,but it’s best to consume protein (and all things) in moderation. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially those high in potassium, to counteract any negative effects on calcium absorption from protein consumption.Protein sources that are also rich in calcium and vitamin D, such as fatty fish, are a smart choice.
Animal protein that is high in saturated fat, such as red meat and dairy, can cause health issues if over consumed .Get your protein from a variety of sources, including lean meats, eggs, and vegetables and whole grains.

, A common piece of osteoporosis lore is that soft drinks cause bone loss. Studies are not clear about the link between soft drinks and bone health, but caffeine in sodas and coffee may be associated with bone loss. Phosphorous, a common ingredient in some colas, may also have an effect. While these effects are not yet fully understood, it’s still a good idea to limit your soft drink consumption.Choose healthy beverages such as milk and calcium-fortified drinks more often. Limit your soft drink consumption to less than 2 cans (roughly 24 ounces) a day. Your overall caffeine intake should be less than 400mg per day.If you need a caffeine boost, black tea has not been shown to impact bone density."
"
Watch your alcohol consumption.,
Get regular exercise.,
Stop smoking.,
Spend time outdoors.,
Prevent falls.",How to Prevent Osteoporosis2," Heavy drinking is unhealthy for many reasons, and it can cause bone loss. Being intoxicated may also put you at a higher risk of breaking a bone.The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism states that “low-risk” or “moderate” drinking is the safest way to avoid damage to your health from alcohol. This is defined as no more than 3 drinks on a given day, and no more than 7 per week for women. For men, it’s no more than 4 drinks on a given day, and no more than 14 per week., Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining bone health, as well as your overall health. People who are bedridden or spend most of the day sitting or otherwise inactive are at a higher risk for developing osteoporosis. People who get regular weight-bearing exercise in addition to daily activity have higher bone density on average.Exercises that require you to move your body weight around help promote bone growth. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day.
Females reach peak bone mass earlier, and have a lower threshold, than males. Exercise is especially important for women.
The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommend activities like brisk walking, hiking, aerobics, tennis, and weight training to help build and maintain bone mass.While fantastic for cardiovascular health, exercises such as swimming and biking don’t require you to move your body weight, so they’re not as good for building bone. Other activities that are good for your bones include:

Jogging (but not running, which can put too much pressure on your joints)
Heavy yard work and gardening
Team sports like basketball, baseball, and soccer
Dancing
Racquet sports like squash
Skiing and skating
Karate



, Smoking is harmful to every part of your body, including your bones. Smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.If you smoke, quitting quickly decreases your risk for many diseases.Don’t think that because you’ve smoked for years that you’re “too old” or the “damage is already done.” While it’s true that smoking can cause irreversible harm to your health, quitting produces immediate benefits, such as reducing your heart rate and blood pressure.Your risk of heart attack can begin to drop within just 24 hours, with full effects within 1-2 years.Your lungs can begin to return to their healthy state in just 1-9 months.It’s never too late to quit.

, In addition to consuming vitamin D in foods, you can boost your vitamin D levels by spending time in the sunshine. Ultraviolet rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in your body.Spending time outdoors getting exercise will also help promote bone health.


Use a sunscreen with a broad-spectrum SPF factor of at least 15 whenever you spend time outside.You can usually spend about 5-15 minutes outside without sunscreen to get enough vitamin D and not increase your risk of skin cancer significantly.
People with higher levels of melanin in their skin have darker skin, and have less ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight., Falls are a leading cause of bone breakage, especially among older adults.You can take some actions to reduce your risk of falling, such as:Using a cane or walker if you need it
Wearing sturdy, rubber-soled non-slip shoes
Salting icy steps and walks
Keeping your home clutter-free
Keeping your home well-lit
Using a non-slip bath mat or rubber adhesives in the bath or shower
Increased alcohol consumption is also associated with a higher risk of falling. Consume alcohol in moderation."

Know what risk factors you can change.,
Ask your doctor about your medications.,
Get a bone density test.A bone density test will check your bone strength by using X-rays, ultrasound, or tomography to determine the mineral levels in your bones.It doesn’t hurt.You should get a bone density test if your doctor recommends it or if:You are a woman aged 65 or older
You are a postmenopausal woman under 65 with risk factors for osteoporosis
You are man aged 70 or older
You are a man aged 50-69 with risk factors for osteoporosis
You have a medical condition associated with osteoporosis, such as autoimmune disorders or endocrine/hormonal disorders or have other reasons for being at high-risk for osteoporosis

",How to Prevent Osteoporosis3," There are some risk factors for developing osteoporosis that you can’t do anything about. Studies suggest that the following groups are at a higher risk for osteoporosis:Women, especially post-menopausal women or women who have had hysterectomies
White and Asian people
Short or small-framed people, especially thin people
People with a family history of osteoporosis
Older people

, You can take the steps in this article to affect many of these risk factors. People have a higher risk of osteoporosis if they:Have anorexia nervosa
Don’t get enough calcium and vitamin D
Have low estrogen and/or testosterone levels
Use certain medications, such as corticosteroids
Don’t get enough weight-bearing activity
Smoke
Drink too much alcohol

, Some medications, such as corticosteroids like prednisone, decrease your body’s absorption of calcium through the intestines.If you have other risk factors for osteoporosis, speak with your doctor to determine a safe dosage.


Taking the lowest possible dose for the shorted time will decrease inflammation without increasing your risk of osteoporosis as much.
If you must continue to take corticosteroids or are otherwise at high-risk for osteoporosis, ask your doctor about medications that can help treat or prevent osteoporosis. Medications include ibandronate (Boniva), alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate sodium (Actonel), and zoledronic acid (Reclast).Hormones including estrogen products may also reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis.

Aim for 5 to 6 small meals each day.,
Choose nutritious, whole foods.,
Refrain from eating empty-calorie junk foods.,
Top your foods with extras.,
Enjoy the occasional treat.",How to Put on Weight when You Have Depression1," People who are underweight may get full faster than others. Instead of eating the typical two to three large meals, break your meals down into 5 or 6 smaller meals to enjoy throughout the day. Strive to eat a small meal or snack every 3 or 4 hours.For example, if you rise at 6am every morning, you will want to eat breakfast within the first hour before 7am. Then, you can have a healthy snack around 10am, lunch at 12pm or 1pm, another snack around 4pm, and dinner at 7pm. If you are hungry later, enjoy a small snack or dessert before 9pm so that you are not eating too close to your bedtime.;
, The very best method to improve likelihood for increasing weight in a healthy way is to consume a nutrient-rich diet. Select vegetables, fruits, lean sources of protein, whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals and nuts and seeds for an overall healthy diet. Doing so may help you to gain a few pounds, and it may also support greater physical and mental health.Examples of nutritious snacks to help you pick up weight may include nuts and seeds, dried fruits, granola bars, bean spreads with chips, and fruit juice or nectar., It may be tempting to gorge on high-calorie processed foods just to see an increase on the scale.But that route is not beneficial for relieving your depression, increasing your energy, or improving your mood. Remember that you get your energy from foods. If you choose packaged foods that are loaded with sugar and salt, you are basically fueling your body with these.


Beware of eating from packages since that tends to indicate “fake”, processed foods. Also, avoid the fast-food drive-thru and try to cook more meals at home.

, If you are trying to put on weight after a sudden loss, it can be helpful to supplement your usual meals with fatty extras. Again, you’re not going for unhealthy or empty-calorie foods. Instead add on healthy fats to increase your calorie intake without sacrificing nutrition.For instance, you can add in veggies and healthy fats like avocado to your morning omelet. Swap out skim milk for whole milk. Dip your apples in all-natural peanut butter for snack.

, Even though you can afford to put on some extra pounds, you still don’t want to consume excessive sugar and unhealthy fats. However, an occasional treat can be a nice perk when eaten in moderation. If you like ice cream, treat yourself to frozen yogurt. Or, mix up a batch of cookies made from healthy ingredients like oatmeal and applesauce."

If you believe this could be the case for you, then speak to your doctor first. If you are gaining weight after an illness it helps to eat bland and easy to digest foods such as eggs and smoothies. Eggs are an especially good choice because they are cheap and you can prepare them in lots of different ways. Also, try to eat at least 5 ounces (150 g) of meat every day. Avoid raw fish if your immune system is compromised.;
, Make sure to discuss the plan and take care of any concerns. Consider visiting a dietitian for a personalized meal plan tailored to your needs.

, It is as hard for some people to gain weight as it is to lose it. Be patient and don’t overdo your efforts. Try to gain about .5-1 lb. (.25-.5 kg) per week by adding 250-500 kcal per day into your diet.

, Try to eat six meals a day rather than forcing yourself to eat three huge meals a day. Eating small meals helps you maintain healthy eating habits while adding calories to your diet. Small meals also prevent you from feeling overfull and not eating later on.

, Rather than stuffing yourself at each meal try to eat just a little bit more than what you would normally eat. This prevents you from overfilling your stomach, which can cause stomach ache or cause you to eat less later on.


Eating just a little bit more also means that you do not have to spend a lot of extra money on food. You would simply make a little bit extra for every meal you prepare.

, Every meal should have protein, starch, vegetables and fat. You do not have to rely on unhealthy fast food or junk food to consume extra calories and gain weight. There are healthier options for increasing your weight.


Calories count but so do nutrients. Make sure your diet is balanced and that you are getting all the right vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. It helps to start with nutritious foods and then load them up with calories by adding yogurt, nuts and healthy fats.
Make sure you eat protein with every meal if you are trying to build muscle. Try not to eat carbohydrates alone.
You should also eat fruit and vegetables with every meal. Although they are low in calories they provide essential vitamins and minerals. If you buy fruits and vegetables on sale then you do not have to spend a lot of extra money to purchase them.
Although junk food is cheap, you can also enjoy healthy, nutritious food without spending a lot of money. By freezing food, buying products that are on sale and choosing options that are lower in cost you can gain weight on a budget.

, To gain weight, you don't just want to gain fat. You also want to build up muscle and strengthen your heart. So lift weights, walk or jog, climb stairs, and swim or play sports. Try to exercise at least four times a week for at least 20 minutes (more is ideal but build up slowly if you are currently a couch potato).

, Strength training will ensure that the weight you gain is not simply fat but also muscle. This way you gain weight in the right places. Make sure you eat high-protein foods immediately after training to help them gain mass.


Even if you do not want to build muscle mass, you still need frequent healthy snacks before and after training to help you gain weight.
You can do body-weight resistance training to avoid paying gym membership fees. There are many exercises that require only your body and a little space to complete to help you train and build muscle.

, You may have trouble gaining weight due to a lack of appetite but there are a few ways to try to boost your appetite. You can try taking a short walk before eating, choosing your favorite comfort foods to eat and adding spices and herbs to make your food taste better.


Try not to drink water immediately before eating because this can fill up your stomach and cause you to eat less.
Fruits are sweet and can stimulate your appetite. Try blending some fruits with other nutritive foods like yogurt into a smoothie.

, Make sure you are getting enough water along with your diet. Drink no less than 6-8 glasses a day. Try not to drink directly before eating because the water will fill you up and cause you to eat less.

, A lot of high-calorie foods have lots of saturated fats and sodium. To gain weight in a healthy way, do not overeat fats and sodium. Animal fats can impact your heart health and sodium can raise blood pressure. Be careful about over consumption of these nutrients.


Plant fats such as nuts, peanuts, seeds, peanut butter, avocado, hummus and oils are healthy and high in nutrients and calories. Plant-based fats are also often cheaper than animal fats and so are good for your budget.

, If you haven't already started, learn to read nutrition labels and get in the habit of reading the label on every food item you buy. Key things to watch for are serving size, caloric content, grams of fat, protein, fiber and vitamins.

, You want to choose foods that have a lot of calories in a very small space so that you can maximize your weight gaining efforts. Calorie-rich foods often contain fats so make sure these are healthy fats. While dairy products and animal fats are good and can be healthy, you should not overeat because it can cause heart disease.Eat nuts, peanuts, seeds, peanut butter, avocado, and hummus. These foods are also generally inexpensive to purchase or make from scratch at home.
Add healthy oils such as olive and canola oil on top of your food. You can usually buy a large container which will be cheaper per ounce if you buy in bulk. Add it on top of your meals such as on vegetables and salads.
Eggs are also usually cheap and a good option for adding calories and protein to your diet.
Potatoes, oats and bananas are dense calorie heavy foods that are great to add to your diet. Potatoes and oats are foods that work well with a variety of toppings.

, Choose full-fat milk, yogurt and other dairy products. If you have high cholesterol then this might not be a good choice, but if you do not, this is a great way of increasing caloric intake.


Dairy products will also provide protein, calcium and vitamin D.

, Choose foods that are high in protein but also economical such as whey protein. Whey protein is one of the most economical proteins to add to your diet. However, powdered milk also contains whey protein and it is even cheaper. Peanut butter, eggs, tuna, Greek yogurt, and tempeh are also good choices for adding protein to your diet.

, Oily fish and tuna are great foods for increasing caloric intake on a budget. Tuna is also quite cheap and an excellent way to add nutrients and calories on a budget.

, Buy meat in bulk and freeze the extras. When purchasing food at the store check the price per weight rather than the total price. Buy food from big box stores to reduce the cost total.


You can also purchase a large bag of brown rice and other grains, which should last you several weeks.

, Greek yogurt is high in protein but can be expensive. Making Greek yogurt on your own can cut down on costs and help you incorporate this healthy food into your diet. Rather than purchasing the yogurt your will simply have to pay to cover the cost of the milk.


Greek yogurt is very simple to make from scratch.
You can use the extra whey to add flavor and calories to other meals such as bread, smoothies, pancakes or even as a nutritional drink (although the taste may not be wonderful as a drink).

, Protein bars are quite expensive for the amount of calories they provide. It is better to save your money for purchasing more economical high calorie food items.

, Dried beans, lentils and split peas are inexpensive and high in both calories and protein. Whole-wheat pasta is filling and a good source of fiber. Both lentils and pasta are relatively quick to cook. Although dried beans usually take longer, you can cook a big batch of them and then use a portion for your meal and freeze the rest for use later.

, Drinking juices instead of water and using high-calorie condiments on your food such as mayonnaise, ranch, thousand island and Caesar salad dressings can boost your caloric intake.

, Dried fruits are concentrated sources of calories and are easy to add to meals. You can add them to salads, yogurt, desserts and trail mixes or you can eat them alone as a snack when you are on the go. They are handy and convenient for adding extra calories and nutrients to your diet.

, Buy food that is on sale in bulk. When you see foods on sale purchase those in bulk and store for later use. This includes fruits and vegetables, which are essential to your diet.


At some stores and roadside stands, you can buy fruits and vegetables on bulk to save money. Cut up whatever you don’t think you will use before they go bad and freeze them.

, Other types of nuts can be quite expensive and difficult to afford on a limited budget. Try eating peanuts, which are less expensive and also high in calories. They are convenient to carry around and eat as snacks or you can add them to cooked meals such as chicken dishes.


Eat unsalted peanuts to reduce your sodium intake, which can raise your blood pressure.
If you can find other kinds of nuts on sale, these are great ways to add protein, fiber, healthy fat and calories.

, Generic brands can help you save a lot of money over purchasing brand name items. To reduce your budget, try to use as many generic products over brand name product as is possible.

Consider sourdough bread.,
Store bread at room temperature.,

Limit your bread servings.",How to Pick a Healthy Bread," Whole grain breads are the best for your health. A whole grain still has the bran and the germ, which are the outer coatings of the grain. They provide fiber and nutrients. They also help level out blood sugar spikes.Therefore, look for breads that are labeled 100 percent whole grain wheat for the most nutrition.If the label just says ""wheat bread,"" that doesn't mean it's whole grain. Always look for whole grains.
If you don't like the flavor of wheat bread, try white whole wheat, which is a little bit lighter tasting.Refined grains, because they have the bran and germ removed, have little to no fiber and fewer nutrients, so breads made with these grains are less healthy.;
, While breads with this label have whole grains in them, they are made with refined grains, too. Stick to the breads that are made only with whole grains for the healthiest choice.However, not every 100 percent whole grain may be labeled that way. Check the ingredients. ""Whole"" should appear before every type of grain on the list for it to be whole grain., Like the label ""made with whole grains,"" ""multigrain"" doesn't mean the bread is all whole grain. Rather, it just means the bread contains more than one kind of grain, some of which may be whole grain., Sprouted bread is when the grains are allowed to sprout before being made into bread. Sprouting can increase the amount of some vitamins in the bread, as well as the soluble fiber., For a healthier bread, the calories should usually be under 100 calories per slice of bread. You can find the information at the top of the nutritional panel at the back. Check to see if the information provided is for one slice or two slices of bread, so you can make a fair assessment., When looking at several brands, pick the one that has the least amount of sodium. Lowering sodium is good for heart health. Each slice of bread should contain less than 200 milligrams of sodium., Fiber is an important part of your diet, and it is essential in a healthy bread. Your bread should have at least 3 grams of fiber per slice of bread. The information will be listed on the label.Another way to approach is to check to see how many grams of fiber it has per grams of carbohydrates. For every 10 grams of carbohydrates, the bread should have 1 gram of fiber., In addition to fiber, check to see how much protein is in your bread. You should look for bread that has at least 4 grams of protein per slice. Protein helps sustain your feeling of fullness., Most bread has a little sugar in it to help activate the yeast and for a hint of sweetness. However, the less sugar the bread has in it, the better. Look for bread that has less than 4 grams of sugar per slice and even less is better., Trans fats and saturated fats are an unhealthy part of your diet, so try to avoid them when possible. Check the label, as food producers are required to add both saturated and trans fats to the label. It should say ""0 grams"" next to both of these fats., Whole grains should be the main ingredient in the bread you choose. Added sugars and fats, for instance, lower the healthiness of the bread, so keep an eye out for those in the ingredient list.Preservatives, though, such as glycerol and ascorbic acid, are usually fine to have in your bread, as they help it keep longer., Sourdough bread uses natural yeasts to do the work. This type of bread is the least likely to raise blood sugar and it is the best choice for people with diabetes. It is also easier to digest than other breads and it often works well for people with IBS., In general, the best way to store bread is at room temperature. Doing so keeps your bread tasting fresher, even if it molds faster than in the refrigerator. Storing it in the refrigerator can cause it to go stale., If you do need to keep bread fresh for longer, you can store it in the freezer, wrapped tightly in plastic. You can thaw individual slices or the whole loaf at room temperature, though it's best to let it thaw in the container if possible., One way to use your healthy breads is to toast it and top it with healthy spreads. For instance, you could toast your bread and spread healthy mashed avocado over it. You could also use a low-sugar nut butter, such as almond butter.

Make bruschetta. Even though this snack is typically made with Italian bread, it will work just fine on a healthier whole-grain bread. Start by brushing the bread with olive oil and toasting it. When it comes out of the oven, you can rub it down with the sliced edge of a garlic clove, if you'd like.
Next, make the topping. To peeled, chopped tomatoes, add a sprinkling of chopped, fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, a minced garlic clove or two, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Mix and spread it on top of the toast., Sandwiches can be tasty, but they're not always healthy with sodium-laden lunch meats. Try making your sandwiches healthier by swapping out unhealthy ingredients for healthier ones.

For instance, spread some goat cheese on bread, then load it up with your favorite roasted vegetables, such as roasted red bell pepper and mushrooms, then top with a fresh green or herb, like spinach or parsley.Make a sandwich with sliced chicken breast. Spread a flavorful sauce on the bread, such as pesto or dijon mustard. Layer on your favorite veggies; sundried tomatoes and spinach or grilled onions and mushrooms are good options. You can even top it with a low-fat cheese., Calories from bread can add up quickly, so it is important to limit your portions and servings per day.Include bread in your daily grain servings. Women should have 5 to 6 servings of grain per day and men can have 6 to 8 servings per day. Keep in mind that each slice of bread counts as one serving."

Try out strength training.,
Take a walk.You might think that exercising to gain weight is counterintuitive.,
Give yoga a chance.,
Go for a relaxing swim.",How to Put on Weight when You Have Depression2," If you are a woman, you may be hesitant to lift weights. Don’t be. Strength training is an asset to overall physical fitness and improved mental health. Plus, this method of exercise allows you to build muscle mass and pick up weight in a healthy way.You can practice strength training in a number of ways, including free weight exercises with dumbbells, body weight exercises, weight machines, or resistance tubing activities.
If you are new to strength training, you may want to consult with a doctor or fitness expert before starting a new regimen.

, “Why workout if I am not trying to lose weight?,” you ask. In the same vein that exercise burns calories, it also boosts appetite. Even light, minimal activities like walking or jogging can prompt a desire to eat afterwards.


Give it a try. Put your dog on the leash and go for a trot around the neighborhood. Visit your local walking/jogging track. Or, simply go for a hike through the woods. In addition to stimulating your appetite, going outside in nature to exercise can also improve your mood., There are various forms of yoga—from gentle, relaxing techniques to heart-pounding strenuous routines. Check out the different types and try it out. Yoga can ease your depressive symptoms and lift your mood, giving your more energy and increasing your appetite. , Any sort of aerobic exercise (i.e. those that promote cardiovascular healthy by getting the heart pumping) is good for battling depression. These exercises also release “feel-good” chemicals in the brain called endorphins that enhance mood and outlook. However, many people find swimming to be especially helpful.It works because the exercise works your entire body while the water soothes and calms. Plus, you can regulate the activity to suit your needs, swimming more vigorously or softly as desired. Not to mention, many people feel hungry for a meal after a long swim, so going for a dive can reverse the effects of a diminished appetite.

Be patient.",How to Put on Weight when You Have Depression3," Before you start a plan to gain weight while depressed, you need to verify that depression is the primary cause of weight loss and not just a symptom. Certain medical conditions like cancer or hyperthyroidism can also cause weight loss, so it is important for you to be evaluated by a doctor. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and family history, and perform a physical examination.


If your doctor can find no other possible causes for weight loss, then he or she will clarify your diagnosis of depression. Signs of depression include feeling hopeless, losing interest in once pleasurable activities, experiencing changes in sleep and appetite, and having a lack of energy.At this point, your doctor will talk to you about treatment options and/or refer you to a psychologist or mental health therapist.

, Most people are treated with a combination of psychotherapy and medications. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, is directed towards helping you develop skillsets for coping with life’s problems. By far, research shows that the most effective form of psychotherapy for depression is cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on bringing awareness to negative and unhelpful thought patterns and building healthier, more realistic ways of viewing life and the world.Your doctor may refer you to a therapist, but keep in mind that you can choose someone else if the initial choice does not suit you well. Some people work better with certain types of therapist, so don’t be afraid to try out a few until you feel comfortable.

, Depending on the severity of your depressive symptoms, your doctor or psychiatrist may prescribe you medications. Although medications help you manage the symptoms of depression, they are not a long-term solution. You should always use medications in conjunction with other treatments like therapy and lifestyle changes for lasting relief from depression.


Drugs that treat depression help regulate the amount of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Scientists believe these chemicals impact the emotions and mood. The major types of antidepressants that you can talk with your doctor about include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).Weight gain can be a side effect of taking antidepressant medications. Talk to your doctor so that you can develop a plan that allows you to gain weight in a healthy way through diet and exercise while taking these medications., It can be frustrating to wait for therapy and medications to do their jobs, but you must. Treatment for depression takes time.Continue your treatment regimen as suggested by your doctors and eventually you will start to see positive changes. If not, you can always try new medications or different therapeutic approaches. Don’t give up.

Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or diabetesEnzyme deficiency
Late stage kidney or liver diseaseAlcoholism
Thyroid dysfunction

Heart disease, including heart failure, arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation), history of a heart attack, valve problems, or cardiomyopathy
Alzheimer’s disease or organic brain syndrome
Post-transplant
Paralysis
Pregnant or breastfeeding
Taking medication you cannot stop taking;
, Consider starting with a 1-day water fast.Limit your water fast to 3 days if you’re doing it on your own. Some evidence suggests that just a 1-3 day short-term fast can have health benefits.If you intend to fast longer than that, only do so under medical supervision – such as at a fasting retreat where you’re supervised by a medical professional.It is probably safer and may offer more health benefits to fast for short times periodically, rather than doing a long fast (over 3 days). Consider doing a water fast for one day out of the week at the most., Plan your water fast for when you will not be under a lot of stress and when fasting won’t interfere with your daily routine. Whenever possible, avoid working while fasting. Save your fast for a time when you can rest both physically and mentally., The idea of fasting for multiple days can be daunting. Talk to your doctor, read books on the subject by reputable authors, and converse with others who have fasted. View the fast as an adventure.

, Rather than jumping straight in to your water fast, start small. Start to eliminate sugar, processed foods, and caffeine from your diet at least 2-3 days before your fast, and eat mostly fruits and vegetables.Also consider reducing the size of your meals for several weeks leading up to your fast. This can help prepare your body for what’s to come, and make the transition to water mentally easier. Consider using intermittent fasting to lead into your water fast. Such a plan could spread over the course of a month:


Week 1: Don’t eat breakfast
Week 2: Skip both breakfast and lunch
Week 3: Skip breakfast and lunch and decrease your portion for dinner
Week 4: Begin your water fast

, In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).You can stick to the daily recommended amount of water during your water fast. Choose the purest water you can, or drink distilled water.Don’t drink all that water at once! Spread out your water consumption throughout the day. Try setting out three 1-gallon jugs every day, so you can see how much water you should drink.
Don’t drink more water than the recommended amount, as this can throw off the balance of salt and minerals in your body and cause health problems., If you get strong hunger pangs, work through it by drinking 1-2 glasses of water. Then lie down and rest. The craving will usually pass.You can also try distracting yourself by reading or meditating.

, Break your fast with orange or lemon juice first.Then proceed to add foods to your diet gradually. Eat small amounts about every 2 hours, at first. Proceed in a stepwise process from easily digested foods to foods that are harder to digest. Depending on the length of your fast, you can spread this process out over one day or many days:Fruit juice
Vegetable juice
Raw fruit and green leafy vegetables
Yogurt
Vegetable soup and cooked vegetables
Cooked grains and beans
Milk, dairy, and eggs
Meat, fish, and poultry
Everything else

, Fasting won’t help your health much if you return to eating high-fat and high-sugar foods afterwards. Follow a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and low in bad fats and refined sugar. Exercise for 30 minutes five days a week. Live a healthy lifestyle to improve your health and wellbeing, and let fasting be only a small part of that., If you’re thinking about doing a water fast, consult your healthcare provider. Though fasting may offer health benefits for some people, others should avoid it. Be sure to discuss your medications and medical conditions with your doctor to determine if water fasting is safe for you.They will likely perform a physical exam and possibly do some blood tests.


If you take medication, you will have to discuss with your doctor whether to continue to take your medication while fasting, or if any dose changes need to occur.

, It’s best to fast only with a doctor’s supervision and input, especially if you’re fasting over 3 days or have any medical conditions. Find a doctor who is trained in fasting and have them guide you and monitor your condition during the fast. Ask your primary doctor to supervise you or suggest another professional who can., After 2-3 days of water fasting you may experience dizziness if you stand up too quickly. Avoid this by getting up slowly and doing some deep breathing before standing.If you do get dizzy, immediately sit or lie down until it passes. You can also try putting your head between your knees.


If you become so dizzy that you lose consciousness, stop fasting and see your doctor.

, It’s not uncommon to feel some dizziness, a little weakness, nausea, or occasional skipped heartbeats while fasting.However, stop fasting and seek medical attention if you lose consciousness, feel confused, have more heart palpitations than one or two a day, have severe stomach discomfort or headache, or any other symptom that feels alarming to you.

, You may experience a drop in stamina and energy during this time. Don't overexert yourself. Maintain healthy sleep patterns. Fasting is all about rest - physical, emotional, sensory and physiological.If you feel like napping, nap. Read uplifting material. Listen to your body and don’t push yourself physically.
If you feel tired and “out of it,” do not operate a vehicle.

, Your energy may fluctuate between feeling weak and tired and feeling energetic. Even when you have lots of energy, don’t exert yourself.Instead, try gentle, restorative yoga. Yoga is a calming way of stretching your muscles and getting some light exercise.Yoga and light stretching may feel good to some people, and be too vigorous for others. Listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable.

Neutralize your menu.,
Go all natural.,
Fruit choices.,
Choose fish.,
Use healthy oil.,
Cook everything from scratch.,
Choose green vegetables.",How to Plan a Healthy Eating Menu when Hosting a Dinner," When planning a healthy eating menu for people, it may be difficult to decide what to include and what not to put in the healthy eating menu as you may not know the tastes and preferences of your guests. The best thing to do is stay neutral in your healthy eating menu. Ensure that you have a combination of dishes for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. In this way, everybody will have a taste of what they like.;
, When shopping for a healthy eating menu, go for fresh produce and try to avoid processed and packaged foods. Not only are these foods usually unhealthy but they also contain additives which some of your guests may be allergic to. When shopping for a healthy eating menu you can also go for the natural spices such as rosemary leaves and fresh ginger instead of going for the ground powdery stuff.

, A healthy eating menu would not be complete without and assortment of fruits that are high in fiber and natural sugars. A fruit salad makes a great desert as compared to cake or ice-cream in a healthy eating menu. This is because rarely are people allergic to fruits and they are full on nutritious quality.

, If you are going to include animal protein in your healthy eating menu, you can go for fish protein as it has a high protein quality or other white meats. Red meat is not always an advisable choice in a healthy eating menu. For the vegetarians, legumes are a must in the healthy eating menu as they are an excellent source of proteins and fiber.

, Focus on vegetable oils when preparing your healthy eating menu for both the vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Vegetable oils contain good cholesterol that can be easily metabolized by the body.

, All the foods in a healthy eating menu should be cooked from scratch. Your healthy eating menu should not contain restaurant bought foods as it cannot be deemed healthy when you have not overseen the process of preparation and inclusion of the ingredients mentioned above.

, Ensure that you have enough of dark green vegetables in your healthy eating menu as these are not only a great source of fiber.

Set a goal.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Invest in a good juicer.,
Decide when to do your juice fast.,
Prepare your body for the juice fast.",How to Perform a Juice Fast1," Seasoned fasters can go for as long as three weeks on a juice fast, however if this is your first time, it is recommended that you start with a smaller, more manageable target, such as three days. Fasting can be tough, both physically and mentally, so you may find it easier to start small. It is better to complete a short fast successfully than to falter in the middle of a long one.To complete a three day juice fast, you will actually be following a five day plan - taking one day to ease your body into the fast and one day to ease out.
If this is your first fast, it may be helpful to rope in a friend to go through the process with you. You can help motivate one another and a slight competitive edge will keep you from giving in to temptations!;
, For your juice fast, you will need large quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables - probably more than you realize. It is very important that you buy organic produce, free from pesticides - the whole idea of the juice fast is to rid toxins from your body, not introduce more.


Stock up on oranges, lemons, limes, tomatoes, spinach, kale, celery, carrots, cucumbers, apples, grapes, blueberries, beets, garlic and ginger root.
If possible, you should also stock up on some good quality spring water from a company that uses food grade plastic or glass bottles. You will be drinking lots of water as part of your fast., Having a good quality juicer is essential when performing a juice fast, as it will maximize the amount of juice that you get from your fruit and veg and will save you time and effort on preparation and clean-up. Make sure you get a juicer with at least 700 watts, which will easily power through any fresh produce you throw at it. You should also look for a juicer with as few parts to assemble and disassemble as possible, as this will make the juicing process faster.


Buying a new juicer can be a big expense, but it will be worth the investment, especially if you plan on making regular juice fasts a part of your lifestyle. You will probably need to spend at least $150 to get a decent juicer, but this should last you 15-20 years.It is not possible to substitute a juicer for a blender when performing a juice fast. If you use a blender, you will end up with a smoothie rather than a juice. A smoothie still contains fibers from the fruit and veg - and although this is normally a good thing - you do not want any fiber in your diet while on a juice fast. This is because your body uses up too much energy when digesting fiber - energy which your body needs to rid itself of toxins., Timing is important when it comes to juice fasting. You will need to ensure that you have plenty of time in the mornings to prepare your juices and that you do not have any high-energy activities planned for the 3-5 day period, especially if it's your first time. Many first-time fasters plan their juice fast for over a weekend, from Friday to Sunday, when they can be at home for extended periods of time.


Some fasters suffer from headaches and low energy when completing a fast (though others claim to have higher energy levels than normal) and you may find yourself needing to take a nap in the middle of the afternoon to conserve energy.You should also be aware that as the juice fast stimulates the flushing out of toxins from the body, your body will need to eliminate this waste frequently. For this reason, it may be best to stay in close proximity to a toilet for the duration of your fast.

, Before the three day juice fast begins in earnest, you will need to take a day to prepare your body for the days ahead. This can be done by eating only raw fruits and vegetables the day before the fast. If you like, you can get your body accustomed to the fast by only drinking juice for breakfast and lunch, then having a solid meal of salad or other raw vegetables and fruit.


Some fasters also advise cleansing the system with a purgative (a natural laxative) or an enema before beginning the fast, although this is optional.

Plan a set bed time.",How to Prepare Healthy Family Foods While Promoting a Healthier Lifestyle," Writing up a weekly meal plan may be one of the most useful things when improving your family's diet. This will help organize you, make grocery shopping easier and help you stay on track throughout the week.Spend some time on the weekends, or when you have free time, and write up a rough list of meals that you're going to prepare the next week. Make sure to include breakfast, lunches, dinners and any snacks.
Take a sheet of paper or notebook and write down each day of your week (Sunday through Saturday). Write in all of your meals, what day you're going to the grocery store and what day you plan on spending time doing some meal prep.
After this is done, write up the corresponding grocery list. This will help you stay on track, buy only what you need and cut down on unnecessary trips to the store throughout the week.;
, Another helpful way to get quick, nutritious meals on the table is to do meal prep prior to your week. Just a little time on the weekends can save you hours during the week.


An example of one day of planned meals may look like: Breakfast: fruit and yogurt parfaits with low-fat granola; Lunch: almond butter and sliced apple sandwiches on whole wheat bread; Snack: 1/3 cup trail mix; Dinner: grilled chicken and pepper fajitas with a tossed garden salad.
In addition to quick meals, studies have shown that children's food choices are healthier and more nutritious if they have parents that meal prep and cook more often at home.Sometimes, healthier, nutritious foods require a little more prep work to get on the table. Many processed foods can be eaten right out of the package or only require a quick microwave or time in the oven.
Meal prep ideas: cut and wash all fruits and vegetables. Place prepared items in sealed bags or containers until you're ready to cook them. You can also pre-cook proteins like fish, chicken or pork and leave items in sealed containers to reheat when you're ready to use them.
If you can, also save yourself time by purchasing ready-to-cook items. For example, you can purchase: bagged lettuce, pre-cut/pre-washed fruits and vegetables, quick cooking whole grains or simply grilled protein.

, This is an essential nutrient for both adults and children. Consuming a source of lean protein at each meal will help ensure each family member is getting their recommended amounts each day.


Include a wide variety of leaner protein choices like: poultry, eggs, pork, lean beef, low-fat dairy, legumes and tofu.
In general, one serving of protein is about 3-4 oz. This is about the size of a deck of cards or an adult sized palm.It's also recommended to include 1-2 servings of fish each week.Oven-fried fish or homemade baked fish sticks are a great way to get kids to eat seafood.
Women should get 46 grams of protein every day, and men should get 56. Women who are pregnant or lactating can intake more protein, too, up to 71 grams a day. Make sure that you're preparing meals that allow for enough protein in your family's diets., Although 100% whole grains may not always be your children's favorite, adding them in whenever you can will help increase the amount of fiber and other essential nutrients in your family's diet.Choose items like brown rice, 100% whole wheat pasta or bread. Minimize more refined grains like white rice, instant oatmeal, plain pasta or white bread.
If your family isn't a fan of whole grains, try mixing half whole grains with more refined grains - like 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 white rice. You can also try purchasing ""white"" whole wheat flour items that are less gritty and have a milder flavor.
Women should get about 25 grams of fiber every day, and men should get 38., At least half of your plate should consist of vegetables., but vegetables can be a tricky food group to get your family to eat. But there are a few tricks to sneak in extra vegetables in your meals without anyone knowing the wiser.


Hide dark greens like spinach into high protein and fruit smoothies.
Puree vegetables into sauces like tomato sauce or cheese sauce for mac and cheese.
Added cooked, very finely chopped vegetables into meatballs, meatloaf, or burgers.
Add shredded carrots or zucchini to muffins, bread or pancakes.

, Cooking with either your spouse or kids is a great way to get everyone involved in cooking and eating healthier meals.


You'll be able to spend some quality one-on-one time with your family members and strengthen your relationship. Also, kids who are exposed to cooking have more adventurous palates and are many times, open to trying more new foods.Choose 1-2 nights a week where you get the whole family involved in cooking. For example: you could make whole wheat pizza dough together and let everyone make their own individual pizza.
Cooking together can also spark an interest in other endeavors, such as chemistry and nutritional sciences.

, As you continue to be consistent with new healthy habits, your family will get used to these new changes.


With children specifically, it might take several tries before they will ""like"" certain foods. If they aren't a fan of an item one night, that's OK. Keep offering that particular food along with a variety of new ones consistently. Most foods will be accepted over time.Also, limit snacks about 1-2 hours before meal time. This will help make sure kids (and adults) are hungry for their meal. When they aren't feeling particularly hungry, they may not be as open to trying new foods., Eating a morning meal each day is important for your entire family's health. Eating breakfast has been linked with a variety of health benefits including healthy weight management, improved concentration and alertness and a more balanced mood.Getting your kids to eat breakfast regularly may also help them manage their weight and keep this healthy habit of eating a morning meal into adulthood.Breakfast doesn't have to be anything special. It could be a meal you sit down together to eat every morning, or something you grab and eat on the way to work and school.
Family friendly breakfasts include: 1 whole grain waffle with peanut butter and banana slices, or ""egg in a hole"" using 1 slice whole wheat bread, 1 egg and some shredded cheese or a fruit and yogurt parfait with low-fat granola.

, Packing lunch for both parents and kid's can help everyone improve their diet and eat healthier.


Packing lunches for adults can help save money and improve overall nutrition.
Many times options at schools are not as healthy as parents would like. Even if your child's school offers healthier options, it may be tempting for kids to choose their favorite more processed foods when they are in charge of making their own choices.To save time, pack lunches at night. That way, everyone's meals are ready to grab and go in the morning.
Examples of family friendly packed lunches include: whole wheat wrap with lean deli meat and cheese with a small piece of fruit and baby carrots or make your own bento box with nuts, cubed cheese, fruit and raw veggies.

, Numerous studies have shown that all members of the family benefit when they eat together as often as possible. Even with everyone's busy schedules, try to aim for at least 3-4 days a week where the family sits down and eats together.


Studies have shown that eating together helps improve children's vocabulary and reading skills, children will eat more fruits and vegetables, and will lower the risk of unhealthy behaviors in teens (like binge drinking or smoking).Make a rule for no cell phones or computers during family meals. In addition to sitting down together, make sure the time is not filled with electronic distractions. Have everyone turn off the TV, cellphone or computers during dinner.

, After dinner is a typical time to crave a little something sweet. Both parents and kid's can healthfully indulge in a sweet treat while still having a nutritious diet.


When you're preparing desserts or treats for your family, try to add in some extra nutrition. For example, using sweet fruit as the main component of dessert can keep the sweetness factor but with little added sugar.
Other nutritious sweet treats include: sliced apple with peanut butter and a drizzle of honey, grilled pineapple with a dollop of low-fat whipped cream or homemade chocolate dipped strawberries.
Limit junk food and unhealthy snacks. Although it's perfectly OK to the have the occasional higher fat, more processed treat, keep these to a minimum. The less options there are in the house, the less likely it is the kids or parents will reach for more processed foods.

, It's important to be good role models for children as they grow up - especially when it comes to healthy eating habits. If you instill good habits early on and are consistent, it's more likely your children will continue these habits as adults.Eat what they eat. If you want your kids to eat more fruits and vegetables, then you need to eat more fruits and vegetables. Show them that this is part of a healthy diet and should be included daily.
Don't skip meals. Skipping meals is an easy habit to get into. However, there are a variety of negative side effects of skipping meals (especially breakfast). Teach your family how important it is to eat regularly by making sure you do so yourself.
Be positive about trying new things. Whether it's trying a new food or new activity, be positive about the experience. Show your family that it's fun and healthy to try new things.

, Being physically active together is another example of when kids can learn good, healthy behaviors from their parents and family. Spend time several days a week being active together.


Adults typically need about 150 minutes of activity each week. Children need about 60 minutes of activity each day.The amount of activity may seem like a lot, but remember, your children are most likely getting activity in through recess and gym class at school. However, it's still important to do activities together as a family.
Try activities like: going for bike rides, taking the dog for a walk, going hiking on the weekends or playing sports together.

, Increased screen time has been linked to increased weight and obesity in children in the US.Limit screen time to a maximum of 1-2 hours daily.Make set rules in your household about when and where children can have screen time. For example: no computers or TV's in your child's bedroom or no screen time until homework is completed and they've been active for 30 minutes.
Engage children in other fun activities outside of screen time like: playing a board game, playing outside, engaging in family exercise or helping prepare dinner or packed lunches.

, Everyone in your family should have a fairly set bedtime - especially kids. It's important for everyone to get adequate rest each night.


In general, adults typically need anywhere from 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Younger children need at least 10 hours night and teenagers need about 9 hours each night.Make sure kids are in bed, ready for sleep at least 9-10 hours prior to when they need to wake up for school. Do not keep electronics or devices that light up or make sound in bedrooms to help everyone have a more restful nights sleep.

Make plenty of fresh juice every morning.,
Drink as much juice as you like throughout the day.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Do some light exercise.,
Rid your system of waste.,
Continue fasting for another two days.,
Stay strong.",How to Perform a Juice Fast2," If you have plenty of time on your hands in the morning, you can save yourself a significant amount of effort throughout the day by making the entire day's juice in one go. You can then keep it in the fridge until you're ready to drink it. Alternatively, you can just prepare the fruit and veg you intend to use in each juice and store it in ziploc bags in the fridge until you're ready to juice!Experiment with different fruit and veg combinations to get tasty and unusual combinations. Really put some thought into what flavors will work well together - that way drinking your juice will be a pleasure rather than a chore.
When doing a juice fast, you should try to keep the ratio of fruit juice to vegetable juice at 20:80. Fruit juices can contain a lot of sugars which are harder for your body to process, so perhaps limit the fruit juices to the morning and stick to vegetable juices for lunch and dinner., A juice fast isn't supposed to leave you starving - your body will need the vitamins and nutrients from the juice to keep you going and do the important work of cleansing your body. For this reason, there is no limit on how much juice you should drink throughout the day. Whenever you feel hungry or thirsty, drink a juice. You should be drinking at least four servings of juice a day.


If you are doing the juice fast to lose weight, you should not try to limit your juice intake either. Your body is being deprived of enough calories as it is, and limiting your juice intake will only send your body into survival mode and cause it to retain any extra weight. So stick to a minimum of 4 glasses a day., Staying hydrated is extremely important when on a juice cleanse, as the water will help to flush toxins from your system, along with helping you to rehydrate after eliminations. Drinking water will also help to keep sensations of hunger at bay. You should aim to drink at least 16 oz of water with each juice, either by diluting the juice with 50% water, or by drinking them one after the other. You should also drink additional water between juices.


Drinking herbal tea is another great way to drink more water - just try to stick with green, decaffeinated versions.

, A little light exercise each day of the fast will allow you to take your mind off any hunger symptoms and will help to stimulate digestive movement. A short walk outdoors or some simple yoga movements will do you good, but refrain from anything more strenuous, as it may leave you feeling weak.

, Many people will experience bowel movements naturally, but you can help the process along by performing an enema once a day, preferably in the morning. This will help your body to clear out any built up toxins in the colon. Drinking a glass of warm water with some freshly squeezed lemon juice and a little honey (for sweetness) first thing in the morning has also been proven to stimulate bowel movements.

, Follow the same schedule for the following two days, drinking as much juice and water as you please. You may need to do another grocery run if you are running low on fresh produce. You should also continue to experiment with different recipes to keep your juice intake varied and interesting.

, No matter how enthusiastic you feel at the beginning of your cleanse, you are sure to be faced with temptations and tests of your willpower over the course of the three days. You will become more sensitive to smells and solid food may seem to be calling to you to be eaten. Stay strong and remember why you decided to do the cleanse in the first place - you are ridding your body of toxins that have built up over the course of many years. You will feel much better afterwards - both physically and mentally - and enjoy the satisfaction at having successfully completed your first juice fast.


Some people enjoy the fasting process and claim to experience a surge, rather than a drain, of energy. Hopefully you will be one of these lucky people!
Try to take your mind off the fast by engaging in relaxing and restorative activities such as meditation, reading, stretching and craft projects. Without having to plan your day around mealtimes, you will have a lot more time on your hands.

Take a day to ease your body out of the fast.,
Gradually return to normal food.,
Think about introducing a 24 hour weekly juice fast into your routine.,
Try a longer fast next time.",How to Perform a Juice Fast3," This day will be similar to the day prior to the cleanse - you will eat only salads and fruits. Stick with small portions so as not to overwhelm your stomach and digestive system., After the easing-in period, you can gradually return to your regular diet by introducing foods such as eggs and dairy products, wholegrain rice and cereals, and lean meats. You should still try to refrain from eating processed foods, to avoid undoing the good work you did during your cleanse.


Eating pizza or other processed foods immediately after finishing your cleanse is not a good idea, and may even leave you feeling ill.

, Doing a juice cleanse once a week will help you to maintain the level of detoxification you reached while doing your fast. It is actually quite simple to do as you can divide the 24 hours over a two day period. Start by having an early dinner one evening, then eat nothing for the rest of the night. Sleep through 8 of the 24 hours, then have a juice for breakfast and lunch that day. You can then eat a solid meal for dinner that night., Once you have done a three day fast, you can move on to doing longer cleanses periodically, progressing towards a 7 day or even 14 day juice fast, if desired. Although this may seem daunting, many seasoned fasters claim that the fasting actually becomes easier the longer you go without solid food. Your body trains itself not to feel hunger, as it recognizes that it is getting all the nutrition it needs from the juice.


Be warned, however. With longer fasts, your body will start eliminating toxins through the skin and lungs and you may notice a funny or unpleasant smell emanating from your body.With longer fasts, you may want to include protein and iron supplements in your juices, to give you more energy and prevent yourself from becoming anemic. These supplements can be found at health food stores."

One of the best ways to do this is by consuming at least 64 ounces of fluids per day. You should consume more if you feel excessively thirsty or if your urine is a dark yellow in color.You can get these fluids by drinking eight glasses containing eight ounces of water each. You may also be able to get fluids from food.
Milk and juice for instance, are comprised mostly of water. Coffee, tea and soda also have water but also contain caffeine, which is a mild diuretic and increases fluid loss.If you exercise a lot, though, you need to increase your fluid intake largely due to sweating, which is the body’s way of cooling itself. Before exercising, consume 16-20 ounces of fluids, 6-8 ounces every 10 to 15 minutes while you’re exercising and 16-24 ounces afterward to replace what you lost.;
, Carrying a water bottle with you can help you stay hydrated even when you are far from a sink or fountain. Fill the bottle with water, a sports drink, or another fluid, and take it with you to work, school, and social events.

It is a good practice to keep a bottle of water with you when you exercise or when you are going to be outside for long periods of time.
Buy a reusable water bottle that you can wash between uses instead of a flimsy disposable bottle.

, Eating foods high in water content is a great way to assist in increasing your overall intake of fluids. Fruits are a great source of water. Watermelon, strawberries, grapefruit and cantaloupe are all between 90-92% water. Peaches, raspberries, pineapples, apricots and blueberries are each between 85-89% water.They can be eaten fresh, frozen or whipped up in the blender with some water or milk (perhaps some ice cream, too) to make smoothies. You can also throw several together and make a fruit salad.

, Not only is munching on crispy cold vegetables a great way to stave off that thirsty feeling, a number of regularly used ones are also high in water. Cucumber, zucchini, tomatoes, radishes, bell peppers, carrots and lettuce are all between 91-96% water, with cucumber coming in first right behind lettuce. Avocado, a nutrient super food, is about 65% water.Eating these veggies alone fresh, as parts of other dishes or together as a salad is best because they lose a lot of water during the cooking process.


With lettuce, eat the outer leaves within a day or two of buying it. Initially, lettuce contains more water in its outer leaves, but it stays longer in its internal leaves., Who doesn’t love a nice big, juicy burger fresh off the grill on a summer afternoon? Ground beef that’s 85% lean is 64% water when raw and 60% when cooked. The “eye of round” roast cut of beef is 73% water when raw and 65% when cooked. The leaner the beef, the higher the water count.Chicken, a dieter’s delight, has a 69% water count before cooking and 66% afterward. Because water will seep out of chicken the longer it sits in the refrigerator, cook it as soon as possible after you buy it.When cooking meat or anything for that matter, make sure to limit your use of salt and spices to reduce your thirst. Both will make you thirsty. Spicy foods and foods containing a lot of salt, like ham, white bread, ketchup, chips, processed cheese and meat pizza, will naturally also increase thirst, too.

, One cup of yogurt is about 85% water. Once you factor in all the nutritional benefits, like its calcium and protein counts; the many flavor options; the low price; and how there’s no preparation involved, yogurt’s star shines brightly among food alternatives to fluids. Add some fruit to it, and you’re golden., Stay away from consuming large quantities of beer and wine, particularly. Contrary to popular belief, you’re not going to the bathroom a lot while drinking because you’ve added fluids – alcoholic drinks – to your body. Actually, it messes with your mind, literally. Alcohol reduces how much ADH, or anti-diuretic hormone, the pituitary gland in your brain produces. This causes you to urinate more, not just the alcohol, but also the fluids that were previously balanced in your body.Drinking more water won't help much either. Your body will only retain about 1/3 to 1/2 of the extra water you drink. Most of it will come out in your urine.It’s this process of dehydration that is the main cause of the dreaded hangover.

Get support.",How to Practice Mindful Eating," Many health professionals, especially registered dietitians, recommend that you take at least 20 to 30 minutes to eat your entire meal. This helps support many of the other mindful eating practices.


The basis of this rule is that it takes 20 or 30 minutes for your stomach and digestive track to begin digesting and absorbing the food from your meal or snack. It takes at least 20 minutes for your GI system to signal your brain that it's had enough food.When you eat faster than 20 minutes, you're more likely to overeat because you haven't received a signal from your brain that you've eaten enough.
Many times, when you're eating rapidly, the first signal of ""fullness"" you feel is coming from your stomach. Stretch receptors are activated when your stomach is full of food and you've eaten too much.
If you're out with a group, it may be easier to take your time. If you have a notoriously slow eater in your group, try to mimic their eating speed. Or, engage in conversation to slow you down.;
, To help slow your eating pace down and for you to use up that 20 or 30 minutes, aim to take smaller bites and chew each bite more thoroughly.


Studies have shown that people who take smaller bites may eat up to 30% less compared to those who took normal or larger bites of foods.In addition, even if those people who were taking smaller bites were distracted, they still consumed less food.
In addition to taking small bites, studies have also shown that if you chew that bite of food 15 – 30 times you may end up eating less and losing more weight.Chewing your food more will naturally slow you down and help signal satiation cues in your brain.
Focus on cutting your food into much smaller pieces and only spearing a small amount (aim for 1/2 the amount of your normal bite) on your fork or spoon. Then, count 15 or 30 chews per bite.

, It can be difficult to practice eating slowly and waiting for your brain's cues to tell you that you're satisfied. To aid in that process, drink a glass of water (or two) while you're eating.


Drinking water while you eat can help your mindful eating practice by slowing you down. Set your fork down, take a sip and swallow before you pick up your fork again for another bite.
The water consumed during your meal can also help speed satiation signals to your brain and make you feel more satisfied with less food.
You may also want to drink a glass immediately prior to your meal. This can help your stomach feel artificially full and make it easier for you to concentrate on mindful eating practices during your meal.Another benefit of drinking water during your meals is that it aids your stomach in digesting foods and helps your body absorb all the important nutrients contained in your meals.When you're in a group, try drinking as others talk. This will help you listen more carefully, but also slow you down and help you consume more water.

, Whether it's lunch with your co-workers or dinner with your family, try to engage in conversation with those who are eating with you. Talking can help you to slow down and be more mindful while you eat.


When you're alone and eating, it can be difficult to concentrate on anything other than the food in front of you. Although this is great for mindful eating practice, it may be easier to start when you are dining with friends or family.
Between each bite of food, set your fork down and ask someone a question, bring up a topic or answer a question. This can help you prolong your meal significantly.

, Forks and spoons can act as little shovels when you're eating. They make eating too easy if you're working on slowing down. If you make eating your meals physically harder to eat, you'll slow down.


Make eating your meals more difficult. This can help naturally slow you down so you're forced to take your time and pay attention to what and how you're eating.
Eat with your non-dominant hand. If you are right-handed, put your fork or spoon in your left hand when eating (or vice versa if your left-handed). This will be somewhat awkward and you'll find it difficult to eat and your pace will naturally slow down.Another way to slow your eating pace down is to use chopsticks to eat instead of a fork or spoon. Chopsticks are difficult to use and they do not allow you to take a large bite.

, One of the biggest reasons people do not eat mindfully on a more regular basis is that they are distracted during mealtimes and are paying attention to other things.


Studies show that those people who eat when they're distracted tend to eat more and weigh more as well.The reasoning behind this is thought to be that while distracted, you're eating much faster and you're not creating the memory of having eaten. Both of these can cause an increased intake of food.
Try to remove all distractions while you're having meals or snacks. Turn off the TV, avoid talking on the cell phone and stay away from your email or the internet. You may even need to let others know, like co-workers, to give you 20 minutes to yourself while you're eating instead of coming in with questions or things to do.
If you're eating with a group - like your family - also remove distractions. This can help your whole group focus on each other and conversation rather than watching the TV or texting on their phones.

, A mindful eating practice should start prior to your actual meal. Taking a moment or two before you start eating a meal can help put you on track to be more mindful and present while eating.After serving yourself your meal or snack, sit down at a table with your food in front of you. Take a few moments to think about how you're feeling, what you're in the mood for and what you're planning on eating.
You can start this little mini meditation by taking a few deep breaths and just looking at your meal and concentrating on the food in front of you.
Take the time to review how you're going to eat mindfully (for example, by eating slowly and taking smaller bites) and the benefits that mindful eating brings you.
If you feel yourself eating too fast or taking big bites or even getting distracted, feel free to stop eating and return to a few moments of breathing to refocus your mind.
If you're with a group, you can comment on how good your meal looks or how great the menu looks and take those moments for yourself to get your mindset straight.

, Prior to starting your meal, also consider your hunger level. Understanding how hungry you truly are can help you work more effectively on controlling how you eat during your meal.Listen to your body's hunger signals. Is your stomach growling? Do you have an empty feeling in your stomach? Do you feel lightheaded or nauseous due to hunger?
Try to rate your hunger on a scale from one to 10 with one being absolutely starving and 10 being so full you're sick to your stomach.
If you're rating your hunger as a one, two, or three, you may have the desire to eat very fast, take large bites or eat more than you need.
Understanding that a low hunger scale rating can make mindful eating more difficult may help you show more control and more restraint during your meal so you avoid those mistakes.
Try to aim for a three to four prior to a meal. This means you're hungry and experiencing symptoms of hunger, but can control yourself more easily during your meal. This makes practicing mindful eating much easier.
If you're with a group, maybe vocally saying how hungry you are can help you rate your hunger.

, One very important part of mindful eating is starting to and learning to listen to your body and it's satiation signals. Your body will provide you with a lot of information regarding whether or not you should eat, continue to eat or even stop eating.


When you take the 20 or 30 minutes to eat a meal, you'll give your body enough time to communicate with your brain regarding your level of satiation or fullness. You'll need to pay attention closely to be able to ""hear"" and figure out these signals.
It's important to listen to your body's ""satisfied"" signals. When you're satisfied, you've eaten just the right amount of food for your body. If you eat too much and feel full, you've overdone it. If you continually overeat, you may end up gaining some weight.
Satisfied feels like a lack of physical hunger (no more growling stomach or empty feeling). There is no sensation of fullness or stretching in your stomach whatsoever. In fact, you may have wanted to finish the last few bites on your plate, but specifically chose to leave them.
Although there are varying levels of fullness, you want to avoid any feelings like: a stretching in your stomach, a slight discomfort, a thought of ""I could have left those last few bites"", a sick feeling or a hurting stomach.

, Another trick that can help support your practice of mindful eating is by serving yourself a portion of food and leaving the leftovers away from where you'll be eating.


When you serve yourself, you're taking control of what you're putting on your plate and how much. Others may give you too much or too little.
Also don't put big plates or bowls of food on the table. Leave them in the kitchen so you're not tempted to go back for seconds at the table.
Sitting and eating at the table is a great practice for mindful eating. It forces you to focus and get in the mindset of mindful eating.This theory also goes for snack foods. It's never wise to sit down with a box of crackers or a bag of chips. You cannot tell how much you're eating. Serve yourself an appropriate portion size and then put the container away., Not every eating session will be a full on meal eaten at the dinner table or even at your desk at work. If you eat a small snack every so often, you’ll be able to be more mindful about your next meals nutritious quality, compared to eating anything you can grab quickly. Make sure you stay mindful during these quick bites or snacks as well.


Some people can get into trouble when they snack mindlessly. If you find yourself zoning out in front of the TV with a bag of chips, this can lead to overeating and consuming too many calories.
To avoid eating mindlessly through snacks, always pre-measure or pre-portion your food. Don't ever sit down with an entire box, bag or container.
Also try to assess your hunger level and time until your next meal. Don't just grab any snack at the slight feeling of hunger. If you're feeling hungry and your next meal is in 30 minutes, you should wait to eat.

, A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that can help guide you with your mindful eating practice. Consider making a consultation with a local dietitian to help you with mindful eating.


Look online or get a referral from your primary care for a dietitian in your area. Set up an appointment and ask them to help teach you and guide you on how to eat more mindfully.
Make sure you share with your dietitian the reasoning behind wanting to eat more mindfully. Are you interested in weight loss? Do you want to improve the quality of your diet?
Your dietitian can also help you set up goals with your mindful eating. You can meet once to set up goals or see them regularly to adjust and help you stay accountable.

, Another tool that can help you practice mindful eating is a food journal. This can teach you a lot about your eating habits and give you hints about where you should focus your mindful eating practice.To start a food journal, either purchase a paper journal or download a journaling app. A paper journal may be better, because you may want to take notes on other things outside of your actual food intake.
Start journaling the types of foods you eat on a daily basis. Also incorporate information about how hungry you were, how you felt while you ate and how you felt after you ate.
After starting your mindful eating practice, note how that has changed your eating habits. What parts were easy? What parts were more difficult and need more practice?

, Whenever you're trying to change your diet or the way you eat, its a good idea to set goals for yourself. Goals can help guide you and motivate you to actually make your desired changes.Mindful eating can be difficult and it generally takes a lot of practice and patience. Start by setting some small goals. These should be short-term goals that you can meet every few weeks. Aim for the short-term goal of 0.5 – 2 pounds lost each week.
For example, you might start with eating dinner at the table every night or turning off all distractions during your lunch break.
Also consider setting some longer term goals. These may be bigger or take more practice to get used to. For example, you might set a long-term goal of losing 15 pounds by eating smaller portions and eating more slowly.

, There are many reasons why people want to eat more mindfully; however, many revolve around weight, managing food cravings or binges or eating a more nutritious diet.


Getting support for your mindful eating and other goals is a great idea. A support group can help encourage and motivate you in addition to helping you through any slip ups.
Consider asking your family to help you with mindful eating. Get everyone on board with removing distractions during meals, eating at the table and eating slowly.
You may also want to ask friends or co-workers for support as well. Ask co-workers to give you a set time for your lunch where you're not interrupted and can focus on your meal.

Suck on ice chips or ice cubes.,
Chew sugar-free gum and suck on sugar-free hard candy.,
Suck on frozen fruit.,
Make popsicles and flavored ice.,
Head to the health aisles.",How to Make Yourself Less Thirsty2," There are times, such as when you can't eat or drink anything the night or morning before surgery, that you think you're starving – not for food but for just one sip of sparkling cold water. While this should be avoided before surgery, ice chips or ice cubes are the first things they give you when you wake up to help moisten your mouth and quench your thirst. So freeze some water in ice cube trays and put them in a cup or a plastic baggie (for ice chips, carefully break them into pieces) for immediate thirst relief.

, Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies will actually make your mouth produce more saliva, which in turn makes you less thirsty. While you also shouldn't do this before surgery, it's helpful if you are restricting liquids because of dialysis. It's also good for quenching thirst caused by any number of other things. Make sure you buy sugar-free hard candies that you not only enjoy but that also last a long time. The more you use, the more saliva your mouth will produce.Be warned, xylitol is often in sugar-free gum and sugar-free candies, and it can lead to diarrhea or cramps if enough is consumed.Sour candy cranks up your saliva glands, so if you can handle it give it a try, too.
Chewing on whole mint leaves is cooling, refreshing and will also help quench your thirst.

, At times, such as when a person is on dialysis, sucking on frozen fruits like grapes, peach slices and pineapple chunks, can be amazing thirst-quenchers. It helps because it, too, stimulates the production of saliva and has a high water content. Aside from grapes and other berries, all you need to do is cut them up and put them in a bag in the freezer. Or, for something like watermelon and cantaloupe, scoop out balls with an ice cream scooper before freezing.


Lemon is another fruit you can also suck on frozen, or fresh if you like. It is one of the most effective fruits because its high level of citric acid really gets the saliva going., This is another great general thirst quencher and one that is also useful during dialysis and after throat or mouth surgery (not before, for any surgery). Depending upon your diet, make tea or lemonade, or buy some apple juice or diet ginger ale. Pour it into popsicle molds or ice cube trays and freeze it. If you have sticks for the popsicles, wait to stick them in until they can stand up alone. If not, and for the flavored ice cubes, put your frozen goodies in a plastic baggie to hold and to catch what melts. You could also take the drinks and freeze them in plastic cups until they become thick slushies that you can scoop out with a spoon., Try over-the-counter saliva substitutes, especially those with products containing xylitol, such as Mouth Coat or Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray, or products with carboxy methyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose, such as Biotene Oral Balance. Again, too much xylitol can have unhappy effects, so take it slow. If you’re being treated for a health condition that is causing your thirst, talk to your doctor first before using these."

Stay out of the heat.,
Wear appropriate clothing.,
Avoid excessive exercise.,
Cool down with water.,
Don’t eat large meals.",How to Make Yourself Less Thirsty3," Maintaining a normal body temperature will also help a great deal in feeling less thirsty. The first step is staying out of the heat so you don’t become too hot. Overheating starts a chain reaction in which your internal AC unit kicks in to cool you, creating sweat. This causes you to lose body fluids and become thirsty. Because the sun is at its strongest between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., try to rearrange your schedule so that you're not outside during these times, particularly during hot periods of the year.


Run your errands in the early morning, for example. Have lunch delivered to your office rather than getting into your sweltering car twice – once on the way to lunch and again on your return.
If staying out of the heat isn’t possible, try to limit the length of each outing as much as you can.
Use buildings and trees to provide shade from the sun.
And don’t forget that air conditioning was created for a purpose – to keep you cool.

, Sometimes we simply can’t avoid being in the heat. Another way to make adjustments, however, is to choose clothes that will reduce the likelihood of becoming overheated. When it’s very hot out and you cannot avoid it, or when you know you’ll be in an environment that will make you sweat if not properly attired, pick your clothes wisely.


If outside, wear lightweight, light-colored cotton or linen clothes. Light-colored clothes will reflect, rather than absorb, the sun’s rays. Cotton and linen are both fabrics that breathe, so they won’t trap heat like polyester, acrylic, nylon and rayon fabrics will.If you can avoid layers, definitely do so. They will only trap in heat to a greater extent, creating more sweat and less room for its escape.
Stay away from tight-fitting clothes, too, unless they are specifically designed for breathability and to wick sweat.

, Working out raises the risk of dehydration – if not adequately replenished – because your core body temperature rises, causing you to sweat and to lose body fluid. Controlling your body temperature, then, is critical, particularly if you do not or cannot adequately replenish the fluids lost.When you do exercise, a) wear only one layer of both lightweight and light-colored clothes when exercising outside and b) if your clothes become wet from sweat, change as soon as possible.
And remember, a brisk walk on a hot and humid summer day can cause quite the sweat, too. When it’s humid, the moisture in the air stops sweat from evaporating from your skin, leaving you baking inside.

, If you’ve gotten too hot, one of the most effective ways of lowering your temperature is by taking a cool shower or bath. Make sure the water temperature is cool, not cold. It should be just below body temperature. If it’s too cold, when you get out your body responds by generating heat to warm up, which is not the effect you want.You can also try putting ice cubes in a thin towel and placing it for about two minutes at a time against your neck and on your wrist, two pulse points that you can reach conveniently throughout the day. This works because pulse points are areas in which blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin, therefore allowing for the transfer of cold through the body.Another option is to soak the base of your head and neck in cool water for 5-10 minutes. Here again, this area has a large concentration of blood vessels close to the skin’s surface and will help cool you down quickly., When you put food into your stomach, you get a boost of energy. Your metabolic system kicks in to digest the food and deliver the nutrients to other parts of your body. This process requires energy, which generates heat in your body – it’s called the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF).Large and heavy meals cause more energy to be created, making your internal temperature rise. So stick to eating smaller, more frequent meals.

"
Cut out the coffee and cigarettes.,
Chew gum and suck on candy instead.,
Take care of your teeth.,
Try special mouthwashes.,
Breathe through your nose.,
Use a humidifier at night.",How to Make Yourself Less Thirsty4," Another reason people often feel thirsty is because they have dry mouth, a condition in which the mouth can’t produce enough saliva. This leaves the mouth not only dry but also irritated, sticky-feeling and craving fluids. If you are well hydrated and not overheated, you could have dry mouth. One means of reducing it is by ditching cigarettes and tobacco chew completely. It’s also wise to curtail your coffee intake. Both leave your mouth dry and you thirsty.If you’re a smoker and not ready to quit, try smoking less frequently, smoke only half of a cigarette at a time or wait longer between each puff – whatever it takes to decrease your overall intake.

, Just as chewing gum and candy helps in the immediate quenching of thirst, it also helps a great deal with persistent dry mouth. The more candy you suck and gum you chew, the more saliva you will produce. It’s best to find sugar-free hard candies and gums because poor oral health can also lead to dry mouth and, therefore, feeling thirsty., Lots of bacteria grows in your mouth, so proper oral hygiene is a must. Brush and floss your teeth after every meal. Flossing is often overlooked, but it’s necessary it help get rid of the bacteria that not only decreases the production of saliva but also increases your chances of getting gingivitis, advanced gum disease and yeast infections, all of which can be caused by dry mouth and make it worse..


Visit the dentist regularly for exams and cleanings. Also have any necessary work done as soon as possible to correct existing problems contributing to or worsening your dry mouth.

, In addition to the saliva substitutes Mouth Kote, Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray and Biotene Oral Balance, use mouthwash specifically for dry mouth that has xylitol like Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse or ACT Total Care Dry Mouth Rinse. On your way out, skip over the antihistamines and decongestants, which will only make it worse, and you more thirsty.While there, talk to the pharmacist about whether any medications you might be on cause excessive thirst or dry mouth. According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, over 400 medicines – from those for high blood pressure to those used for depression – can cause the salivary glands to produce less saliva., When you breathe through your mouth, the air that passes through dries out your mouth. When your mouth is dry, you feel thirsty. Start noticing whether you breathe through your mouth or your nose; it’s not one of those things most people consciously pay attention to. Then make a concerted effort to do it and see if it helps!

, One of the first things most people reach for in the morning is a glass of water. Why? Because typically when we sleep, we breathe through our mouths, not our noses as instructed. Hours upon hours of doing this creates significant drying in our mouths. Using a humidifier, which adds moisture to the air, will reduce how dry your mouth becomes at night and help to alleviate what is sometimes called “cottonmouth.”Make sure you regularly clean the humidifier to avoid the growth of bacteria and mold.

Order steel cut oatmeal.,
Choose fruit salad.,
Resist the bread basket.,
Avoid fried potatoes and hash browns.,
Skip the biscuits and gravy.,
Avoid waffles.,
Skip the bagels.",How to Order a Healthy Brunch1," Order an omelette with one slice of cheese and at least two kinds of vegetables. On the side, choose the fruit salad instead of the hash browns or French fries.This meal has protein, selenium and vitamin D from the eggs, as well as fiber and vitamins from the vegetables.


If you want an omelette but are trying to reduce your cholesterol, you should order an egg white omelette.;
, Ask for one or two poached eggs. If you order one egg, you will get 75 calories including 7 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 1.6 grams of saturated fat, alongside iron, vitamins, and minerals. Eggs also contain carotenoids, which may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older adults.Two poached eggs will add up to 150 calories.


Order your poached eggs with a piece of dry brown toast and a sliced plum tomato.From the plum tomato, you should get about 11 calories, including 2 grams of carbohydrates, 1 gram of protein, ten percent of your vitamin A requirement and thirteen percent of your vitamin C requirement.From the toast, you will get about 65 calories, including 2.5 grams of protein, 13.6 grams of carbohydrates, and half a gram of fat.If you order poached eggs, brown toast and a plum tomato, you will be consuming 150-225 calories, depending on whether you order one or two eggs.
By asking for poached eggs instead of fried eggs, you will reduce your intake of saturated fats. Scrambled or fried eggs require butter or oil, which contains saturated fat.

, A typical eggs benedict meal can up to approximately 1,050 calories, including 57 grams of fat. It is packed with fat and is very hard to digest. If you spring for it, you may feel bloated and tired for the rest of the day.Order eggs benedict without the sauce. The eggs will offer the creaminess and you can cut down on the calories in this meal.Order eggs Florentine without the sauce. You will get spinach, which has tons of vitamin A, calcium, iron and vitamin C.Order eggs benedict without the hash browns. If you cut the hash browns, you can cut down on the calories in this heavy meal.

, If you get a good quality, center cut bacon, you can reduce the amount of fat by about twenty grams compared to regular bacon. You will have to ask what kind of bacon they use and decide accordingly., Ask them to make your oatmeal with steel cut oats and water, as opposed to cream. On the top, you should request fresh fruit as opposed to dry fruit which has excessive sugar.Oatmeal is a smart choice for breakfast because it lowers LDL cholesterol, and decreases your risk for heart disease. The fiber will make you feel full, and can ease constipation., If you are craving something sweet, choose fruit salad instead of waffles or pancakes. A serving of fruit salad with a honey and yoghurt dressing adds up to approximately 135 calories.In comparison, one piece of freshly prepared French toast adds up to about 148 calories and one pancake adds up to about 164 calories.Fruit salad is a nutritionally superior option to other menu items. Whereas fruit salad has plenty of fiber and vitamins, French toast and pancakes are full of simple carbohydrates that will give you a sugar high and eventually result in exhaustion., The bread basket of most brunch restaurants is full of scones, muffins, white bread, and other baked goods that are high in refined carbohydrates and sugar, as well as low in fiber. If you eat too many of these items, you will basically be eating two meals by the time brunch is over. You may also experience a sugar crash due to the high volume of refined carbohydrates., Although potatoes have plenty of nutritional benefits, they need to be prepared appropriately. Eating potatoes at brunch typically means potatoes that have been fried in some manner such as hash browns or latkes. These foods have a lot of saturated fats from all of the oil that is used to make them. Choose to eat baked potatoes at lunch or dinner instead of fried potatoes at brunch., Biscuits are made with processed, white flour and is not the most healthful option because it packs a lot of calories and not enough fiber. One biscuit with gravy may add up to 680 calories and 32 grams of fat.Order a whole grain English muffin instead, which will have more fiber and vitamin B than the biscuits., Waffles are both incredibly high in calories and served in excessively large portions. A seven-inch waffle has about 218 calories, including 11 grams of fat, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of protein. Typically, restaurants will give you at least three or four waffles, if not more. In addition, waffles are often eaten with syrup, jam, and other high sugar toppings. This meal may give you a sugar high and then make you tired for the rest of the day.If you do order waffles or pancakes, you can order whole wheat or buckwheat varieties and ask for fruit on the top instead of syrup.

, One bagel has about 430 calories, including 1 gram of fat, 92 carbohydrates, and 15 grams of protein.Once you add the jam or peanut butter or cream cheese, you are looking at a lot of calories.


Choose a piece of toasted whole wheat bread instead, which should have around sixty five calories."

Order hard boiled eggs with fruit on the side.,
Ask for a serving of garden salad.,
Ask for a cup of yogurt with blueberries.",How to Order a Healthy Brunch2," The eggs on a brunch menu typically come with a lot of calorie rich sides and may be fried in oil or butter, which results in a high calorie and not especially healthy meal. Instead of the standard menu, you can ask them to make you some hard boiled eggs and a small fruit salad.One large hard-boiled egg has approximately 77 calories, including 5 grams of fat, 1 gram of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of fat.A serving of fruit salad with yogurt dressing has approximately 136 calories, so your meal should be about 213 calories., If you are more on the lunch side of brunch, try ordering a garden salad. A garden salad has plenty of vitamins and fiber and will give you energy for the afternoon. You will get about 50 calories in a garden salad and plenty of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A, C, calcium and iron.Avoid cobb salad. Cobb salad has a lot of sodium rich foods like blue cheese and ham.Ask for your dressing on the side so you can determine the right amount for your salad.

Combine dry ingredients.,
Heat oil in a pan.,
Sauté the sprouts in the pan.,
Add seasoning when sprouts are almost clear and stir.,
Serve!",How to Make Sprouts Tasty1," Believe it or not, the same sorts of sprouts that are often seen as flavorless or bland (like alfalfa sprouts and mung bean sprouts) can make a quick, easy, and delicious dish all on their own with the right seasonings! To begin, combine cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Use the ""Seasoned Fried Sprouts"" ingredients list above for guidance.


If you enjoy strong, spicy flavors, you may want to add any of your favorite seasonings to the dry mixture. A little cumin and curry powder can give this dish a savory twist, but there's no ""right"" way to prepare sprouts, so feel free to add other flavors as you please — for instance, ginger, garlic, and coriander are all good additions.;
, We're going to sauté our sprouts, so we'll need a hot pan to start with. Add your sesame oil to a medium-sized frying pan on the stove, then set the burner to a medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat until lightly shimmering or just barely smoking before continuing (this should only take a minute or two.)


Note that, compared to other oils, sesame oil has a low smoke point, which means it will begin to produce smoke at fairly low temperatures (specifically, about 350-410°F/175-210°C.)This means you'll want to keep an eye on the stove while the oil heats — if cooked too hot, sesame oil will make lots of smoke, causing burnt-tasting food, a smokey kitchen, and a blaring smoke alarm, so reduce the heat once you notice smoke.

, When your oil's nice and hot, pour in the sprouts. They should immediately begin to sizzle — if they don't, increase the heat a little. Cook, stirring frequently, for about five minutes.


Ideally, your sprouts should be fairly dry before you add them to the pan. Adding too much water can cause the oil to sputter and fizz, which can potentially lead to stains or burns. Try patting your sprouts down with a paper towel if you notice lots of water droplets on them.

, Your sprouts should cook fairly quickly. As they do so, you should start noticing them gradually lose their whitish color and turn translucent or clear. When they're almost clear, pour in your mix of dry seasonings and stir to coat the sprouts evenly. Cook for about one more minute, then remove from heat.


You can add your seasonings to the dish earlier, but this isn't always advisable, since some seasonings (like black pepper) can burn if cooked too long. Adding the seasonings just before the dish is finished allows them to release their flavor and aroma while keeping your food safe from their acrid flavor when burnt.

, Congratulations — you've just made a delicious, nutritious, low-calorie dish from nothing more than a handful of sprouts and some basic spices! Enjoy your sprouts on their own or eat them with your favorite light carb (like rice, tortilla or flatbread) for a vegetarian snack.

Try wraps instead of sandwiches.,
Avoid sticky fingers.,
Choose whole fruits.,
Go for one-hand foods.,
Chomp on carrots and celery.,
Simplify your salad with a lettuce wrap.,
Steer clear of melty desserts.,
Stay hydrated with water.,
Skip the greasy, fatty, salty foods.",How to Pack Snacks for the Beach1," Sandwiches are a go-to beach snack for many people, but they also tend to become “sand traps” — either the sand blows in between the bread slices or parts of your sandwich fall out into the sand. Instead, try wrapping your favorite sandwich filling in a whole grain tortilla or flatbread, which will provide greater protection and easier handling.Peanut butter and jelly is a classic for kids, of course, but really any type of sandwich can become a wrap — just make sure to keep meats and cheeses in particular cold throughout the day.;
, No matter what you do, sand is going to end up everywhere on you (and your stuff) during a beach day. If you’re licking your fingers while eating cheese curls or even nibbling on pineapple spears, you’re likely to end up with a sandy claw (and mouth) by the end of your snack.It’s best to skip the fatty chips or cheese curls anyway, and if you’re going with sticky fruit pieces, bring a fork to pick them out of a resealable container.

, Whole fruits like bananas, oranges, and apples come with a built-in sand barrier — their skin. While cutting up your fruit beforehand may seem more convenient, keeping it whole will reduce sand infiltration.Peel a bit of the banana or orange, eat the goodness inside, then repeat. You’ll reduce both stickiness and sand consumption.
While whole berries are refreshing and tasty, they’re also more likely to attract sand. Try making a mixed berry smoothie instead and keeping it cold in your bag.

, The more fingers you need to put on a food item to eat it, the more sand you’re going to transfer to it. Big slices of watermelon that require both of your kid’s hands to eat, for instance, are likely to turn their hands and face into pink-hued sand art.


Wraps are easier to eat with one hand than sandwiches, and properly chilled fried chicken or kebabs can also pack a handy protein punch., Fresh-cut veggies are one of the healthiest snack options at the beach or anywhere else. Some cut veggies, like cucumbers or even bell peppers, are moist enough to attract sand easily. Carrots and celery, though, tend to be dry enough to prevent looking like they’ve been breaded in sand for frying.Bring along some hummus or peanut butter for dipping, if desired. But expect to eat a bit more sand if you do!

, While a fresh salad that’s bursting with veggie goodness is a filling and healthy snack option, it can also be a bit unwieldy to eat on the beach. Just like turning your sandwich into a wrap, though, you can condense and partially sand-proof your salad by wrapping your desired ingredients into a large lettuce leaf.Use a toothpick to keep your lettuce wrap together, if necessary. Just make sure you don’t eat it!

, Ice cream is another beach classic, despite the stickiness and messiness, but only if you can get it from a beachside stand. It’s nearly impossible to keep it cold enough to prevent melting (or potential contamination) if you bring ice cream with you.


Cookies may be a better option to satisfy your sweet tooth, but skip the melty chocolate chips or sand-attracting frostings or glazes. Consider peanut butter or oatmeal raisin cookies instead., Soda, iced tea, juice, and alcohol can all make appealing refreshment options when you’re at the beach. However, the healthiest, most refreshing, and most convenient option is regular old water. Bring lots of water, keep it cold, and hydrate early and often throughout the day. This is especially important on a hot, sunny day, and for kids.Fresh fruits and veggies also provide some hydration, but make sure you’re drinking enough water regardless., Sure, it can be enticing to see a beach day as an excuse to “let go” and chow down on your favorite unhealthy foods. If you must do so, though, wait until the evening after your beach day. While you’re on the beach, stick to lighter, healthier, and hydrating options.Lighter, healthier foods like fruits, veggies, and a grilled chicken lettuce wrap will leave you feeling more energetic, less bloated, and less likely to become dehydrated.

Mix sprouts, onion, and tomatoes in a salad bowl.,
Mix dry ingredients in separate bowl.,
Season salad with dry ingredients and lemon.,
Add coriander leaves (cilantro) and/or dressing if desired.,
Serve!",How to Make Sprouts Tasty2," You don't have to eat sprouts on their own — in fact, they're often best when paired with other ingredients with complementing flavors! In this recipe, we'll use sprouts as the ""greens"" for a basic salad. To start, gently toss your sprouts with chopped red onion and tomatoes in a mixing bowl.


With their relatively mild flavor, red onions are frequently used for salads. However, if you find them too strong, try soaking them in water before adding them or using a sweet onion as an alternative.In terms of tomatoes, there's no wrong answer here — anything from a large, hearty beefsteak tomato to a handful of flavorful cherry tomatoes will work well.

, Next, add chili powder, salt, and chaat masala to a small mixing bowl. Stir to combine.


Chaat masala is an Indian spice blend that's often available at ethnic grocers or in the ""spice"" aisle of well-stocked grocery stores. If you can't find any, you can approximate the flavor with cumin, salt, and crushed red pepper, though the final taste will be somewhat different.

, Spritz your veggies with the juice of half of a small lemon, then toss it gently to get an even coating. Sprinkle your dry seasonings over the dish and toss again to combine. The powdery seasoning should cling to the lemon juice, creating a sort of makeshift ""dressing"".

, At this point, you may want to add a few coriander leaves to your salad if you have them available. Coriander leaves have a spicy, aromatic taste that complements the mild flavor of sprouts excellently.


You may also add your preferred salad dressing, but use caution — not all dressings pair well with the tart, spicy taste of your lemon-and-spice seasoning. You may want to try testing dressings on individual sprouts until you find a taste you like.

, Congratulations! Your salad is ready to eat. Serve the salad on its own as a light, refreshing treat or as a side-dish for heartier main courses (especially Asian dishes.)

Heat oil in a pan.,
Cook eggs omelet-style.,
Cook ginger and garlic until soft and aromatic.,
Add sprouts, vegetables, soy, vinegar, and half the scallions.,
Add eggs, hoisin, and remaining scallions.,
Serve!",How to Make Sprouts Tasty3," Sprouts aren't always featured in light side dishes — sometimes, they're part of the main course. For this hearty stir fry-style dish, we'll be preparing all of our ingredients in the same hot pan. To start, heat a teaspoon or so of sesame oil in a pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers or smokes ever-so-gently.

, Crack four eggs into a small bowl, beat or whisk them together, then add them to your hot pan. Turn the egg mixture frequently with a spoon or spatula to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Cook eggs until firm and omelet-like, but broken into pieces (not in one single piece like an actual omelet.)


To be clear, you don't want a soft, smooth texture like you might use for scrambled eggs. You want your eggs cooked a little more solid — ideally, they should still be soft, but should have a bit of firm chewiness to them.

, When your eggs are cooked, remove them to a plate and wipe the pan down with a paper towel or a clean rag. Toss in your ginger and garlic and allow them to sauté on their own for just a minute or two. When they're fragrant and lightly seared, continue to the next step. Don't wait too long — both ginger and garlic can burn if cooked on their own for more than a few minutes.

, Once you add these vegetables and liquid ingredients to the pan, stir them to combine, then cover the pan. Let the vegetables simmer under the lid for about three minutes, stirring once or twice. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften before proceeding to the next step.


Covering with a lid keeps the moisture of your ingredients contained in the pan, preventing them from drying out or searing while they soften (and helping them cook evenly.) If you're having a hard time getting your vegetables to soften or cook evenly, try adding a splash of water to the pan to create additional hot steam under the lid.

, When your vegetables are softened, add all of the remaining ingredients to the pan. Your goal is now simply to warm the ingredients, not cook them any more. Once the ingredients are uniformly hot, you're done!


Adding half of the scallions at the end of the cooking process keeps them crispy, which creates a pleasing contrast with the soft texture of the scallions you added earlier.

, Congratulations! You're ready to enjoy this filling, nutritious sprout-centric meal. Serve hot from the pan on a plate or serving platter (if feeding multiple people) and dig in!

Use sprouts as a light salad garnish.,
Add crunch to phos or soups.,
Use sprouts as a sandwich topper.,
Add sprouts to brown rice or quinoa dishes.",How to Make Sprouts Tasty4," If you've got some extra sprouts lying around, you don't necessarily have to go to the trouble of making an entire sprout-based recipe — instead, try simply adding them to your favorite dish! For example, if you already have a salad ready, add sprouts over the top for an extra ""crunch!"" Sprouts' neutral flavor goes well with most salad ingredients, so don't be afraid to experiment!


Sprouts don't just taste good in your salad — they can give it a big nutritional boost! Most sprouts are relatively rich in protein, vitamins A, C, and E, and other essential nutrients., Is your soup a little lacking? Try giving it with some texture with a handful of sprouts! Sprouts are frequently added to lend variety to clear Asian soups and broths (like, famously, Vietnamese pho soup). However, there's no reason not to add sprouts to other types of soup, so don't hesitate to toss some in your homemade chicken noodle soup or tomato bisque.

, Iceberg lettuce tastes boring and, nutritionally speaking, is fairly weak. For a better alternative, use sprouts! Laying a handful of your favorite sprouts over the top of a sandwich's meats, vegetables, and cheeses gives the same satisfying, fresh crunch as lettuce with the addition of sprouts' nutrition benefits.


Be careful to eat your sandwich over the plate after you add sprouts to it — no matter how hard you try, it's tricky to eat a ""sprout-y"" sandwich without some falling out.

, If you've ever ordered quinoa at a restaurant, you may have eaten sprouts without even knowing it. Sprouts are often added to quinoa, rice, couscous, and other grains to modify their taste and texture (and for nutritional reasons.) The grains mentioned here are already quite nutritious in their own right, so give them a further boost by stirring some sprouts in!


Thinner sprouts like alfalfa are best for this — thick sprouts like mung bean sprouts aren't necessarily bad with grains, but their textures can pair somewhat oddly with the relative softness of the grains.

Prepare and portion foods the night before.,
Use water bottles as ice packs.,
Freeze foods to keep them cold.,
Bag up your cut veggies with ice.,
Bury perishables at the bottom of the cooler bag.,
Practice food safety throughout the day.",How to Pack Snacks for the Beach2," On your beach day, you’ll be eager to get out on the sand and less likely to spend time preparing and packing your snacks properly. Chop up your carrot sticks, create your wraps, freeze what needs frozen, and individually bag your items the night before. Have your cooler bag ready to be filled with ice and your snacks so you can be out the door quickly., Especially if you’re only packing a few small snacks, a couple of frozen plastic water bottles can pull double-duty as ice packs and cold refreshment. Freeze the bottles overnight, and they’ll thaw out throughout your beach day.Bring along one chilled but unfrozen water bottle so you can hydrate right away when you get to the beach.
Don’t rely on frozen water bottles alone if you’re packing perishable snacks and/or a larger bag. But they can provide a nice supplementary chill.

, Just like frozen water bottles, some foods can be frozen beforehand so that they end up the right temperature when you’re ready for them. Frozen tubs or squeeze tubes of yogurt, for instance, will thaw out during the day and be chilled and ready to enjoy at snack time.Grapes and blueberries are also good options for freezing and thawing, although they will become even more sticky (and thus sand-attracting) this way.

, If you just want to toss a quick, small snack into the bottom of your beach bag, pair a frozen water bottle with a resealable bag filled with cut carrots and celery and ice cubes. The chilly environment will keep your veggies crisp and refreshing until you’re ready to eat them. If sealed correctly, the baggie will also prevent leakage., Take a bit of time to plan things out before you start tossing snacks into your cooler. Any meats or dairy products in particular need to be kept cold right until you eat them. To manage this, layer your items in the cooler bag by temperature needs. For instance:Put a layer of ice or ice packs in the bottom of the cooler.
Place perishables like deli wraps on top of the ice.
Layer fruits and veggies on top of the meats and/or dairy.
Pile on non-perishables like pretzels as the next layer.
Add some frozen water bottles as the top layer. If you still have extra space, use a small towel or t-shirt to help hold in the chill.

, No one wants their beach day to end with a bout of food poisoning. Keep cold foods cold all day long, clean your hands before eating, and, when in doubt, toss foods out.Do not mess around with perishable foods like meats and dairy. If they’re not still cold, don’t eat them.
Keep your cooler in the shade and your food out of the sun. Only get out the food you’re going to eat when you’re going to eat it, and put the rest away promptly.
Bring the supplies you need so you can clean your hands and clean up your area after eating.

The recommended serving size for carbohydrates, such as pasta or rice, is one cup or 8 ounces (about 237 ml): the size of a baseball or a tennis ball.
For fruit, a portion size is the equivalent of a medium-sized fruit, such as an apple, or one cup (8 ounces or 237 ml): about the size of a light bulb.
A one-ounce serving of cheese is about the size of your thumb, or a pair of dice.
When it comes to snack foods, the serving size generally is the equivalent of a handful.
You can do an internet search for visual representations of portion sizes to get more ideas and find objects that are familiar and will work best for you.;
, The USDA website has a food gallery which shows what individual servings of various types of food look like on a plate or in a bowl. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with odd-shaped foods, such as chicken legs.Browsing through this gallery can help you get a handle on proper portion sizes for different kinds of foods – particularly foods that you eat on a regular basis.
You also can use the gallery as a tool when you start shopping for bento boxes, so you can best ensure that the compartments will hold individual portions of various types of food.

, If you have particular dietary needs, or if you are obese, you may want to consider having a certified professional look over your diet and help you determine the portions that are best suited to your needs and your lifestyle.For example, if you are vegan, you need to make sure you're getting adequate protein. A dietician who specializes in vegan diets can help you.
You also may need help if you have multiple food allergies or are on a specialized diet, such as a gluten-free diet, whether for medical reasons or as a lifestyle preference.
Dietitians and nutritionists are registered, and work at fitness centers, health food and nutrition stores, hospitals, and schools.

, You may be used to seeing huge portions of food, especially if you frequent all-you-can-eat buffets or fast food restaurants. By eating slowly and mindfully, you can adjust to smaller, more healthy portions.Before you start eating, take a few deep breaths and consider whether you're hungry, and how hungry you are. Pay attention to what your body is telling you.
Look at your food, at the colors and shapes. Take in the aroma with another few deep breaths.
Chew slowly, savoring each small bite. Put your fork or spoon down in between bites and focus on each bite as you chew it.
Evaluate your hunger situation several times as you eat. When you no longer feel hungry, stop eating.

, At a minimum, you want sections for fruits and vegetables, protein, and carbohydrates. You can adjust this configuration based on your dietary needs and the types of foods you plan to include.Go to a home goods store or a large discount store so you can evaluate a variety of bento boxes. You often can find them in grocery stores as well, but there may be limited options.
If you want a lot of variety in your bento box meals, look for boxes with six or seven compartments, so you can include small amounts of several different foods.
Keep in mind that portions apply to the type of food, not the particular food item. If you had carrot and celery sticks in your bento box, both together should be equivalent in size to one individual portion of vegetables. Just because you have two different vegetables doesn't mean you get two portions.
When you evaluate the size of the compartments, think about the kinds of food you plan to eat on a regular basis. For example, if you typically have a sandwich for lunch, you want at least one compartment that's large enough to hold a whole sandwich.

, While you can get glass or stainless-steel bento boxes, plastic typically is the most convenient and versatile. These containers also have the benefit of being lightweight and easy to store away when not in use.Good quality plastic bento boxes typically will run you around $20 a piece, but you may be able to get a discount if you're purchasing several. Stainless steel or glass typically will be more expensive. Price also will vary depending on the brand, although a higher price doesn't necessarily indicate the box is of higher quality.
Check product information and make sure the boxes you choose are freezer- and microwave-safe. You also may need them to be dishwasher-safe. Keep in mind that even though the box itself may be microwave- or dishwasher-safe, the lid may not be. Also, don’t microwave a plastic bento box even if it says microwave safe because this can release unhealthy compounds. Get a glass bento box if you plan to microwave your meals.
Choose the material that best fits your lifestyle and daily routine. For example, if you bike to work and are generally rough-and-tumble with your things, you may not want to get a glass container, which is heavier than plastic and may break if dropped.
Some types of plastic will stain, particularly with sauce-heavy foods. If you decide to go with plastic bento boxes, you may want to carry sauce in a separate container. Rinse out your box after eating, so the sauce has limited contact with the surface of the box.
Make sure the bento boxes you choose are leak-proof. You can test them by filling the bento box with water, putting the lid on, and shaking it or turning it upside down.

, Bento boxes can be difficult to wash and sanitize properly. If the bento box you buy is too much of a hassle to clean, you'll be disinclined to use it regularly. Make sure you can clean the box you choose in a way that is convenient for you.Bento boxes with removable dividers are not only more versatile, but also will be easier to clean because you won't have to get into as many corners and crevices.
Larger bento boxes may not fit in your dishwasher, particularly if they need to go on the top rack.
Lids may have specialized rubber seals to prevent leaks that must be carefully washed by hand to maintain their seal. If you put them in the dishwasher, they may warp and become ineffective.

, Particularly if you get bento boxes that have a limited number of individual compartments, you may want to pick up some cupcake liners that you can use when you want to include a small portion of another food that needs to be separated.Silicone cupcake liners can easily be washed and reused, and you can buy a dozen for under $10. This makes them an economical way to add temporary compartments to your bento boxes.
You can find them in many different colors and shapes if you want to get creative. Each regular-sized cupcake liner is about the size of an individual portion of most side items such as fruits, vegetables, or cheese.
You also may want to pick up some smaller silicone liners for ""mini"" cupcakes or muffins. These can be ideal for special treats that are only supposed to be consumed sparingly, such as candies.

, The number of calories your body needs each day depends on your gender, body mass, age, and level of activity. You'll get the most accurate measure of your caloric need if you know your basal metabolic rate.You can find calorie calculators online if you want to get a general, working idea of how many calories your meals should include.
Keep in mind that total calories refers to your intake over the course of an entire day. Not only must you divide this number by the number of meals you eat each day, but you also should account for snacks.
Remember to do this calculation regularly if you have a change in your level of activity, or if you gain or lose a significant amount of weight.

, There are 3,500 calories in one pound. Using this, you can determine how many calories you need to cut (or add) each day if you want to gain or lose weight.To lose one pound a week, you need to eat 500 fewer calories every day. So if you calculate that you need to eat 1700 calories a day to maintain your current weight, you would need to eat 1200 calories a day to start losing weight.
If you want to gain weight, the calculation works the same way, but in reverse. If your calculations revealed that you needed to eat 1700 calories a day to maintain your weight, you would need to eat 2200 calories a day to gain a pound a week.

, Bento-style lunches aren't just about providing a well-balanced meal – they're also an art form. There are a number of accessories you can buy if you want to express your creativity with your bento box.For example, you may want to invest in some stylish food picks or bento picks. While some of them may be a bit more cutesy than you would like, keep in mind that they serve an important function apart from decoration. They keep your food from moving around or shifting too much during transport, and give you something to hold onto while eating finger foods such as strawberries, so you can keep your fingers clean.
Egg molds can transform hard-boiled eggs into symbols or animal characters.
You also can use cookie cutters and mini bento cutters to shape vegetables or make cut-outs in sandwiches.

, Whether you're specifically dieting or just trying to eat more healthy, lean protein is essential to build strong muscles and provide you with consistent energy throughout the day.Chicken and turkey are good sources of lean protein. If you are a vegan, try including edamame or other soy products, as well as lentils and almonds.
Even meat-eaters should consider substituting their meat with an alternative protein source, such as tofu, at least once or twice a week.
Hard-boiled eggs are a staple of bento-style meals, and also a good source of protein.

, According to bento box tradition, your bento box must contain at least five colors. Colorful foods are higher in antioxidants. Following this tradition not only gives you a meal that's pleasing to the eye, but encourages you to go beyond your standard fare and incorporate less typical food options that you may not have considered otherwise.For example, look for red, yellow, and green tomatoes, or orange and purple cauliflower. These foods taste generally the same, but naturally bring more color to your bento box.
Always include some green in your box, in the form of leafy greens for a salad or cucumbers and celery.
Melon balls are another good way to get a variety of color into your bento box while still eating healthy food that's divided into proper individual portions.

, Use a small container or tube with a separate lid to carry the sauces, salad dressings, or dips you plan to use with your bento box meal. If you get a container that only holds an ounce or two, you can better control your portions than if you just use a whole jar or bottle.Make sure any liquids in your bento box are closed so that they won't get all over everything else in transit.
Some bento boxes have a small raised compartment designed specifically for liquids. The sides of this compartment go all the way up to the lid to prevent leaks – however, it may not be entirely leak-proof since it isn't sealed the same way the outside of the box is. Keep that in mind before you throw your bento box into your backpack or turn it upside down.

, Even if you're on a diet, you don't necessarily have to deprive yourself of the little treats you love. Just enjoy them in incredibly small amounts so you can satisfy your craving without blowing your diet.For example, if you're putting together a bento box full of sweet and salty snacks to eat at work over the course of a day, you might include a mini cupcake liner with a half a handful of chocolate candy or jellybeans.
These small amounts also can be a good way to add some fun and variety to your bento box meal while still exhibiting good portion control.

Use vegetables as pasta noodles.,
Add flavorful herbs instead of heavy sauces.,
Use unsaturated fats (like oils) instead of saturated fats.,
Add vegetables to bulk up your dish.,
Add lean meats to your noodle dishes.",How to Make Noodles a Healthy Food1," Turning vegetables into noodles is all the craze lately. You can even purchase something called a spiralizer to turn vegetables into perfectly coiled pieces that look just like pasta. The best part is they are vegetables so they’re an extremely healthy alternative to the traditional noodle.


Zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, asparagus, and any other vegetable that contains a good deal of moisture can be turned into a noodle.
Even better, try spaghetti squash, and you won't need a spiralizer. Simply cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, and bake it face-down in the over for about 30 minutes. Then take a fork and rake the squash to make ""noodles."";
, By putting flavor-rich and healthy items into your pasta you can make your dish more flavorful without needing a heavy and high-calorie sauce to make it yummy. Really robust herbs like rosemary, sage, parsley, thyme, and basil are good options for adding flavor.


Try adding fresh chopped cilantro or parsley just before serving for a touch of green and great flavor.

, Drenching your noodles in thick, rich and high-calorie fats (or saturated fats, like butter, milk fats, lard, and hydrogenated oils) is not the way to make noodles a healthy food. Olive oil is a great source of unsaturated (healthy) fat and can be used to add flavor to a dish. It is especially good for the development of a tasty sauce.Avoid using full-fat milk when making a pasta sauce or butter or cream. If you can't avoid creamy sauces altogether, use skim or reduced fat milks.

Many of these ingredients are mixed and processed to make basic foodstuffs, primarily flour, but gluten can also be found in less obvious products such as lunch meats and soy sauce.A gluten free diet implies nutrition without these ingredients or their products.


A gluten free diet is the best way to treat celiac disease and to protect children who are sensitive to gluten. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that occurs in the intestines, with symptoms such as diarrhea, pains in the stomach, vomiting, loss of nutrients, and a delay in development.Gluten sensitivity and intolerance includes, in addition to the symptoms of celiac disease, symptoms such as pain and stiffness in the joints, headaches, and a sleepy or foggy mind.Gluten acts as a toxin for children with gluten intolerance, as it hinders their ability to absorb the nutrients found in healthy foods.But for children without celiac disease, a gluten-free diet can deprive them of the important nutrients like Iron and vitamin B, found in foods like cereals, pasta, and bread, so a gluten free diet may not be necessary unless your child suffers from celiac disease or a gluten intolerance.;
, Explain what gluten is, which foods have gluten and the reasons why gluten should be avoided to your child.


Go shopping together and walk through the aisles to discuss whether certain foods are good for them to eat or bad for them, and why. Allow your child to help choose gluten free versions of the food they love or enjoy.
Educating your child on the benefits of a gluten free diet will help to lessen the stigma of having different lunches than their friends at school and encourage your child not to share or accept food from their friends as it may not be gluten free., Always read all the ingredients listed on the label as even a small amount of gluten can be harmful to your child. Gluten free foods generally means that the food contains less than 20 parts per million of gluten.Start by checking for the more obvious sources of gluten: wheat, barley, or rye.
Though not as obvious, gluten can hide in the following ingredients: flakes, brewer's yeast, durum einkorn, emmer, farro, spelt, kamut, dinkel (types of wheat) graham flour, semolina, modified wheat starch, malt and any products containing malt (malt extract, malt vinegar, malt flavoring, malt syrup), and rye bread., Pay special attention when you purchase the following foods, as they likely contain gluten: bread, cereals, chips, crackers, biscuits, some chocolates, pasta, spices, sauces, and soups (especially cream soups that use flour as a thickener).Look for gluten free versions of these foods, as many of these products are now available commercially without gluten., Many processed foods contain gluten which can be accidentally consumed by your child, such as luncheon meats and sausages. Imitation meat substitutes may also contain gluten ingredients or grains. Imitation seafood, such as crabstick, will also contain gluten.Keep an eye out for these unsafe ingredients on packages of processed food: bread flour, cookie crumbs, edible starch, enriched flour, protein, malt syrup, seitan, and semolina., It’s always safer and easier to incorporate foods that do not contain gluten into your child’s lunch.For example:


Eggs and milk products, such as cheese, yogurt, and milk.
Vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, beans, corn, and potatoes.
Fruits such as oranges, bananas, strawberries, cherries, apples, apricots, and watermelon.
All kinds of fresh meat such as chicken, turkey, pork, and fish.
Many common condiments do not contain gluten, such as mayonnaise, ketchup, peanut butter, mustard, jam, and marmalade.

, It is possible to find gluten free flour and foods made ​​from gluten free flour like pasta, cookies and bread.Some examples of gluten-free bread include: Udi’s Whole Grain Bread, Kinnikinnik Foods Brown Sandwich Bread, or Whole Foods Market Gluten Free Bakehouse All Natural Sandwich Bread. If you plan to use a gluten free flour for home baking, it is not as simple as replacing wheat flour with gluten free flour and following the same recipes. Gluten-free flours must be combined together to create similar baked good with gluten, and you will need to use a binding agent such as xanthan gum or ground chia seeds or flax seeds.So once you find a gluten free flour mix that works for you, make large amounts and store it in a cool, dry place so it will always be ready for use in your baking.
Examples of gluten-free flours include: rice flour (white and brown), amaranth flour, arrowroot flour, corn flour, hemp flour, potato flour, soy flour, and tapioca flour.Examples of mixtures that can be used for gluten free baking include: equal parts of bean flour, cornstarch powder and tapioca flour or one and a half cups of potato and brown rice flour and one cup of tapioca flour., Though the rest of your family may eat gluten, dedicate one shelf in the fridge or pantry to gluten free only products to lessen the risk of cross contamination and to make it easier for you to make gluten free meals quickly and correctly.


If your whole family is going gluten free, a gluten free only pantry and a fridge stocked with only gluten free products removes any risk of cross contamination and lessens the temptation to eat gluten.

, Creating a weekly meal plan will save you time preparing meals the night before or in the morning and ensure you child has a gluten free meal every day. , Although they may seem fussy or complicated, gluten free lunches can be full of variety and very tasty. Create different food combinations that best suit your child’s taste and make sure the food you prepare is diverse and varied so your child doesn’t get bored with their lunches.For example, avoid packing peanut butter and jelly with gluten free bread every day for a week straight for your child's lunch. Vary up the types of sandwiches you make with gluten free bread, or integrate corn tortillas or quinoa into their lunches as an alternative starch or grain.

, Fruits and vegetables are safe to include in your child’s lunch since these foods are gluten free, packed with essential carbohydrates to give your child energy, and of course, very good for them.


Slice up fruits evenly and nicely and make your fruit preparation as colorful as possible. You can also create animals or shapes out of the fruits and vegetables to make them more appetizing to your child or create fruit and vegetable kebabs. Include a dip on the side for added taste and flavor, as most children love to dip their food., A treat will act as a form of encouragement for your child to eat their lunch and then enjoy their treat at the end.Good treats include a piece of fruit, a gluten-free cookie, gluten free candy, or a gluten free chocolate bar.

, Here are some examples of possible gluten free meals for your child:


Gluten free pasta with vegetables, ham, or leftover chicken, with a treat of apricots or grapes on the side.
A sausage and veggie meal, with a fruit such as berries or strawberries as a treat.
A baked potato with cheese and ham, a boiled egg, and condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise in separate small containers to encourage dipping.
A vegetarian meal like rice, mushrooms and carrots, with a treat of yogurt and bananas.
A meal with fish, cooked potato, cabbage salad and apples as a treat.

, A lunch box and thermos with your child’s favorite cartoon or superhero will help them get excited about carrying their own special lunch, and even if the food is not initially very enticing, it will at least appear more attractive to them.Encourage them to also pick out a matching thermos for healthy drinks. Make sure the thermos seals well and will preserve flavor and freshness. When water or juice is fresh, your child will be more encouraged to drink it.

, Have your child participate in choosing their gluten free lunch and help you package their lunch in their lunch box. Offer two options for lunch and let them pick the one they prefer. Doing this will allow your child to actively participate in choosing their gluten free meal, and hopefully enjoy their selection., Reusable containers cut down on the amount of waste you throw out every day, and save you money. They are also convenient and safe to use as they are leak proof, and divided into sections so you can prepare a variety of gluten free foods for your child's lunch.Make sure the plastic, reusable containers for your child's lunch are also free of BPA. BPA stands for Bisphenol A, which is an industrial chemical that has been used to make certain kinds of plastics. Exposure to BPA can lead to health risks that potentially affect behavior, brain, and prostate glands, especially in infants and young children. There are some containers that are already clearly marked as BPA-free, and stainless steel or glass containers are naturally BPA free. You can also call the manufacturer of the containers to check if they are BPA-free.

, Giving your child’s teacher a heads up on their gluten free diet will help the teacher watch for any cross contamination in the lunchroom and keep your child’s diet in mind when interacting with the other kids.The teacher can also ensure special meal is available for your child if a class party or trip involves a shared meal, or let you know you will need to provide a special meal for your child, such as gluten free pizza for a pizza party, or gluten free treats for a birthday or holiday celebration.

, Children can be exposed to ridicule or teasing from classmates that have a standard lunch, so try to mask gluten free food to appear similar to traditional lunch foods.For example, make bread from gluten-free flour or buy gluten free bread to make sandwiches, make pizza dough without gluten and pack a pizza for your child, or make corn tortillas with gluten free filling to make burritos.

, It is not uncommon for children in school to trade their lunches because their lunch becomes too familiar or monotonous, no matter how many special treats you pack from them. However, trading and sharing food can be dangerous for a child who is sensitive to gluten or has celiac disease, as this can lead to contact with gluten and an unwanted allergic reaction."

You can find most of the ingredients in a well-stocked grocery store, but you may also order them online. For example, lecithin may be difficult to find in a grocery store. To make liposomal vitamin C, you will need:Distilled water
Vodka (40% alcohol)
Vitamin C powder or tablets (also sold as ascorbic acid)
Powdered lecithin derived from soy or sunflower seeds (make certain the product you buy does not contain GMOs)
High power blender
Scale that measures in grams or ounces
Large glass container, such as a measuring cup or beaker
Large mason jar;
, It is necessary to use steam-distilled water for this recipe. Do not use regular tap water. Measure and pour the water and the vodka into the glass container. If you have a measuring cup with measurements on the side, then this is ideal., Measure out 6 ounces of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) powder and add it to the vodka and water mixture. Stir the vitamin C into the water and vodka until the vitamin C is completely dissolved.To make sure that the vitamin C powder is fully dissolved, you may also want to heat this mixture in a ceramic pan until it reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).

,
Leave your cornbread mix out at room temperature for about 2 minutes or so to let the ingredients settle.,
Spray your cooking pan with cooking spray so your cornbread will not stick to the sides.,
Slowly stir your cornbread mix a final time and pour it slowly into your cooking pan.,
Place the pan into the oven and let it sit in the oven until it reaches a golden-brown color.,
When it's done, remove from the oven.",How to Make Cornbread Without Milk," When pouring, pour slowly and gently so the powder does not explode into your face or counter top.;
,


The corn muffin mix most likely already contains salt and flour in the pre-made ingredients. When adding extra salt and/or flour, you may not want to add too much.

, You can decide of course whether or not you will be using the egg whites, yolk, or the entire egg.

, As shocking as it may seem, mayonnaise is a perfect substitute for milk when making cornbread for the lactose intolerant. You won't really notice the difference in taste in the cornbread; it's mainly for holding your cornbread together so it doesn't crumble apart.


It's a myth that all mayonnaise contains milk/aged milk, but some brands will have milk added to it. Pay close attention to the ingredients listed on the mayonnaise bottle.

, Pull out your whisk and/or electric mixer and stir the wet ingredients for about 10-20 seconds.


If your mix ends up too thick, simply add a tablespoon of water and stir it in. Repeat this until your mix is at your desired thickness/thinness.

,, Preheat your oven to 400°F while your cornbread mix sits out.

, Make sure that the pan you are using is ""Deep Dish"" as if you were about to bake a layer of cake. Using thin cookie sheets may result in your cornbread cooking entirely too fast thus breaking apart, and then you'll have burnt cornbread cookie-looking things. That doesn't sound tasty, right?

, Spread out the cornbread mix evenly in your pan so all sides will cook evenly.


Avoid overfilling the pan though; the cornbread mix will rise in the over and if it's over filled, it will rise over the sides and make a complete, lactose free, mess!

, Periodically stick a knife into the middle of the cornbread mix and lift up the knife, If the cornbread mix is still wet and sticks onto the knife, it must cook longer.


This baking process may take 20 minutes maximum. Always remember to constantly check on your food because it will cook fast meaning it may also burn fast.
Different oven racks may make the cooking time a few minutes longer or a few minutes shorter, always keep a watchful eye on the mix.

, Let it cool before cutting it up and enjoying the results of your hard work!

Prepare your breakfast the night before.,
Plan a week’s worth of breakfasts.,
Stash breakfast-y snacks at work.",How to Make Breakfast a Daily Habit1," Perhaps the best step you can take to help get in the habit of eating breakfast is making it the night before. One easy, healthy option is making oatmeal in the evening. In the morning, you can eat it cold or reheat it. Mix in nuts, fruit, or a handful of raisins and a bit of cinnamon.Oats are a great breakfast food, as they are high in fiber and will keep you feeling full well into your day.
Whole grain muffins are another good quick grab-and-go option. Make a big batch to last you through the week - and even longer if you freeze some.
You can even do the prep work for a quick omelet ahead of time by whisking the eggs and chopping the veggies ahead of time and storing them in the fridge overnight.;
, Whether you prefer to change up your breakfast day to to day or eat the same thing everyday, planning ahead will help you establish a routine. If you like to vary your meals, make a weekly plan so you can get everything you need and have it at the house. If you know you like to eat the same thing every day, stock up on what you need.For instance, have a backup tub of Greek yogurt and an extra bag of granola on hand in case your current supply runs out.

, For those days when you do wind up running a bit behind, store food at work so you don’t have to go without breakfast. Definitely store a few items with stable shelf life in your desk or locker. Good options include a jar of peanut butter, protein bars, and dried fruit.If you have access to a refrigerator, consider storing protein shakes and cheese sticks in it.

Garnish the dessert.",How to Make Healthy Banana Pudding2," Separate four eggs, keeping all of the egg yolks. In a medium-sized glass, whisk together the yolks, honey, and arrowroot powder. Whisk until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed., In a small saucepan, heat the coconut milk over medium heat for five minutes, stirring it occasionally. Then slowly pour the warm coconut milk into the egg mixture, whisking it constantly. Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and cook it over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir regularly to avoid boiling and remove it once the pudding thickens.Stirring regularly helps heat the mixture evenly and prevents it from burning.

, In a medium-sized bowl, mash the bananas. Then pour the pudding into a large bowl. Whisk in the vanilla and mashed bananas until thoroughly mixed. Let the pudding sit for one hour in the refrigerator to congeal., Once the pudding reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the refrigerator. Spoon the pudding into a small bowl or glass. Top it with banana slices or chopped walnuts.If there are leftovers, place them in an air-tight container and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Grab and go.,
Set your alarm fifteen minutes earlier.,
Don't eat too much late at night.,
Eat with another person.,
Have something light before exercising.,
Open the blinds.,
Eat whatever sounds good.",How to Make Breakfast a Daily Habit2," Some people simply don’t want to be bothered by preparing a breakfast in the morning. While this is entirely understandable, it’s important to recognize that you’ll be more productive during the day if you kick start your metabolism with at least a small breakfast in the morning.Good quick options include a handful of almonds, a whole grain English muffin, a hard boiled egg, or fresh fruit with reduced-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt.
You could keep a box of Cliff bars or a similar prepackaged bar in the car if you find yourself rushing out the door every morning.

, If the reason you tend not to eat breakfast everyday is because you’re in a rush to get out of the door, you need to adjust your schedule. Get up ten to fifteen minutes earlier to give yourself a chance to start your day more calmly - and with the opportunity to eat something as well., If you actually want to be hungry in the morning, you should stop eating at least 2 hours before bed. If you are always hungry during the night, think about whether your dinner meals are adequately satiating., Make breakfast a social occasion by sitting down at the table with your family or a roommate each morning. Over time this will help make breakfast a habit., Even if the thought of eating early in the morning doesn’t appeal to you, get in the habit of eating breakfast by starting small. If you like to exercise in the morning, it's important to eat something - even if only a piece of fruit, before your workout. Exercising will also increase your appetiteOne great option for those who don’t wake up hungry is a smoothie. Not only will a smoothie give you the health benefits of eating breakfast, they can also be made to be especially nutritious.
The specific ingredients in a breakfast smoothie are up to you. Use plenty of fruits and veggies, and consider using a liquid dairy alternative as the base, such as almond milk. Include powdered protein or seeds for additional vitamins and nutrients.
If you start the day with something small and then exercise, be sure to eat a more substantial meal within two hours after you work out.

, It may seem too easy to be true, but simply opening your blinds can help get your metabolic patterns on a more consistent pattern. This, in turn, can help you feel hungrier in the morning. For maximum effectiveness, open your blinds all the way as soon as you wake up and enjoy the sunlight while you’re getting dressed and preparing for the day.Get dressed before you get to the kitchen. Getting dressed for work before making your morning dietary decisions can help motivate you to be conscious of your health when deciding what you want to eat.

, There are many foods that are commonly considered ""breakfast foods,"" but this distinction is ultimately unimportant. If you feel like eating leftovers from the night before or slicing up a tomato with fresh mozzarella, feel free! The important thing is to get something in your body that has nutritional value.In fact, look to include more vegetables in your diet wherever possible. Even if you do go for a breakfast classic like an omelet, include asparagus, bell peppers, or other veggies.

"
"
Include some protein.,
Get some whole grains too.,
Default to savory options.,
Don’t ditch yolks entirely.,
Take care with caffeine.",How to Make Breakfast a Daily Habit3," Protein is an important component of a healthy breakfast. This is in part because protein is digested more slowly than carbs, for instance, and will help you feel full longer. Lean, low-fat options are the best. For example, opt for low-fat Greek yogurt, soy or turkey sausage, or eggs.If your breakfast includes dairy products, opt for skim or low-fat options.

, In addition to protein, fiber is also extremely important, as this will help keep you nourished and satiated well into the day as well. Perhaps the easiest option is cereal - but read the nutrition facts. Beware of misleading portion sizes and high amounts of sugar in many cereals.Check the nutritional label of any cereals and only go with options that have whole grains listed as the first ingredient. Further, make sure your selection has less than 10 grams of sugar, at least 3 grams of fiber, and is free of artificial coloring.

, Though many breakfast options are rather sugary, these are not the best options. Aside from selecting options based on protein and fiber, opt for seasonings like pepper and turmeric instead of syrup or brown sugar.When you do want a bit of sweetness to something like oatmeal, use fruit or honey.
Cutting to the chase, skip the donut shop. The only thing worse than skipping breakfast in the morning is loading up on sugar and unhealthy fats with your first meal of the day.

, While egg whites are lower in calories and fats, it’s important to note that egg yolks do contain highly valuable nutritional components like protein, healthy fats, choline and a variety of vitamins. A good option for an omelet is one whole egg and one or two “egg’s worth” of egg whites.

, Drinking coffee in the morning will curb your appetite and may be causing you to eat less. Unfortunately, if you ride the caffeine train all day and don’t eat much, you’re metabolism will slow down, and you’ll risk storing a bunch of fat following an evening meal - which is likely to be larger than necessary if you hadn’t eaten all day.Further, you may be setting yourself up for failure by trying to get by on coffee alone. Not only is the coffee-only approach unhealthy, you’re even more likely to wind up caving in and grabbing one of those volleyball-sized cinnamon rolls when you go for a refill before eating something healthy.

Cut sweets out of your diet.,
Choose complex carbohydrate foods.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Avoid trans fats and saturated fats.,
Choose healthier options for cooking oils.,
Eat foods with omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Lower Triglycerides Naturally1," Too many simple carbohydrates can keep triglyceride levels elevated. Sadly, this means that you can lower levels by cutting out sweets.This includes sugary soft drinks, candy, cookies, and other processed foods with too much sugar., You should generally cut back on carbohydrates to help reduce your triglyceride levels.However, you should not try to cut them out of your diet entirely, as this can lead to health complications, including heart disease.Instead, avoid refined carbohydrates in favor of complex carbohydrates.Refined carbohydrates include items made from white flour or semolina, including white rice, white bread, and many pastas.Complex carbohydrates option include whole wheat pasta, grain breads, quinoa, brown rice, oats, etc., This step is closely related to the last since complex carbohydrates tend to be a good source of fiber. In addition to whole grain foods, beans, fruits, vegetables, and seeds are all excellent sources of fiber.Try replacing your sugary snacks with pumpkin seeds, raspberries, or apples—all of which are great sources of fiber.You should aim to consume 25 to 30 grams (0.88 to 1.1 oz) of fiber each day. Most Americans consume closer to only 10 or 12 grams (0.35 or 0.42 oz) each day.Increased fiber will also have an effect on digestion and keeping you regular. You can increase fiber slowly to avoid discomfort. You should also ensure you drink enough water to help soften the stool., You can avoid trans fats by keeping away from foods that say “hydrogenated vegetable oil” on the list of ingredients.When it comes to saturated fats, this means fried foods, dressings, and sauces that are rich in butter, shortening, or lard.Foods that commonly contain trans fats are processed meats (such as hot dogs and lunch meat) and fatty snack options., When cooking at home, use olive oil, flaxseed oil, walnut oil, or canola oil to cook foods. These are much better options than butter, margarine, or lard.This is a fundamentally simple but critical step in lowering triglycerides. Even the healthiest of foods can be made unhealthy by cooking them in oils that are saturated or trans fats.

, You may have heard about the “good” fats found in fish. This refers to omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower your triglycerides.In addition to fish, you can also find these nutrients in flaxseed, legumes, soy products, and leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale.The American Heart Association suggests that you eat two servings of fish each week. Healthy options include salmon, tuna, trout, and mackerel.When you do eat red meat, opt for grass-fed sources as they contain more omega-3 and omega-6 fats."
"
Stop smoking.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Decrease your alcohol intake.",How to Lower Triglycerides Naturally2," Along with the wide array of other health complications related to smoking, it can also raise your triglycerides.The single best step smokers can take to help with an entire range of health-related conditions is to stop smoking.


Cold turkey rarely works, though. Try to quit gradually by using a variety of resources, including nicotine gum and other smoking cessation aids. You can find more info at How to Quit Smoking


, Burning calories can also help burn off excess triglycerides in your body to lower levels.In addition, being physically inactive (often combined with being overweight) are two things that increase your triglyceride levels.If you are overweight, then losing even a moderate ten to fifteen pounds can help reduce your triglyceride levels.The American Heart Association recommends that you get 150 minutes of moderate cardio exercise each week (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise).This breaks down to thirty minutes a day and can include anything that gets your heart rate going—from jogging to sports to swimming., Some people have a sensitivity to alcohol that causes an increase in triglyceride levels.For these people, even small quantities of alcohol can raise levels, so try cutting back significantly to see if it affects your triglycerides.Unfortunately, the type of alcohol doesn’t matter. You should cut back on beer, wine, and mixed drinks that contain hard liquor."
"
Take fish oil supplements.,
Add psyllium to your daily regimen.,
Add soy protein to your daily intake.,
Take vitamin B3 supplements.",How to Lower Triglycerides Naturally3," If you want the healthy omega-3 fats but can’t stand fish, you can simply take fish oil supplements containing omega-3s. These supplements have been shown to lower triglyceride levels in adults.EPA and DHA are the fish oils you want to maximize omega-3s. Take as directed.

, If you have trouble packing enough fiber into your daily routine, then you can add a psyllium supplement. Psyllium is a water-soluble form of fiber, and it is available in several forms, including pills and powders that you stir into a glass of water (such as Metamucil). Studies have shown that high-fiber diets including psyllium lead to lower levels of triglycerides., Soy protein supplementation is most commonly available in a powder form that you can mix into a variety juices, smoothies, etc. Many studies have shown that soy protein supplementation can lower triglycerides, as well as having an overall positive effect on your cholesterol levels.Take as directed.


Studies have shown that whey protein can also positively affect triglyceride levels., Vitamin B3 (niacin) has also proven effective at lowering triglyceride levels.However, you should consult your doctor and monitor niacin supplementation closely as common side effects at high doses include:Skin flushing
Upset stomach
Headaches
Dizzy spells
Blurred vision
Risk of damage to your liver

Try tummy-control garments.,
Take advantage of current trends in corseting and waist training.,
Consider a body wrap.,
Reduce your water weight.",How to Lose Stomach Fat Without Exercise or Dieting1," There have never been more options in the undergarment industry for clothing that tighten, firm, and shape the midsection. Made mainstream by Spanx, tummy-control garments are available in many types for people of most sizes.


Women's undergarments include tummy-control pantyhose, panties, high-waisted shorts, body suits, camisoles, and tank tops made of Lycra, elastic, or some combination. Most mainstream undergarment brands for women carry control top styles, but the most popular include Spanx, Soma, and TC Shaping. Buy your normal size and expect it to run small.
There are many options for men, including Spanx or Sculptees brand tank tops for men that target the abdominals. These are essentially compression shirts that whittle the appearance of the midsection. While results will vary, these companies claim their products can reduce the midsection by 3 – 5 inches (7.6 – 12.7 cm).;
, This method involves wearing a binding garment across the abdomen. If done in moderation, corseting can create a thinner silhouette without any other lifestyle changes.


Some celebrities swear by corseting as a weight loss mechanism, and although doctors say it won't actually help you lose fat cells, it can help you lose weight by cinching in your stomach as you eat so that you don't have as much room to overeat.In addition, the fat cell can expand or shrink, according to how much fat it is storing.
Be careful about wearing these too tight or too frequently. Because they can reduce your stomach capacity, you might vomit after eating even a normal sized meal. They can also contribute to heartburn and compress your organs.Purchase your corset at a store with a knowledgeable sales staff, who can help you fit it correctly and learn to lace it appropriately so that it is not too tight.

, Body wraps are spa treatments that claim to detoxify and slim the midsection. With training, these can also be done at home. While the process can vary, most involve several steps and the application of several types of body products.The aesthetician will start by massaging and applying a body scrub to your midsection, which will then be rinsed in a shower. The body scrub will contain a variety of herbs and minerals thought to cleanse the skin of impurities and reduce the appearance of fat or cellulite.
The body will then be rubbed with a lotion or oil containing other emollients and properties.
Next, the midsection will be securely wrapped in linen, plastic, or thermal sheets, and then an electric heated blanket will be used to warm the body for about 30 minutes, which will cause sweating. This step in particular is thought to remove impurities and reduce the appearance of fat.
After removing the blanket and wraps, the midsection will be massaged again to increase blood flow.
While this process is not supported for weight loss, many clients feel that it reduces the appearance of stomach fat and cellulite, especially with repeated treatments. Due to the sweating process (and loss of water weight), it is not uncommon for clients to experience a loss of a couple of inches, although this will be temporary., The body can retain water for various reasons, giving a bloated appearance particularly around the waist. Reducing water weight will temporarily slim the waistline.Hydrate. In many cases, water retention is the body's effort to prevent dehydration when you are not taking in enough water per day. This is especially true in hotter months. Be sure you are drinking at least eight 8-oz glasses of hydrating fluids a day (or 2 liters), which will help flush out your system and reduce bloating and puffiness.Reduce your sodium intake. Excess salt causes the body to retain water. Processed foods and restaurant foods are the major source of sodium for the average American. These foods account for about 75% of the sodium in the diet. You should consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day, which is a little over 1/2 teaspoon of salt.Reduce your alcohol and coffee consumption. These drinks are known to cause dehydration, which can cause water retention in the body (as the body struggles to hold onto whatever water it can). "

Avoid swallowing air.,
Practice good posture.,
Get enough sleep.,
Find a fitness-positive support network.,
Start tracking your weight.",How to Lose Stomach Fat Without Exercise or Dieting2," This might seem like a strange suggestion, but swallowed air is one of the biggest causes of bloating, which contributes to a rounder midsection. Simply reducing the amount of air you swallow throughout the day can trim down your tummy measurements.


Avoid carbonated beverages, even those with zero calories like carbonated water. Beverages with air in them fill your abdomen with air, which causes a bloated appearance.
Avoid smoking. Smokers who inhale smoke also tend to swallow it, which bloats their stomachs.
Avoid chewing gum and talking while eating. Both of these habits lead to swallowed air.

, Changing the way you carry yourself and sit won't make stomach fat disappear, but it will make you look slimmer by helping your body fat distribute properly across the torso rather than gathering at the midsection. Try to keep your upper body straight, your shoulders pulled back, and your head high.


When you sit, your buttocks should touch the back of your chair, and all three normal back curves should be present in your back (meaning a small towel or washcloth rolled up should fit above your buttocks).When you stand, keep your shoulders back, pull in your stomach, and keep your feet about hip width apart.If you're willing to do a little exercise, movements that strengthen your core and back can make it easier to maintain your posture while tightening up the muscles around your midsection. Try adding a few light crunches and easy back exercises to your schedule as you improve your posture.

, Sleeping doesn't burn fat on its own, but it is a crucial part of weight loss efforts. This is mainly because sleep deprivation (not getting enough sleep) makes most aspects of weight loss more difficult. When you aren't well rested, it's hard to motivate yourself to get up and move. It's also hard to control cravings: you're more likely to act on impulses to eat junk food when you're already drained of energy.While everyone's sleep needs are different, the majority of adults need about seven to nine hours per night. Children and elderly people tend to need more., Surrounding yourself with people who are committed to healthy living can help you live healthier. Hanging out with health-conscious people gives you more opportunities to participate in activities that lead to weight loss. Make an effort to spend time with people who enjoy hobbies that promote healthy living, like walking, sports, cycling, nutritious home cooking, and so on. Limit your time with people who have unhealthy hobbies like eating junk food, binge-drinking, and watching hour after hour of television.If you don't have anyone in your family or circle of friends who is interested in health-conscious activities, don't be afraid to make new contacts. Join an intramural sports team or start participating in pickup games at your local park. Take a healthy cooking course or join a spin class at your local community center. There are many healthy ways to meet people — it's up to you!

, Some nutrition experts suggest that having an accurate idea of your own weight can promote healthy living.Keeping track of your weight forces you to think healthy — if the numbers on the scale start to go up, you'll know that it's time to reconsider your habits.


A person's weight can fluctuate by as much as 10 pounds from day to day. To get an accurate average, measure yourself at the same time every day (like right after you get up). At the end of the week, add up your measurements and divide by seven. The number you get will be close to your ""true"" average weight.

Drink plenty of water.,
Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Measure out each serving of food.,
Eat breakfast.,
Make smart food choices.,
Keep your portions under control when you eat away from home.,
Switch to foods that leave you feeling fuller longer.,
Eat slowly.,
Eat in peaceful, quiet locations.,
Record your meals.",How to Lose Stomach Fat Without Exercise or Dieting3," If you drink soda, sports drinks, flavored coffees with sugar and cream, or other high-calorie beverages throughout the day, try replacing them with water. You'll get the same level of hydration and fullness while cutting down on your calories. Keep it up and you can achieve mild weight loss without any extra effort.


The health benefits of water are well-documented. Drinking water energizes muscles, keeps skin looking healthy and clear, and provides a boost of energy.Best of all, it's zero-calorie, so you can drink as much as you want. See our tips on working water into your daily schedule for more great ideas.
Don't be fooled into swapping soda for fruit juice, which is full of calories. The process of juicing removes all the healthy fiber from fruit and leaves nothing but sugar behind.Stick with water or zero-calorie flavored waters for the most tummy-friendly hydration.

, Instead of three large meals a day, try eating several smaller meals of a few hundred calories. This can reset your hunger cues so that you will know when you are actually hungry versus eating out of habit.


One convenient way to reduce your portion sizes is simply to use a smaller plate. Smaller plates can make the same amount of food appear larger due to something called the Delboeuf illusion.You're essentially ""tricking"" your brain into being satisfied with less food.

, Don't trust your eyes to tell you how much to eat — instead, use your brain. With recent trends in commercial cuisine tending towards large portions, many people now have a distorted idea of what a normal portion of food looks like. Use measuring cups and the information on the ""Nutrition Facts"" section of your food's packaging to ensure you eat one serving at a time. You may even want to invest in a simple food scale.


Many common foods have serving sizes that are easy to visually memorize. A few common examples are below (you can view more here):

Vegetables and fruit: about the size of your fist
Meat, fish, or poultry: about the size of your palm (minus the fingers)
Cheese or fatty spreads: about the size of your thumb
Carbohydrates (rice, pasta, etc.): about the size of a cupcake wrapper



, Many Americans skip breakfastand then overcompensate for their resulting hunger by overeating at lunch and dinner.


Ensure that your breakfast contains at least one item from three food groups: dairy, fruit, and grains.If you are on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, you could have eggs and cheese. The important thing is that food intake in the morning actually gets your metabolism going, and you do not remain in the fasting state
A healthy breakfast for a 150 pound adult is about 300 – 400 calories.

, A healthy diet is more friendly to the waistline than a non-healthy one, even if the calorie content is the same.


Eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead of processed snacks. Processed foods have added preservatives, artificial ingredients, and are often full of carbohydrates, sugar, and fat. Fresh foods give you more nutrition per calorie than processed, carbohydrate heavy snack foods like chips or crackers. Processed foods also tend to contain more salt, which retains fluid and can lead to excess weight stored around the midsection.
Never snack directly out of the bag or carton. One study found that people given a large bucket of popcorn ate 44% more popcorn than those given smaller buckets.It's much easier to overeat when a large portion of food is in front of you. Instead, pour one serving of the snack into a bowl, then put the package away.

, Controlling portions at home when you sit down for a meal is often easier than at a restaurant, where portions sizes for one meal often contain the recommended calories for one person for an entire day, or at a friend's house, where you cannot control what goes into the meal. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to control your portion size in places where you don't have perfect control over your food:Plan what you will order ahead of time. Many restaurants have websites with complete nutritional information for their menus, so you can make a smart choice before you even leave your house.When you're at a restaurant, ask the waiter to bring a takeout container at the same time as your food. Measure out one portion, then put the rest in the container right away. You'll be less tempted to mindlessly continue eating as you talk with your companions.
When dining at another person's house, don't be afraid to ask for a small portion. This way you can clean your plate, instead of leaving a portion of food behind and potentially offending your host.
When shopping, pick individually-sized foods, rather than foods that come in large containers. For instance, instead of buying a carton of ice cream, pick up a package of popsicles or ice cream sandwiches.

, When it comes to reducing your tummy line, it's not all about how much you eat, but also what you eat that counts. Certain foods give short ""bursts"" of energy and satisfaction, but leave you hungry before your next meal. Instead of these foods, focus on alternatives that offer long-term satisfaction.


Filling foods that offer longer periods of satisfaction include whole-grain breads, rices, and pastas, oats, nuts, water, lean meats and fish, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and legumes.Non-filling foods include sodas, processed snack foods, ""white"" breads, rices, and pastas, candy, and starches.

, When you eat quickly, you can swallow a surprising amount of food before you start to feel full and satisfied. On the other hand, eating slowly gives you plenty of time to feel full and stop eating before you've consumed more calories than you need. There is even evidence that this can promote the release of specific hormones that are responsible for the feeling of fullness in the brain.Take time to eat your food. Concentrate on chewing each bite 10 – 20 times and take sips of water between each bite. Set the fork or spoon down between each bite. If you can, eat with someone else so you can pause to chat during your meal.
Try setting a timer for 20 – 30 minutes at the start of your meal. Pace yourself so that you don't take the last bite until the timer goes off.
When you finish your food, take a break from eating, even if you still feel a little hungry. Give your body a chance to register as having a full stomach, which can sometimes take a while. Only help yourself to seconds if you still feel hungry after another half an hour.

, Research suggests that eating in relaxing environments leads people to eat less overall. On the other hand, eating in loud, busy, chaotic environments can lead to over-eating. While the root cause isn't certain, this may be because these sorts of situations distract from feelings of fullness by creating mild anxiety.One common cause for rushed, panicked eating is being late to school or work. Fixing this is a matter of adjusting your schedule. Consider getting up earlier so you have a chance to enjoy a relaxed breakfast before you leave.

, Merely keeping track of what you eat can be an enlightening experience. You may be surprised to learn that you normally eat more than you think you do. Try writing your meals and snacks in a notebook you carry with you every day. Be sure to note the number of servings you eat for each as well as the calorie content per serving.

Take the time to remove all of these foods. You can toss them, donate them to friends or give unopened items to a food bank.
You can also slowly finish off these foods and once they are gone, do not purchase them again.

, If you enjoy fast food meals, fried foods or meals that are overly processed, you may benefit from doing some research on healthy ways to cook those same foods.


Look for healthy versions of your favorite recipes or foods online. Many food bloggers and cooking websites offer great tips and ideas for healthy spins on common high-calorie, high-fat meals.
There are also cookbooks that solely focus on healthy remakes or healthy swaps of comfort foods.
Look for recipes like this of your favorite foods and start incorporating some of these healthier recipes into your week.

, Many studies have shown that those people who cook from home more often tend to eat healthier and consume fewer calories overall compared to those who cook less.One of the main benefits of cooking from home is that you know exactly what goes into your foods, meals or snacks. Even when trying to order something healthy at a restaurant, you may not be exactly sure what's in that particular meal.
Cooking from home also lets you control the amount of certain ingredients you use in food preparation. You can control the amount of added fat, sugar and sodium.
In addition, when you cook from home you can make extra and prep take away lunches, snacks or meals on the fly. It takes away the excuse that you need to eat out.

, Protein is an essential component of a healthy diet. It helps provide energy and nutrition for you throughout the day; however, some protein sources and methods of cooking protein aren't as nutritious or good for your health.


Choose leaner cuts of protein over higher fat protein or fatty cuts of meat. Those higher fat proteins (like pork, processed meats, lard, butter, lamb)are typically high in saturated fat which can increased your cholesterol and risk of heart disease and stroke.Choosing leaner cuts of protein helps you avoid or minimize how much saturated fat is in your diet. Choose items like: skinless poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, seafood, legumes and tofu. Go for a 3 – 4 oz serving of protein per meal.In addition, choose healthy and nutritious methods of preparing protein foods — such as baking, boiling, or grilling — rather than frying.
Try to avoid: deep frying, frying or cooking in a lot of oil or butter, adding high-fat or high-calorie sauces (like cream sauces, cheese sauce or gravy) and avoid seasoning with lots of salt or seasonings high in sodium.
Instead of fried shrimp, try baking breaded shrimp. Instead of chicken Alfredo, toss chicken and pasta with naturally low-calorie marinara sauce. You can also swap 80/20 ground beef for 93/7 ground beef or lean ground turkey or chicken when making burgers or meatloaf. If you normally purchase poultry with the skin on, remove the skin or opt for the skinless versions for less fat. Purchase white meat poultry over dark meat.

, Another easy fix to add more nutritious foods to your diet is by swapping out refined grains for 100% whole grains.


Refined grains are those that are highly processed and have their nutrient-containing parts removed. Although they have a long shelf life, they're less filling and low in fiber and other essential nutrients.100% whole grains are minimally processed and are much higher in fiber, protein and other vitamins. Although very similar in calories, whole grains are much more nutritious than refined grains.Change your typical refined grains to whole grains like: oats, quinoa, brown rice, 100% whole wheat pasta or bread. Aim for 1/2 cup or 1 oz serving of these foods.Swap your typical plain spaghetti for whole grain or whole wheat versions. Choose brown rice or quinoa instead of white rice when making stir fry or curries.
If you're making baked goods like homemade bread, muffins or cakes try substituting half of the flour in the recipe with 100% whole wheat flour. (Completely substituting whole wheat flour for white flour usually requires a special recipe since whole wheat flour is much more dense than regular.)
Like protein, still consider how you prepare your grains. Avoid adding a lot of extra butter or oil or tossing them with higher fat or higher calorie sauces.

, Another quick way to make any meal more nutritious, is to include more fruits and vegetables.


Fruits and vegetables, even if they're minimally processed, offer a wide variety of benefits. They're low in calories, high in fiber and high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Swapping out a starchy side (like bread, rice or potatoes) or larger servings of protein for more fruits and vegetables will automatically lower the calories of your meals and increase their overall nutrition.
Aim for a total of five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Aim to make half your plate or meal fruits and/or vegetables.Like other foods, you can still make less healthy choices in this food group. Limit high-fat sauces (like cheese or cream sauce) on vegetables or adding too much butter or oil. Keep fruit simple and do not add any sugar, honey or other sweeteners to keep calories and sugar in check.
If you typically buy fruit cups or applesauce cups with added sugar, switch to no-sugar added varieties or those packed in their own juice. With vegetables, choose canned or frozen veggies without added salt or sauces to save calories.

, Even if you're trying to eat healthier and consume more nutritious foods, that doesn't mean you have to stop snacking.


Snacks are a great way to give yourself a boost of energy, added nutrition or enough fuel to get yourself through a workout.Try to avoid processed food snacks like: candy, cookies, chips, crackers or pastries. These are high in calories, sugar and fat.
If you're craving something salty or crunchy try having: low-sodium beef jerky, a hard boiled egg, 1/4 cup of nuts, raw vegetables and hummus or a low-fat cheese stick.
Instead of going for sweets like candy or cookies, try: a piece of fruit or small fruit salad, a low-fat yogurt, apple with peanut butter or 1/4 cup of dried fruit.

, Making better food choices is just one part of your diet. Also pay attention to the types of drinks you're consuming throughout the day.


Some beverages are just as processed and unhealthy as junk foods. Avoid items like: sodas, sugary coffee drinks, fruit juices, energy drinks, sports drinks or alcohol.
Instead of these types of drinks, go for eight to 13 glass of beverages that are sugar-free and caffeine free. Plus, these are the most hydrating.Besides water, you can try flavored water, flavored sparkling water, decaf coffee and decaf tea. Any combination of these will hydrate you without any additives or extra calories.

Purchase organic foods.,
Buy locally.,
Make your own meals.,
Consider starting your own organic garden.,
Look for environmentally friendly cleaning products.,
Choose hygiene and beauty products wisely.,
Purchase used clothing.,
Drive a fuel-efficient car.,
Look for alternative methods of transportation.,
Take public transportation.",How to Live an Organic Lifestyle," Eating organic foods is good for the environment, but it also improves your health. Eating foods that are not organic means that you are ingesting lots of different chemicals, which can build up in your body.Not only that, but organic foods are usually more nutritious and taste better.


Look for eggs that are, at a minimum, certified organic. This means that the birds were not fed any type of hormones or antibiotics. However, if you are also concerned for the welfare of the animals, look for eggs that are “certified humane raised and handled” or at least “free range.” This means that the birds are not kept in tiny cages their whole lives, and are given at least some opportunity to go outside and live like normal chickens.Choose meats and dairy products that are certified organic. This means that the animals are not given any synthetic hormones or antibiotics meant to speed their trip to the slaughterhouse and keep them from getting sick in their inhumane living conditions. These chemicals are often able to survive the cooking process and end up in your body.;
, Depending on where you live, this may limit some of the fruits and vegetables you have access to, but buying locally supports your local economy and it also reduces green house gasses by eliminating the need to transport your food from far away countries.The best way to find local products is to visit your local farmer’s market. If you don’t have a farmer’s market in your area, look for small organic shops around where you live as these usually source local products.
Another option, that is becoming more popular, are fruit and vegetable boxes delivered to your door. These boxes are available in many areas and contain fresh fruits and vegetables, usually from local farmers. A great thing about this is that it will encourage you to try out fruits and vegetables you maybe wouldn’t have otherwise tried.
Be aware though, that just because you bought something at a farmer’s market or because it came out of a veggie box doesn’t mean it is organic. Before purchasing anything ask the person you are buying something from where it came from and what products were used to grow it. Organic food should be grown without the use of fertilizers or pesticides.
When it comes to meat and eggs, you can look for small farms in your area, some of which may be able to sell you fresh meat and eggs directly from the farm. Make sure to ask them about how the animals are raised and whether they are fed any antibiotics or hormones.

, While more and more organic restaurants are popping up, you can never be sure where the ingredients on your plate have come from unless you have purchased and prepared them yourself. If you really want to live a completely organic lifestyle, avoid eating out as much as possible.That’s not to say you can never ever eat out again as long as you live. You can, but try to limit this to special occasions. When you do eat out, try to choose places that promote the use of organic ingredients. Research the restaurant before you go there to make sure they actually practice what they preach.

, One way to reduce the amount of waste you produce (e.g. through plastic bags and other packaging that your organic groceries may come in) is by growing some of your own vegetables. Starting up an organic garden will save you money because you will only have to purchase the basic supplies to start a garden (mainly seeds) and it will give you many great fruits and vegetables that will keep you healthy.Gardening is also a great hobby. Many people find it very relaxing and rewarding.
A 4x4 foot bed will be able to grow all the vegetables that one person can eat, and even small window boxes can grow a few herbs or vegetables to supplement your meals.

, Unfortunately, there is nothing specific that makes a cleaning product “organic”, and the more natural products will often be more expensive than the more traditional cleaning products. However, if you want to choose safer cleaning products look for products that don’t include phosphates and phthalates.Be wary of green-washing. Green-washing refers to marketing campaigns that attempt to convince consumers that their products are environmentally friendly, natural, or green. In many cases, this is not really the truth. Many “green” cleaners include palm oil. Palm oil has a huge and very negative impact on the environment as palm oil plantations take over habitats and displace wild animals. Check for palm oil in the list of ingredients.You can also stick to natural cleaning and disinfectant products. For example, baking soda, lemon juice, salt, and white vinegar can all be used to clean many parts of your home just as effectively and much more safely than some of the better known products., In the cosmetics industry, the terms “organic” and “natural” are not regulated the way they are in the food industry.Thus, at present, there isn’t really a good way to know whether or not the products you are using are organic. However, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) offers a website which allows you to read about the safety and environmental impact of products you are using for a small fee.


However, you can also look for products that are made up of mostly natural ingredients. For example, soaps that are made up of pure essential oils or other natural oils such as jojoba, olive or coconut oil.

, Many thrift stores sell clothing that has barely been worn, and you can find great deals there too. Wearing second-hand clothing is a great way to reduce your impact on the environment.



Shopping at thrift stores can be a different experience than shopping at a big name store. Know what you’re looking for when you go, and be prepared for a different experience.
If you can’t stomach the idea of wearing used clothing, at least try to look for brands that use organic materials. As people become more aware of the environmental costs of our lifestyles, more and more organic clothing stores are popping up. If you can’t find any in your city, try searching online.

, You don’t necessarily have to own a hybrid, but do consider switching to a car with better gas mileage. Even if you get excellent gas mileage, try to avoid unnecessary trips. Combine your errands so that you travel as little as possible in your car.


If you don’t need to drive very often consider selling your car and signing up for a car sharing program. These programs allow you to use a car in the area whenever you need for a small fee. If you only need to drive once or twice a month this will save you tons on car maintenance fees and insurance, and will also save you the hassle of trying to find somewhere to park your own car.

, Is the place you want to go within walking distance or can you ride a bike there? While driving remains the most popular way to get around in countries such as the US, walking or riding your bike offers a great way to get outside and get some fresh air while also accomplishing other things, such as food shopping.


Your own two feet offer the most organic way to get around. Walking doesn’t require any special equipment and it helps you stay healthy.

, Although the US is far behind many other countries when it comes to public transport, some cities are trying to improve options for taking public transportation. Look into what your city offers. For places you go often, see if there is a bus route that you can use instead of driving.


In a place such as the US, where public transportation is, in most places, not the norm don’t be afraid to go against the grain. People may find it funny that you take the bus to the grocery store when everyone else drives, but hopefully you can inspire others to try out the public transport in your city by setting an example.

Follow the guidelines of the food pyramid.,
Consume smaller quantities of food toward the top of the food pyramid.,
Consume ""super foods"" that deliver exceptional nutritional benefits.,
Pay attention to portion size.",How to Keep Your Body Fit With Food1," The U.S. government and other public health agencies have developed a variety of food ""pyramids"" and ""plates"" over the past several decades. These tools are graphical representations of the various food groups you should eat — and how much of each group you should consume. Public health research institutes such as the Harvard School of Public Health have developed exceptionally helpful ""pyramid"" tools for evaluating your diet. The quantity of foods you eat from each category in the healthy ""base"" of the pyramid will vary upon your size, exercise level, and dietary preferences, but a majority of your caloric intake should come from these categories:


Carbohydrates in the form of whole grains such as oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and brown rice.
Healthy fats and oils. Healthy choices include unsaturated fats such as olive and vegetable oils; nuts, seeds, and avocados; and fatty fish such as salmon. Studies show Americans generally get 1/3 or more of their daily categories from fats, and this can be an acceptable practice — if you are consuming healthy varieties. Note that fats and oils are calorie-rich, so small quantities add up quickly. Read labels carefully.
Vegetables and fruits. Aim to fill half your plate with these foods at each meal.
Nuts, beans, seeds, and/or tofu. If you are a vegetarian, these foods are especially important sources of dietary protein.
Fish, poultry, and eggs. If you consume animal products, you may choose to consume more of these foods and fewer nuts, beans, seeds or tofu products.;
, The nutrients found in dairy, especially, are important, but on the whole you'll want to eat top-of-the-pyramid foods sparingly. Follow these guidelines:


One to two servings of dairy products per day, or vitamin D and calcium supplements if you dislike (or are allergic to) dairy foods.
Infrequent consumption of red meat, processed meat, and butter. Eat red meat no more than two times per week, and minimize processed meat and butter in your diet.
Minimal consumption of refined grains such as white rice, white bread, sugary or refined foods, and salt., If your aim is fitness as well as general good health, consider eating foods that deliver extra energy, antioxidants, calcium, or heart-healthy fats and proteins.


Dried fruits, sweet potatoes, and bananas deliver complex carbohydrates that will help you efficiently store and use energy. Each of these foods contains valuable potassium in addition to a host of other nutrients.
Broccoli and other green vegetables, tomatoes, blueberries, and cocoa all contain antioxidants that remove cell-damaging free radicals from your blood.
Milk and green vegetables provide calcium to ensure healthy bones. Warm milk consumed near bedtime has the added benefit of boosting the serotonin and melatonin that help you sleep.
Salmon and nuts deliver healthy fats and proteins. Consider adding Brazil nuts in particular to your diet, as they contain high levels of selenium, a mineral that helps bolster your immune system., Read food packaging carefully to determine portion size and the number of servings in a given package. Split value packs into portion-sized containers, and consider sharing large restaurant meals.Learn how to identify proper portions using hand-size references; guidelines are readily available online. One serving of carrots, for example, is equivalent to one cup, or approximately the size of an adult fist; a serving of dry cereal is also one cup, or one adult fist, in size."

Keep a food diary.,
Assess your level of physical activity.,
Determine your daily calorie needs.,
Adjust your caloric intake as needed.,
Calculate your body mass index (BMI).,
Measure your waist circumference.",How to Maintain a Healthy Weight1," Keeping a food diary can give you a better understanding of the number of calories you're consuming each day. Estimate your portions so you can use nutritional information to determine how many calories are included in each of your meals.Keep your food diary for at least a week so you can get a daily average.
Take note of days that seem out of the ordinary and try to figure out why you were consuming so much more (or so much less) on that day than on others. This can help you identify triggers that cause you to overeat.;
, As with your food, it might also be helpful to keep a physical activity diary for a period of at least one week. This can help you determine your average level of physical activity during the day.Be sure to include daily activities as well as dedicated exercise times. For example, if you routinely walk up three flights of stairs to get to your office each morning, this should be included as physical activity. Cleaning the house or walking the dog also are daily physical activities.
You also need to calculate the period of time when you are not active. For example, if you spend four hours a day sitting at your desk at work, this should be included in your physical activity diary.

, Your daily calorie needs depend on your age, sex, and physical activity level. Use your physical activity diary to determine which general category you fall into: sedentary, moderately active, or active.Look for tables or calculators online that will enable you to estimate your daily calorie needs. For example, you can find a table in the dietary guidelines established by the U.S. government, available at https://health.gov/.
Finding a general category will not give you an exact number of calories you must consume each day to maintain a healthy weight, but it will give you a good estimate.
If you find that you are gaining weight despite using this estimate, you can adjust downward by 200 calories until you find the right balance.

, While your goal may be to maintain a healthy weight, your weight may fluctuate between 5 and 10 pounds regularly for a number of different reasons that are unrelated to your eating or physical activity level, such as hormones or stress.The key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding the right balance between the calories you're consuming and the calories your body is burning for fuel. You may not be able to maintain your weight simply by consuming the same amount of calories all the time.
Revisit your calorie calculations once a month or so and make adjustments as necessary. If you find you're gaining or losing weight, you may want to keep a food and physical activity diary for a week. Compare the week's entries to previous weeks you've done and see if you can identify the differences that are causing weight gain or loss.

, Your BMI looks at your percentage of body fat rather than simply your weight, which makes it a better way to gauge whether your weight is in a healthy range for you. If your BMI is too high or too low, you should focus on eating and exercising to gain or lose weight, not to maintain your current weight.The easiest way to calculate your BMI is by using an online chart.Make sure you have accurate height and weight measurements before you begin.

, Even if your BMI is in a relatively healthy range, your waist circumference may be too large. Carrying excess abdominal fat puts you at risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure.If your waist circumference is too high, you should diet and exercise to lose more weight around your midsection.


Wrap a tape measure around your waist, just above your hips, while standing. The tape measure should be tight, but not squeezing or pressing into your skin. Make sure it's straight and horizontal around your waist.
Take a deep breath in, then exhale and place your finger on the larger number where the end of the tape reaches. This is your waist circumference. You are at risk for developing obesity-related health conditions if you are a man and your waist circumference is larger than 40 inches (about 101 cm), or if you are a non-pregnant woman and your waist circumference is larger than 35 inches (about 89 cm).

Understand the benefits of a diet high in dietary fiber.,
Choose high fiber foods.,
Proceed gradually when converting to a high-fiber diet.",How to Keep Your Body Fit With Food2," Foods rich in dietary fiber help you control your hunger and lose weight in a number of ways.


High fiber foods have a higher ""chew factor."" Put simply, they take longer to eat, increasing your sense of satisfaction.
Foods that are high in fiber take longer to exit your digestive tract. This means you feel fuller longer.
Foods containing soluble fiber such as oatmeal and beans help to stabilize your blood sugar over the course of the day. This means you don't feel as hungry.
Fiber also helps to lower cholesterol in some individuals and bulk stool for better digestive health.

, Dietary fiber is found in a wide variety of foods, so adding this important element to your diet may be easier than you imagine. Try high-fiber cereals, beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds, and fruits., While your body functions best on a high fiber diet, if you haven't previously been eating much fiber it will need time to adjust. Start by introducing one high fiber element and then continue to improve your diet incrementally. You may replace your low-in-fiber corn flakes with a raisin bran cereal, for example, and then wait a few days before introducing salad with your lunch."
"
Prioritize whole foods.,
Consider starting a garden.,
Cook from scratch.",How to Keep Your Body Fit With Food3," Choosing unprocessed foods allows you to control your diet by eliminating ""hidden"" ingredients and excess salt.It's possible that weight gain may be coming not from the quantity of food you are eating, but the amount of sugar, salt, and other ingredients that are added to your meal. Whole foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fish also tend to reside near the healthy ""base"" of the food pyramid.

, Studies indicate that children who participate in school-based gardening programs are twice as likely to try new foods as those who did not participate in these programs.Nurturing your own vegetables from seeds or seedlings will inspire you toward healthy eating. Growing your own vegetables also saves money, allowing you to keep your body fit without breaking your budget.

, Much like consuming whole foods, cooking from scratch improves your control over your diet. Not only are you likely to save money by preparing your own meals, but you can eliminate additives, extra sugar and salt, and other processed ingredients.


Develop your cooking skills gradually. You may become overwhelmed if you try to take on too much, too quickly. Start with easy recipes to increase your confidence. Give yourself permission to learn over time and you'll find cooking is more likely to become an enduring habit.

Prepare for a workout by eating a low-glycemic meal.,
Eat foods that boost your energy and endurance.,
Replenish your energy after a long workout.,
Consume protein after exercising to help your muscles recover and grow.,
Remember that consuming ""fitness"" foods is no substitute for physical exercise.",How to Keep Your Body Fit With Food4," Low-glycemic foods are composed of ""slow release"" carbohydrates such as oatmeal, bran cereal, or whole-wheat toast. Consume your low-glycemic meal three hours before working out. Studies show that doing so will enable you to burn additional fat during exercise.


Proper hydration before a workout is also important. Plan to drink two to three cups of water, two to three hours before you exercise.

, You may be familiar with various carbohydrate blends of glucose and fructose (sports drinks, gels, etc.) that are commonly used during long workouts. You might, however, want to consider a natural option that combines glucose and fructose with additional vitamins and antioxidants: honey! The darker the honey, the more antioxidants it contains.Continue to hydrate during your workout. Drink 3/4 to 1 1/2 cups of water every 15 – 20 minutes, and consider an electrolyte drink if you have been exercising longer than 60 minutes., This is your big opportunity to combine a treat with food that will keep your body fit: chocolate milk is an excellent post-workout recovery drink. The carbohydrates it contains will help replenish your energy stores. Try a banana with peanut butter if you aren't fond of milk.


Drink tart cherry juice after exercise to help ease muscle inflammation. Avoid drinking juice before or during exercise, however, as it can cause stomach cramps., Good sources of protein include fish, poultry, meat, nuts, beans, seeds, lentils, soy, and milk products. Note that while advertisements for protein supplements often advertise that they provide amino acids the body cannot make, you can obtain the same important nutrients by consuming a variety of protein-rich foods., One prominent study suggests that ""fitness branding"" encourages consumers to eat more of a given food and exercise less. This can undermine your efforts to keep your body fit. That ""fitness"" bar has just as many calories as any other food of its size and nutritional content!Read labels carefully. Energy bars and other ""fitness"" products often contain significant amounts of added sugar and are usually heavily processed and filled with artificial ingredients. If you do opt to purchase an energy bar, look for bars with about 5 grams (0.2 oz) of protein, some carbohydrates and very little fat.
Pay attention to the caloric content of your sports drinks. If you're exercising to lose weight, opt for water or ""light"" versions."

Eat breakfast every day.,
Include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet.,
Choose lean meats and protein sources.,
Limit your intake of sugar.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Maintain consistent eating patterns.,
Control your portions.",How to Maintain a Healthy Weight2," Starting your day with a healthy breakfast is the best way to jumpstart your metabolism and give you the energy to focus and perform throughout your day. A healthy breakfast includes sources of vitamins and protein as well as healthy fiber.For example, you might have whole-grain toast topped with a poached egg and a tomato. If you don't have time to prepare breakfast in the morning, you might go with a fruit smoothie that includes a protein boost.
You also might consider batching breakfasts such as make-ahead breakfast wraps or fruit salad and putting it in the freezer if your time is limited in the morning. Then all you have to do is heat each portion up for a few seconds in the microwave and you're ready to go.

, Fruits and vegetables are relatively low-fat food options that are packed with the vitamins and nutrients your body needs. You should aim to have at least two servings of fruit and five servings of vegetables each day., Poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and eggs are lean sources of protein that will give your body the fuel it needs to build strong muscles. The meat you eat should be broiled or grilled rather than fried., Consumption of sugars and saturated fats can cause you to gain weight, even if the rest of your diet is relatively healthy. Be careful about added sugar in packaged foods, especially frozen dinners and pasta meals that you wouldn't consider sweet.Natural sugar in fruit is better for you than refined sugar added to other foods. Try having a medium-sized apple or a cup of grapes as a snack instead of cookies or cakes.

, The amount of water you need to stay adequately hydrated depends on your size and how physically active you are. Generally speaking, however, you should be drinking at least eight or nine glasses of water a day.To determine how much water you lose through sweat when exercising, weigh yourself before and after your exercise session. For each pound of weight lost, you need to drink a pint of water.
Keep in mind that if you feel thirsty, that means you're already dehydrated. Drink water constantly, not just when you're thirsty.

, To maintain a healthy weight, it's best to establish a regular pattern of eating at the same times every day. Eating smaller meals every two or three hours may be better than eating three larger meals., Managing portion sizes is important if you want to maintain a healthy weight. This can be especially difficult when eating out, because restaurants typically serve larger portions of food than one person needs.You can control your portions while eating out by splitting a meal with a friend or ordering from the kid's menu. You also can ask the server for a to-go box and split your meal in half as soon as it comes to the table.
When eating snacks, choose single-portion containers or take only a single portion out of a larger bag rather than eating directly from the bag.
Use government health websites such as https://www.choosemyplate.gov/, provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to better understand what healthy portion sizes are for various types of food.

Make exercise a social activity.",How to Maintain a Healthy Weight3," Ideally, you want to engage in moderate-intensity exercise 30 to 60 minutes a day at least four days a week. You don't have to do this exercise all at once, but you should be consistent and exercise at the same time every day.If you don't have an hour that you can carve out of your day for exercise on a regular basis, try splitting the time into three 20-minute intervals. For example, you might take a brisk walk in the morning, at mid-day, and then in the evening.

, Getting down to your goal weight isn't enough if your muscles remain weak and easily fatigued. Even doing basic bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups and crunches, can help build muscle strength.There are plenty of strength training videos you can find online for free and follow at home. However, if you're new to strength training, you may want to work with a professional trainer first to make sure you're getting your form right.

, Exercising regularly is not just about dedicated fitness work at a gym. Many daily physical activities including gardening, cleaning around the house, walking the dog, and other daily chores can also be done at moderate intensity to keep your body active.For example, you might walk up and down the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or park far away from your destination so you have a further distance to walk.

, If you have trouble staying motivated to exercise on a regular basis, going for a walk or jog with a friend can help you stay on track. You also might consider joining a gym or fitness club, or taking a new class to learn a new physical activity."

Include naturally high sodium foods.,
Add salt to your foods and cooking.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.,
Restrict your water intake.,
Drink sports drinks.,
Drink oral rehydrating solutions (ORS) to boost sodium in case of excessive fluid loss.",How to Keep Sodium Levels Up1," Some foods naturally contain more sodium than others. Including more of these foods can help maintain a higher sodium balance.


Try include one or more servings of these high sodium foods daily: fish and shellfish, swiss chard and spinach, artichokes, seaweed, red meat, and eggs.Also include foods that are high in salt and have other benefits. For example fermented foods like sauerkraut or kimchi have higher sodium contents but also have been shown to be beneficial for digestion.Do not consume a lot of highly refined or high processed foods. Even though these are typically higher in sodium, they also come with a cost of being higher in sugar, fat and calories.You want to manage sodium levels in the healthiest way possible.;
, Another easy way to get in extra sodium to your diet is by using more salt on your meals and while you cook.


One teaspoon of salt contains about 2300-2500 mg of sodium.Sprinkle your meals with a little salt and use it while you're cooking.
When using prepared sauces, marinades or canned foods, do not choose low-sodium items. Also try using products that contain higher salt contents. For example: use salted butter instead of unsalted butter.

, These categories of fluids may worsen low sodium levels. Both can cause electrolyte imbalances and also act as a mild diuretic.Caffeinated drinks to avoid include: coffee, tea and energy drinks. Be sure to look for bottled juices or sports drinks that promise an ""increase in energy"" as they might also contain caffeine.
Although it's appropriate to consume alcohol occasionally, it should be completely avoided if you are suffering from low sodium levels and are having difficulty managing them.

, Cutting back on the amount of water and other clear fluids you consume can help manage sodium levels. Too much water can dilute the sodium levels in your blood and make them more difficult to manage.Although water is crucial to your health, you shouldn't over consume it. In general your thirst should guide you to what is an appropriate amount of fluid. If you're not thirsty, you're most likely consuming an adequate amount of fluid.Also take note of your urine color. If your urine is pale yellow and you're using the bathroom between 4-6 times daily, you're most likely consuming adequate fluids daily.Reducing your water intake will help your body naturally raise its ratio of sodium to water. This may be easier and more effective than sodium replacement.

, These drinks contain electrolytes and will provide the necessary amount of minerals, including sodium.Even the low calorie or diet sports drinks contain extra sodium and other helpful electrolytes.
Sports drinks are also a great way to replenish temporarily reduced sodium levels after vigorous exercise.

, Oral rehydrating solutions are especially helpful in cases of diarrhea, vomiting, and excessive sweating.


Commercially-available ORS can be bought over the counter. They are usually meant to be diluted with 1 L of water and consumed in one sitting.
ORS can also be made at home using 6 level teaspoons of sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of salt, diluted in 1 US-quart (950 ml) of water.You can mix this solution with powdered flavorings to help make the solution more palatable.
Coconut water is also a good ORS substitute as it contains natural electrolytes to help manage fluid balance.

Talk to your physician.,
Take anti-nausea medication.,
Take anti-diarrheals.",How to Keep Sodium Levels Up2," If you're dealing with low sodium levels or are having difficulty managing them with lifestyle and dietary changes, it's important to speak with your doctor. They will be able to tell you how to appropriately and safely manage your condition.


Your doctor may prescribe different medications to help manage your low sodium levels. Always follow these directions prior to making any dietary or other lifestyle changes.
Ask your physician if there are changes you can make at home to help support a normal sodium level.

, If your low sodium level is due to vomiting, you may want to consider trying an over-the-counter anti-nausea medicine. Taking anti-nausea medicine to may help make sure that you stop the excessive loss of fluid due to vomiting.


When you vomit, you expel most of the contents of your stomach, including water, sodium and other electrolytes.If you are vomiting excessively, such as during a stomach flu or other bacterial illness, you may lose so much water and sodium that your sodium levels drop dangerously low.
In addition to anti-nausea medications, you may also want to consider natural ways to manage nausea and vomiting. Ginger tea, ginger soda and more small frequent meals can help reduce nausea and vomiting.Always talk to your doctor prior to taking any over-the-counter medications.

, Another common cause of low sodium levels is diarrhea. Taking an over-the-counter medication to help lessen or stop diarrhea can help you manage low sodium levels.Diarrhea causes your body to flush out a large amount of fluids. It doesn’t have the time to absorb the needed minerals, including sodium.Take anti-diarrheal medications to stop diarrhea and allow your body time to reestablish your sodium levels.
In addition to medication, there are some natural ways to manage diarrhea. Try including bland, non-fibrous foods like bananas, white rice and toast. Also avoid high fibrous foods and dairy as these can make diarrhea worse.Consult with your personal physician prior to taking any over the counter medications.

, These come from nuts, seeds, legumes (e.g., peanuts and soybeans), and fish, which provides a special kind of polyunsaturated fat called omega-3 fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fats provide essential fatty acids but are less healthful than monounsaturated fats due to their multiple double bonds.

,, Reduce meat consumption. Meat is high in calories, lacks antioxidants and fiber, and contains saturated fat, animal protein, and cholesterol. Base meals around lean chicken and fish or use meat substitutes, made with soy or vegetable proteins. Include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables with meals, which are low in calories (due to their water and fiber content) and abundant in antioxidants. Numerous studies show that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with lower body weight. For one hundred calories, you could eat an entire pound of vegetables. An entire cup of whole or sliced strawberries has only about fifty calories., Refining grains removes the antioxidants and fiber, which may help you to feel fuller. These include brown rice, barley, millet, and buckwheat. Check labels on breads and pastas. Some foods made with whole grains contain some refined grains as well. Try to select foods that are 100% whole grain.

,


Drink 100% fruit and vegetable juice. One 8-ounce cup of 100% fruit or vegetable juice contributes two servings of fruits or vegetables. Drinking 100% juice will help to avoid added sugars, which contribute calories with no antioxidants. You may have seen bottles of fruit juice or V8 beverages touting ""40% less sugar"" or ""50% less sugar"" or even greater sugar reduction. You may be tempted to try these beverages as part of your weight-loss plan, but it is not possible to remove natural fruit and vegetable sugars. See one complex approach being tested out by Chinese researchers. They are using cultures (like those in yogurt) to break down some of the sugars in juice, but they are not magically pulling the sugar out of the solution. If a company in America ever finds a way to do that, it will proudly put ""100% juice"" on the front of the label.
Beware of all fruit or vegetable juices that say ""reduced sugar"" or ""less sugar."" These either 1) contain added sugars, which have been reduced in this version of the product or 2) have been watered down to reduce the amount of sugar. However, you should choose juices that say ""no sugar added""; these are 100% juice with only natural sugars. One example of the ""low sugar,"" watered-down juices is Mott's for Tots. Mott's refers to it on its website as ""prediluted"" juices (such as apple) with ""purified water.""Mott's Vice President of Marketing said, ""oms will appreciate the time saved mixing juice and water. With Mott's for Tots, we've added natural flavors to give kids the taste they love, and a boost of Vitamin C, an important nutrient for growing kids.""Too often it is forgotten that it is the antioxidants in juices that are the real contribution, not the vitamin C.
Find the Nutrition Facts for any of these ""low sugar"" fruit juices, and above you will find the percentage of juice. Check any of these products, and you will see that these are watered down juices...sold at full price...to consumers acting in good faith to improve their health. There is no need to worry about natural sugars; these do not raise blood sugar levels any more quickly than other kinds of carbohydrates, including complex carbohydrates.
If you want fewer calories, choose the types of juices that naturally contain less sugar. A cup of strawberry juice contains just 71 Calories.A cup of watermelon juice has just 76 Calories.You can also increase the volume of food that you eat in a day by eating whole fruit (which also provides fiber, usually missing from juice). Vegetable juice provides a great deal of nutrition for very few calories. Many vegetable juices (including V8) have only about fifty calories per cup, fewer calories than skimmed milk (about eighty or ninety calories). Beware of V-Lite, a recently introduced ""version"" of V8 vegetable juice, which is 60% vegetable juice.,


Soymilk and soy yogurt are rich in legume antioxidants.
Almond milk is touted as being high in antioxidants, but few almonds are used to make it. For example, a serving of almonds (22 whole kernels) contains 20% DV of magnesium and 37% DV of manganese; a cup of almond milk contains only 4% DV of magnesium and 6% DV of manganese. A serving of almonds provides six grams of protein; a cup of almond milk provides only one gram.Almond milk contains seven grams of sugar, contributing about half of its calories.You can make a smoothie with fresh fruit, yogurt, and ice. It combines the goodness of fruit with the goodness of dairy, which includes a source of calcium. You can easily prepare a beautiful strawberry smoothie for just ninety calories.
Some water beverages (e.g., ""acai-blueberry-pomegranate"" and ""sync"" brands of Vitamin Water) contain extracted antioxidants and are available in very-low-calorie or zero-calorie versions (e.g., 10-calorie Vitamin Waters).
Drink tea or coffee, which are very rich sources of antioxidants and contain almost no calories naturally.

, They contain higher levels of antioxidants. These include dark green vegetables, blueberries, blackberries, purple grapes and cranberries., It is creamy white in color and can be bought from a farm. It is rich in antioxidants and adds flavor. You can also use fruit juice in tea in place of sugar for additional nutrients and antioxidants.

Eat high-quality lean protein.,
Incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Add more spices to your diet.,
Increase your selenium intake.,
Up your intake of alpha-lipoic acid.,
Choose a multivitamin that includes glutathione-supporting vitamins and minerals.,
Consider supplementing with Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).,
Exercise more.",How to Increase Glutathione Naturally1," Since your body makes its own glutathione, you can aid its production by eating foods that will help your body make more of it. Glutathione is composed of three amino acids — cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. These amino acids are present in high quality lean protein sources, so eating high quality lean protein will help your body to make more glutathione.Make sure that your diet includes high-quality lean protein sources such as lean poultry; whey protein; soy protein; antibiotic and hormone-free dairy products; and yogurt. Aim for two to three servings per day.;
, Many fruits and vegetables provide glutathione. To get the most glutathione from this food group, eat fresh fruits and vegetables, not overcooked or processed ones. Overcooking and processing will decrease the level of glutathione in these foods.The fruits and vegetables that contain the most glutathione per serving include: asparagus, potatoes, peppers, carrots, onion, broccoli, avocados, squash, spinach, garlic, tomatoes, grapefruit, apples, oranges, peaches, bananas and melon. Also, bok choy, watercress, mustard, horseradish, turnips, rutabagas, kohlrabi, okra and ripe seeds of green beans contain precursors of glutathione.Cyanohydroxybutene, a chemical found in broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and cabbage, and chlorophyll in parsley are thought to contribute to raising Glutathione levels.
Beets have been shown to have a positive effect on the activity of GSH enzymes as well., Some spices — like turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, and cardamom — have compounds that can assist in restoring healthy levels of GSH and boost the activity of GSH enzymes.Curries often feature cumin, turmeric, and cardamom. Try a curry recipe to incorporate more of these spices into your diet.
Cinnamon is easy to incorporate into your diet. Sprinkle a little on your morning coffee or on a bowl of ice cream.

, Selenium elevates the levels of glutathione peroxidase — the cysteine molecule appearing in the process of digestion of plants grown in selenium-rich soil contributes to GSH production.In other words, it is necessary to form glutathione-containing enzymes.


Foods rich in selenium include sunflower seeds cereals, oats, Brazil nuts, walnuts, legumes, tuna, beef, poultry, cheese, eggs, turkey, chicken breast and brown rice.
You can also take a selenium supplement. The recommended daily intake (RDI) for adults is 55 mcg.

, Alpha-lipoic acid, or ALA, promotes glutathione synthesis in the body, thereby increasing glutathione levels.It is a natural antioxidant with free radical scavenging abilities and has the ability to regenerate oxidized antioxidants like Vitamin C and E and helps to make them more potent.


Foods rich in alpha-lipoic acid include: spinach, tomatoes, peas, Brussels sprouts, rice bran and mayonnaise. Many of these foods are naturally high in glutathione, too.
You can also supplement your diet with 100 – 200 mg of ALA daily, but check with your doctor first to determine if this supplement is right for you.

, It is not always possible to get everything that you need from diet alone, so taking a daily multivitamin is a good idea. Read the label on your multi-vitamin to make sure that it includes the following vitamins and minerals. Some of these vitamins and minerals are difficult to get in sufficient quantities from food, but they are required for many biochemical reactions.Vitamin C
Vitamin E
Vitamins B6
Vitamin B12
Folate
Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)
Selenium
Magnesium
Zinc
Vanadium

, MSM provides a source of sulfur, which is necessary for the synthesis of glutathione. If you think that your diet is lacking sulfur, ask your doctor about including an MSM supplement. The common dosage is 500 mg of MSM three times a day.Do not take MSM if you are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), unless you are advised to do so by your physician.

, Exercise is a great way to increase your metabolism and stimulate your body to produce more glutathione to fight external toxins. Begin your training program with light aerobic exercises such as walking, then move to jogging, bicycling, and swimming.


All forms of moderate exercise have been shown to increase blood levels of glutathione. This includes aerobic exercise training, circuit weight training, and combined training aerobics and circuit weight training.You can also start with ten or fifteen minutes of activity and work up to 30 or 40 minutes per session. Try to exercise at least four times per week for best results."

Understand how glutathione levels decrease.,
Learn about the makeup of glutathione.,
Recognize the importance of glutathione.,
Know when glutathione therapy is used.",How to Increase Glutathione Naturally2," Glutathione is considered one of the most important antioxidants in the body. It has been shown to help protect against cancer, aging, heart problems, and brain diseases. Your body produces this powerful natural antioxidant, but several environmental factors can have a negative effect on its levels:Pollution or toxins in the air
Drugs
Bacterial or viral infections
Radiation
Aging

, This antioxidant is built up from several components known as amino acids, namely cysteine, glycine, and glutamine. Amino acids contain sulfur group (SH) in their structure that acts like a sponge to adhere to any toxin on its surface, such as heavy metals, mercury or free radicals that can cause direct damage to different cells in our body.


When these toxins or harmful substances increase in our body, they accumulate in higher levels and can inhibit the release of glutathione. That is the point when we need help to get glutathione in our diet, or to stimulate its natural release again.

, Glutathione is a strong antioxidant that helps us get rid of the toxins and free radicals in our body. It works by adhering to toxins on the surface of the glutathione itself, and then expelling them from our body through stool or bile secretions.Glutathione deficiency can lead to some serious conditions such as cardiac diseases, infections, arthritis, and liver and kidney disorders.
Glutathione boosts and supports the immune system while fighting diseases and infections. It increases cytokine production (part of the immune system), and promotes the killing power of cytotoxic cells. It also maintains other antioxidants such as Vitamins C and E in their active forms.
Glutathione has a major role in maintaining our physical activity and mental health, preventing some critical mental disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Glutathione is very critical to our skin cells health too, preventing aging and maintaining normal cell functions.

, There are some oral, inhalant, and injection glutathione supplements available, but these are most often used as therapy for serious diseases. Doctors use glutathione to treat health conditions including:Anemia
Parkinson’s disease
Atherosclerosis
Diabetes Mellitus
Cancer
AIDS

Ask your doctor about St. John’s wort.",How to Increase Serotonin Naturally1," Eating a healthy diet is important. However, over-restricting your calorie consumption can cause your body to produce less serotonin.Talk with your doctor or a nutritionist about what level of calorie consumption is healthy for your body and fitness goals.;
, The amino acid tryptophan is part of serotonin production. When combined with vitamin B6, tryptophan can pass through the blood brain barrier and convert into serotonin.Some research has linked tryptophan depletion with lower brain serotonin levels.Low tryptophan levels are also associated with increased anxiety.This doesn’t mean that you can replace your antidepressant with a handful of cashews, but research suggests that supplementing your tryptophan levels, such as by eating tryptophan-rich foods, may help you naturally boost your serotonin levels.The average adult should aim to consume 3.5-6mg of L-tryptophan per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. However, your needs may vary, so it’s best to consult with a doctor or nutritionist to find out your specific needs.Milk products are high in L-tryptophan.In addition, many milk products are fortified with vitamin D, which helps promote serotonin production.Foods with high percentages of tryptophan per 100g of food include soybeans (1.6%), cashews (1.6%), oats (1.4%), cow’s milk (1.4%), and chicken breast (1.3%)., Some research using lab rats shows that L-lysine binds to serotonin receptors, inhibiting serotonin “reuptake” (i.e., how your brain reabsorbs serotonin). Inhibiting serotonin reuptake helps keep more serotonin available in your body.Foods that are high in protein are often high in lysine. However, too much protein may interfere with tryptophan in the bloodstream, an important precursor to serotonin.
Lysine-rich foods include meat, cheese, fish, nuts, eggs, soybeans, spirulina, and fenugreek. Beans and other legumes also contain lysine., Some research suggests that caffeine may interfere with serotonin uptake.However, other research suggests that caffeine may actually benefit the activity of some antidepressants, such as duloxetine and bupropion.It may also promote feelings of alertness and energy when consumed in lower doses.If you do consume caffeine, keep your intake at a low to moderate level (200-450mg per day). For example, a cup of regular coffee usually contains about 100mg of caffeine per cup, while most colas contain about 45mg per 12-ounce can.Caffeine is also in some medications, such as migraine headache pain relievers, so watch all your caffeine sources.

, Carbohydrates help increase serotonin levels.When you eat a meal high in carbohydrates, your body secretes the hormone insulin. Insulin lowers the levels of most amino acids in your bloodstream, but it doesn’t affect the levels of tryptophan, which is necessary for serotonin production. More tryptophan is thus able to enter your brain, where it can be converted into serotonin. Because of your individual metabolism and the protein content of complex carbs, the serotonin production prompted by carbohydrate intake varies.Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, barley, and sweet potatoes, may help increase serotonin levels. However, these complex carbs contain more protein. High-protein meals increase the levels of competing amino acids in your bloodstream, meaning that less tryptophan makes it to your brain.Meals high in sucrose (sugar), which have a high glycemic index, stimulate more serotonin precursors than meals high in starch, although both sucrose and starch carbohydrates increase serotonin production., Vitamin B6, sometimes called pyridoxine, is a crucial part of how tryptophan is converted to serotonin.Vitamin B6 also has many other health benefits, such as fighting heart disease. Experts recommend that you get between 1.3-1.7mg of B6 per day.Avoid extremely high doses of vitamin B6 (greater than 100mg daily). This could lead to nerve damage.Good dietary sources of B6 include beans, whole grains, nuts, poultry, fish, bananas, dark leafy greens, avocados, papayas, oranges, and cantaloupe.Bananas naturally contain serotonin. However, this serotonin cannot pass the blood brain barrier, so it will not increase brain serotonin levels.Because they contain vitamin B6 and many other nutrients, they’re still a wise choice for a balanced diet.

, Some research suggests a link between omega-3 fatty acids and serotonin function. People with low serotonin levels also often have low levels of DHA, an essential building block for brain function.Omega-3 fatty acids can help replenish DHA levels.Seafood is one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Cold-water fish such as halibut, mackerel, salmon, trout, and tuna are very high in omega-3s.Seeds and nuts, especially flaxseed, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts, contain omega-3s
Flaxseed, canola, and walnut oil are fairly high in omega-3s. Oils such as corn, soybean and sunflower are not as high, but still offer some.Dark leafy greens, such as kale, parsley, spinach, and watercress, offer omega-3s through ALA. ALA is not processed as efficiently as DHA, but these foods are also very healthy and should be a regular part of your diet., Dark chocolate contains resveratrol, which has been shown to increase serotonin levels.Cocoa is also very high in tryptophan.Eat dark chocolate, as it has more cocoa (and usually less sugar) than milk chocolate., Like dark chocolate, red wine also contains resveratrol.However, alcohol can interfere with healthy serotonin function.Talk with your doctor to see if drinking alcohol is appropriate for you.


Alcohol can also interfere with several antidepressant medications.

, Low magnesium levels reduce serotonin.Vitamin B6 determines how much magnesium your body will absorb, so make sure you are also eating foods that contain B6. You can get magnesium through a variety of dietary sources, as well as supplements.Adults should have between 310-420mg of magnesium daily.
Good sources of magnesium include tofu, whole grains, legumes, green leafy vegetables, brazil nuts, wheat bran, almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, and walnuts., St. John’s wort improves mood and reduces anxiety in people with mild to moderate depression.These effects are likely because it has been shown to increase brain levels of serotonin in lab animals.Taking St. John’s wort may be a good idea, but it’s crucial to consult with your doctor before taking it, as it has negative interactions with many drugs and can cause severe complications to existing medical conditions.


Taking St. John's Wort with SSRIs and other types of medications that increase serotonin can cause serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening reaction. St. John's Wort can also make other drugs less effective when taken at the same time. Drugs that might be affected include oral contraceptives, anti-retroviral medications, anti-coagulants such as Warfarin, hormone replacement therapies and immunosuppressant medications. Talk with your doctor if you are on other medications.Do not take St. John’s wort if you are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Do not take St. John’s wort if you use hormonal birth control; it may make your birth control less effective.Do not take St. John’s wort if you have major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ADHD. St. John’s wort may cause severe side effects for people with these disorders. It also interferes with other antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications.Do not take St. John’s wort if you have a heart or liver condition, or take medications for your heart or liver. St. John’s wort also negatively interacts with many medications for HIV/AIDS and cancer.This is not a complete list of interactions. Consult with your doctor before taking St. John’s wort to make sure that it is safe for you.

Get exposure to sunlight.,
Practice good sleep hygiene.,
Exercise.,
Focus on the positive.,
Play with your pet.,
Do yoga.,
Challenge yourself.,
Destress.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Meditate.",How to Increase Serotonin Naturally2," Some types of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder, are linked to a lack of exposure to sunlight. Your body uses UV rays in sunlight to promote Vitamin D production, which is linked to serotonin production.Research has shown that sun exposure is positively correlated with serotonin production, and bright sunlight can counteract the mood-lowering effect of acute tryptophan depletion.Low sunlight levels may also increase your body’s production of melatonin, which can interfere with your body’s serotonin levels.If you don’t live in an area with bright sunlight, light therapy by using a light therapy box is an option.Consult with your doctor about which light therapy box is best for you: boxes produce anywhere between 2500 lux and 10,000 lux. Use a stronger box for at least 30 minutes every morning; lower-lux boxes may require up to two hours.Be safe outside. Choose a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and wear sunscreen whenever you go outside (even on cloudy days). Being outside in the sunshine without sunscreen dramatically increases your risk of developing skin cancer., The exact relationship between serotonin and sleep is still under scientific debate.However, serotonin does help regulate your sleep cycles. Chronic sleep deprivation has been shown to desensitize the serotonin receptor system, leading to symptoms that are similar to those seen in mood disorders (e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms).Wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day, including weekends.This consistency will help your body regulate your sleep cycle.
Avoid distractions in bed. Don’t watch TV, do computer work, or use backlit screens in bed, as these can interfere with melatonin production and may keep you awake.Limit napping. Too much napping during the day can disrupt your nighttime sleep cycle. Try to limit afternoon naps to 10-30 minutes.Have a glass of milk before bed. Milk contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose, which may help you fall asleep. Carbohydrates are also linked to serotonin production, although not directly., Exercise has natural antidepressant effects and releases endorphins, the body’s natural mood elevators. The exact relationship between exercise and serotonin production remains unclear.Moderate exercise appears to increase tryptophan levels, and may contribute to the production of serotonin. Regardless of the exact process, many research studies show that moderate, regular exercise improves your mood and reduces depressive symptoms.Aim for a minimum of 30-35 minutes of physical activity per day.Moderate activities include brisk walking, biking, jogging, swimming, and gardening.
Aerobic activities have the greatest effect on mood, and are the most likely to increase serotonin levels.Avoid exercise that is too strenuous. Over-exercising can trigger stress responses in your body, which will deplete serotonin levels. Exercise that is too difficult for your fitness level is also much harder to get yourself to do regularly. Exercise in ways you enjoy.

, Some studies show that thinking about positive events in your life can increase serotonin production. Similarly, thinking about negative emotions can decrease serotonin production.People who can view even challenging past experiences as positive (e.g., as learning experiences) are considerably more likely to feel happier overall.


Research suggests that feelings of awe and wonder promote healthy cytokine levels. When cytokine levels are too high, they can block serotonin from functioning properly. Taking a walk in nature or doing something that literally “amazes” you is actually good for your serotonin levels!, Studies have shown that petting your dog or cat can raise levels of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, which all play significant roles in your psychological well-being. Playing with your pet can also reduce your body’s stress responses.Pet owners are less likely to suffer from depression than people who do not own pets.

, Research suggests that practicing yoga regularly can significantly increase your serotonin levels. In addition, yoga reduces monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters.Several studies have shown that yoga can help reduce anxiety and depression.Sudarshan Kriya Yogic Breathing has been shown to help treat stress, anxiety, and depression.To maximize yoga’s effectiveness, you should practice a mix of asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), and meditation. Which yoga practices work best for you will depend on your fitness level and other factors; experiment to find what helps you the most., Success enhances the level of serotonin in the brain. Experiences of failure and social rejection lower serotonin levels. People who experience positive, successful social interactions and have healthy self-esteem are more likely to have high serotonin levels.Put yourself in situations that will boost your self-esteem by allowing you to take on a challenge, however small.For example, set (reasonable) goals for yourself, and celebrate your successes when you achieve them. Learn to dance, play the guitar, cook a meal, or skydive.
Research suggests that success produces a positive feedback loop: achieving your goals boosts your confidence, which boosts your ability to perform and achieve new goals.
Pursue something meaningful to you. Pursuing accomplishments that give you a sense of purpose may also increase your serotonin levels., Stress increases your body’s level of cortisol, a stress hormone. It also reduces your serotonin levels.People with poor serotonin levels can experience depression, mood swings, and stress. People who have positive, relaxed moods also have higher serotonin levels.In addition to the obvious candidates such as meditation and yoga, there are several other ways you can reduce your stress levels.Practice progressive muscle relaxation. PMR focuses on intentionally tensing and then relaxing your muscle groups, one by one. PMR can help you become more aware of your body and where you tend to carry tension. With practice, you can learn to release tension on command.Listen to pleasing music. Calm, pleasant music helps reduce your stress levels. This, in turn, may boost serotonin levels.The British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the world’s most relaxing music according to science.
Try therapeutic massage. Massage has many health benefits. It can improve symptoms of depression and alleviate anxiety. Research also suggests that massage may boost serotonin levels.Try visualization. Visualization can help you relax by using mental images to create a calm, relaxing place for you to retreat to. During visualization, you imagine a relaxing safe space in as much detail as possible, using all of your senses. The University of Houston - Clear Lake has several guided visualization exercises on their website., Deep breathing is excellent for quelling your body’s stress responses. You can get these effects from just 10 minutes of deep breathing practice.Find a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting erect.
Place one hand on your lower abdomen and one hand on your chest.
Slowly inhale through your nostrils for a count of 4. You should feel your lower belly expand as your diaphragm expands and your lungs fill with air.
Slowly release the breath through your nostrils for a count of 4.
Repeat for at least 5 minutes (but preferably 10).

, Meditation lowers stress responses in the right prefrontal cortex and amygdala. When your body is stressed, it releases cortisol, which robs your body of serotonin.Meditation also heightens activity in the left prefrontal cortex, which is associated with feelings of happiness and well-being. While no studies have proven a link between meditation and serotonin function, it is an excellent way to improve your mood and reduce stress.Mindfulness meditation has been linked to increased serotonin activity.Meditation also stimulates the lateral hypothalamus, which may elevate serotonin levels."

Ditch the juice.",How to Live a Vegan Lifestyle on a Budget," As a vegan, to stay healthy you'll have to regularly eat fruits and vegetables, and lots of them! Fruits can be some of the cheapest snacks when in season, but beware fruits out of season, as they can be really overpriced. Try to stock your fridge with fruits that are grown locally or nearby and that are in season, as these will normally be the cheapest and will also be of the best quality. Plus, you'll be helping local farmers, which is something many vegans consider important.


In Canada, the cheapest fruits are apples, oranges and bananas, for example. Relying on exotic fruits for all your snacks can be really expensive, whereas a banana can be as cheap as 30 cents.;
, You pay more for the service of having someone else cut up the fruit, so forgo this and do it yourself. An entire watermelon will give you a ton of fruit to last a long time, for a lot less than if you bought the same amount already cut up. Instead of buying a fruit tray or a pre-prepared fruit salad, try buying the fruits and making the salad yourself. The cost of preparation and packaging can be cut from your budget easily.

, Any vegetables that are out-of-season or pre-cut or pre-prepared as salads will always going to cost more.


Make your own salads! Buying pre-made salad costs a lot more because of preparation and packaging costs.

, Often times, gluten-free and vegan products can overlap. However, gluten-free items can be extremely pricey. Just because the gluten-free spaghetti doesn't have egg, there are probably other regular products that don't either––they'll probably be cheaper too and they may even be more flavorsome.

, With milk as the exception, as the price of almond and soy milks is usually the same as regular milk, avoid foods claiming to be vegan substitutes. This includes soy cheese, meatless chicken, meat analogs, etc. Meat and dairy products are derives from an expensive industry anyway. (Look at the price of a steak.) The meatless substitutes are also usually expensive, and most of the time, they aren't as healthy as whole foods. Much like meat and dairy products, they are usually highly processed and do not add a great deal to your diet.


Egg substitute is the exception, as you can buy 100 ""eggs"" for baking for the price of 12 real eggs.

, Try out that homemade veggie burger recipe for example, instead of buying a pack of pre-made ones. It's healthier and more cost efficient. You can freeze excess for several more meals to come.


Make your own soup. Homemade soup is one of the best foods for a budget, and can be frozen and eaten later! Just chop up lots of vegetables, boil some water and cook it up! You can have meals for weeks on less than a dollar per meal.

, Beans and lentils are a great way to get protein and iron! Buy large bags of beans and lentils; they store wall and they don't go bad for a long time. They're super cheap and can be incorporated into almost any dish.

, Doing this can save you a lot of money over time. If you are able to eat all the food in the larger package before it expires, or if it has a long expiration date, opt for the larger pack. Always be sure you can eat the food in time though, otherwise this isn't a good savings.

, If you have a friend who likes the same foods or is also vegan, consider splitting bulk products with them. Have a day every week where you both go grocery shopping together.

, If foods can be frozen, buy in bulk and freeze half for later if you're afraid it will go bad. This works well for bread and can also be applied to vegetables and fruit that have been prepared properly for freezing.

, You're going to be eating tons of fruit, so buying an entire box of clementines or kiwifruits to save money won't go to waste. Again, if you can split the box with a neighbor or fellow vegan close by, you'll save a lot more.

, Grocery stores are always promoting great deals, try to keep an eye out for them! Often you can score some great savings just by shopping at the right place at the right time.

, Couponing has become such a popular part of North American culture, and it's easy to do. Try subscribing online for monthly or even weekly coupons at your favorite grocery stores, or look through flyers or the backs of cereal boxes. There is no shame in saving money!

, If you want specialty vegan products that aren't in your local area, use online shopping. There are many websites now that are tailored specifically for vegans, offering products that mimic non-vegan ones. Here you can buy vegan cheese, meat substitutes, marshmallows, sauces and much more. However, be alert to the fact that as tempting as this can be, it can be really expensive, especially when you include the shipping. If you decide to order products online that you can't find locally, try splitting the order with a friend and sharing the shipping cost.


Ask to be placed on the store's mailing lists. That way, when sales come up, you can bulk buy those products that normally cost a lot more.
Look for free or low shipping options; some stores will offer these.

, By far, in most places, the cheapest liquid you can drink is water. It comes out of your taps for free, and you can add a water filter that can make almost the tap water drinkable if needed.


Even if you insist on buying water in stores, it is usually the cheapest drink you can buy (although, reducing your ecological footprint does mean thinking carefully about the use of water in plastic bottles when you have decent tap water available).

, It is far better to eat the fruit itself than to rely on juice for your serving of fruits and vegetables. It's cheaper to drink water than juice, and it even quenches your thirst better.


With eating the fruit, you'll get the roughage and vitamins needed, while with juice, you risk over-dosing on too much fructose.

Keep a water bottle with you at all times.,
Vary the types of fluids you're drinking.,
Have a water schedule.,
Cut back on your sodium intake.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Be aware of your body.,
Limit your total fluid intake.,
Hydrate effectively.,
Check your urine regularly.,
Test how much fluid you've lost.",How to Keep Hydrated Without Over Doing It," Most people don't truly need to worry about overhydration. Most actually need to worry about being adequately hydrated.


Carrying around a water bottle with you at all times gives you access to hydrating fluids any time of day.
Consider purchasing a reusable water bottle that you can fill up as many times as you need during the day.
Make life easy by filling it up at night and keeping it in the fridge ready to go in the morning.
Also keep it on your desk at work and bring it with you in the car so you can constantly work on drinking adequate amounts of fluid.;
, Drinking plain water all day can be boring. In addition, some people don't enjoy the taste of plain water. Mix it up to help you ingest more fluid during the day.


In addition to plain water, any decaf, sugar-free beverage can hydrate you. Low-calorie sports or electrolyte drinks, flavored waters and decaf coffee and tea all count.
If you want a more natural water flavoring, try steeping fruit, herbs or even cucumbers in a pitcher of water over night for homemade flavored waters.

, If you're not good at drinking adequate amounts of fluids during the day or are chronically dehydrated, try giving yourself a schedule to follow throughout the day.


Select certain times a day that you must have some water. Of course you could drink water in between these times too.
Also, consider purchasing a reusable and measured water bottle. Make ""rules"" for yourself about when and how much water you need to drink.
For example, you might have a rule to start your bottle of water when you get to work and finish it before your lunch break. Then, have another rule to fill it back up and start it after lunch and finish it by the time you leave work.
Try setting email reminders, pop-ups or timers on your phone or watch to help cue you in to drinking more water, more frequently throughout the day.

, Another way to improve your hydration is to cut down on the amount of salt that you include in your diet. In fat, you only require about ¼ teaspoon of salt per day, but most people get way more sodium than this in their diets. Check the labels on any packaged foods that you buy and try to avoid eating foods that are high in sodium. Some of the high sodium foods to avoid or limit include:Salted or cured meat, such as bacon, hot dogs, ad cold cuts.
Frozen dinners and other prepared foods, like frozen pizza and breaded meats.
Canned foods, like soups, raviolis, beans, and chilis.
Salted nuts.

, If you think you're over-hydrated or dehydrated, it's important to talk to your doctor about appropriate treatment.


If you're having difficulty maintaining normal fluid status, seeing a doctor is imperative. He or she will be able to treat any underlying conditions appropriately.
Make sure to tell your physician if you're having any symptoms or if symptoms have worsened over time. For example, if you've been drinking a lot of fluid, but are not urinating frequently throughout the day.
Let your doctor know if you are experiencing excessive thirst because this may be a sign of diabetes.

, Trust your body to tell you if it needs something or has too much of something else. Start to pay attention to your body's signals and symptoms regarding hydration.


Symptoms of overhydration or ""over-doing"" it with fluids include: nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle weakness and cramping, seizures, unconsciousness and coma.You can tell if you're properly or adequately hydrated if you're: not feeling thirsty, your urine is the color of lemonade or very pale yellow by the end of the day and you have constant sweat production during exercise.
During the day if you feel thirsty, take a couple sips of water. However, if you've been drinking consistently throughout the day and are not feeling thirsty, put the water bottle down for a bit.

, If you have the tendency to over drink or go overboard with your fluids throughout the day, give yourself a limit to stick to.


Most health professionals recommend consuming between 8-13 glasses of clear hydrating fluids daily. These fluids include water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.Be aware that sweetened beverages and caffeinated beverages do not count and can work against your total hydration status.
You will only need to drink more than 13 glasses of water daily if you're exercising a lot or working in humid or hot conditions.

, Sometimes you might need to rehydrate with other fluids outside of water. Think about what types of fluids to drink in certain situations.


If you want to limit the amount of fluid you're drinking or ensure you're not over drinking fluids, choose drinks that will hydrate you more effectively than water.
Some sports drinks, electrolyte drinks and coconut water all contain some electrolytes and a little bit of sugar. Your body can get rehydrated and replace any electrolytes lost through sweat and urine.
If you're exercising daily or for long periods of time, drinking a low-calorie sports drink, electrolyte water or coconut water can be especially helpful.

, Urinating regularly is a good indication of hydration, but too much urine or clear odorless urine may indicate overhydration. Check the amount and color of your urine to determine if you might be dehydrated.

In adults, too much urine would be more than 500ccs of urine each time you go. In babies, this would be a very wet heavy diaper. However, keep in mind that it is rare for babies to become overhydrated unless they are on IV fluids. A baby’s diaper can also be a sign of dehydration. For example, if a baby’s diaper stays dry for 4 or more hours, then they are likely dehydrated.
In adults, clear water-like urine that has no odor is a sign of overhydration. In babies, clear odorless urine can also be a sign of overhydration.

, If you exercise regularly, workout for long periods of time or are working out in the heat and humidity, hydrating appropriately is important. There are two simple tests you can do to figure out how much fluid you've lost through exercise.


Do the sweat test. Weigh yourself before and after an intense or especially sweaty exercise session. If you've lost 1 pound, you sweat out 16 oz (or 1 pound) of fluid. Next time you do that activity, aim to drink 16 oz of fluid during your workout.Make sure that you do not overcompensate with fluids after a workout because this can be a cause of overhydration.
Check your clothes too. If you notice you have white streaks on your clothes, skin or have a salty coating on your skin after a workout, you've lost a lot of sodium. You'll need to rehydrate and replenish electrolytes.Try coconut water or a low-calorie sports drink.
Remember, if you're working out to lose weight, stick to sports drinks or electrolyte drinks that have 50 calories or less per 16 oz serving."

Evaluate legumes (pulses).,
Check matcha tea's antioxidant claims.,
Learn about chia seeds.,
Evaluate ancient grains.,
Research the benefits of probiotics.,
Learn about the paleo (caveman) diet.,
Learn to read labels.,
Recognize weight loss claims.,
Watch for promises to boost your metabolism.,
Distinguish marketing from certifiable health claims.,
Understand how your body stores vitamins.",How to Know if Trendy Health Foods Are Beneficial," You probably already eat pulses without realizing it. Pulses are legumes, or dry lentils, beans, and chickpeas. They're being called this year's superfood, but their health claims are pretty modest. Specifically, pulses are high in protein and low in fat. They also contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, including iron.These health benefits back up a number of health claims. For example, pulses are especially good for vegetarians who may be lacking in proteins. They can lower blood sugar and blood pressure, which can prevent or manage type 2 diabetes and heart disease.Add pulses to soups and casseroles to up the protein.;
, You've probably seen matcha as a popular addition to drinks and desserts. You may have even seen claims that this crushed green tea leaf prevents aging. Since these claims vary widely, you should read health and nutrition studies. Research shows that matcha does contain antioxidants, as well as L-theanine which can keep you focused. But, consider the food to which you are adding matcha. A sweetened whole-milk matcha latte with whipped cream is going to have high amounts of fat and sugar.Instead, try to prepare and drink matcha as simply as possible — as a tea.
The antioxidants and polyphenols in matcha can protect against some diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes., Many people are trying to eat the tiny seeds from the chia plant because they're seen as a superfood that can help you lose weight.Since this vague assumption doesn't tell you much about the specific health benefits, check major health journals to see what's being researched. The research shows that chia seeds are good sources of protein that can treat certain conditions. But, chia seeds don't actually help with weight loss.One study found that chia seeds may be effective for allergies, cancer, heart disease, and stroke (among other conditions). The research also showed that chia seeds may be an antioxidant and antiviral. But, the study also shows that more research is needed to see exactly how chia seeds prevent disease., Ancient grains like teff, millet, quinoa, and amaranth are popular because they're gluten-free and seen as more nutritious than plain flour. If you have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, these may be obvious flour replacements.Ancient grains are also seen as nutritious because they aren't processed like most flours. These whole grains contain fiber, antioxidants, and amino acids according to studies.Be skeptical if food packaging advertises ancient grains. It's more important to pay attention to whether or not the product is mainly made of whole grains and is low in sugars and fats., You may not be familiar with probiotics, but you've probably heard that Greek yogurt is a great health food that contains them. Probiotics are believed to improve intestinal health but supporting the ""good"" bacteria found in our digestive system. Recent claims suggest that improving gut health can improve mental health and anxiety.One study supports probiotic use to treat vaginal infections.Studies focusing on probiotics are difficult to perform because the microorganisms are living.Researchers have called for large studies to learn about probiotic treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Many believe that probiotics will be an important treatment along with traditional IBS therapies., This popular diet focuses on eating unprocessed foods like nuts, meats, fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Some people eat a paleo diet to prevent bloat and get more vitamins and minerals. The idea is that eating a diet similar to one our ancient ancestors ate can prevent the development of chronic diseases.Some clinical trials suggest that a paleo diet can help you lose weight, control appetite, and manage your blood sugar and blood pressure.Unfortunately, many trials were very small and didn't last long (less than 12 weeks). This makes it difficult to understand any long-term effects of the paleo diet.

, A consumer food trend study found that sales of foods labeled ""natural"" or ""organic"" grew by 24 to 28% in recent years.Foods that are labeled ""organic"" must be certified and held to processing regulations. But, foods labeled ""natural"" are not held to any regulations. You should be in the habit of reading food labels to look for added sugars, fats, and artificial sweeteners or colors.For example, be skeptical of any food that contains high fructose corn syrup, trans saturated fats, or artificial coloring and claims to be healthy.


The Food and Drug Administration is considering regulating the term ""natural"" after May 2016.While it's tempting to believe the front-of-the package health claims, you should avoid relying on them. Health claims on the front are usually just marketing. Instead, focus on reading the nutrition label., At most, healthy food trends should only promise to taste good and be good for you. You should be skeptical of trendy foods that promise to help you lose weight. Remember that the only way to lose weight is to reduce the amount of calories you consume while you burn more calories through exercise and daily activities.Pay attention to terms like ""low-fat,"" ""diet,"" and ""fat-free."" Don't assume that these terms automatically make a trendy food healthy. Instead, be sure to read the labels for artificial substitutes, added sugars, and serving sizes.

, Lots of foods promise to speed up your metabolism, but that's usually an empty claim. The largest factor in your metabolism (Basal Metabolic Rate) actually depends on your body size and composition (how much you weigh and how much of that is muscle mass), your age, and your sex. These account for 70% of your BMR.The remaining 30% is determined by your physical activity (exercise), increasing your muscle mass, and by nutrients you get from your diet.
Metabolism may also be determined by genes, since genes play a role in muscle size and the ability to develop muscles.
Men tend to have more muscle mass, heavier bones and less body fat and hence their daily calorific requirement and metabolic rate tend to be higher.
Some foods and herbs may help your body burn calories more efficiently which can improve your metabolism. These include: chilli peppers, horseradish, mustard, cinnamon, fennel seed, garlic, ginger, ginseng, guarana, turmeric, and green tea., If you're interested in a trendy health food, you've probably heard that it's beneficial in some way. Rather than let yourself be informed by marketing surrounding the product, research the health studies that support or refute these benefits. For example, maybe you heard that kale is good for juicing and losing weight. To research this claim, you might research studies about leafy greens and their impact on metabolism and weight loss.


Pay attention to sources when researching food and health impacts. Don't rely on studies that were sponsored by a corporation that could benefit from the research. Instead, look for independent studies, medical or scientific studies, or government health departments for information.

, Your body reacts to vitamins differently, depending on if they're fat-soluble or water-soluble. With fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamins A, D, E, and K), your body breaks them down in fat and stores them throughout your body. With water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C and the B complex vitamins), your body doesn't get a chance to store them since they dissolve in water before this can happen. Your body also needs a variety of minerals in different amounts in order to function correctly.Because your body processes these nutrients differently, you should avoid eating too much of one food (even if it is considered to be a superfood). Instead, try to eat a varied diet.

Top your toast with vegetables.,
Incorporate shredded vegetables into fritters and pancakes.,
Eat a meal that is not normally considered breakfast fare.",How to Incorporate Vegetables Into a Healthy Breakfast," A vegetable scramble is a simple dish made by sautéing vegetables in a shallow pan and then adding beaten eggs over them to hold the dish together. Begin by adding any vegetables you like, including onions, garlic, bell peppers, chili peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus, or spinach. Once the vegetables are cooked down, pour one or two beaten eggs over the top, and allow it to cook thoroughly.;
, Hash browns or home fries are wonderful ways to cook potatoes for breakfast. However, this preparation also works well when substituting winter squash or yams for some of the potatoes. Consider adding minced onion and bell peppers to the mix to add flavor, color, and increase the vegetable content.

, Wraps provide an easy template for creating a healthy breakfast. Begin by sautéing a hearty amount of your favorite vegetables - the same ones you would prefer in an omelet or scramble. Scramble an egg in a separate pan, and then fill a warm tortilla with the vegetables and egg.

, Orange juice and other fruit juices are mainstays at the breakfast table, but you can easily drink your vegetables as well. If you do not feel like juicing your own fresh vegetables at home, there are many bottled fruit and vegetable mixes that you can buy at the store. Remember to check the nutrition label, however, as some of these vegetable juices can contain high amounts of sodium.

, One technique that will allow you to incorporate more vegetables into any meal is to serve a plate of fresh cut vegetables alongside the main course. Cucumbers, carrots, celery, and cherry tomatoes are all easy to munch in their raw form, and can complement a breakfast as well as any other meal.

, When it comes to breakfast toast, butter and jam are the undisputed favorites for toppings. Instead, try topping your toast with some fresh or cooked vegetables, including spinach, basil and tomato. Avocados are another topping choice that can even rival the creaminess of butter or margarine.

, Some vegetables, including carrots, zucchini, and sweet potatoes, can be marvelously incorporated into fritters, pancakes, or other pan-fried dishes. Shred or puree the vegetables in a food processor, and add them to the batter before cooking.

, Try a hearty salad for breakfast, or a heaping plate of steamed or stir-fried vegetables. These vegetable dishes can always be paired alongside breakfast favorites like eggs and toast if desired.

Add ground black pepper to help your body absorb the turmeric.,
Combine turmeric with coconut oil.,
Add herbal supplements.,
Put golden paste into other foods.",How to Improve Your Health with Golden Milk2," The curcumin in turmeric doesn’t get absorbed into the body easily. The curcumin is metabolized by your body before the body can absorb any of the beneficial nutrients. To help with this, add black pepper to slow down your body’s metabolism of the curcumin.According to one study, adding 20 mg of piperine found in black pepper to 2 g of curcumin can increase the availability in the body by 2,000%.

, The curcumin in turmeric is fat-soluble. This means that the without a fat source, the curcumin will be more difficult to digest or absorb. To help with this, combine the turmeric in your golden milk with coconut oil.The coconut oil provides a fat to help the curcumin absorb into the body.

, The simplicity of golden milk lends itself to customization — feel free to get creative with your recipe. Try adding liquid herbal extracts of ginseng for energy, holy basil leaf to reduce stress, or ginger to reduce inflammation.You could also try blending it with 1 tablespoon of goji berry powder to add antioxidants, or add whole, pitted dates instead of honey to sweeten.

, The base of golden milk is golden paste. Golden paste combines turmeric, coconut oil, and black pepper, which increases the absorption of the curcumin in the turmeric. If you don’t want to drink golden milk every day, try putting golden paste in other foods for the same benefit.For example, you can put golden paste into your rice, peanut butter, yogurt, or even guacamole. Try it in casseroles or with pasta.

Notice joint pain and tenderness.,
Notice redness and swelling around your joints.,
Notice the development of nodules.,
Feel if your skin is itchy.,
Recognize any disturbances to your sleep patterns.,
Be aware of kidney problems.",How to Identify Hyperuricemia1," Joint pain occurs because of the deposition of urate crystals on the joints.


The deposits can press on the nerves that supply that particular joint and cause pain.
The urate crystals may also interfere with blood flow to the joint, resulting in tenderness and pain.;
, Redness and swelling occur due to inflammation of the joint that causes an increased blood supply to that area.


This is a sign of your body fighting invaders, when antibodies that protect the body are transported to the inflamed areas.
Swelling on the joints is caused by increased blood supply to the joints.
This occurs because blood supply is increased as a way of fighting the disease.

, You might develop nodules on your elbows, ears and hands.


This occurs because of increased deposition of urate crystals in different parts of your body.
The nodules are also called tophi and appear as white or yellow firm papules.
They can appear in multiples or as a single nodule.
They can appear in varied parts of the body like the hands, feet, and fingers.
Tophi can also erupt on the skin and discharge chalky masses that contain crystals of urate.

, If you notice yourself itching and scratching your skin, it can indicate an increase in uric acid content in your blood and skin.


This causes you to feel itchy and scratch, because the urate is accumulating.
You may notice red marks left on your skin the morning after a night of scratching while asleep.

, Difficulty sleeping occurs because of increased tenderness and pain in your joints.


The tenderness may be so intense that it is hard for you to fall asleep when your body feels the light pressure of your sheets.

, Increased uric acid can cause kidney stone formation and lead to problems with urination.


The kidney stones may block urine passage.
Kidney stones can also cause extreme pain during passage.

Get your medical history taken and undergo a physical to identify symptoms.,
Have laboratory studies done to determine the levels of uric acid in your body.,
Get imaging tests to determine the condition of your joints.,
Get a joint aspiration done to detect uric acid and crystals in your joints.",How to Identify Hyperuricemia2," If you are suffering from hyperuricemia, your health care professional will conduct a thorough history of your health background.


Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, factors that trigger your symptoms, and any other relevant medical problems that could provide information.
Your doctor will also carefully examine you, looking for symptoms that suggest the development of hyperuricemia.

, In order to confirm a diagnosis of hyperuricemia, you can have certain lab exams performed by your doctor, such as:


Serum uric acid. A blood sample will be drawn, put in a sterile container, and examined to determine the level of uric acid in your blood.
Urinary acid excretion. This test is done if you exhibit a high amount of uric acid excretion. For 24 hours, you will collect your urine while maintaining your normal diet and alcohol intake. After 24 hours of monitoring, you will be put on a low-purine, zero alcohol diet for 6 days and then collect your urine again. After both collections, the urine will be compared, looking for a decrease in the levels of uric acid.

, Imaging tests can determine if you have joint swelling due to uric acid build up. There a few tests that can provide your doctor insight, such as:


Skeletal c-ray films. This test may detect the presence of swelling in the joints and the development of subcortical cysts (cysts that form in the skeleton) if you have gout.

This test uses x-rays that pass through your bones in order to create images.


Renal ultrasound/sonogram. This test is used to evaluate kidney function in order to find the presence of uric acid stones.

It is a painless procedure that makes use of sound waves to create images of the kidneys that are recorded by a computer.
During the procedure, a cool gel or lubricant is placed onto your pelvic area (between your hipbones).
An instrument called transducer (marker shaped instrument) will be placed over the lubricated area to create images of the kidneys and the surrounding area, which your doctor can view on a computer.



, During a joint aspiration procedure, your joint will be drained of fluid for analysis.


Before the procedure, the skin over your joint will first be cleaned using an antiseptic solutions such as betadine.
A sterile syringe will be inserted into the joint to collect and drain fluid that will be examined in the laboratory.
The punctured area will then be covered with sterile gauze to prevent bleeding.

Cut out or reduce unnecessary amounts of fats or oils used for cooking.,
Substitute water, 100% fruit juice, or healthy oil for butter when frying, sautéing, or oven roasting.,
Reduce added salt, fat, and sugar by using herbs and spices.,
Add fruits or vegetables to almost anything.,
Try substituting high cholesterol ingredients with soy products, fruits, vegetables, or lower cholesterol items.,
Make condiments, sauces, dressings, and other additives at home.",How to Improve the Nutritional Value of Recipes," For dishes that involve a greased pan or oil for cooking simply to ease the transfer of the food from dish to plate or to facilitate stirring or flipping in the pan, try reducing the amount of butter or oil by half.


In most cases, two tablespoons of butter or oil will provide enough grease to prevent a whole pan of vegetables from sticking to a frying pan.
If necessary, additional butter or oil can be added if stirring or flipping becomes difficult.;
,


In many cases, using water or juice in the place of butter or grease can remove a significant amount of fat from a recipe.
Even meat dishes can taste great when fried or baked in a bit of juice and spices instead of in oil.
If the preparation requires oil for proper frying, try using olive oil, vegetable oil, sunflower oil, or other healthy oils in place of butter, and use only the minimum amount necessary to brown or sear the food.
Other creative mixtures containing common ingredients like honey, mustard, vinegar or wine may enhance flavor and add nutrients while reducing fat.

, Dried or fresh herbs and spices can add considerable flavor to any recipe, allowing a major reduction in added salt, butter, or sugar in sauces, toppings, dressings, and other ingredients that aren’t essential to the preparation of the recipe.


Herbs go well with poultry, seafood, meats, eggs, vegetables, and pastas.
Spices pair well with fruit dishes or sauces, some meats, desserts, and many baked goods.
Experiment with herbs and spices to find flavors that appeal to every family member if necessary, and only season with salt or sugar after serving if necessary.

,


Try replacing chocolate chips with raisins in cookies.
Add pureed cauliflower to cheesy mashed potatoes.
Sneak shredded carrots and zucchini into meatloaf.
Mix canned corn into cornbread.
If a beef stew only calls for onions and potatoes, try adding carrots, corn, crushed canned tomatoes, peas, parsnip, spinach, cabbage, or other vegetables to bulk up the recipe.
For pancake mixtures, add bananas, berries, mandarin oranges, or pre-cooked apples to up the fiber and nutrient content, and top them off with a fruit topping seasoned with cinnamon or allspice and a dash of brown sugar.
Even boxed, canned, or frozen dishes can improve in both nutritional value and flavor when chopped fruits or vegetables are added to them.

,


In some recipes, applesauce can substitute for eggs or low-cholesterol items can replace meat.
Try eggplant Parmesan instead of chicken, or make a beef and broccoli dish into a tofu or shrimp and broccoli dish.
Experimenting with hearty vegetables, seafood, or soy products as meat replacements can not only reduce dietary intake of cholesterol, it can also add important vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fatty acids only available in other food sources.
If family members balk at tofu, try bean or salmon burgers as an occasional change-up for hamburgers as a start.

, For many people, flavorings, dressings, condiments, and sauces can be the black sheep in an otherwise healthy diet. Because they add so much flavor but take up very little actual volume on the plate, it is easy to go overboard.


When out and about, opt for mustard instead of mayonnaise, vinegar and oil instead of ranch, or ketchup instead of cheese sauce.
At home, dressings and sauces are easy to make; many have very few ingredients and by mixing them up with fresh ingredients, taste and nutritional value improve as well.
Try a citrus vinaigrette with three parts orange juice to one part olive oil, a squirt of brown mustard, a clove of minced garlic, and a dash of salt, pepper, and sugar.

Consider how you deal with being told what to do.,
Think about whether you're all right with being second guessed.,
Examine your work ethic.,
Be honest with yourself about how squeamish you are.,
Consider your bedside manner.,
Remember that you need emotional strength for the job.,
Think about how organized you area.,
Think about how much you care.",How to Know if Nursing Is for You," Do you have problems with authority? Are you okay with being told what to do and when to do it?


When training to be a nurse and when qualified, you are told what to do all the time. Every day. This could be by patients, doctors, charge nurses, physio-therapists, occupational therapists, etc.... If you have a problem with being told what to do, when to do it and how to do it, then you may need to rethink.;
, Are you okay with having your work scrutinized by other nurses, doctors, patients and patients families?


When training to be a nurse you are scrutinized and assessed every second you are in placement. Staff report to the mentor on your progress, and you are assessed by your mentor in a book; where comments are made about every possible detail.
When qualified, you are in charge of your patients. Staff, patients, doctors and patients families are quick to point out errors however tiny they may be.
Can you handle this pressure? This ability to do everything to the best of your ability at all times (tired/hungry or not)? If you can, you could maybe handle it.

, Nursing is not a career that you can put your feet up for 5 minutes because you're ""tired"". A typical ward day is manic, and sometimes you are lucky to make it to your lunch breaks on time... if at all!

,


You see puss, blood, mucus, urine, stool (Hard and watery), every possible substance that a human body can produce... Can you handle this without letting it show on your face?
Can you smell these things without letting it show on your face?
Can these things accidentally spill on you without gagging/fainting? ...Then maybe there's some hope for you!

, Can you build a rapport with strangers very fast? Can you become a daughter, mother, brother, father, best friend, counselor but professional all at once and in about 5-10 minutes? In other words; If you are a responsible, reliable, likable, nice person with a good sense of humour you probably could learn this with time and practice.

, You can be good friends with a patient one minute, and the next they have passed away.


You have to be able to take any statements such as, ""I don't want to die"" or ""I'm thinking about suicide"" or ""I'm worthless, there's no point in me living anymore""... You will be taught what to physically do. But can you deal with these questions emotionally when you go home?

, You'll need to stay ""on top of"" social work referrals, dietitian referrals, food charts, nursing notes, ward rounds, observations, toileting, personal care, turning charts, fluid balance charts, discharges, admissions, medications, appointments and the list goes on and on and on.


Are you responsible and pro-active enough to remember to do all of these things? ....And not just hand them over to the next nurse.

, Can you care enough about a strangers well-being (no matter how nice/horrible they are) to give them the best care that you can possibly give?


It's a tough balance between caring enough that you give amazing care, and not letting yourself get too emotionally attached and damaged.

"
Find your item in your local mega-mart, online, or in a general grocery store.,
Read the whole label, especially the small print, but never believe what you read on the front and side of the label.,
Look first for the number of servings per container.,
Compare the number of servings with Total fat, Calories from fat, Trans fat, Saturated fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Total Carbohydrate, Dietary Fiber, Sugar, Protein and the list of assorted vitamins and minerals.,
Read the ingredient list.,
Start with baby steps.,
At first, look at just the first three ingredients listed.,
Have some ideas about where to start.",How to Improve Your Health by Reading Labels,";
, Be wary of the way they write advertisements. People can literally hypnotize you with the written word.

, You don't want to be eating the whole package, that looks like a single snack, when the pack contains 2 or 3 servings.

, To eat healthy, quickly eliminate products that contain too much saturated fat, any trans fat, too much cholesterol, or too much sodium.


Fat: There is no safe limit on trans fat, so if any amount is listed, the product is unhealthful. Saturated fat is bad, polyunsaturated fat is neutral, and monounsaturated fat is good. Look for a very low saturated to total fat ratio, or monounsaturated fat much greater than saturated fat. Also, look at the calorie from fat in relation to total calorie. If fat accounts for over 30% total calorie, that is too much; less than 15% is good. The example shown above has saturated fat to total fat about 1:4, and monounsaturated fat is more than saturated fat, so it can be considered a healthy choice on this account. Fat accounts for 537.4 out of a total of 2059.6 calories, or 26%, which is ok.
Cholesterol: this comes only from animal products and is linked to increased cardiac risk. As with saturated and trans fat, you should limit this intake as much as possible.
Sodium: most commonly comes from table salt (sodium chloride), but may also come from other additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). High sodium intake is linked to hypertension and a myriad of other serious health problems,so limit this as much as possible. As a rough rule of thumb, any product containing more than 1 mg of sodium per calorie is too much. The example above has 2975 mg Na per 2059.6 Cal, which is too much.
Carbohydrates: there is no hard lower or upper limits on total carbohydrates, but two components deserves mention.

Dietary Fiber, which comes only from plants and is essential for good health. The more of this, the better, but aim for at least 25 g for women and 38 g for men.
Sugar is frequently an additive and should be limited. Correlate this by reading the ingredient list (see below) for ""sugar"", ""high fructose corn syrup"", or any of many forms (see here).


Protein: this is essential and most need 46-56 g per day.The Institute of Medicine recommends 10-35% of calories from protein.Know that fat has 9 Calorie/gram, while carbohydrate and protein have 4 Calorie/gram. The example above has 83.3 g protein or 333.2 Cal, which is 16% of total Calories, so it meets the standard.
Vitamins and Minerals: these are essential micronutrients, so aim to have close to 100% daily requirement.

, This is often the trickiest part of the whole label in that manufacturers disguise ingredients with unfamiliar names. Anything called ""glutamate"" or ""hydrolyzed"" is something like MSG. Go back to the reference to the advertisement article. The fewer items listed, the better. The ideal product has only one item listed, such as ""Whole grain rolled oats"". Anything with more than one ingredient contains additives. The more highly processed foods (read unhealthy) have longer ingredient lists.

, Don't sit down and try to read every little item and think you will absorb it. Start with common foods. Make lists until you get used to what you're looking at. Web search different items to find different names for them.

, Don't worry about the rest. The ingredients are listed in the order of their quantity in the food. For example, if water, sugar and soy are the first ingredients, that means that these ingredients are the first, second and third greatest quantities that there are in the product. Likewise, if a product is advertised as containing whole grain, but the first item listed is ""enriched flour"", rest assured that whole grains do not account for much of the product.


What you find might surprise you. You might think that a meat product is made mostly of meat, only to find out that the major ingredient is a grain.
Many people enjoy better health when reducing the role of meat in their diet. You might experiment with eating fewer foods that are based on meat. Meat is an animal protein, but has zero fiber. Animal meat is high in fat, cholesterol, and protein, and contains no dietary fiber and few micronutrients.

, Some words/terms that can help you determine that it is a preservative or some other additive.


Look for various types of phosphates in the foods. See what the results are. If you have a sensitivity to it, you will notice matching symptoms. One such additive, is sodium phosphate.







Monosodium Glutemate (MSG). This is very common as are allergies or intolerance to it. Research the various symptoms or reactions that others have had and compare them to what your symptoms are.







High Fructose Corn Syrup - You would be amazed at how many foods have this ingredient in it that don't need it. There are, on average, 4,500 products in an average mega-mart. 1/3 of them contain high fructose corn syrup. Do some research on this additive and don't let the commercials think for you. Remove it from your diet and see how you feel. There are natural alternatives for it, if a sweetener is needed.There have been many studies that are tying high fructose corn syrup, Type II Diabetes, and obesity closely together. Replace it with agave nectar.
EDTA - used for mayonnaise and dressings. EDTA is a chelation chemical used in industry for removing heavy metals from our systems.

Identify yourself as a leader.,
Demonstrate confidence.,
Have courage.,
Communicate clearly and consistently, and remember to listen.,
Pay attention to professional growth.,
Manage your time well.,
Lead by example.,
Find a mentor of your own.,
Stay current in the profession.",How to Have Good Leadership in Nursing," Many nurses see their roles as deferential to doctors and other practitioners. Make sure you understand and embrace the role leadership plays in your career.;
, Self-confidence is essential to a nurse's leadership skills.


Understand what you need to do and approach every patient with a confident and competent attitude. If you come across as nervous and unsure, your patients will also feel anxious.

, Good leaders are willing to take calculated risks, and as a nurse your leadership depends on your ability to take those risks. Playing it safe will not develop you into a nurse leader.


Share ideas. Let doctors and colleagues know what you think about the care that patients are receiving and if you have an idea, speak up.

, Whether you are talking to patients, doctors, family members or other nurses, be mindful of how you communicate.


Listen first, and respond directly and truthfully. If you cannot answer a question, say so. If you promise to do something, do it. Good communication will develop leadership and trust.

, Take classes, courses and seminars that go beyond those you are required to take to maintain your nursing license.


Look for opportunities to learn new skills. Try a business or management class, or attend a leadership conference.
Encourage any nurses you supervise to grow professionally. Recommend classes that might interest your staff. When other nurses see you investing in your own learning, they might do the same.

, Prioritize your tasks and responsibilities wisely. For example, you do not want to keep a patient waiting while you open mail or file charts that can be dealt with later.

, Be the best, most knowledgeable and talented nurse you can be. Other nurses around you will take note and mimic your demeanor, skills and leadership.

, Having good leadership skills as a nurse means learning them from many different sources.


Ask a nurse you admire for some coaching. Pay attention to the nurses that you work closely with, especially those who impress you.

, Read nursing journals, subscribe to e-newsletters and join professional nursing associations.


Keep up with the latest best practices in leadership as well. Read books and articles about leadership, even if those materials are not specific to nursing. There is a lot to be learned from business and nonprofit leadership theories.

Steam your cauliflower.,
Mash the cauliflower.,
Aid digestion with grilled cauliflower.",How to Improve Your Health with Cauliflower1," Steaming is good way to cook your cauliflower until it is tender enough to eat but still maintains many of the veggie’s great health benefits.Steam your cauliflower by placing raw or frozen florets in a steamer with lid and placing over a pot of boiling water for seven to ten minutes, until slightly tender.Steamed cauliflower is easily dressed with a bit of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and/or fresh herbs such as garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Generally, if it works on a potato it will taste good on cauliflower.
Steaming cauliflower has a minimal impact on the health benefits of the vegetable, and one of the easier ways to prepare the food while keeping it nutritionally sound.
Have half a cup as part of a nutritionally balanced meal to get micronutrients such as vitamin C that you need for full body health.;
, A cauliflower mash can be a great heart-healthy, low-calorie substitute for a dish such as mashed potatoes. Simply steam a head of cauliflower and five cloves of garlic for about 15 minutes, then puree in a food processor with a pinch of sea salt.If you would like, you can also add in a quarter of a cup of fresh herbs such as chives and/or rosemary. A drizzle of olive oil can add some flavor, as well.
Serve in half-cup portions as a side dish to include extra fiber in any meal, and get in heart-healthy vitamins like folate and B6.

, Take a head of cauliflower, rub it down with a mix of a few tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and wrap the head completely in foil. Then, grill over indirect medium heat for about 40 minutes or until tender.You can also slice the cauliflower into “steaks” and cook it on a grill, like you would a cut of meat.
Grilled cauliflower can help add fiber and necessary roughage to cookouts or other heavy-eating events, and is easy to prepare and share with others.Look to grilled cauliflower as a substitute for heavier cookout side dishes that tend to be high in calories, fats, and carbohydrates but relatively low in micronutrients.

Improve your nutrition and your health.,
Do not use coconut water to refresh your sodium levels.,
Don’t use coconut water to rehydrate.",How to Improve Your Health with Coconut Water1," Good nutrition and good health go hand in hand. You can get vital nutrients like potassium, magnesium, and manganese from coconut water, and improve your health in the process. Coconut water is naturally low in fat, and it is a good source of potassium, magnesium, and manganese.


Potassium is an electrolyte that is responsible for muscle contraction, which is important for heart health and good digestion.Coconut water contains high levels of potassium.Drink coconut water to improve your health by increasing your potassium intake.Potassium is readily available in other sources like bananas, leafy greens, and citrus fruits. Eating a balanced diet will provide you with adequate amounts of potassium.
Magnesium is important for a variety of bodily functions, including muscle contraction, protein synthesis, and blood glucose control. You can get magnesium from other food sources such as almonds, spinach, cashews, peanuts, and soy milk.Manganese is a trace mineral that helps with the formation of connective tissue, sex hormones, and bones. You can also get manganese from whole grains, nuts, seeds, and pineapple.Coconut water may even lower cholesterol levels and reduce blood pressure according to some research.;
, When you sweat, you will lose sodium. Some people think they can use coconut water to restock their body’s sodium stores and thereby improve their health. However, the amount of sodium you gain from coconut water is negligible, and will not adequately restore your sodium levels – sports drinks are far better at doing that than coconut water., If you’ve had an intense workout, you might be tempted to reach for coconut water to improve your health. But coconut water is no better than regular water at rehydrating the body. Your best bet is to save money and just enjoy plain old tap water or bottled water.Additionally, if you’re regularly drinking coconut water (say, two average-sized bottles of coconut water daily), you could add over 100 additional calories to your daily caloric intake."

Try different recipes with ingredients like pistachios or lemon to get different added health benefits.Keep in mind that while a cauliflower dessert is a healthier alternative to many traditional desserts, it should still be consumed in moderation.

, There are a number of recipes out there that use cauliflower as a substitute for fats, flours, and other ingredients in traditional baked goods. Go online or find a speciality cookbook to find cauliflower baked goods recipes to make healthier versions of your favorites.Cauliflower desserts should be expected to taste different than the baked goods they imitate. The taste is often still pleasant, but do not expect an exact substitute.

, Take some of your cauliflower rice and cook it with milk, cinnamon, sugar, and spices to create a sweet, sticky rice pudding that can help satiate your sweet tooth. Substitute this in place of more sugary desserts as a healthy alternative for when you want a treat.Using cauliflower in your diet in place of sugary foods can help improve your brain function, mood, and memory, all factors thought to be negatively impacted by eating too many sugars."

Take diuretics.,
Maintain your blood pressure with medication.,
Ingest phosphate binders.,
Get Vitamin D supplements.,
Take iron supplements to treat anemia.,
Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",How to Help Kidney Failure Patients Who Refuse Dialysis1," Diuretics can decrease edema (swelling of hands and feet) due to excess water in the body. Your doctor should prescribe drugs like hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide in doses specific to the severity of kidney failure. Furosemide is administered in tablet form or IV and is taken every day once a day until the desired effect is obtained.;
, ACE inhibitors, Veno-dilators, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers can help keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. These drugs either dilate the veins or arteries, reducing either the amount of work required of the heart or reducing the amount of blood pumped to the heart.

, Taken before meals, phosphate binders like calcium carbonate or Calcitriol bind phosphate in the stomach and prevent it from being absorbed. A concentration of phosphate in the blood leads to:


weakening of bones and ultimately irreversible damage
skin irritations and itching
muscle cramps due to electrolytes disturbance

, Supplements can help activate the vitamin taken from food or sunlight. The activated form of vitamin D helps regulate both calcium and phosphorus levels in your blood through balancing their absorbance. It also controls parathyroid hormone ""PTH"" release, which forces your body to increase calcium levels by taking it from bone tissue, which is ultimately not good for you.

, Anemia develops because of a decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) production. EPO help form red blood cells by stimulating bone marrow to produce them. When not enough red blood cells are synthesized, less oxygen is delivered to your vital organs, causing short rapid breath, fatigue, chest pain, confusion or dementia.

, NSAIDs like Ibuprofen and Declofenac salts can harm your kidneys. Ask your doctor to prescribe you other safe analgesics.

Recognize pain as an indicator of a stress fracture.,
Keep an eye out for inflammation or bruising.,
Notice the presence of localized tenderness.,
Consider the presence of muscle spasms or numbness.",How to Identify a Stress Fracture1," Pain is the most common symptom of stress fracture, especially pain directly on the affected area. Although pain from a stress fracture can be barely noticeable at first, it tends to become unbearable over time.


Especially consider pain that intensifies upon weight bearing activity and exercise and subsides with proper rest.
The pain may be sharp, pulsating and excruciating.;
, If inflammation or bruising is present at the site of pain, this indicates the possibility of a stress fracture.


Inflammation results from the body’s immune system releasing inflammatory chemicals in order to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process. Bruises appear when the blood vessels break because of force or blow to the skin. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in a red, black or purple skin mark.

, Localized tenderness is tenderness that usually originates from a specific spot and decreases during rest. Tenderness or a feeling of a palpitating soft object can be due to inflammation in the affected area.

, When the muscle fibers in the injured area stretch or tear due to stress fracture, these muscle fibers contract and tighten. This contraction results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. Reduced blood flow can lead to spasms and a funny feeling or numbness in the affected area.

Avoid salts and sugars.,
Increase your intake of Vitamin D by eating seafood.,
Get more iron.,
Restrict your potassium and phosphorous intake.,
Include red bell peppers and red cabbage in your diet.,
Use olive oil as dressing for salads or as a cooking replacement for regular sunflower oil.,
Drink parsley juice.,
Try herbal remedies after consulting an expert.",How to Help Kidney Failure Patients Who Refuse Dialysis2," They retain water, trapping it in your body and could elevate your blood pressure. Hidden sources of salt and sugar include canned food, sauces, fried potatoes, candies, carbonated drinks and salad dressings.

, Great sources of vitamin D include salmon, tuna, mackerel, and sardines. Other vitamin D sources are cod liver oil, eggs, and dairy products like cheese and yogurt. Vitamin D balances the absorption of potentially harmful phosphorous.

, Increase your iron intake with beef liver, chicken liver, kidney beans, and some cereals. Iron is needed by your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. This in turn produces more hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood.

, Try to limit the amount of bananas, oranges, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, apricots and clams that are eaten. Instead, eat peaches, apples, grapes, and watermelon, and for vegetables you can eat broccoli, cucumber, and cabbage. Also avoid foods like dried beans, carbonated soft drinks, nuts and peanut butter as they contain high levels of phosphorus, which weakens the bones.

, Red bell peppers contain vitamin C, vitamin A, and vitamin B6. They also contain lycopene, which protects the body against various cancers and free radicals. Onions are also antioxidants that enhance protein and fat metabolism. Red cabbage contains phytochemicals, vitamin C and serves as a good fibre. Red cabbage is an anti-oxidant with low potassium levels and also increases water flow and salt absorption.

, Olive oil contains oleic acid, which acts as an anti-inflammatory fatty acid. The monounsaturated fat in olive oil protects against oxidation and also contains polyphenols and antioxidant compounds that fight against inflammation and oxidation.

, It acts as a diuretic by flushing out excess water and electrolytes and reduces toxin build-up. Parsley consists of fenilpropanos and flavonoids, which have a renoprotective effect. It is also an anti-oxidant and helps lower creatine levels in the body.

, Studies show that medicinal plants can decrease toxins in the body as well as balance various levels like water and electrolytes.


Boerhaavia diffusa helps increase functions of the kidney and helps remove toxins from the blood and body.
Tribulus terrestris also known as Gokshur or Gokharu or puncture vine consists of flavonoids, flavonol glycosides, steroidal saponins and alkaloids, which help balance water levels and electrolytes.
Terminalia chebula (haritaki) is used for its free radical properties.

Quit smoking and drinking alcohol.,
Practice yoga.,
Join a support group.",How to Help Kidney Failure Patients Who Refuse Dialysis3," Smoking introduces free radicals into the body leading to cellular damage. It also constricts blood vessels, which can compromise the patient's health. Alcohol is also another form of toxin your kidneys have to filter and excessive drinking places unnecessary strain on them.

, Certain breathing techniques help clear out toxins efficiently, while various asanas in yoga help reduce the burden of blood flow to the kidneys.


Crane pose begins with balancing on your hands while your shins are lifted onto the back of your upper arms. Keep your toes as close to your butt as possible. Extend your chest and gaze forward or down.
Crescent lunge energizes the spine and opens up your chest. From a high lunge position, press both palms together above your head. Keep your stomach and chest lifted by slightly bending your back.
A low plank is similar to a , except your hands are flat on the ground, your elbows hug your ribs and your arms are bent at a 90 degree angle.
Side plank challenges your core strength. Lie on one side, hips and feet stacked on top of each other. Place the hand closest to the ground underneath your shoulder and push up. Extend your opposite arm directly upwards.
Warrior two also opens up your chest. Again, stand in a high lunge position with your back foot slightly turned inwards and your front knee facing the direction it’s bent. Raise your arms so they’re parallel to the floor, actively stretching them in opposite directions.

, Emotional support from friends and family is recommended. Explaining the disease to relatives and friends will help educate them. They can then offer moral as well as physical support to the patient.

Identify what causes stress fractures.,
Understand that sedentary people can experience stress fractures after becoming active.,
Know that athletes are at a heightened risk of stress fractures.,
Be aware that women are more prone to acquiring stress fractures.,
Understand that people with foot problems are prone to stress fractures.,
Know that preexisting medical conditions can heighten your risk of stress fractures.,
Consider lifestyle factors that can affect your risk of stress fracture.",How to Identify a Stress Fracture2," Stress fractures are caused by putting too much weight or pressure on the weight bearing bones of the body such as the legs and feet. This weight can cause an imbalance in the growth of new bone cells, and constant overuse of weight bearing bones can lead to bone exhaustion, cracking the bone and leading to the development of a stress fracture.


Stress fractures usually occur in the tibia (shin bone) fibula (lower leg bones), metatarsals (bones of the feet), navicular (bones of the mid foot). They occur less common in the femur (hip bones), pelvis, and the sacrum.

, Sedentary individuals who are subjected to increased physical activity after a very long sedentary life can have a high likelihood of developing stress fractures. This can come as a shock, and be the first sign of overtraining.


If you have just upped your running mileage dramatically, or recently began a new regimen, you may be suffering from stress factors.

, Many sports, such as track and field, basketball, tennis, and gymnastics enforce repetitive stress on the bones. This stress is due to the foot striking the ground, causing trauma that can lead to stress fracture.


Athletes who overtrain on different surfaces and those who use substandard equipment, like worn out athletic shoes, are at an increased risk for stress fractures.

, Women, especially those with an irregular menstrual cycle, are at an increased risk of stress factors. During menstruation, a sufficient amount of iron is lost. Iron is needed for the proper development of bones.


Iron deficiency can predispose women to stress fractures.

, Individuals with foot problems, like flat feet or high and rigid arches, are more prone to developing stress fractures. This is due to the imbalance these foot abnormalities cause during weight bearing activities.

, People with preexisting medical conditions, especially osteoporosis, are prone to developing stress fractures because they have weak and brittle bones.


Osteoporosis weakens the bone and a stress fracture can develop.

, People who drink more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week or smoke are at a higher risk of developing stress fractures. This is because substances in alcohol and cigarettes tend to reduce bone density.


Additionally, people with eating have reduced amounts of calcium and vitamin D, nutrients that are necessary for strengthening the bones.

"
"
Know when to see your doctor.,
Discuss your medical history.,
Get a physical examination.,
Get imaging tests.",How to Identify a Stress Fracture3," Although you can make a rough diagnosis at home, it is important that you check with your doctor or a specialist (podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon) right away, once you experience pain while doing weight-bearing exercises such as walking, running and jogging. Remember that in the case of a stress fracture, the pain usually subsides at rest, but when the pain, discomfort and swelling do not subside, it is best to head to the emergency department of the nearest hospital or treatment facility.


If left untreated for too long, a stress fracture can cause quite a bit of damage.

, The doctor will interview you and ask you some questions are necessary to gather information. This information will aid the doctor in accurately diagnosing a stress fracture. The doctor can also evaluate the patient’s risk factors for developing a stress fracture.

, A thorough physical examination is done where the doctor will inspect, palpate and percuss the affected area. Symptoms such as tenderness, pain, and swelling are determined in this manner.

, Imaging will help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. Since stress fractures might only appear to be a crack in the bone, their extent and severity may not be seen in a routine x-ray. If the x-ray is unsuccessful, further imaging will be ordered. Some possible types of imagine are seen below:


X-ray. May not show evidence of stress fractures, but can be used several weeks after the symptoms begin. This can show when the bone starts to remodel and heal, evidence that an extra bone is being formed at the fracture site.
Computed tomography scan. A modernized method of evaluating the internal structures of the body. CT scans take computerized images and convert them into visual to provide a clearer picture of what is happening within the affected site and its surrounding joints, ligaments or bones.
Bone scan. Can identify a stress fracture. This scan uses a radioactive tracer injected through an intravenous line to demonstrate areas where bone cells have increased activity and blood supply, suggesting bone repair. A bright white spot is shown on the scan image.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A procedure used to establish the degree of injury acquired by the patient through a scan. It uses radio and magnetic field waves to form a more detailed and clear picture of the scanned body structure.

Avoid higher fat or higher sugar processed foods.",How to Get Lean," By making a list of your goals, whether it simply be losing five pounds or being able to run a mile under a certain time, having your goals written out may help you stick to them long-term.Write your goals down, and keep them in plain sight so you are reminded about what all your hard work is going toward each day. Be as specific as possible. Instead of just saying ""lose weight,"" say ""lose X pounds by December.""
Make sure your goals are realistic and timely. You may need to make multiple goals until you reach a larger, more long-term goal.Keep track of your progress towards your goals in a journal or a sheet of paper you tack to the fridge. Seeing how far you've come may help keep you motivated and working harder to achieve your long-term goals.;
, By decreasing the amount calories you eat each day may help you lose weight and reduce your total amount of body fat.


The prescribed calorie deficit ranges from 500–750 each day. This amount will be different for everyone based on how many calories you are currently eating and how fast you want to reach your weight goals.It's not wise to cut too many calories or eat less than about 1,200 calories daily. If you do not eat enough (especially if you're working out) you're more likely to lose lean muscle mass rather than fat.You may need to test out a few different calorie levels until you find the right balance for your body, lifestyle, and activity levels. For example, if you notice you're not losing weight at all, you may need to eat fewer calories daily. If you're feeling tired, fatigued, or notice your athletic performance is suffering, you may not be eating enough.

, Talk with your physician or a registered dietitian for advice on how to lose weight and build lean muscle mass. They can tell you more about exercise plans, diet plans, and give you warnings about any health issues which might arise.


If you have a heart condition, asthma, or any other health conditions you feel may inhibit your ability to lose weight, consult with your doctor immediately.
Beware of any “professional” trying to sell you supplements. Especially if those supplements come in a powder form. Doctors and dietitians will usually prefer a healthy diet and lots of exercise, as supplements are largely unproven and poorly studied.

, When you're starting a new diet or exercise plan, it may be helpful to keep a weekly plan or log somewhat like a ""to-do"" list.


Keep a notebook or journal with your weekly plans. Write out each day of the week and include what exercises you'll be doing that day, what meals and snacks you're eating and even what progress you've made on your goals.
Weekly meal and exercise plans can be a great component to your diet. They've been shown to help keep you on track and organized throughout the week.An example of one day of your plan might be: Morning workout: 30 minute jog and 20 minutes of yoga; Breakfast: greek yogurt with fruit; Lunch: spinach salad with grilled salmon; Snack: two hard boiled eggs; Dinner: grilled chicken with quinoa and steamed vegetables.

, These are exercises which raise your heart rate and burn calories without building too much muscle.Cardio exercises will help give you that lean look as this particular type of exercise helps burn calories and decrease body fat.


In general, most adults should be performing cardio exercises for a minimum of 30 minutes per session. Do cardio and aerobic exercises about four to five times a week to meet your weekly goal.In addition to burning calories and helping support a lean and toned look, cardio has a variety of other benefits including: helping support a healthy weight, decreasing blood pressure and blood sugar and helping improve mood.The key is to provide variation in the workout routine to prevent boredom and address different problem areas. This keeps the body guessing. Keep

, Biking is a great way to give yourself a lean physique. You can bike at home or at the gym on a stationary bike or you can get outside on a real bike.


Biking is a great aerobic exercise because it allows you to increase your heart rate significantly and it helps tone your entire lower body (glutes, quadriceps, calves and hamstrings).If you're biking or taking a spin class, working at a higher intensity can help you burn almost 500 calories within about 60 minutes. It's a very efficient way to burn larger amounts of calories.This is a great exercise for busy people, as it can be used as an alternative form of transportation. Ride your bike to work to fit a workout into your daily commute.

, Swimming is another great way to lose weight and get a lean body. Whether swimming at home in your pool or going to a gym, swimming helps tone your entire body.


There are a variety of exercise options you can do in the water. Try swimming laps, doing water aerobics, or water resistance training.
Unlike many other forms of aerobic exercise, swimming (especially swimming laps) works almost every muscle group in your body. As you swim through each stroke, that repetitive motion helps strengthen and tone your muscles.Swimming is an especially good exercise if you are very overweight or have knee or bone structure problems, as it distributes your weight away from your skeleton and is low-impact., Running is a great aerobic exercise which can quickly help you lose weight and build lean muscle.


Running or jogging specifically works the lower body and core. However, to increase the toning benefits of your jog, increase the speed or intensity of your runs. The harder you work, the more benefits you'll receive from this exercise.
You can run alone or in groups, around your neighborhood, at a local track, or at your gym. Make sure where you're running is safe if you're going alone.
Be aware that running is a high impact exercise that can be hard on the knees and other joints. If you have previously had a knee injury, running may not be the best option for you.

, Spending hours weight lifting each week will definitely help you tone up, but it may also make you bulk up as well. Toning involves strengthen muscles and providing definition without adding muscle bulk. Concentrate on elongating and toning exercises instead.


Typically, if you're looking to get lean, avoid doing exercises that involve using high weights and and many repetitions.Avoid these types strength training exercises, as these will increase the size of your muscles, making you look bigger, rather than smaller.

, Pilates is a series of movements which can increase your balance, flexibility, and help build long, lean muscles.


Sometimes tools, such as weights or exercise balls, are involved. Take Pilates classes, study online guides, or watch videos on the internet.

, Again, like pilates, yoga involves moving through a series of positions that will build your flexibility, strength and support long, toned muscles.


Yoga classes may be offered at your gym, at a separate yoga studio or free online.
It might be worthwhile to take a few classes with a knowledgeable instructor so you can learn the correct way to do the poses and movements. Then try them at home.

, When you're trying to lose weight and get lean, it's important to follow an appropriate diet. Measuring portions can help make sure you're eating the right amount and not too much.


Consider purchasing a food scale or a set of measuring cups to help you stay on track with each of your meals and snacks.
While you may not need to measure each meal or measure long-term, for the first few weeks it will be helpful to be more consistent with your measured portions.

, Eating high protein foods will provide you with energy and help support more toned, lean muscles. Aim to include a source of lean protein at every meal to help meet your daily goals.


When you're dieting and trying to build lean muscle mass, it's important to consume an adequate amount of protein each day. In general, you will meet your daily needs as long as you include a serving of protein at each meal. Go for about three to four ounces of protein (about the size of a checkbook) at each meal and snack.Try to eat healthy, leaner sources of protein. Foods like poultry, eggs, pork, seafood, lean beef, legumes, and low-fat dairy which are low in unhealthy fats and high in protein.

, In addition to protein, your body will need adequate amounts of carbohydrates to help support basic daily activities but the increased amount of aerobic exercise you may be doing.


Aerobic exercise depends on an adequate amount of carbohydrates. If you're not eating correctly or cutting out too many calories, your performance may suffer due to inadequate food and carbohydrate intake.
Choose nutrient-dense sources of carbohydrates throughout your day. This will help ensure you're eating nutritious sources of carbohydrates.
Complex carbohydrates are foods that contain carbohydrates but also are higher in fiber. In general, they are more nutritious than more refined carbohydrates or those which are highly processed and lower in nutrients.Choose foods like: 100% whole grains like quinoa, whole grain oats, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread; fruit; legumes and starchy vegetables like potatoes, carrots or peas.

, While protein and complex carbohydrates will support your workouts and your goal of a leaner, more defined body, fruits and vegetables help round out your meals to make them more balanced.


Fruits and vegetables contain high quantities of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.Although they don't necessarily fuel high quantities of exercise, they provide your body with the nutrients essential for life.
Include one to two servings of a fruit or vegetable at each meal and snack. One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece of fruit.One serving of vegetables is one cup or two cups of leafy greens., Depending on the length, intensity or timing of your workout, you may need a pre or post workout snack. These snacks will help prepare your body for exercise or help it recover appropriately.


Your body needs mostly carbohydrates as a pre-workout snack. Just like you cannot drive a car without gas, you shouldn't work out without appropriate fuel.Carbohydrates are your body's best and most efficient fuel for workouts.
Best pre-workout snacks include: a piece of fruit, a bowl of oatmeal and dried fruit, a smoothie with yogurt and fruit or a bowl of high fiber, low sugar cereal.
After a workout, you need to replace all the fuel your body used up during your exercise session. The best combination is protein and carbohydrates together. This will help your body recover and repair muscles and energy stores effectively.The best post-workout snacks include: chocolate milk, protein bar, apple or banana with peanut butter, one mini whole wheat bagel with almond butter or one greek yogurt with fruit.

, In general, it's important to stay hydrated throughout the day. When you're increasing your exercise amounts, it's even more crucial to stay hydrated throughout the day.


At a minimum, you should consume eight glasses of water daily. Some studies show than you may need upwards of 10–13 glasses daily.Drinking a lot of water will actually help water retention and bloating. The more water your drink, the less the body needs to hold on to.
Stay hydrated with clear, sugar-free fluids like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee, and teas.

, Many processed foods are high in fat, sugar, sodium, and overall calories. Eating foods like these on a regular basis may lead to weight gain and increased fat mass.Avoid foods like: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, pastries, fried foods, frozen meals, processed meats, crackers, and chips.
Focus on eating foods that are minimally processed and nutrient dense. They generally are lower in calories and much higher in nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein or fiber.

Know your nurse's name.,
Use your nurse for help regularly.,
Bring a family member or friend to be with you in the hospital.,
Have your friend or family member keep a written record of the main events during your stay.,
Volunteer information about your medications.,
Inform your nursing staff and doctor of your habits and needs.,
Ask your nurse to let you know when there will be a shift change.,
Make sure your family members also know who your nurse is when they have to leave the hospital.,
Ask for a nurse to be present during your doctor's visit.,
Ask your nurse about what to do once you leave hospital.",How to Get the Best Healthcare when in the Hospital," It seems elementary, but knowing your nurse, their name and how to call for their help is just a really good and important first step to communicating well with the team in the hospital.


You have a nurse assigned to your care at every moment you are in the hospital. That means from admission, throughout your stay, no matter if you direct admit from a doctor's office, you come through One Day Surgery Center, the Radiology Department or the Emergency Room, you will have a nurse assigned. This is critically important to your continuity of care. Always, there is a nurse who knows who you are, what your diagnosis is and where you are.;
, Nurses, as a rule, are proud to call themselves patient advocates. In order to have your advocate 100% engaged and invested in your well being you ideally should know who your nurse is, at all times. In addition, you should feel confident he or she is going to do the best they can to advocate and help guide you through initiation of the healing process and finally to your discharge.

, Once again, this is not your responsibility, exactly, but it will pay dividends if you have someone who is able to stay with you through the night and even during the day when you are having tests or need a lot of assistance with normal day to day activities. While you have a nurse 100% of the time assigned to your care, and you may have nursing assistants and orderlies too who will work to help you, they are also assigned simultaneously to other patients and you cannot have them with you all the time. So, having a family member or friend can be really reassuring to you.

, This written record is also not mandatory, but being able to recall events when you are ill is not an easy task. So, if you keep a record of when you saw the doctor, what tests you have done, what treatments you had that day, you can then feel a little more in control of yourself and what is happening. If no one is able to stay with you and keep a record, have your nurse write down what tests will be coming up and any significant activities you will undergo each day on a dry-erase or write-on/wipe-off board at your bedside so you have a reference point each day.

, If you come to the hospital with medications from home you should declare and show those medications to your nurse upon admission. You may be asked to have someone take them back home, but they are important for the admitting nurse to document and know what drugs you normally are on.

, If you are on a special diet, have certain home or sleep routines, these can often be observed while you are hospitalized, but your doctor has perhaps not known or not informed the nursing staff, so you must communicate those specific needs to your admitting nurse.

, That way, you will know when you will be reassigned to the oncoming nurse. You need to be aware of shift change as there is some overlap of nursing staff and a report time where the new nurse coming on will hear report from the nurse going off about patient updates and care needs. So this is a good time to put in request for what you need from the upcoming shift nursing staff.

, This way if there is any communications to you or to your nurse your family member will have that nurse's name to ask for when they call to inquire about you.

, This is particularly important if you do not have anyone with you when your doctor comes to visit you in your room. This way you will have a second set of ears to listen to any instructions given from your doctor or updates about tests he might review with you.

, Upon discharge there will be a nurse who does all of your education about home care instructions, when to return to the doctor for follow up and how to take medications at home. This discharge review will be given as a written handout too. You should make sure and keep your discharging nurse's name on the discharge instruction sheet and a phone number for the unit where you discharge from also so you can call back if you think of questions after you go home.

Define health-related anxiety.,
Recognize the symptoms related to hypochondria.,
Admit that you need help.,
Get a physical examination.,
Consult with a mental health provider.,
Learn about cognitive-behavioral therapy.,
Join an anxiety support group.",How to Handle Health‐Related Anxiety1," If you have overwhelming and frequent irrational fear of getting sick, chances are you are experiencing hypochondriasis. People who have hypochondria are frequent visitors at the doctor's office or community hospital emergency rooms. They believe or are convinced that they have some kind of undiagnosed illness or disease.
, Hypochondria is a somatoform disorder that is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual with an array of identifiable symptoms. These list of symptoms help psychiatric and other mental health professionals make a proper diagnosis to help align the client with the appropriate treatment. Some of the symptoms to take note of include the following:

Uncontrollable preoccupation and irrational fear that you have a serious illness or disease despite diagnostic care and medical clearance from a provider.
The person’s preoccupation is not otherwise complicated by a delusional disorder body dysmorphic disorder.
Preoccupations and irrational health related fear is affecting your normal daily functioning, and these symptoms have been going on for at least 6 months or longer.
There is not any other diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder.

, If your life is severely affected by health-related fears or concerns, you need to seek professional help. Health anxiety can prevent you from leading a satisfying life because you may frequently check your body for signs of illness or spend all of your time seeking reassurance that you are not dying from a serious medical condition.If you are truly committed to getting help for your health anxiety, you will have to follow some steps that go against your natural tendencies to check or get reassurance.

, Those who suffer from health anxiety are no stranger to their doctor’s offices. If your imagination is filled with the picture of you dying from a rare disease, see your medical doctor once to rule out a physical cause to your symptoms.


More than likely, if you have been suffering from health anxiety for a while, your physician is already familiar with your persistent fears. Explain that you truly want to get to the bottom of your condition, so you need a comprehensive examination.
Do not ask your doctor to conduct special diagnostic tests. Get a thorough physical exam and blood testing only.

, If your doctor sends you off with a clean bill of health, there’s a chance your health concerns are of a psychological nature. You may have an anxiety condition such as hypochondria, somatization disorder, and illness anxiety disorder or even suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Only an experienced mental health provider such as a psychologist can fully assess and diagnose your case.


If you have health anxiety, you might be tempted to ignore your doctor’s reassurances that you do not have a serious medical condition. You may want to seek a second opinion. Don’t. The worries and fears that contribute to health anxiety are of an emotional sort. You need to see a professional who can adequately address these fears.
Bring a list of symptoms you have experienced, your family history, your medical history, and any other pertinent information to your first appointment., Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is one of the most effect psychotherapeutic approaches to treating all types of anxiety, including the health-related kind. This approach focuses on identifying problematic thought patterns that may influence your anxiety.For example, your mother may have died of cancer, so you have an ingrained fear of developing the disease. This causes you to check your body for signs or visit your doctor for any minor issue. Your CBT therapist will address the underlying cause of your fears (your mother’s death) in order to help you change these irrational thought patterns and behaviors.
Ask your psychologist about CBT. If this professional does not practice this type of therapy, you can ask for a referral or find someone in your area who does on the Psychology Today online portal.

, It can be gratifying to meet with others who suffer from health anxiety, too. In these groups, participants share their individual battles with anxiety and may even offer forth some coping strategies you can incorporate into your own life.Ask your physician or mental health provider about an anxiety support group that may help you.

, If your school or community has STEM-centered clubs or activities, those are a great way to both boost your understanding of your future and look good on paper. Naturopathic doctors vary off the beaten path of physicians, but nature and science centered activities both help for it.

, This is important both for paper, again, and so you know what you're getting into. If you wander into a doctor's office right now and say, ""What? This is miserable,"" that's a lot better for your future than if you do so in five or so years.

, High school is important, but you can bomb it and still make it into college with a couple of speed bumps. Right now, mental health is more important than prepping for a major. You have time.

Set aside a “worry period.” There are some self-help strategies you can implement to manage your health-related anxiety symptoms.,
Resist the urge to check your body daily.,
Stop seeking reassurance.,
Seek out accountability.",How to Handle Health‐Related Anxiety2," Contrary to what many physicians believe, staying away from health resources does not decrease the worry. In fact, avoiding learning about the conditions you worry about only makes the fear grow over time.


For example, you worry about developing cancer, so you avoid news and health articles that discuss the disease. It seems this doesn't relieve your anxiety, it only helps the cancer grow more ominous in your mind.
Create a daily worry window of about 30 minutes in which you educate yourself about the conditions that influence your anxiety. Check out the symptoms, read testimonies of people with the disorders, and examine the worst-case scenario. You may get worried about developing the disorder, but ask yourself what are the chances of it actually happening. Then, ask yourself how you would handle it if it did happen.This practice helps you overcome the avoidance aspect that worsens your anxiety. It also helps you gain some control of the situation and view your fears in a more realistic way.

, Along with avoiding health resources and excessive worry, another common symptom of health-related anxiety is obsessively checking your body for signs of illness. In order to take back control and overcome these fears, you have to stop checking.If you have a frequent habit of checking, it may be too difficult to stop cold turkey. Start by reducing the number of times you check per day. Then, reserve checking to a certain time of the day (maybe during your worry window). Gradually, decrease checking until you are doing it once a week or once a month.

, Reassurance-seeking is another problematic aspect of health anxiety. You might call your doctor’s office excessively to report “strange” body sensations. You might phone your friends and family to verbalize your fear of developing a serious medical condition. Stop this right away.Set a rule with loved ones that you are not allowed to discuss health symptoms. Visit your doctor only as needed for routine exams or tests. When you ask a question, take your physician’s first answer and do not ask again or seek a second opinion.
The fact of the matter is, you will never be completely certain about your health or free from risk of illness. All you are doing is upsetting yourself and the other person by seeking out empty reassurances.

, Dealing with the symptoms of health anxiety may be challenging to do on your own. Ask your therapist, doctor, friends, and family to hold you accountable. If they are knowledgeable about what you need to change, they can correct you when you start obsessing over symptoms. It may also help to give your friends and family pamphlets and resources about health anxiety.


To your health providers, you might say, “I’m really interested in treating my health anxiety. So, please redirect me if I ask too many questions or seem obsessive about my health. I need you to help me stay accountable.”
To your loved ones, you might say, “I am struggling with health anxiety, which means I am constantly worried about getting sick. I have a problem obsessing over the slightest change in my body. Can you please be on the lookout for any anxious behavior and call me out on it? Or, if I am focusing on a condition, can you change the subject? I’d really appreciate your help.”"

Be curious about your anxiety.,
Lead a healthy lifestyle.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Be patient and gentle with yourself.",How to Handle Health‐Related Anxiety3," If you are participating in CBT therapy for health-related anxiety, a major focus of your sessions will be on the root cause of the anxiety. Instead of beating yourself up when you notice fears or worries getting the best of you, be curious. Ask yourself, from where did it arise? How severe is it? Use the A-B-C Model to help you learn more about your anxiety.Find the Activating event. What happened that made you start to become anxious? (e.g. A friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer)
Notice your Beliefs. What are your thinking about the activating event? (e.g. You think that “life is short.” You wonder why your friend didn’t catch the symptoms in time)
Reflect on the Consequence. What did your behavior cause to happen? (e.g. You started staying up late researching cancer every night. The more you research, the more worried you become about your own health, so you started making appointments with different specialists)

, One excellent method for taking better control of health-related anxiety is to support your overall health and wellness. This typically starts with cleaning up your diet and getting more exercise. You might also ensure that you get enough sleep (i.e. 7 to 9 hours) nightly.Eat a diet of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean sources of protein, low-fat dairy, and nuts and seeds. Limit salty, sugary, and fattening fast foods and processed foods. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
Exercise for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week. Try running, weight lifting, yoga, boxing, or swimming.

, As you learn to control health anxiety it can be handy to develop a relaxation practice. There are many ways to practice relaxation, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, massage and guided imagery.Learn how to perform these techniques and include them in your daily routine to help promote recovery.
Regular self-care may also help you manage anxiety. Schedule in some activities that you enjoy each week like hanging out with supportive friends or watching comedy films.

, Overcoming health anxiety requires a level of self-compassion. You didn’t develop this condition overnight, and you won’t be able to make it disappear overnight, either. Start a journaling habit to track your progress through treatment. Celebrate the small victories like reducing your body checks or going long periods between doctor visits. Be patient with yourself as you learn new strategies.

Consult a physician or health professional.,
Select an emulsified oil.,
Take the oil daily until the symptoms resolve.,
Drink the oil mixed with juice, water, or milk.,
Try gargling with diluted oregano oil to ease a sore throat or sinus infection.",How to Get Health Benefits from Oregano Oil1," Oregano oil supplements are not recommended for everyone. Before beginning a regimen of oregano oil to treat internal symptoms, consult a health professional to make sure you do not have any contraindications (such as pregnancy or anemia) for use of the oil.A health professional should also be able to suggest a recommended dose for attempts to use oregano oil as a natural treatment for whatever condition you are trying to address.;
, For the duration of your treatment, 600 mg of emulsified oil in capsule form per day should be the maximum dose necessary (for short-term treatment) to relieve intestinal symptoms and reduce inflammation.


Smaller doses of 100 to 150 mg per day in capsule form should be sufficient for less serious symptoms or problems, such as yeast imbalances, general inflammation, sinus problems, and upset stomachs.

, Oregano oil needs to be taken consistently to build up the effect and reduce symptoms. To give yourself the best chance at benefiting from the healing properties of oregano oil, do not skip doses. Doses can be spread throughout the day.

, Because oregano oil can be very intense and even dangerous in its undiluted form, take capsule supplements or mix undiluted drops with a small glass of juice, water, or milk before consuming.


Oregano oil (3-6 drops) mixed with juice can reportedly aid a sore throat, cold, or sinus condition.
When purchasing a supplement, look for a concentration of carvacrol of 70% or greater.

, Mix two or three drops of oil into orange juice or warm water and gargle several times, morning and night, to relieve inflammation and fight infection."

Eat fruit rich in magnesium.,
Try the most magnesium-rich veggies.,
Eat more whole grains.,
Eat lots of cooked fish.,
Try Vegemite.,
Drink tap water.",How to Get Magnesium from Food1," Tamarind and prickly pear are the fruits with the highest content of this nutrient. One fresh prickly pear contains 88 mg of magnesium. ½ cup of tamarind contains 58 mg.A medium sized banana, for comparison, provides only 32 mg of magnesium., Cook spinach and Swiss chard. Just ½ a cup of either of these dark, leafy greens contains a good amount of magnesium. Cooked spinach will offer 83 mg of the nutrient, whereas cooked Swiss chard offers 80 mg.Try cooked okra. A delicacy of the American south, okra provides a decent amount of magnesium. A ½ cup portion will provide 50 mg of the nutrient, the same amount as medium-sized cooked potato.
One avocado, meanwhile, provides 44 mg of magnesium., Wheat germ cereals are a great source of magnesium. Just ¼ cup (30 mg) will provide you with just under 100 mg. Even shredded wheat cereals provide a good amount of magnesium. Serving portions of cereal are often much greater than ¼ cup, so a bowl of all wheat germ cereal every day is one of the best ways to get more magnesium from your food.Look for high-fiber foods generally. Avoid heavily processed grain products, as much of their nutrients have likely been removed.
Cereals made with bran are comparably high in magnesium, offering between 85 – 97 mg in the same portion. Some will even be fortified with magnesium, and will be labeled as such.
Eat other grains too. Quinoa will give you just over 50 mg of magnesium in a ½ cup serving when cooked.A slice of whole wheat bread will provide 23 mg, and ½ cup of cooked brown rice offers 42 mg.

, Several types of fish offer plenty of magnesium, even in small portions. Chinook salmon is best, offering 92 mg in a 2.5 oz (75 g) serving. Mackerel from the Atlantic offers 73 mg for a similar portion, and pollock from the Atlantic offers 64 mg.Atlantic snow crab offers 47 mg in the same size portion, when cooked.

, The yeast extract spread popular in Australia (and similar to marmite) offers 66 mg of magnesium in just a 2 tablespoon (30 mL) serving. Enjoy these spreads on a hearty, whole grain bread., Magnesium is present in most hard tap water, some providing up to 30% of your daily needs. Contact your local water supplier and ask how much magnesium is in the tap water as it can vary greatly from place to place."

Eat yogurt.,
Add soft cheeses.,
Incorporate kefir.,
Drink milk.",How to Get More Probiotics in Your Diet1," Yogurt is one of the most popular probiotic foods. Don’t just pick up any yogurt, though. Make sure to read the label. Look for the words “contains live active cultures” or “contains probiotics.” This means you will be eating probiotics.Look for organic yogurt that comes from grass-fed animals. Read the label to see how many cultures it states the yogurt has. The National Yogurt Association's “Live & Active Cultures” seal indicates there are at least 20 billion cultures per eight ounces, a standard which has been associated to be necessary for attaining optimal probiotic health benefits.Many brands have probiotic varieties of yogurt you can buy. However, you still need to look at the label. Many yogurts are full of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, and other additives that reduce the health value. Choose a yogurt with low sugar content.;
, Some soft cheeses contain probiotics. You can eat cottage cheese, or soft fermented cheese like Gouda. Some cheddar cheeses and parmesan cheese also contain probiotics.Consider eating six to eight ounces each day.

, Kefir is similar to yogurt, but often thinner and drunk instead of eaten. Kefir is a combination of milk and fermented kefir grains. It is tart, so a good way to eat kefir is to add it to a smoothie. Kefir has a higher probiotic count than yogurt.Try drinking 1/2 cup to one cup each day.

, Certain kinds of milk contain probiotics. Acidophilus milk contains probiotics, as does buttermilk. Just be aware these milks don’t have the same flavor as traditional cow’s milk.The USDA suggests having three cups of dairy each day. If you eat a cup of yogurt and a cup of kefir, then you can drink one cup of milk..

Include at least three to five servings of high-fiber vegetables.,
Include one to two servings of high-fiber fruits.,
Choose high-fiber nuts and seeds.,
Sneak in high-fiber, low-carb grains.,
Write yourself a meal plan.,
Calculate daily fiber totals.,
Add extra fiber to your favorite recipes.,
Talk to your doctor or dietitian.,
Add a powdered fiber supplement to your diet.,
Take supplemental fiber capsules.,
Drink extra water.",How to Get More Fiber on a Low Carb Diet," One of the food groups that isn't limited on most low-carb diets is the vegetable group. These foods are naturally low in carbohydrates and calories but high in fiber.


To make sure you can get the most fiber from the vegetable, the first thing you'll need to do is make sure you're eating enough vegetables daily.
Include at least three to five servings of vegetables each day. Measure out 1 cup or about 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.When you're planning your meals or snacks, always include a vegetable to help ensure you're getting a dose of fiber at every meal.
Although all vegetables are good for you, focus on the highest fiber vegetables like: artichokes, peas, broccoli, cauliflower, turnip greens, brussels sprouts, carrots and avocados.;
, In addition to vegetables, fruits are another food group that are naturally higher in fiber as well. Be mindful to choose foods that are high-fiber and lower in carbs.


Although fruit may be limited in your low-carb diet, most diets do allow for some fruit. Fortunately, many of the fruits that are a little bit lower in sugar and carbohydrates are the ones that are also higher in fiber.
To keep your overall carbohydrate intake in check when you're consuming fruit, measure your portions. One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or about one small piece.The highest fiber and lowest carb fruit includes: blackberries, raspberries, unsweetened coconut, pears and apples., Fiber isn't only found in fruits and vegetables. A subset of the protein group, nuts and seeds are the perfect fiber filled foods to eat on a low-carb diet.


Both nuts and seeds are naturally low in carbohydrates, but high in healthy fats and protein. Many nuts and seeds also have a high-fiber content as well.For instance, 1 ounce of almonds contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of total carbs, and 3 grams of dietary fiber.
Like all other foods, measure the portions of your nuts and seeds. In general, about 1/2 ounce or 1 tablespoon is a serving of nuts or seeds.
The highest fiber nuts and seeds include: chia seeds, flaxseeds, almonds, pistachios, pecans and sesame seeds., Not all grains are overly high in carbohydrates. In fact, there are a few sneaky ways you can eat some grains or parts of grains to help boost the fiber in your diet without overdoing it on carbs.


Although a big hunk of bread or bowl of pasta will be overly high in carbohydrates, there are some grain-based foods you can enjoy that can help boost your fiber. Many low-carb versions of your favorite (like low-carb tortillas) and foods like wheat bran can help boost your fiber intake.
Try some high-fiber cereals and grains like: wheat bran; low-carb, high-fiber cereals; rice bran or oat bran. These foods are lower in carbs, but contain a lot of fiber. For example, wheat bran has 3 grams of carb and 6 g of fiber per 1/2 cup.Also consider purchasing and using low-carb versions of your favorite grains. There are low-carb breads, tortillas and wraps, pastas and English muffins. In fact, many of these also contain added fiber as well.
Like all foods, to keep the total carbs in control, always measure your portion sizes. Grains should be eaten in 1/2 cup or 1 oz servings., If you're following a low-carb diet, you may already have a system in mind for how you plan your meals. However, to make sure you're eating enough fiber, it's important to come up with a detailed meal plan.


It's easy to just cut out obvious sources of carbohydrates in your diet. It's a little more complicated to cut out carbs while still meeting your daily fiber needs. A meal plan can help provide a blueprint of exactly what you can eat to meet your carb and fiber needs.Pick a day during the week where you can sit down and come up with all the foods and meals you will eat over the next week. Write down each breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack that you will plan on eating.
After you complete your meal plan, you can make up your grocery list which will make it easier to get exactly what you need at the store.

, After you've created your meal plan, take a few minutes to see if the meals and snacks you have planned will meet your fiber needs. If not, make some changes to your meal plans.


To calculate how much fiber each day of meals and snacks provides, you may need to use an online food diary app, a smartphone app or just a search engine to find the fiber content of the foods you're planning on eating.
Add up all the fiber from your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks and see if they meet your needs. Men need about 38 g of fiber daily and women typically need about 25 g of fiber per day.If you've met your fiber goal, then you can leave your meal plan alone; however, if you're far off from your goal, rework your meal plan or recipe ingredients to to help increase your fiber intake.

, Focusing on high-fiber foods can make meeting fiber needs a little easier. However, you may not enjoy foods that are higher in fiber or might be getting a little bored with the same foods. To mix it up, try adding extra fiber to your current favorite meals and recipes.


To help increase your fiber intake a little more, get creative in the kitchen and add fiber to your usual meals.
For example, you can blend dark greens or avocado into a morning protein shake or smoothie.
You can also sprinkle wheat or oat bran onto salads, added to foods like meatballs or meatloaf or even sprinkle it onto your morning yogurt or cottage cheese.
Blend vegetables into baked goods like meatballs, meatloaf, burgers or casseroles. Also add extra vegetables into some of your other favorite meals like adding steamed broccoli to a salad., Whenever you're following a diet it's a good idea to keep your doctor up to speed. This is especially true if you feel like you need to increase your fiber intake and are looking for ways to increase your fiber. Because some supplements can interfere with other medications or conditions, it's important to always consult your doctor before taking a supplement.


Talk to your doctor about your low-carb diet you're following. Share with your physician what foods are allowed and what foods you're avoiding.
If you have been keeping track of your fiber intake, share this information with your doctor as well. You may think you need more, but your doctor may think you're getting an adequate amount in.
If you're having a lot of difficulty meeting your fiber intake, ask your doctor if they have suggestions for you. Also talk to them about whether or not they think a fiber supplement would be safe or effective for you.
A dietitian is a health professional who is an expert on nutrition and diet. They can make sure you are getting adequate nutrients on your diet and help you figure out how to get more fiber. They can even help you create a meal plan to make sure you get all of your daily nutrients.

, The best source of additional fiber in your diet is from foods; however, it' may not be realistic to be able to rely solely on your diet everyday to meet your fiber needs.


One type of fiber supplement is a powdered supplement. There are a variety of these on the market and they are very easy and convenient to use.
In general, most powdered fiber supplements just require you to mix it into a liquid. Some have a flavor, like orange, and others are flavorless and can be added to anything (even foods like yogurt or soups).Follow the dosing instructions and portion sizes of the powdered supplements. You want to make sure that you're adding the right amount every day.

, If you don't think a powdered supplement would work well with your lifestyle, there are other options. You can take a fiber capsule or gummy each day to increase your overall intake.


Like the powdered supplements, fiber capsules will come with a recommended serving to take each day. Follow these instructions.Fiber capsules are easy to include in your diet. Take them along with your other medications or vitamins daily to help get you into the routine.
Other than your preference, there's no benefit of using the powdered supplements versus the fiber capsules.

, Whenever you're focusing on increasing your fiber intake, you also need to focus on your water intake as well. Fiber needs water in order to be effective in your diet.In general, as you increase your fiber intake, it's important to increase your water intake. There is not a recommended ratio, but aiming for the minimum recommended amount of fluids daily is a good place to start.
When you combine extra fiber and water together, it helps the fiber work more effectively. Fiber will absorb the extra water and make your stool softer and easier to pass.
It's typically recommended to consume about eight glasses of water daily; however, some people need closer to 13 based on their activity levels.If you're already consuming about eight glasses of water daily, increase to nine or 10 glasses per day as you increase your fiber intake.

Treat skin conditions with oregano oil.,
Follow the instructions on bottled oregano oil.,
Mix oregano oil with olive oil or coconut oil.,
Begin with a skin care regimen of one application per day.",How to Get Health Benefits from Oregano Oil2," Oregano oil has some anecdotal evidence for treating acne, athlete's foot, oily skin, dandruff, rosacea, warts, and insect bites., Depending on the concentration of the oregano oil you have purchased, you may need to mix the oil with different amounts of other oils before applying it to the skin.

, If you have full strength oregano oil, mix 1 drop of oregano oil with a single teaspoon of a mild, food-grade oil such as olive oil or coconut oil.


If you need enough oil to cover a larger skin area, maintain the 1 drop oregano and 1 teaspoon other oil ratio for the entire mixture.

, If your infection or problem persists and shows only mild improvement, up the application (of diluted oregano oil) to 2 or 3 times per day.


If there is no improvement after 2 weeks or if symptoms worsen, discontinue use of the oil and consult a health professional. The nature of your skin problem may not be able to be treated effectively by oregano oil.

"
Be aware of possible allergies.,
Do not use oregano oil for long-term treatment.,
Discontinue use immediately and seek medical help for certain reactions.",How to Get Health Benefits from Oregano Oil3," Because oregano is from the same family of plants as mint, thyme, basil, and sage, individuals with allergies to any of these herbs may experience a similar reaction to oregano.If you have a sensitivity to any member of this family of plants, proceed cautiously with oregano oil, starting with a single dose of very low concentration until you know how your body will react.

, Because oregano oil may interfere with iron absorption and can impact blood clotting, oregano oil should only be used for short-term treatments of targeted conditions.Oregano oil is not a recommended daily supplement, even for individuals who suffer from chronic bowel inflammation or long-term gastrointestinal problems, unless it has been prescribed by a health professional.

, If use of oregano oil induces vomiting, skin rashes, swelling, irritation, or difficulty breathing, consult a health professional. Even natural oils have significant medicinal properties and can cause serious health complications when administered incorrectly or to individuals with an intolerance for the plant’s compounds.

Opt for pumpkin seeds.,
Snack on sunflower seeds and Brazil nuts.,
Eat other nuts and seeds too.",How to Get Magnesium from Food2," Pumpkin and squash seeds are an incredibly good source of magnesium. A ¼ cup (60 mL) of any type of squash seed (without shells) contains a whopping 317 mg, effectively measuring up to daily dose for an adult female who isn’t pregnant., A ¼ cup (60 mL) of Brazil nuts without their shells will provide you 133 mg of magnesium. Similarly, the same amount of sunflower seeds without shells offers 119 mg. The same portion of sunflower seed butter, however, provides twice this amount! Generally, butters made with nuts are great sources of magnesium., Other nuts (all without their shells) can also be good sources of magnesium. A ¼ cup (60 mL) serving of almonds contains about 100 mg, whereas the same serving of cashews provides 90 mg. The same amount of pine nuts contains 70 – 86 mg. The same amount of cashew butter provides 168 mg.A comparable portion of peanuts provides 65 mg. Peanut butter, on the other hand, provides around 100 mg per ¼ cup (60 mL).
Flaxseeds and sesame seeds are especially good sources too. Just 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of flaxseeds provides 111 mg of magnesium, and the same amount of sesame seeds offer 56 – 68 mg.

Incorporate soy products into your diet.,
Eat more peas.,
Enjoy other beans too.",How to Get Magnesium from Food3," Edamame, or baby soybeans, are a good source of magnesium, offering 52 mg per ½ cup serving when cooked. Mature cooked soybeans offer a bit more magnesium, roughly 72mg in the same sized portion. Soy nuts (which are soybeans removed from their pods) are the best source, offering 99mg in only a ¼ (60 mL) cup serving.Cheese and yogurt imitations derived from soy are great sources. A 50 g (1.5 oz) portion of soy cheese provides 114 mg of magnesium, while ¾ cup of soy yogurt provides about 70 mg.
Drink soymilk (plain or vanilla) to get 61 mg of magnesium per cup.
Cooked tempeh, which is a fermented soy product, offers 116mg of magnesium in a ¾ cup (150 g) serving.
Tofu, another soy product, also contains magnesium. When prepared with magnesium chloride or calcium sulfate, it contains between 45 and 80 mg in a 3/4 cup (150 g) serving.

, Cooked black-eyed peas and cowpeas are other great sources of magnesium. A ¾ cup (175 mL) serving of either offers 121 mg. Cooked split peas or lentils offer 52 mg in the same sized portion., Many other types of cooked beans offer a decent amount of magnesium as well. A ¾ cup (175 mL) serving of cooked black, lima, navy, adzuki, white kidney, pinto, great northern, or cranberry beans all contain somewhere between 60 – 89 mg. Chickpeas fall within this range as well.Hummus is made from chickpeas, making it a great source of magnesium. Spread it on your sandwich or use it as a dip for veggies.


Baked beans, even cooked and canned with pork, offer 64 mg per ¾ cup (175 mL) serving.

Establish your recommended daily intake.,
Monitor young people’s magnesium intake too.,
Visit the USDA’s Nutrient Database.,
Understand magnesium's relationship to calcium.,
Watch out for magnesium deficiency.",How to Get Magnesium from Food4," You age and sex dictate how much magnesium you need to eat everyday. If you are pregnant, you’ll need extra. The amount needed for a male aged 19 – 30 is 400 mg per day. This is also the amount used to determine “percentage of daily value” information on food labels in the U.S. Women of the same age require 310 mg.Men over 30 require 420 mg, and women of this age require 320 mg.
Pregnant women younger than 30 years of age need 350 mg. If you’re pregnant and over 30, shoot for 360 mg of magnesium per day. These requirements do not apply to breastfeeding women.
Never take more than 350 mg of magnesium via daily supplements, as dangerous side effects my occur.

, Young people require different amounts of magnesium. Talk to your family doctor about making sure your baby gets the nutrients they need. Children will need increasingly greater amounts of magnesium.From one to three years old, kids need 80 mg.
From four to eight years old, 130 mg are necessary.
From nine to 13, make sure kids are getting 240 mg.
Sex begins to matter in the late teens, when 14 – 18 year old boys need 410 mg and girls of the same age need 360 mg.

, The U.S. Department of Agriculture hosts a nutrient database on its website that includes the nutritional content of almost any food you can imagine. You can search by nutrient content or by food name. For instance, search a certain food to find out how much magnesium it will provide you with, or search magnesium and see a list of foods broken down by category and listed in order of their magnesium content.You can access this database by visiting the following page: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/


, For your body to utilize calcium, you need magnesium as a cofactor. Therefore, if you are consuming a calcium supplement, calcium-fortified products and/or calcium rich-foods without meeting your magnesium daily needs, your body won’t be able to utilize calcium for its purposes., Magnesium deficiency is quite rare, but can lead to symptoms. In particular, take note of any hyperexcitability, muscle weakness, or sleepiness. Alcohol abuse, extensive burns, low amounts of calcium in the blood, medication use, and several other medical conditions may increase the likelihood of these symptoms.


On the flipside, it is unlikely that you will experience symptoms related to eating too much magnesium in your food. Your body will most likely excrete extra magnesium.
Prolonged lack of magnesium can lead to anorexia, apathy, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, muscle twitching, poor memory function, and reduced learning capacity. Heart complications may arise over time, and a severe lack of magnesium will lead to muscle contraction, delirium, numbness, hallucinations, and tingling sensations.

Try tempeh.",How to Get More Probiotics in Your Diet2," Kimchi is a Korean side dish made from fermented cabbage, cucumber, or radish. Sauerkraut is a popular condiment made with fermented cabbage.Fermented foods provide a good source of probiotics.


When cooking kimchi, add it later to the pan to avoid cooking away the bacteria.If you buy premade sauerkraut, check to make sure it hasn’t been pasteurized. The pasteurization process kills the bacteria.
You can eat one two to six ounce serving each day.

, Pickles are a good source of probiotics. But make sure you look at the label. Pickles that have been made using vinegar will not have any probiotics in them. Instead, look for pickles that have been made naturally, like with sea salt and water.Eat a natural pickle as a snack to incorporate some probiotics into your day.

, You can get a serving of probiotics from eating sourdough bread. This bread is also low on the glycemic-index, so it won’t spike your sugar like other breads.Instead of regular bread, use sourdough to make your daily sandwich.

, Miso is made from fermented ingredients, so it provides a good source of probiotics. You can add a tablespoon of miso to water for a tasty soup.Have a cup of miso soup for lunch of dinner to add some probiotics.

, Tempeh is made from fermented soybeans. It’s a vegetarian option you can use to replace meat in dishes. Because it is fermented, it provides a good source of probiotics.Use tempeh instead of meat in your pasta, stir fry, or salad.

Take a prebiotic supplement.,
Take a probiotic supplement.,
Eat prebiotic foods.",How to Get More Probiotics in Your Diet3," A prebiotic is a kind of soluble fiber which can be dissolved in water and is used by gut bacteria for fuel.Look for prebiotic supplements that contain inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These act as prebiotics, supporting the probiotics.You should also look for a “USP Verified” seal, which indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the veracity of the contents and found that the bacteria or other ingredients listed on the label are actually in the bottle.

, Probiotic-containing supplements can be taken to increase the numbers of beneficial gut bacteria. Get a controlled-release form. You want a form of probiotic that allows the capsule or tablet to dissolve after it has passed through the stomach, which is what controlled-release does. Check the expiration date. Make sure the supplement contains at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs).Make certain the probiotic contains many different strains of bacteria, but at least contains L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L, rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum.
Some products include a yeast, Saccharomyces, which functions very effectively to help protect the gut bacteria. This should be avoided if you have IBS, especially if you may have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth).

, Prebiotic foods are foods that support and essentially feed gut bacteria. Eat these prebiotic foods at least twice a day.Prebiotic foods include:Oatmeal
Red wine
Honey
Chicory root
Jerusalem artichokes

These vegetables support the growth of healthy bacteria. They contain substances that bacteria use to produce anti-inflammatory substances and, incidentally, may very well help prevent cancer.Eat kale, spinach, Swiss chard, and greens from mustard, collard, beet, and turnip plants. Also include broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower.
You can eat one to five cups of dark leafy greens. You can never eat too many dark leafy greens.

, Sources of fiber don’t provide bacteria, but fiber is essential for a healthy gut microbiome. Fiber in the diet performs a number of functions. It can help you increase the regularity of bowel movements, help remove metabolic and toxic wastes, and provides ful for the gut microbiome.A deficiency in fiber could starve gut bacteria and force them to look for fuel from other sources, such as the mucus lining of the gut.


High fiber foods include whole grains, vegetables, and fruit. Eat the rind of fruit, such as apples, plums, prunes, peaches, and nectarines.
20 to 35 grams of fiber a day is a reasonable goal. If you can take more, that is even better. Some people do better with more fiber, though more fiber can cause gas in some.

, Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower contain fiber, which helps aid in digestion.


Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower contain substances known as glucosinolates. The glucosinolates are sulfur-containing chemicals which, during digestion, breakdown to form indoles, nitriles, thiocyanates and isothiocyanates. Indole-3-carbinol and sulforaphane have been the most studied of these substances, and have been found to inhibit the growth of cancer of the bladder, breast, colon, liver, lung, and stomach in lab animals. We also know that people whose diets include these vegetables tend to have fewer cancers., Beans contain lots of fiber, but they also release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA strengthen and support gut bacteria.


The SCFA also support the lining of your gut and improve the absorption of many nutrients. They may also help with weight loss.

Identify the two different types of iron.,
Determine your recommended daily amount of iron.",How to Get Enough Iron on a Raw Food Diet1," First, there is haem iron, which is easier for the body to absorb and is found only in animal meat. The second type of iron is called non-haem iron; this type of iron is a little harder for the body to absorb and is found in other foods besides animal meat. This is why finding the right amount of iron on a raw food diet can be a concern. It is important to focus on how many total milligrams of iron is in the food you are consuming. Don’t only focus on the percentage of daily value written on nutrition labels.;
, Because the type of iron found in food other than meat is harder for the body to absorb, the recommended amount of iron needed for a person who does not eat meat is higher than that of a person who does consume meat.


Vegetarians and those who are on a raw food diet are recommended to take in 1.8 times more iron than people who are eating meat.
Women who have not started menopause are recommended to get 33 milligrams of iron per day.
Women who are post-menopause and all men are recommended to consume 14 milligrams of iron per day.
Children require different amounts of iron, depending on a few factors such as their age, gender, diet and overall health.

Decide if natural ingredients are better.,
Select between organic, natural, and vegan.,
Understand the claims for going natural or vegan.,
Think carefully about a manufactured brand.,
Look out for non-natural ingredients.",How to Get Clear Skin Fast and Naturally1," Natural beauty is an attractive option, but changing from your true and tried face cleansers, moisturizers, and face masks is not as simple as changing your pants. There are many factors that must be considered before switching to the “green” option.Despite the popularity of natural products, very few studies have been conducted on the impact of fruits and vegetables on human skin.
There are no federal regulations regarding natural skin products. It is better to check the packaging to determine what is inside the product if you buy it at the store.;
, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate the distinction between these terms. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), however, does provide an official seal for organic beauty products.Many natural beauty products originate from overseas. In that case, you should be familiar with ECOCERT (French) and BDIH (German) designations for natural cosmetics.
The USDA will certify organic beauty products that contain natural ingredients such as honey, berries, and other fruits as long as they are void of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and other inorganic substances.
Here are the four organic levels certifications of the USDA: 100% organic; organic (95% organic produced ingredients); made with organic ingredients (70% of organic ingredients); and less than 70% of organic ingredients. Only the top two levels will display an official seal from the USDA.

, The basic claim is that these ingredients did not come from animal products. Vegan also means that the product was not tested on animals, but that does not necessarily mean that vegan is organic. You should also be aware that the words “natural” and “all-natural” really have no certifiable evidence that they are because they are not regulated by the USDA or the FDA.If unsure, check the FDA website which contains food labeling requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Most prepared foods require labeling but nutrition labeling for raw produce and fish is voluntary.

, It is estimated that the average person applies ten different skin care products on their body each day. Most products are safe, but there are still ingredients you have to be aware of and their harmful effects. Few studies, however, have been conducted to discover long-term effects of placing so many creams and oils on the skin. Most are mild in small quantities while others, like phthalates, are linked to birth defects, infertility, sperm damage, and even feminization of male babies. Read the label!Downsize the amount of creams, toners, and moisturizers you have. Most products simply do not deliver the promises made on their labels. Instead, purchase one basic cleanser, toner, and moisturizer since there is little difference between them.
Beware of fragrances because they do not have to label the toxic chemicals that produce a product’s fragrance. This is where many of the toxic ingredients are located.

, There are hundreds of skin care products on the shelves claiming to be natural but, in reality, toxins still exist in many of them. Knowing what is extremely hazardous and what can and cannot cause serious illness will help you decide whether to continue purchasing your products at the store or begin to make many of the easy mixtures at home.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention found phthalates, a chemical plasticizer found in fragrances, to be a possible cause of birth defects.
The formaldehyde found in skin care products is a carcinogen that can cause nausea, coughing, asthma, and burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat.

Eat nuts to help reach your recommended daily amount of iron.,
Try taking an iron supplement to help you reach the recommended daily amount of iron.",How to Get Enough Iron on a Raw Food Diet2," If you love salads then you are probably already getting a lot of iron in your salad greens. A head of romaine lettuce is chock full of iron, and other greens such as spinach and parsley have good amounts of iron as well. Some individuals who are on raw food diets recommend making a smoothie out of your greens and getting much of your iron in this way. This is a delicious, easy and quick way to consume the iron that your body needs.

, There are certain vegetables that you can consume, which will make it easier to get all the iron you need.


Fennel and broccoli are very rich in iron, for example. These two vegetables can be easily incorporated into any dish. Broccoli is also beneficial to keep around as a snack and can be eaten often throughout the day.
Zucchini, also high in iron, is a versatile vegetable that can work well in a wide variety of meals. A popular way to eat zucchini when on a raw food diet is to shred it into spaghetti-like strands and top it with marinara sauce.

, Nuts are a very good source of many vitamins and nutrients that your body needs. In addition to being high in iron, they also contain a lot of protein and some have a lot of calcium as well.

Use a gentle cleanser.,
Dry excess oil and promote peeling.,
Use moisturizers.,
Avoid irritants.",How to Get Clear Skin Fast and Naturally2," If you want to avoid using prescription products, try washing your face twice a day with mild soap and warm water using your hands instead of a wash cloth.Avoid treating your skin with irritable products such as facial scrubs, masks, or other astringents that tend to worsen your skin condition.
Be careful not to excessively wash and scrub your face because it will irritate your skin.
If you have a breakout or rash, be careful when shaving since it will either make the area sore or worsen the breakout.
Use water as a natural toner because it will not strip your skin of oil. Most commercial toners use chemicals, fragrances, and preservatives that are harsh on your skin and strip it of oil causing the overproduction of skin oil as a reaction. Water, on the other hand, does not possess perfume, oils, or other unnecessary accessories. Be careful of tap water, however, as chlorine and limescale can cause irritability and dry, red, flaky skin.
Aloe vera is an excellent anti-inflammatory that will help seal in moisture.

, At the store, look for products that contain benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. Benzoyl peroxide, when applied to the skin, reduces the amount of acne-causing bacteria by drying the skin and making it peel.Besides benzoyl peroxide, look for products that have sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid because these ingredients prevent pores from becoming plugged, remove dead skin cells, and remove excess oils.
The FDA recommends caution using popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers, and soaps due to the possibility of causing skin reactions.
If you have sensitive skin, be aware that the possible side effects from using these products include dry skin, redness, scaling, and burning sensations.

, Moisturizers have many benefits for the skin, such as protection, improved skin tone and texture, treat dry skin, and cover up imperfections. Not all skin is the same, therefore, the moisturizer you choose will depend on if you have dry, oily, sensitive, or normal skin.Water-based moisturizers go with nearly all skin types because they typically contain light oils, silicone-derived ingredients, and leave a non-greasy feel to them after application.
Petroleum-based moisturizers offer longer protection and act as a sealant, keeping moisture from evaporating off of your skin.
For dry skin, consider a heavier, oil-based moisturizer that focus on hydration.
If you have acne or oily skin, use a water-based moisturizer that is classified as non-comedogenic because it won’t clog your pores.
Sensitive skin prone to irritation, redness, or rashes requires a more soothing moisturizer with chamomile or aloe and is void of fragrances and dyes. Acids should be avoided too.
As your skin matures it becomes dryer and less flexible. In this case, choose an oil-based moisturizer with a petrolatum foundation, antioxidants, and alpha hydroxyl acids to fight wrinkled skin.

, Maintain good hygiene and keep your hair, hands, and tight clothing off of your face. Be mindful of sweating and dress appropriately.You also want to avoid cosmetics, sunscreens, hair products, and acne concealers that are oily or greasy.

Carbohydrates – brown rice, quinoa, and squash – and proteins such as in pomegranates, Greek yogurt, and kidney beans, are also important for repairing and building muscle.

, Studies on water have shown increase blood flow to the surface of your skin, aiding the skin’s density and thickness. If the outer layer of skin, the epidermis, does not retain enough water it will lose elasticity and feel course.The signs of aging skin are minimized when you skin is hydrated by drinking 8-10 eight-ounce servings of water a day.
Despite the connection between water and a hydrated epidermis, there is no evidence that drinking excess water will increase the hydration of your skin.
Beyond water, avoid exposure to dry air, use a gentler skin cleanser, avoid products that contain alcohol, moisturize your skin after a shower, and use a humidifier to help you maintain hydrated skin.

, Green tea possesses an abundant amount of plant polyphenols and antioxidants that protect the skin against UV rays, accelerated aging of the skin, and loss of tissue elasticity.When drinking green tea, squeeze citrus juice into your tea. This provides better absorption of the antioxidants, keeping it in the body longer with lasting benefits.
Green tea is good for the eyes too. You can steep your tea for drinking and then squeeze the excess water from the tea bags. Chill green tea bags and then place them on your eyes for ten or fifteen minutes. The tannins inside the tea will constrict the skin and help reduce puffiness.
Apply green tea powder to your sunscreen. The benefits of green tea against sun damage are well-documented.
Not all studies agree with the impact green tea has on the skin when tested against the damage created by UV rays on inflammation, infection, or on cellular activity., There are few secrets when it comes to eating healthy with fruits and vegetables. A well-balanced diet is essential for a natural glowing and healthy appearance to your skin. Fruits and vegetables have an unending amount of good nutrients that will nourish your skin and prevent aging and wrinkles. Good nutrition, after all, is the foundation of healthy skin.

Yellow, green, and red bell peppers help reduce wrinkles around the eyes because of the boost in antioxidants they provide. Better store up on these yummy vegetables.
Carotenoid fruits and vegetables, like carrots, contain high amounts of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and antioxidants. Carrots benefit not only your skin but also your hair, teeth, and the digestive system.

, Antioxidants stabilize the free radicals responsible for causing damage to your skin and accelerating the aging process. Vitamins A and E found in pumpkins, sweet potatoes, carrots, and cantaloupes are high in antioxidants. In other words, eating a healthy diet will help you obtain all the necessary antioxidants your body needs.Although we often associate fruits and vegetables as sources of good antioxidants, spices and herbs are actually very effective. Choose a food, like Indian cuisine, that contains lots of turmeric, one of the best spices to consume.
Nutrients such as beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and selenium are good sources for antioxidants.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are excellent for strengthening your skin and are largely found in fish and nuts. These are good fats that promote the health of the cell membrane, which determines the ability of the cell to hold water, produce moisture, and help reduce wrinkles on the skin.Almonds (antioxidants, vitamin E); pecans (complex B vitamins); hazelnuts (magnesium, unsaturated fats, and vitamin E); and pistachios (vitamin E, oleic acid, and antioxidants) provide enough healthy nutrition that you no longer have to avoid the “nut tray” during holidays.
Omega-3 fatty acids are also involved in slowing down the skin’s aging process and impacts how the skin appears.

, Sugar spikes insulin levels which will induce inflammation, irritating and aging your skin. This inflammation breaks down collagen, a protein that aids in the appearance of supple skin, making your skin look dull, dry, and brittle.Although not completely conclusive, diets low on the glycemic index, a system that ranks the effect of blood-sugar levels from 1 to 100, may improve skin from acne.
Be aware of protein bars because they are a candy bar in disguise. The sugar from these bars gets into your bloodstream quickly, spiking insulin levels that will cause acne, wrinkles, and rashes.
Although fruits are high in sugar, they also have a high fiber content. Fruits are also anti-inflammatory and good for your skin.
Dark chocolate and cocoa protect the cardiovascular system, protects your brain, absorb important nutrients, and protection from sun damage to your skin. In this case, choose extra dark chocolate of at least 70 to 85% cocoa concentration.

Ask yourself if you're truly hungry.,
Meditate.,
Do a hard workout.,
Write up a list of things to do.",How to Feel Full Without Eating2," Sometimes when we're stressed, bored, depressed or angry, we may have feelings of hunger. But in fact, these are just strong emotions that may be triggering hunger-like signals.To figure out if you're experiencing real, physical hunger ask yourself:


When is the last time I ate? If it's been more than four to five hours, you might be physically hungry.
Is it close to a regular eating time?
Did I skip a meal today?
Am I experiencing typical hunger signals? These include: empty or pit feeling, stomach growling, or stomach pangs.

, Having some zen time is another effective way to curb food cravings. Taking deep breaths from your belly area will fill your stomach with air and can calm you down.

Get adequate sleep.,
Don't skip meals.,
Eat whole and satiating foods.",How to Feel Full Without Eating3," It's recommended adults get at least seven to nine hours sleep each night. When you're behind on sleep, your body produces more ghrelin — your body's hunger hormone. Higher levels of ghrelin make you feel hungrier throughout the day. Studies show that a body that is sleep deprived craves more carbohydrates.


Go to bed earlier or wake up later if possible so that you can get in the recommended amount of sleep.
Also shut off all lights, electronics and any other devices that give off light or make sounds. Even small distractions can prevent you from falling asleep or staying asleep.

, If you’re trying to feel full without eating in order to lose weight, it’s still important to make sure that you’re eating regular, consistent meals. This will not only help your body more effectively lose weight, but also ensure you are getting the proper nutrients to stay healthy.


Studies have shown that skipping meals may increase your hunger levels over the day and could cause you to overeat.Plan to have at least three meals daily. If there is more than four to five hours between meals, you may need a snack in addition to your meals.

, Your food choices also affect how full you feel. By choosing to eat whole foods (like fruits, vegetables or whole grains) that will stabilize your blood sugar and not digest quickly, you will feel fuller longer after meals.High water, high fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables will also help you feel fuller longer because they add bulk to your meal.For example, you could have one cup of raspberries or one cup of cooked whole wheat spaghetti for extra fiber.Hearty soups and stews are a good option because they’re often high in water, protein, and fiber content. Add ingredients such as vegetables, beans, and herbs to help yourself feel fuller for longer. For example, beans such as and lentils are high in fiber, while vegetables including split peas are another high-fiber option.

Include lean protein at each meal.,
Bulk up your meals with two to three servings of a fruit or vegetable.,
Add in a serving of whole grains.,
Drink water before each meal.",How to Feel Full Longer1," Before you even start a meal, one way to make you feel more satisfied and stay satisfied may be by regulating the speed at which you eat. Some studies show that slower you eat, the more satisfied you'll feel.It's recommended to take about 20 – 30 minutes to eat each meal. This slow pace may help your brain register being satisfied with your meal. In addition, it helps force you to pay attention to what you are eating and get more mental pleasure from it.Time yourself at each meal for a couple days to get an understanding of how long you normally eat, and let that motivate you to slow down in the future. Try taking a sip of water between bites, putting your fork down in between bites, and talking to others to slow yourself down.;
, Protein is an essential nutrient to your diet. It not only helps fuel your metabolism, but can also help you feel more satisfied with your meals.A higher protein diet has been shown in many studies, to be helpful in managing hunger and increasing your overall satiation after your meal. It can take 15 to 20 minutes after food is eaten for the satiety signals to reach the brain. Foods high in protein seem to register satiety faster than carbohydrates and fat.
Aim for at least one serving of protein at most meals. One serving is about 3 – 4 oz or about the size of your palm.Try using a food scale to help keep you on track if needed.
There are many different sources of protein. Try to stick to leaner protein as this is lower in calories. Even if you're not trying to lose weight, eating larger quantities of higher fat protein can cause weight gain due to a higher calorie level.
Proteins to try include: beans and pulses, poultry, eggs, lean beef, fish, low-fat dairy products and tofu.

, Fruits and vegetables are great food groups to add bulk to your meals to help keep you feeling satisfied longer throughout the day.

They're high in fiber, water, and air content. Fiber and high water content help add physical bulk to your meals (without too many calories) and air can help you feel more physically full.Studies have shown that higher fiber diets help you feel more satisfied for longer.Bulking up meals with fruits and vegetables is an easy way to get your 25-38 g of fiber (the recommendations for women and men respectively) each day.Include at least two to three servings of fruits and vegetables at each meal, or try to make half your plate half fruits or vegetables. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens or about 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., Like fruits and vegetables, whole grains are another great source of extra fiber. This delicious food group is an easy way to add fiber to meals and will help you stay satisfied longer.


Whole grain foods are minimally processed and include all parts of the grain. This makes it higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.Processed or refined grains on the other hand, do not have the fiber containing part of the grain. This makes them less fibrous and less nutrient dense overall.
Include one serving of grains at your meals. Measure out 1/2 cup or 1 oz per serving.Whole grain foods to try include: whole grain oats, quinoa, brown rice, farro, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread or millet.

Many times we feel hungry when in fact we're only thirsty.Aim to drink at least 64 oz (about 2 liters) or about eight glasses of water or other calorie-free, hydrating beverages daily. You may even need up to 13 glasses!Stick to fluids like: water, flavored water, sparkling water or decaf coffee and tea.

Always eat three meals daily.,
Plan for a snack or two.",How to Feel Full Longer2," If you're fighting hunger throughout the day and are looking for ways to stay satisfied longer, you need to be able to differentiate between true physical hunger and hunger due to psychological or emotional reasons.

, Another way to manage your overall hunger throughout the day is by planning on having a scheduled snack or two during the day.


A snack is a great idea to help tie your appetite over until your next planned meal. If you go too long between meals, you may get overly hungry and over eat later on.
Plan to have a snack if two meals are more than four to five hours apart. For example, if you finish lunch at 12:30 and dinner isn't until 7:30 pm, there's a good chance you'll be very hungry or starving at dinner without a snack.
Snacks, like meals, should contain protein and fiber to help give you a boost of energy and satiating calories. Try: carrots and hummus, two hard boiled eggs, whole wheat pita crackers and cheese, yogurt and fruit or celery and peanut butter.

Spice up your meals.,
Chew some gum.,
Eat off a blue plate.",How to Feel Full Longer3," One way to help curb hunger throughout the day and trick your brain into feeling less hungry is by sipping on some hot mint tea or sugar-free mint candies.


Mint has been shown to be an appetite suppressant. Including mint tea during the day or mint candies, can help decrease appetite.This is especially good to do right after you've completed your meal or snack. Not only does it curb appetite, but minty flavors help signal the brain that it is the end of the meal., Another neat trick to get you feeling more satisfied is by adding some spice to your meals.

Earn your high school diploma, or equivalent level of education, like a GED.,
Develop basic math skills.,
Develop strong communication and people skills.,
Look for open positions at a pharmacy.,
Prepare your resume and cover letter.,
Apply for pharmacy assistant positions.",How to Get a Job at a Pharmacy1," A pharmacy assistant, also known as pharmacy aide, organizes medications, deals with customers, and oversees the day to day business of a pharmacy. Pharmacy assistants do not have the credentials to be a pharmacist and need very little formal education. As an aide, you can accept orders, package prescriptions, and prepare prescription labels. But you cannot work directly with medications.As of 2013, the median salary for pharmacy assistants was $22,580, or an hourly rate of $11-$14.;
, Many pharmacy assistants are trained on the job. The main qualifications for the position, besides a high school diploma, are good people skills, good communication skills, and good organizational skills.

, As an assistant pharmacist, you will need to have basic math skills to count out dosages and run a cash register., Some employers favor applicants with training or experience in customer service, retail, or administration.


Previous customer service is a big asset for this position, as you will be working directly with patients to give them their prescriptions.

, Look online for job postings at pharmacies in your area. Go into your local pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist about a possible position or references to other positions available in the area.You will need to be at least 18 years of age to work at a pharmacy. Employment for pharmacy aides is growing every year, as pharmacies are always looking for capable, efficient assistants who work well with people.
Job opportunities for pharmacy technicians, who are trained to assist pharmacists in dispensing medications, are also growing rapidly every year. So you may decide you want to pursue a formal technician training program and become a pharmacy technician.

, When drafting your resume and cover letter, its important that you highlight your math skills and your communication skills. You should also indicate that you enjoy working with people and providing excellent customer service.

Bring them food.,
Engage semi-independent autistic people in cooking together.,
Have them take a break from hyperfocus.,
Create a schedule.,
Offer food that your loved one enjoys.,
Keep an eye on media exposure (especially for girls).,
Feed a very resistant person in front of a screen.",How to Get an Autistic Person to Eat1," The quickest answer to executive dysfunction is to simply initiate and complete the task yourself. Ask them what they want, make it, and guide them to the table to eat it.


Don't expect them to have an ""age-appropriate"" level of cooking skills. Executive dysfunction and motor skill impairments may make it difficult or impossible for autistic teens and adults to prepare their own food.;
, Initiate the task yourself, and get them to join in. Maybe you get out the ingredients while they make their sandwich. Talk them through the steps and help with difficult parts as needed.


Only do this if they are comfortable with it. If their sensory issues are acting up, moving around in a kitchen with another person may be too much.
Dyspraxia may make a task more difficult if they are ""overthinking"" it.See if it helps to slightly distract them as they work by talking or singing together.

, Autistic people have incredible powers of focus, and can concentrate on a task for a remarkably long time. The downside to this skill is that it can interfere with proper eating. Force them to break focus for long enough to get food.


Set alarms or other reminders, and see if they work.
Install a program on their computer to make it go to sleep at a certain time (for example, from 12:00 to 12:30). During this time, they will be forced to stop what they are doing, and they can go get food.

, If an autistic person eats at the same time every day, then they are more likely to remember to eat. Try giving them reminders, or setting up on their laptop or phone an alarm to remind them to eat.

, If they like the food in front of them, they're more likely to start eating, and to eat more. Take note of the foods that the autistic person enjoys, and try to make them easy to access.


If you are making something they might not like, offer something they like on the side. Even if they barely touch the cod, they can fill their plate with broccoli and potatoes.

, Magazines, movies, and TV may suggest that they need to be thin and that it is normal to restrict one's diet.


Encourage books and shows that feature characters with diverse body types.
Try introducing them to feminism and body positivity.

, If nothing else works, set a controlled portion of food in front of them as they are watching TV, reading, or surfing the internet. While they are distracted, they may reach for the food without thinking much, and start eating.


Because they are not thinking, controlled portions are important. If you give them an entire bag of chips, they may eat more than is healthy for them, without realizing it.

Get your high school diploma.,
Enroll in a pharmacy technician program.,
Look into pharmacy technician training programs.,
Pass the PTCE exam.,
Become certified.,
Look for a position as a pharmacy technician.",How to Get a Job at a Pharmacy2," Pharmacy technicians assist pharmacists with dispensing medication and other health care products to patients.You will need to count and measure medication and manage the inventory of the pharmacy. You will also need to complete pharmaceutical dosage forms on a full or part time basis.
As of 2012, the median annual wage for pharmacy technicians was $29,320. Employment of pharmacy technicians is projected to grow 20 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than average for most occupations., To pursue a career as a pharmacy technician, you will need to have a high school diploma or equivalent level of education.

, Make sure the program is at an accredited vocational/technical college or online program. This program will prepare you for the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board exam or the PTCE.Many colleges and websites offer online pharmacy technician programs. This will allow you to keep your current job and study at your own pace.
During the training program, you will learn the names of drugs and their uses, how to dispense medications and how to determine correct dosages.
You may also learn customer service skills, record keeping skills, and ethics.

, If you decide not to enroll in a training program through a college, you can enroll in a program offered by a pharmacy. If you go for this option, you will be trained with the exact skills needed to be an employee of the pharmacy that is doing your training.You will need to be at least 18 years of age to become a pharmacy technician.
Check that the training program at the pharmacy is designed to prepare you for the PTCE exam.
PTCE certification will be required if you want to work at another pharmacy in the future.

, Most states and countries require all technicians to pass the PTCE exam. It is a computer based multiple choice exam that contains 90 questions, 80 scored questions and 10 unscored questions. About 1 hour and 50 minutes are allotted for the exam.The PTCE was developed by experts in the pharmacy technician practice and asks questions on pharmacy laws and regulations, medication safety, and pharmacy inventory management, among other topics. There are several practice tests available online to prepare you for the actual exam.You can also complete PTCE practice questions to give you a sense of what to expect from the exam., The following requirements must be met to be a certified Pharmacy Technician (additional requirements may apply according to state):A high school diploma or equivalent educational diploma like a GED or foreign diploma.

Understand what a pharmacist does.,
Graduate from high school.,
Get your Bachelors of Science (BS) degree.,
Take the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT).,
Obtain a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D) degree from an accredited pharmacy school.,
Get your pharmacist license.,
Look for a pharmacist position.",How to Get a Job at a Pharmacy3," A pharmacist dispenses prescription medication to patients and offer expertise in the safe use of prescriptions. They also provide advice on how to lead a healthy lifestyle, conduct health and wellness screenings, provide immunizations, and oversee the medications given to patients.Many pharmacists work in community pharmacies in drug stores or grocery stores. But they can also work in hospitals and clinics.
Becoming a pharmacist takes years of education and training. Aspiring pharmacists can spend between six years (fast-track) to thirteen years completing pre-requisites, Pharm.D coursework, clinical rotations, and exams. So be prepared to devote a lot of time, effort, and energy into this career.As of 2012, the median annual wage for pharmacists was $116,000., While in high school, focus on science courses like biology, chemistry, and physiology. Notice how you perform in these subjects. It helps to be strong in these subjects if you want to become a pharmacist.


You can also get your GED or equivalent educational degree.

, Your Bachelor of Science degree must come from a four-year program. During your bachelor’s degree, you will need to complete at least two years of pre-pharmacy coursework, including anatomy, biology, calculus, chemistry, physics, and sociology.Look for schools that offer a pre-pharmacy program. If you are currently an undergraduate student, talk to your guidance counselor about possible pre-pharmacy programs in your state or country. Pre-pharmacy programs prepares you for admission into a pharmacy program. The focus in these programs is boasting your grades in math, biology, and chemistry.
Getting good grades in a pre-pharmacy can help you get into a better pharmacy program.
There are databases of pre-pharmacy schools where you can filter them by state, annual tuition costs, and college type (public or private).It may also be helpful to do an online search of the pre-pharmacy programs you are looking at applying to, and reading any forum posts by previous or current students in that program., This test is a requirement for admission to most pharmacy schools. It measures your overall academic ability and your scientific knowledge.You can prepare for the test by studying the PCAT handbook and guidelines. You can also take a PCAT preparatory class or hire a private tutor to help you study.
Not all pharmacy schools require you to take the PCAT. But more than 75 percent of all pharmacy programs require applicants to submit scores for the PCAT.Check with the schools you plan to apply to and note if the PCAT is listed in their admission requirements.
The minimum PCAT scores will vary from institution to institution. Check the requirements of the institution to determine the PCAT score needed to apply., These programs usually take four years to complete. Once accepted into a Pharm.D program, you will study subjects like pharmacology and medical ethics in the classroom. You will also complete supervised internships in hospitals and retail pharmacies.If you have a busy schedule or a current career, you can take pharmacy school online.A list of the top pharmacy schools in the U.S., as of 2012, can be found here: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/pharmacy-rankings. The top five schools were University of California - San Francisco, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, University of Minnesota, University of Texas - Austin, and University of Kentucky.
Your first year in the Pharm.D program focuses on the fundamentals of the trade. You will learn about reading and using dosage forms, pharmacy law and ethics and patient counseling.
The second and third years focus on advanced principles like institutional pharmacy, pharmacotherapy and health management. You will also home in on a pharmaceutical speciality and think about where you would like to work after graduation and exams.
Year four is all about practice experience. You will perform clinical rotations to put your knowledge and experience to use. This includes interacting with patients, recommending medications, and guiding administrative staff to better support customers and the community.

, To get your license, you will need to pass the North American Pharmacist Licensing Exam (NAPLEX). NAPLEX is an 185 question test that measures your knowledge of practice of pharmacy, from distributing medications safely to educating your patients on optimal health care.In some states, students must pass a Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE).
Graduates of pharmacy schools not in the U.S. or outlying territories must pass the Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Examination Committee (FPGEC) Certification.
If you fail the NAPLEX, or one of the other required exams, you can apply to retake it. However, some states have a limit on the number of times you can retake a test or other requirements. For example, in California, if you fail the California Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination four times, you’ll need to complete additional educational training before taking the test again.

, There is ongoing demand for pharmacy services throughout the U.S. and other countries. This is due to the increasing number of prescriptions filled each year, and the increased number of medications available on the market. There is also an increased demand for patient services, as pharmacists can work in a wide array of settings and positions. As well, as the elderly population goes up, so does the demand for pharmacists.The demand for pharmacists is going up in settings like hospitals and clinics, so look for positions in these settings. Talk to your professors in your Pharm.D program and don’t be afraid to network among your colleagues and recent graduates of your program.
With higher demand for pharmacists, the competition for good pharmacy positions has also increased. Students who complete a residency program may improve their job prospects.
Certification from the Board of Pharmacy Specialties also looks good to potential employers."

Keep easy-to-access snacks around the house.,
Help them identify their feelings.,
Give them time to think about their hunger.,
Praise them for taking initiative.",How to Get an Autistic Person to Eat2," If food is easy to get, they are more likely to be able to take the initiative to eat. Here are some snacks that take very little effort to grab:


String cheese
Bowls of nuts or chopped fruit
Granola bars
Pudding, applesauce, or yogurt
Trail mix

, Many autistic people experience alexithymia, and have trouble understanding how they feel. Help them label their emotions, and connect physical and behavioral symptoms to feelings. For example:


""Your forehead is all crinkled and you look stressed. Are you hungry, or is it something else?""
""You're holding your stomach. Usually that means you're hungry. Do you want something to eat?""

, It may take them several seconds to consciously evaluate what is going on with their stomach. Use patience while they think, and let them change their answers if their automatic answer is different from how they're actually feeling.


Try asking them to rate their hunger to encourage them to think about it.

, When you notice that your loved one has successfully fed themselves, remark on it. Tell them what a good job they did, and how happy you are for them. They're more likely to do it again if they think it makes you proud.

Give yourself (and your loved one) a break.,
Don't turn the dinner table into a battleground.,
Encourage stimming at the dinner table.,
Offer options for sensory overload.,
Engage in fun conversation.",How to Get an Autistic Person to Eat3," You don't have to be a ""warrior parent"" or caregiver, nor do you need to toss and turn at night because the autistic person won't eat carrots. It's okay if their diet isn't perfect. You aren't a bad caregiver.It's okay if the autistic person isn't eating the same foods that their neurotypical peers eat. They're autistic. That makes them different. You haven't failed as a parent or caregiver.
Try offering gummy vitamins for nutrition to take off some of the pressure.

, For an autistic person, eating food with onions may feel as pleasant as chewing on a raw lemon.If an autistic person cannot handle the food, let them avoid eating it.


It's okay to encourage them to try new foods and offer options. There is a differing between giving them something to try and pushing them to eat something they can't handle.
Have them help you with the grocery list so you buy foods they can tolerate.

, If bouncing on an exercise ball or fiddling with a tangle toy is what allows them to sit calmly, then they should use it.


Suggest that the autistic person grab a stim toy from their bin before coming to the table.
Talk about cleanliness and personal space (e.g. not whacking people in the face) as necessary.

, A busy room with talking and food smells may cause overload in some autistic people. Encourage them to self-monitor and tell you if they need to eat in a room by themselves.


Immediately paying attention and respecting their decision will make them more likely to talk to you when they need to leave.
Notice if they are looking stressed, so you can ask if they need to leave. Sometimes autistic people have difficulty identifying how they feel.

, Talk about your day, silly things, your plans, their special interests, etc. Take time to ask them about their thoughts and listen to their responses. Turning mealtimes into quality time together will help them look forward to it.


Try playing games. For example, tell them how many bites to eat and say you will eat more bites than them. Encourage them and tell them that they'll finish before you. If they do, reward them with playing another game with them, hugging them, or even giving them a high five. They will learn that they will get rewarded when they win or do something correctly.

Read the food labels.,
Select minimally processed fruits and vegetables.,
Choose 100% whole grains with few additives.,
Go for minimally processed meats.,
Choose dairy products without added sugar.,

Limit sweetened beverages.,
Minimize highly processed sweet treats.,
Eat minimal amounts of fried and fast foods.,
Avoid processed meats.,
Skip the frozen and canned meals.",How to Find Healthy Processed Foods," Whether you're trying to stay away from processed foods or choose more nutritious processed foods, the first place you'll want to look is the nutrition label. This is where you're going to get the ""real story"" of the foods you're eating.


The first thing you need to look at is the serving size. This will determine exactly how many calories or how much sugar is in an individual food.Without this, you cannot make sense of the rest of the information.
After the serving size, check out the total amount of fat in the product. Unhealthier processed foods may be especially high in saturated fats or trans fats — avoid these.Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, however, are essential to good nutrition and can be consumed in moderation.
Another part to look at is the total amount of sodium. Many processed foods are especially high in sodium. Anything under 200 mg of sodium per serving is considered ""low-sodium"" and is OK to eat.Look at the total amount of sugar. There's not necessarily a limit here, however note that you will not be able to tell whether or not there are added sugars or natural sugar.You'll need to look at the ingredient list to determine if there are added sugars.
Also check on the ingredient list. This will tell you whether or not there are any added sugars, preservatives or other additives. Additives to look out for and avoid include: Partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats), propyl gallate, MSG, sodium acid, sodium benzoate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, high-fructose corn syrup, antioxidant preservatives (BHT and BHA), food coloring (except natural substances like beta-carotene and carmine), and potassium bromate.;
, You can find minimally processed and heavily processed fruits and vegetables. Choose items that are minimally processed without additives for the healthiest choice.


Pre-washed or pre-cut fresh fruits and vegetables found in the produce section are still processed (they're washed and cut which counts as processing); however, few (if any) other ingredients are added to these items.Try bagged lettuce, bagged and cut vegetables or pre-sliced fruits.
Slightly more processed version of fruits and vegetables are frozen items. Many times these are only blanched or cooked and then flash frozen. Look for items that come without added sauces, gravies, sugar, seasonings or salt for the most nutritious choice.Both canned fruits and vegetables are probably the most processed versions of these otherwise nutritious foods. Choose canned items without added salt or look for items labeled as ""no salt added"" in addition to fruits canned in water or their own juice., 100% whole grains are a great food group to add to your diet. They're typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients and considerably less processed than refined grains.Be choosy with the whole grains you do purchase to avoid highly processed items.


Look for uncooked or raw grains without added seasonings. For example, many grains, even whole grains, come with added flavorings and seasonings if they are a mix — like cajun brown rice or herbed couscous. If your grains come with a seasoning packet that's separate, toss it and add your own seasonings at home instead.
Some whole grains come par or pre-cooked (like microwave in a bowl brown rice). Although these nutritious grains have gone through a higher amount of processing — mostly just cooking — they're still a nutritious version of a processed food.
If you're purchasing breads, one of the great choices is to buy it from the bakery section of your grocery store. Loaves are generally baked fresh and are minimally processed.
You may also want to try sprouted breads, tortillas or English muffins which are typically found in the refrigerated or freezer sections. They have minimal additives and actually need to be kept frozen so they do not spoil., Meats and seafood can range widely in the amount of processing they undergo. Generally, the more processed they are, the less nutritious they are as well. Be smart when you're purchasing your proteins.


The best type of meat or seafood to buy are those that are raw or frozen without any seasonings or flavors. Also read the packaging label as many raw or frozen items may have some additives to help improve color, freshness or moisture. These are safe, but may be something you want to avoid.There are also canned versions of chicken, tuna, salmon and other protein sources. These are generally cooked but are canned with very minimal additives. These are a convenient and nutritious processed version of proteins.

, The dairy food group contains many nutritious foods that contain high amounts of protein, calcium and vitamin D.Make sure to choose the least processed items here.


In general, items like plain milk, cottage cheese and cheese are minimally processed and contain very little additives.
If you're choosing yogurts, choose plain for the least processed. The plain flavors of both greek and regular yogurt do not contain added sugars or flavorings. Purchase the plain and add your own fruit or sweetener at home.
Non-dairy alternatives are a great for those who do not want to have or cannot have dairy products. These come with the tradeoff of being slightly more processed in order to mimic the flavor and texture of regular dairy foods;however, you can easily make your own almond milk, rice milk, or oat milk at home so you have complete control over the contents.

, It's hard to purchase condiments, salad dressings, marinades or sauces without multiple ingredients. Sometimes these foods have many ingredients and are still a nutritious choice.


Choose low-sugar or ""all natural"" ketchup. These have lower amounts of sugar, salt and have minimal additives.
Instead of low fat or fat free mayonnaise, choose the mayonnaise with olive oil for a less processed version of this creamy condiment.
You may also want to consider purchasing salad dressings made from yogurt for a lower calorie, but less processed version of creamy dressings.
Look for salsa or tomato sauce with little added sugars and sodium for the best bet.

, If you're busy and on the run, purchasing some pre-washed and cut fruits and vegetables can make getting your five to nine servings of these nutrient-dense foods a lot easier.Buy pre-washed lettuces and salad mixes. These allow you to get a quick side dish or main course on the table quickly. Plus, you can also make quick lunches by tossing a few handfuls of bagged lettuce with your favorite protein in a tupperware for a nutritious, packed lunch.
Consider purchasing pre-cut and trimmed vegetables like bagged broccoli florets, cauliflower florets or baby zucchinis. Sometimes you can even microwave to steam these in the bag for a very quick and easy clean up side dish.
Pre-cut apple slices or cut up fresh fruit can make a quick side to a packed lunch or a great and easy topper for your morning yogurt or oatmeal.

, Overly processed proteins like bacon, sausage or deli meat are not a great choice as they are too processed. Make healthy meals by trying the following:


Purchase pre-grilled chicken breasts or chicken breast strips from the refrigerated section. These are minimally processed and great to top a salad with or toss with whole wheat pasta.
Stock up on canned tuna or salmon to make your own homemade tuna salad or to flake over a spinach salad for lunch.
Purchase individually frozen chicken breasts or fish filets. Take one or as many as you'd like out the night before for an easy, portion-controlled protein source at dinner.

, Grains can be a pain to cook. Some take 20 – 30 minutes to cook which you might not have time for in your busy schedule. Choose nutritious processed grains like these to make meals quick:


Purchase microwaveable grains or pre-cooked grains like brown rice, quinoa or couscous from the store. They are pre-cooked and more processed, but minimally so. They just require a quick reheat and you'll have a high-fiber side in a flash.
Also consider purchasing frozen, pre-cooked grains. Many grocery stores offer pre-cooked brown rice, quinoa or wild rice mixes in their frozen sections. Again, they are more processed, but not in a negative way. A quick microwave and you have your whole grain side dish done quickly.

, Although all dairy foods are a little processed, they offer a lot of health benefits. They're a great source of protein, calcium, Vitamin D and potassium.Choose nutritious sources of processed dairy like these:


Cottage cheese. This is a very high protein food that can serve as a quick breakfast or lunch. Top with some fruit for a balanced meal.
Yogurt. Try going for plain varieties since they don't have the added sugar of the ""fruited flavors."" Top with sliced whole fruits, nuts and seeds for a balanced meal.
Cheese. This is another processed dairy food, but adds great flavor and some protein to meals. Serve yourself an ounce per meal to stick to appropriate portion sizes., A common source of extra calories and sugar are sweetened beverages. In the ""drink world,"" sweetened beverages are some of the most processed.Limit drinks like sodas — even diet or ""zero"" sodas. They're either high in sugar or artificial sweeteners and many coloring agents and other preservatives.
Also try to minimize your intake of fruit juice. Only drink 100% juice, but this is still a source of liquid calories and should be minimized.
Don't forget about sweetened coffee drinks and teas from your local coffee shop. These are very processed and another big source of sugar.

, When you get a sweet craving, many people will go for an overly processed sweet treat. Like sweetened beverages, these contain high amounts of sugar and calories.Avoid items like ice creams, cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, and doughnuts. These are all very processed and contain high amounts of sugars and calories.
Also don't get fooled by frozen yogurt shops. Many offer sugar-free and fat-free options. But remember, when they remove the sugar and fat they're adding more artificial sweeteners and other additives to replace the palate pleasing sugar and fat.

, Outside of sweets, one of the biggest groups of processed foods that are eaten are fried and fast foods. Not only are these foods one of the most processed, they are also some of the most unhealthy foods.


Both fried foods and fast foods contain many, many additives and are especially high in calories and fats (like trans fat).Skip foods that are deep fried and go for something that's grilled, steamed or baked instead.
If you're stopping at a fast food restaurant, be careful as many of the foods offered will be processed. Stick to simple items like salads, grilled chicken sandwiches or soups.

, Like fried and fast foods, processed meats are generally ranked as some of the most unhealthy versions of processed foods. Make sure to avoid this type of processed protein.


Processed meats have been linked to a variety of adverse health effects like heart disease and cancer.Skip over items like bacon, sausage, deli meat, hot dogs, salami, and canned meat spreads. These are some of the most processed foods that you can purchase.
Also consider skipping over more ""natural"" or ""healthy"" processed meats. Sometimes turkey sausage or turkey bacon may seem like a better choice, however they are sometimes higher in sodium and calories than regular bacon or sausage., Another category of foods that are notoriously overly processed and high in sodium are both frozen and canned meals.Avoid these items as well.


Although some frozen meals are obviously not the healthiest choice, there are some frozen meals that are marketed as ""healthy"" or ""low calorie."" These are generally incredibly high in sodium, although low in calorie.Canned meals like ravioli, spaghetti and even soups are also highly processed and full of additives, calories and sodium. Avoid these at all costs as well.

Try grilled vegetables.",How to Feed Vegetables to Picky Eaters," Crunchy, crispy, salty french fries are one of the tastiest foods out there and kids generally love them. Try swapping in a more nutrient dense vegetable (like a sweet potato). You'll be able to enjoy a serving of vegetables without feeling like you're eating a bland, boring or bitter item.


An easy swap for a french fry is using sweet potatoes instead of the regular white potatoes. These orange spuds have way more Vitamin C and a whole day's worth of Vitamin A.You can also try making zucchini or summer squash fries as well. Both of these vegetables are really low in calories, but also have Vitamin C.You can also try making butternut squash fries, asparagus fries, avocado fries or even green bean fries.
You can dip them in a batter or dredge and and fry them in a little oil or bake them in the oven.;
, Another fun way to get a few extra servings of vegetables into your diet is by making vegetable spaghetti. Try using a spiralizer to help you make some nutritious noodles for a kid-friendly twist on pasta.


A spiralizer is a kitchen tool that turns a variety of vegetables or fruits into noodle shapes. Depending on which spiralizer you get, you can make spaghetti noodles, fettuccine noodles or even ""curly fry"" sized noodles.
Use a spiralizer to make noodles out of vegetables like zucchini, summer squash, carrots or even cucumbers. It looks like spaghetti, but its all veggies.Depending on your taste, you can try topping lightly cooked veggie spaghetti with sauce. Or you can try mixing half vegetable spaghetti with half regular spaghetti together.
Also try using spaghetti squash instead of pasta. This neat squash, when cooked, shreds like little spaghetti noodles and contains Vitamin A, C and Iron.Top with olive oil and Parmesan cheese or with your favorite pasta sauce.

, One way to make veggies a little more appetizing for children is serving them with a dip. Bland or boring vegetables get a little kick of flavor and children will enjoy getting to dunk their veggies in dip.


Serve cut up raw vegetables with your favorite salad dressing or dip. If you're not a fan of totally raw vegetables, you can try blanching them quickly to help make them a little softer and less crunchy.
If you want a vegetable that doesn't have a strong flavor, try cut up celery, cucumbers or cauliflower. These are fairly bland. Sliced peppers or snap peas have a sweeter and less bitter taste.

, Like french fries, potato chips are a great salty snack that kids love. Instead of using white potatoes, try making homemade veggie chips instead.


Swap out your regular white potato, for a more colorful set of vegetables like: sweet potatoes, purple potatoes, gold and red beats, sliced carrots or even kale.Toss thinly sliced vegetables in olive oil and your favorite seasonings. Bake until they're golden brown and crispy.
Many store brand ""veggie chips"" don't really have very many (if any) vegetables in their ingredients.Make your own out of real vegetables for the best bet.

, One fairly plain and flavorless vegetable out there is lettuce - especially iceberg lettuce. Swap out your child's sandwich bread or wrap in favor of a lettuce wrap.


By swapping out your favorite sandwich bread in favor of a wrap, you're automatically cutting out calories and carbohydrates from your meal.
There are a variety of different lettuces that you can use as a wrap. Some lettuces, like iceberg, do not have many nutritional benefits outside of being very low calorie.However, you can try using kale leaves or Swiss chard leaves for a low calorie and Vitamin A and C packed wrap., Not only are baby vegetables more cute and fun to eat, they may taste better too. Stick to these little vegetables if your child is more sensitive to many flavors of more mature vegetables.


When a vegetable is allowed to mature and grow to it's full size, the flavors of that vegetable intensify and become more significant (and can also be more bitter).This can make vegetable unappealing at times.
Baby vegetables are picked when they are younger. They have very little bitter flavor and actually taste more sweet. Most people are able to tolerate vegetables that have a slightly sweeter taste to them.Baby vegetables can be easily found. Look for baby zucchini, carrots, artichokes and turnips.

, In addition to making vegetables more appealing in general, try to sneak them into your child's breakfast foods so they aren't even aware that they're there!


Oatmeal is a great breakfast meal to disguise some hidden vegetables. Mix oatmeal with canned pumpkin for a a slightly sweet fall-inspired breakfast. Pumpkin has large amounts of Vitamin A, Vitamin C and fiber.Make green eggs and ham. Puree a little bit of frozen spinach into scrambled eggs to make a real life version of green eggs (serve with some Canadian bacon or ham). Spinach has also has a lot Vitamin A and folate.You can also try smearing your favorite toast with a 1/2 of avocado. This creamy vegetable tastes great with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Plus, it has a significant amount of fiber and heart healthy fats., A great way for picky eaters to get more vegetables is by pureeing them into their favorite savory dishes. Pureeing helps disguise them visually and hides their flavor.


Meatballs, burgers and meatloaf are a great place to hide pureed vegetables. You can add pureed spinach, peppers, onions and even zucchini into the meat mixture of these items.
Mac and cheese or lasagna are great options to hide pureed cauliflower, pumpkin, sweet potato or butternut squash. The white and yellow fit right into the color scheme with these baked items.
Tomato sauce and soups are a great place to hide additional vegetables outside tomatoes. Try adding pureed carrots, onions, peppers, zucchini or spinach.
Add cauliflower to mashed potatoes. It's white, has very little flavor and blends well with mashed potatoes.

, Use the natural sweetness of fruits and dairy to make a smoothie. Vegetables get hidden with ease and kids will enjoy a sweet smoothie as a breakfast treat or afternoon snack.


Make a smoothie with your favorite yogurt, fruit and some water to thin it out. Puree in a few vegetables for added nutrition.
Spinach is a great vegetable to add to smoothies. It makes them a brilliant green color and since spinach is slightly sweet, it doesn't add any additional flavor to the smoothie.
Adding avocado to your smoothie can help make your drink extra creamy and rich.
Both carrots and beets are also naturally sweet and will blend well into a fruit smoothie.

, It's always hard for children or adults to turn down a delicious sweetened baked good. Sugar, chocolate and other sweet flavors mask any hint of a vegetable making baked goods a great place to hide veggies.Common recipes that add extra vegetables are muffins and quick breads. You can add shredded zucchini or carrots and make zucchini bread or morning glory muffins.
Sweet potatoes, yams, winter squash and pumpkin are sweet and make great additions to muffins, waffles, quick breads and even ice cream.
Avocado can also be used to make ice cream or pudding which makes for a nice creamy and rich treat. You can also add pureed avocado to brownies, muffins or quick breads as well.

, If you or your children enjoy drinking fruit juices, you may enjoy making make your own homemade juice. Again, the flavor of vegetables is generally masked by the sweet fruit.


You may want to consider purchasing a juicer or blender to make your own homemade juice.
Use sweet vegetables in your juices to blend in with fruit. Try: carrots, beets and dark greens for a sweet twist.
Other vegetables like celery and cucumbers impart very little flavor to fresh juices.

, It's important to be a good role model for your children. They mimic a variety of your behaviors (especially when they're young) including how and what you eat. If you're not eating vegetables, then your children may not either.When you're serving dinner or other meals, make sure that you serve yourself a helping of vegetables in addition to everyone else at the table.
Also, if you're planning on having a snack, show your child that you can pick cook or raw vegetables as snack instead of typical ""junk food"" snacks like crackers, chips or cookies.
Be aware of how you talk about vegetables. If you talk about how you don't like them, they don't taste good or you don't enjoy eating them, your child may pick up on these signals and mimic these same thoughts.

, There are always going to be foods, vegetables included, that your child doesn't like and refuses to eat. However, its important that you get them to try a bite and not make them a different or special meal.


If your child refuses certain foods, don't worry. It's normal for children to go through different phases and have their tastes change over time.
Have your child try one or two bites of everything on their plates. They do not have to finish their entire meal, but should be encouraged to sample all new foods or foods they do not like.If you're cooking a vegetable that your child previously refused, still scoop a serving onto their plate. It can take 15 or 20 tries for a child to like a new food. By skipping it, you never give their taste buds an opportunity to grow.Also, don't make ""kid special"" meals. Your child should be eating exactly what's on your plate (unless it's unsafe or inappropriate for their age).

, Children respond well to hands on activities - especially cooking. They can ""play"" with their food, help make cooking decisions and get creative in the kitchen.


Studies have shown that when children participate in cooking or prepping foods, they're more likely to eat those same foods.Children can start cooking and helping you prepare foods from an early age (even at 2 years old). Let them get their hands in their food and help get creative.In addition to getting your child to try or eat more vegetables, cooking together can help you bond, teach your child life skills and give you the opportunity to talk about the health benefits of vegetables., It may sound a little odd, but if you're interested in getting your child to eat a new vegetable or expand their palate, try pairing their veggies next to a ""non-exciting"" main dish.


Studies have shown that kids were more likely to eat the vegetables on their plate if those veggies were paired with an item that didn't get a lot of attention and wasn't their favorite item.For example, if your child loves chicken nuggets but isn't a fan of broccoli, pairing the two together will result in the broccoli being left on the plate. Your child will eat their favorite thing first and ditch the unwanted item.
Instead, pair the broccoli with grilled chicken strips instead. It's not your child's favorite (but they'll still eat it) and your child may end up taking a few bites of that broccoli.

, Roasting is a great method of cooking for vegetables. It can help bring out the best flavors in vegetables.


One big benefit to roasted vegetables is that many nutrients that are found in vegetables are actually more ""available"" to our bodies once the vegetable has been cooked.For example, the antioxidant lycopene found in tomatoes is actually better absorbed when the tomatoes have been cooked.
In addition, roasting brings out a sweet nutty flavor in vegetables and helps take away the bitter, raw flavor of boiled or raw vegetables.The vegetables also become golden brown and even a little bit crispy with roasting due to the higher temperatures. This may make them a little more appealing to picky eaters.Roasted vegetables are great as a side to a main dish or tossed with a salad.

, Blanching is a cooking method primarily used for vegetables. It's a great way to enjoy crunchy vegetables without that raw, bitter flavor.


Blanching is a very simple process. You submerge vegetables in boiling water for just a few seconds. This helps quickly cook vegetables and removes their harsh raw flavor.
Blanching also helps preserve the color and flavor of vegetables which can be appealing to picky eaters. Plus, these vegetables remain crunchy instead of soft and mushy.Blanched vegetables are great to eat with a dip, add to smoothies or homemade juices or eat by themselves.

, Making a homemade cheese sauce to go with blanched or steamed vegetables is a great idea for picky eaters. It's an easy way to make a vegetable a little bit more exciting.


The cheese sauce is tasty and can help cover up flavors of vegetables that may be unappealing to a picky eater.
The most nutritious cheese sauce would be one that you'd make at home where you can control the ingredients, calories and fat.If you don't know how or do not want to make your own cheese sauce, many frozen vegetables come with cheese sauce already mixed with them.
Cheese sauce goes especially well with broccoli or cauliflower. However, you can use it on any type of vegetable you'd be willing to eat.

, Grilling is a cooking method that lends a lot of great flavors to many foods including vegetables. It's a great way to tempt a picky eater into trying vegetables.


Grilling imparts a lot of great smoky, charred flavor to vegetables. It's a unique flavor profile that only grilling can provide. You can use an outdoor grill or even a grilled pan over the stove.
Another great thing with grilling is that you can marinate vegetables or season them prior to grilling. This is another way to add a lot more flavor.
Grilling also helps vegetables get a little crispy. It helps improve texture for those that are off put by the texture of some vegetables.

You can also look up European patents here.
Or check Google Patents.
Patents cannot be renewed and you can’t get the rights to an expired patent. ;
, In the US, 2 main types of patents are given: utility patents or design patents. Utility patents cover the function of an invention and design patents protect the way an invention looks. Utility patents generally last 20 years, while design patents last 14 years or 15 years for those filed on or after May 13, 2015. There are also 20 year long plant patents for inventors who asexually reproduce a newly discovered or invented variety of plant., Patent extensions are sometimes granted if there are government regulatory delays or if newer laws extend the length of a patent. Sometimes, with very strong justification, you can try to get Congress to pass a bill to extend your patent. If you fall into one of these categories, then you may be able to get your patent extended.

, For most inventions, the given term for your patent will stand. Recognize that you may not be able to extend your patent for this particular invention. Focus, instead, on developing a new invention that you can then get a new patent for.

, Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other establishments regularly take volunteers in both clinical and administrative capacities. If you want to work in an office, this is the best way to make connections that can pay off when an opening for a MT appears.


Use this volunteer position in your resume. A history with successful medical administration will show that you have some experience in the industry.

, These are available through most MT programs. Most job postings look for people with at least 2 years of medical transcription experience, so this work will help you to qualify for jobs more quickly.

, The quality of your resume and the way you present your experience will have a large bearing on the job offers you receive. The following are good guidelines for resume preparation:


Tailor each resume to the job you are applying for. Each job will have a different set of qualifications. You must respond to the qualifications in your resume and cover letter.
Use keywords that are listed on the company website and job posting in your resume. This will show you reflect the experience they are looking for, and it will show that you have interest in the job.
Use action verbs. Make sure each reference to your experience begins with an action verb. Good examples of action verbs include: evaluated, edited, increased, produced, achieved, created, corrected, developed, expedited, fixed, gathered, imported, led, launched, performed, oversaw, taught and refined.
Use a functional resume rather than a chronological resume if you don't have very much experience. Create headers that are separated by skills or qualifications, as listed in the job posting. Detail your experience under each heading.
Focus on your accomplishments as well as your skills. Many people focus too much on their qualifications and never talk about their value. Use facts and figures whenever possible. For example, statements such as ""Increased productivity by 20 percent,"" or ""Earned promotion after 3 months,"" or ""Awarded Employee of the Month prize in August 2011.""

, Since these are national sites, there is a lot of competition for each listed position. Sign up for daily alerts so that you can submit your resume and cover letter immediately.


If you are looking for work from home, filter your results by ""telecommute"" rather than location.

, Many organizations specialize in providing MT services. Instead of looking for postings on job sites, go directly to the MT companies and submit your resume and cover letter for future openings.


Get certified! Once you graduate, take the Registered Medical Transcriptionist (RMT) exam. The RMT exam is given by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI) and would be another great credential to add to your resume.
The Website Worldwide Work at Home has a list of medical transcriptionist companies. Visit http://www.worldwideworkathome.com/medicaltranscription.html to begin submitting resumes.

, Hospitals are the largest employers of medical transcriptionists. Submit a business card or resume to each hospital's hiring department. Attend hospital functions to network with people who work there.

, A paying member of this organization will get access to training and job postings. It will add credibility to your resume as well.


Try to find an AHDI chapter in your area. Although AHDI is a national organization, there are many local and regional chapters. Networking with members can allow you to open up job possibilities. People who are currently employed can recommend you for a job.
Other professional organizations include the Medical Transcription Industry Association (MTIA), American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). Research these societies to see which chapters offer the best job search options in your area.

, Similar to a recruiter, these people work to place MT in jobs according to their experience. Contact CQI Placement Service and MT Connection Placement to start the process.

File for an extension with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).,
Wait to hear back from the USPTO.,
Request an administrative hearing.,
Meet with an intellectual property lawyer.",How to Extend the Life of a Patent2," If you filed your patent after May 29, 2000 and your patent was delayed because the USPTO was taking longer than normal to process the paperwork, you may be eligible to file for an extension. The extension will cover the time lost from your patent term for the delay. The length of the extension you are approved for will depend on the delay time frame, but will not be longer than 5 years.

, If you were initially granted less time than later legislation allows, you may be eligible to request an extension on your patent for the newer patent term. Under the Uruguay Rounds Agreements Act, utility patents granted before June of 1995 may be given an extension to 20 years instead of the original 17 years. This does not apply to design patents.

, A patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act is sometimes given to those who qualify.This applies to those whose products or processes, such as medications, medical devices, food and color additives, require testing and approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) before they can be marketed. The period of time that you were unable to sell your product because you were awaiting FDA approval may be restored as an extension to the original patent. , All application forms for patent extensions can be found on the USPTO website: here for applications filed before September 16, 2012 and here for those filed after this time frame. Know that there are filing fees associated with this application.The process for filing for the extension depends upon which reason for extension the patent falls under.


Generally, the application for extension must be in writing, include the identifying information for the patent, information about why the applicant is entitled to an extension, relevant dates to determine the length of the extension, copies of the patent documents, etc.
Be sure to check with the USPTO for the exact amount of the fee (around $1,000) and the proper procedure for requesting the extension for your case.

, It can take up to several months for the USPTO to process your request. As with any government process, patience is best. If you are eligible and have a good reason for an extension, then there's a chance you could be approved so waiting is worth it.

, If your extension request is denied, you have the right to appeal your denied request. Appeal forms can be found on the USPTO website: here for applications filed before September 16, 2012 and here for those filed after this time frame. Reasons for denial include defects in the paperwork you submitted to the USPTO asking for the extension and your invention being ineligible for extension. File an appeal and address any of the issues that your extension was denied in your written appeal.


The appeals process begins with your Notice of Appeal and fee payment. It will continue through various steps until it reaches the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The board will make a decision on your case and complete the appeals process.

, It could be very beneficial to consult with an attorney to review your options, especially if your request is denied. Your lawyer may be able to offer suggestions and ways to supplement your application. Filing for a patent extension can be complex and your lawyer can ensure that it is done correctly.

Be realistic.,
Find a representative.,
Draft a bill.,
Submit your bill to your potential sponsor.,
Get a lobbyist to represent you.,
Be patient.",How to Extend the Life of a Patent3," This is the least common form of attempting to extend a patent. Congress may not grant your request unless you have very convincing evidence for doing so. You also may need strong support from the community or a special interest group with persuasive lobbyists on your side.


Congress extended the copyright of works to 95 years over the original 75 in 1998. This was due mainly to influential corporations like the Walt Disney Company lobbying for the modification.Keep the kind of influence you may require in mind when you decide to send a bill requesting a patent extension through Congress on your behalf.

, Do some research on representatives in your area or someone you think would want to sponsor you in extending your patent. You will need to convince him or her that there is a very important reason you must extend your patent. It is best if they have a record of supporting the type of invention you have or are connected in some way to that field.


Only a member of Congress can propose private legislation to the legislative body.

, It’s a good idea to do as much of the legwork as possible before approaching your representative. Your bill should be written in legal language and go over the reasons your patent should be granted an extension. You can check existing bills on the Congress website to get an idea what a bill looks like. It might be helpful to consult with a patent attorney when you're writing this as legalese can be difficult to master.Create a preamble. This is an introduction and general overview about your patent, the date it will expire and an explanation of why you need an extension on your patent.
Write up a body clause. This is the meat of your biIl and contains clauses that show what action needs to be taken—in this case, you want your patent to be extended.
Finish with an enactment clause. This tells when you want the bill to take effect. This will be the day your patent is due to expire.
Know that bills which need to take effect in 90 days or less will need 2/3 majority vote, while those that take effect after that time period will only require a majority vote. Send your bill in as early as possible., Contact your representative by phone or email. Many have websites where you can fill out a form to submit your case. Be sure to ask what the process is like and when you can expect to hear back.

, If your patent is important to certain groups or not extending it could cause harm, then look for someone with contacts to represent you. Lobbyist groups can put pressure on Congress to extend your patent. In order to do this, you need to have a good cause with far-reaching effects if your patent is not extended.

, The legislative process can take time. It must go through multiple committees before the house will vote on it. After that, it must be signed in. The length of time this will take varies and is something you should discuss with your sponsor.

Resolve.",How to Enjoy Being a Pharmacy Tech," Find which pharmacies are hiring, and what each is offering for wages.;
, While busier pharmacies may seem like they'd be more work, they are actually essential to enjoying your job as a tech. If your store is busy there will be more technicians on duty and thus more people for you to talk to and befriend. Also having work to do also makes the time go by faster. However, a slow pharmacy provides an easier transition when training and more time and energy to focus on patients.

, There is much to learn in a pharmacy if you make yourself open to absorbing the information. Listen to the pharmacists' counsel to patients and their answers to patient questions. Think about what kind of medicine you are handling and what it is for, and how it relates to other medications. Get to know the brands vs. generic. Not only can you learn about prescriptions, but about the different conditions they treat and effect. There is also much to read in the pharmacy, you can read the books on pharmaceuticals and diseases. Learning will make your job seem more worthwhile.

, Bring a book, or do homework, or focus on learning more as described in the preceding step.

, There isn't much time for recreation behind the pharmacy counter, but there is always time to talk. Talk to customers and you take their scripts and ring them out, and talk to your fellow technicians. The more people you talk to, the more fun you'll have, and the more you'll enjoy your job.

, One of the most stressful parts of being a pharmacy tech is not knowing what to do in a given situation. However, the pharmacist on duty usually knows how to solve whatever problem you may have and asking them is a great way to get help. Don't be shy to ask for the same thing more than once. Pharmacists understand that there are many things to learn and that technicians can't always keep track of everything. Remember, in this job it is important to have no mistakes.

, Don't leave any issues unresolved. If your shift is over before a problem is solved, let another technician or pharmacist know so they can continue to work on the problem. Don't be afraid to leave notes either. You don't want to be blamed for a mistake later.

Know who determines whether an acupuncturist is licensed.,
Learn about the educational requirements of a licensed acupuncturist.,
Recognize the extensive training needed to become a licensed acupuncturist.,
Recognize the differences between a licensed acupuncturist and someone who claims to be certified in acupuncture.,
Research your state's regulations on acupuncture licensing.",How to Find a Licensed Acupuncturist1," Most individual U.S. states regulate acupuncture licensing, but these states typically work with the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) to determine eligibility for licensure.


NCCAOM is the only nationally recognized certification granted to acupuncturists, but having the certification does not necessarily mean someone is a licensed acupuncturist. Acupuncturists are usually required to pass NCCAOM exams to be licensed, but in addition to this exam, the specific state the acupuncturist will be practicing in might have additional licensure requirements.Currently, 43 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia work with the NCCAOM to assess and regulate acupuncture licensure.California administers its own exam, the California Licensing Examination, to grant licensure to acupuncturists.;
, Licensed acupuncturists attend and graduate from nationally accredited colleges of acupuncture. This education is usually at a master’s level, takes 3 to 4 years to complete, and is supervised by experienced and qualified acupuncturists. acupuncturists:To become licensed, the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine requires that applicants attend a program accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). There are about 60 of these accredited programs in the U.S.To maintain their license, acupuncturists must also complete continuing education courses.
Even after completing coursework and graduating from a program, most states also require that applicants for licensure pass NCCAOM certification exams on topics such as acupuncture with point location, chinese herbology, and oriental medicine. State requirements vary as to which NCCAOM exams or how many different NCCAOM exams a person must pass before being granted licensure.

, In addition to taking courses at an accredited college of acupuncture, acupuncturists must complete extensive hands-on-training before they are granted licenses to practice.Licensed acupuncturists complete at least 1500 to 2000 hours of training as part of their educational program.
Before being granted licensure, acupuncturists are required to have seen and treated at least 250 actual patients.

, When trying to locate a licensed acupuncturist, you might encounter medical professionals who perform acupuncture or claim they are certified in acupuncture. This designation is often used by physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, and dentists who employ acupuncture techniques in their fields, but this does not necessarily mean they have the level of training and experience as licensed acupuncturists.In comparison to licensed acupuncturists, individuals claiming they are certified in acupuncture usually complete 100 to 300 hours of training.
The certification is typically granted by a professional organization in the individual’s field such as the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, or the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society.Certified acupuncturists are not required to pass NCCAOM exams.
Certified acupuncturists often do not have as much hands-on-experience with patients before being granted certification.
Certified acupuncturists are not required to complete continuing education courses.

, Regulations on acupuncture licensing vary among states. Before you start looking for a licensed acupuncturist, familiarize yourself with the specific requirements in your area.


The NCCAOM maintains a database of these requirements, which is available through their website."

Search online for a licensed acupuncturist in your area.,
Ask your physician for a recommendation.,
Verify state licensing.,
Research an acupuncturist’s ratings and patient reviews.,
Request a patient referral from the licensed acupuncturist.",How to Find a Licensed Acupuncturist2," One of the easiest ways to locate a licensed acupuncturist in your area is to use the search engine or registry provided on the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) website.Keep in mind that the NCCAOM registry only includes practitioners who elect to make their information available through the registry. This means that it is possible for an acupuncturist to be licensed but not appear in the registry.
If someone you know recommended a specific acupuncturist, you can use the NCCAOM website to verify their licensure or contact the organization by phone or email to confirm they are licensed.

, Your physician has likely referred patients to a licensed acupuncturists in the past, and should be able to recommend one.Even if you receive a recommendation from your physician or another medical professional, it’s a good idea to use the other steps in this article to verify the individual is a licensed acupuncturist and make sure their licensing is up to date.

, An acupuncturist may be certified through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, but not licensed through the state they are located in. As a result, it’s a good idea to contact your state’s acupuncture board to verify whether an acupuncturist is licensed to practice in your area., Another helpful way to find a licensed acupuncturist is to research patient ratings and reviews online. These will often provide insight into whether an acupuncturist is licensed, but also provide you with invaluable information about their bedside manner and skills.


Contact an organization like the Better Business Bureau, either online or by phone, to see how other patients rate this acupuncturist.
While patient reviews can be helpful, don’t rely on them exclusively. Instead, use them in conjunction with the other methods discussed in the article so you can be confident that someone is a licensed acupuncturist.

, To get a more detailed review of a licensed acupuncturist, ask the office for a current or past patient referral.


Many offices are prepared for these requests and will try to provide the contact information of a patient with a condition similar to yours that the acupuncturist treated.
If the office declines the request because of privacy concerns, don't be alarmed. You want to work with an acupuncturist who is professional and will respect patient privacy.

Verify board certification and licensing when scheduling an appointment.,
Find out if your insurance will cover the treatment and if the acupuncturist accepts insurance.,
Meet with the licensed acupuncturist.,
Consider the specialty of the licensed acupuncturist.,
Be patient with your search.",How to Find a Licensed Acupuncturist3," Before you schedule an appointment or procedure with a specific acupuncturist, verify again that the acupuncturist is board certified by the NCCAOM and that their certification and license are up to date.


Your state’s acupuncture board or the acupuncturists’ office should have no problem confirming this information.

, Not all insurance providers cover acupuncture treatments and not all acupuncturists accept insurance, so talk with your insurance provider and the acupuncturists’ office staff before setting up an appointment. These details might influence which licensed acupuncturist you ultimately decide to work with, so here are a few questions to ask in advance:How many treatments will the insurance carrier provide?
What will your copay for a visit to a licensed acupuncturist be?
Does the insurance company require a referral from a physician?
What conditions are covered for acupuncture? Some insurance companies only cover acupuncture for pain relief.
Does the insurance provider have specific requirements about who can provide the acupuncture?
How will the acupuncturist deal with insurance? For example, they might want to be paid in full up front, and recommend that you file a claim for reimbursement with your insurance provider on your own.

, It’s important to meet with the acupuncture practitioner you are thinking of working with before proceeding with any treatment. This will provide you with another opportunity to verify that they have appropriate credentials, but also give you a chance to assess whether you feel comfortable working with this individual.


If you don’t want to schedule a formal appointment at this stage, contact the office and see if there is a time you might be available to meet with the acupuncturist for a few minutes.
If you schedule a more formal initial visit, ask the acupuncturist about the steps involved in treatment, how much relief you might expect it to provide, and how much it would cost.

, Though all licensed acupuncturists are required to understand general practice, some specialize in certain fields such as fertility or dermatology. If you would like to work with an acupuncturist who specializes in a specific field, take this into consideration when researching licensed acupuncturists.


If the acupuncturist has a website or is featured on one, their online profile might describe his or her areas of interest or specialty.
If you're uncertain whether you need a specialist, you can always see a general acupuncturist first and discuss whether your treatment requires a specialist.

, Like with any medical professional, it can take time to find the right acupuncturist for you and your needs. If you are not comfortable with the practitioner you selected or have concerns that the treatment is not working, you can reconsider your options and get a second opinion from a different licensed acupuncturist or other medical professional.

Decide your definition of ""moderation."",
Follow appropriate portion and serving sizes.,
Go for the ""real deal."",
Take precautions if you have diabetes.,
Choose junk foods that have some nutritional benefits.,
Track your definition of moderation.,
Limit your intake of junk foods at parties and social events.,
Come up with healthier swaps.,
Start your day prepared for snack time.,
Drink more water.,
Address stress and emotional eating.,
Don't give up junk foods completely.",How to Enjoy Junk Food in Moderation," If you're aiming to work towards enjoying your favorite junk foods in moderation, the first thing you'll need to do is define what moderation is for you.


Come up with a very specific definition of moderation. It needs to be specific so that you stick to a honest plan and aren't able to ""cheat"" and eat more junk foods than you should.
An example of a specific definition could be: ""I will allow myself to eat two individual bags of chips with lunch every week."" Or, ""I will allow myself to eat three small, individual candy bars after dinner every week."" Or, ""I will allow myself one lunch out per week with co-workers without worrying what type of food I order.""
You may want to try the 80/20 rule. 80% of the time you stick to nutritious, whole foods, and 20% of the time you eat whatever you wish. With this method, you don't think of foods as ""good"" or ""bad,"" or that when you eat something unwholesome you are ""cheating.""Make sure you stick to your definition of moderation. It's when you're slipping or cheating and eating more than you should that junk foods affect your weight and health.;
, If you're going to include the occasional junk food treat, it's incredibly important to make sure you're following the appropriate portion size.


Eating a small serving of chocolate, chips or candy every now and again isn't a big deal. The small serving size keeps calories, fat, sugar or sodium in check.
Eating large portions of junk foods or multiple servings in one sitting allows junk food to wreak more havoc on your overall diet. You may be eating way more calories, fat or sugar than you realize.
Make sure to read the food label of whatever junk food you choose. Specifically check out the serving size. If your favorite junk food are cheese puffs, you'll need to count out how many cheese puffs are in one serving. Or if you're getting a bag of candy from the vending machine, read the back of the label to make sure that ""single pack"" is one serving and not two (or more)., Although this may seem counter-intuitive, if you're craving your favorite junk food, go ahead and eat the ""real deal."" Don't substitute a low-fat or diet version.


Many food companies are making low-calorie, diet friendly or ""healthy versions"" of many junk food treats. Although this may help you stick to a lower calorie diet overall, these foods generally don't taste as good as the real thing. Sometimes, these lower calorie ""diet"" foods, don't really, truly satisfy your junk food craving and may cause you to overindulge when you do eat them.
Instead of going for diet foods more often, stick to your plan of moderation and enjoy your favorite junk foods.

, Things are a little different if you have diabetes, as you will need to be much much more careful about your sugar intake. Try to limit your junk food treat to twice a week. Be smart with your carbohydrate choices — ""trade out"" a carb at dinner for your dessert carb instead of having both.Exercise can help keep your blood sugar levels stable, so make sure you are exercising regularly. Try going for a walk when you know you plan to indulge in some junk food.
Do not eat sugar or carb-heavy treats on an empty stomach. This can cause your blood sugar level to rise faster than normal, or you may overindulge. Eat treats alongside a meal or right after.

, Although many junk food treats aren't overly nutritious or are considered healthy, there are some foods that do offer you a little bit of useful nutrition.


Go for dark chocolate. Dark chocolate has been shown to have antioxidants that help calm and relax you in addition to supporting a healthy heart and vascular system.Choose whole grain chips. If salty and crunchy is your thing, choose whole grain chips. The extra whole grains will give your snack a little extra hit of nutritious fiber.Grab a bag of trail mix. Usually a mix of roasted nuts and dried fruit, trail mix can get a bad rap if it contains candy pieces. Choose trail mix with dark chocolate chunks to get the added antioxidant benefits of the chocolate in addition to the protein and healthy fats provided by the nuts.

, After you've experimented with your created definition of moderation, make sure you evaluate it to ensure your junk food indulgences haven't affected your health.


Track your weight. Junk foods are typically higher in calories so if they're eaten too much or too frequently it may make you gain weight. If you notice you're gaining weight, you may need to re-address your definition of moderation and decrease your overall consumption.
Also track blood sugars or blood pressure. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, these conditions can be affected by the consumption of salty or sweetened junk foods. If you're having difficulty keeping these numbers within normal limits, you may need to decrease how much you're eating your junk food.

, It can be difficult to stick to small portions of junk food treats at certain events like parties or potlucks. Prepare yourself for these situations and use tricks to keep you consumption under control.


Use a small plate. Whether its an office potluck or a football party, higher calorie junk foods may be the only option. Use a small appetizer plate to serve yourself some of these foods. This will help keep your portion sizes smaller.
Only allow yourself one serving or one trip with your small plate. Going up multiple times or getting multiple servings is when things can get out of control.
Try to find a healthier, lower calorie option like raw veggies or hummus and eat these foods first to help decrease your hunger and fill you up with fewer calories.

, Craving junk food on a regular basis can be hard to deal with. If you're looking to minimize your junk food cravings or limit how much you typically eat, try coming up with healthier, more nutritious alternatives.


If you typically eat junk food on a regular basis or crave it, make healthy and enjoyable swaps instead just giving up junk food completely.
If you typically crave something sweet, try these healthier options: yogurt with fruit, a small fruit salad sprinkled with cinnamon, a small serving of homemade granola, 1 – 2 oz of dark chocolate or 1/4 cup of dried fruit.
If you typically go for a salty snack, try: whole wheat pita chips and hummus, whole grain tortilla chips and salsa or beef jerky.

, Prepare yourself everyday for a potential snack craving. This can help decrease how often you choose junk food.


Preparing yourself with healthier items may help you decrease the temptation to go for a vending machine snack.
If you typically have a snack every afternoon, come prepared with a home packed snack or stock your office with healthier options. If you have these on hand, you're probably less likely to get a junk food item.

, Drinking adequate water is a good idea if you typically feel hungry throughout the day. This can help manage your junk food cravings.


Many times, when we feel hungry, we're actually just thirsty. Sometimes we confuse these too signals and end up eating or snacking more than we need to.Ensure you're drinking adequate fluids throughout the day to help prevent even low-grade dehydration.
Aim for a total of eight to 13 glasses of water, flavored water, decaf coffee or tea daily to stay hydrated., A common reason people crave or go for junk foods is when they're feeling upset, stressed, depressed and even bored. Try to manage stress and other emotions to minimize this problem.


If you notice yourself craving junk food or reaching for it more often when you're feeling down or upset, consider working on managing your emotional eating.
Things you can do include: talking to a friend or support group, going for a walk, drinking a glass of water and distracting yourself from your craving temporarily.
In addition, consider talking to a counseling or behavioral specialist if you're having trouble curbing this type of eating behavior.

, Although it may seem counter-intuitive, telling yourself you're giving up junk foods forever, this thought process can actually backfire and cause you to overindulge or binge on these foods.


Telling yourself you're never having your favorite junk foods ever again is not a smart move. Typically after a period of intense restriction, the next time you encounter your junk food or just have a bite or two, you'll overeat or binge on that food.If you're trying to limit your junk food consumption and eat it in moderation, make sure that you include the occasional junk food so that you don't over do it.
In addition, having the occasional junk food or unhealthy treat is OK and considered a normal part of eating.

When you eat, just eat, do not do anything else.,
Decorate your table.,
Start eating after a short meditation or prayer.,
Do not swallow your first bite, but chew it for some time.,
Taste a wide range of food items.,
Eat the rest of your meal mindfully.,
Enjoy the experiment and repeat with every meal.

",How to Eat Mindfully," We are all children that need nurturing, love and care. So give your inner child that nurturing and love, give yourself back the joy of mindful eating.

The life with the rhythm and routine will give you time for yourself, your children, cousins, friends, work, study, theater, for all… The rhythm and routine secures predictability and stability. The kids love to know that they will be fed properly daily and that you will together bake pancakes every Thursday afternoon. It is not easy to find the rhythm in today’s world full of various distractions, and it is not easy to find ‘time’ when so much is spent in useless activities (TV and computers) but it is possible to do so, and if you manage your time,your inner being will start thriving.;
, Become conscious of quality and quantity of food that you are taking. Let it be fresh, organic, locally grown, seasonal, nutritious, use non-processed whole-meal items, and lots of raw veggies. Let the quality of your food items replace the quantity, and allow the food awareness to become your guide. With the awareness you will start respecting yourself and the enjoyment will multiply.

, Taste your healthy and nutritious meals without external interruptions, experience the joy of tasting food without TV, reading, working, rush, mobile, messaging, etc... Savor and enjoy your food while eating, become ‘mindful’ of your food, rather than just swallowing your food while watching TV, surfing the Net, or reading the paper.

, Arrange your food using your nicest plates, light a candle and place a flower arrangement on your table as though you are serving a guest.

, Just before you take your first bite, sit in front of your food for a minute or two before eating. You may wish to close your eyes. Respecting the food, the space around you, the silence, will make you face your animal instinct of HUNGER, relax you, and you will turn towards food peacefully.

, The first few bites of food taste the best. If we are aware of what is happening within our body, we will be able to control the hunger and enjoy the taste more. So stay aware of your hunger and what it feels like in your body, aware of the various flavors within each bite, aware of what it feels like not to swallow.

, Try sweet and sour foods, liquids and solids, hot and cold foods. Before you eat, smell your food, as though you are experiencing the finest wine, stay with each experience.

, Eat slowly, chew properly, lift your fork gradually and thoughtfully, experiencing every movement fully. After finishing your meal, take a few moments to notice that you have finished. Allow the feeling of gratitude to fill your mind – you just had this wonderful nourishing meal to support you on your further journey.

Don't take any other vitamins or mineral supplements during these three days.A lower bowel capsule contains cascara sagrada extract, buckthorn, ginger root, goldenseal root, raspberry leaves, fennel seeds, turkey rhubarb, lobelia, and cayenne pepper.You can make the capsules yourself (if you’re familiar with herbal remedies), or you can purchase them at a natural health food store.
Cascara sagrada extract, buckthorn, and turkey rhubarb help control the motility of your colon, similar to a laxative. However, cascara sagrada extract also helps tone your colon.
Ginger root and fennel seeds reduce griping or nausea in the intestines while performing a cleanse or fast.
Goldenseal helps make mucous membranes stronger.
Raspberry leaves are a demulcent, which soothes the intestines.
Lobelia helps control nerve reactions in the intestines.
Cayenne pepper increases blood circulation.

Know how long you need to spend breaking a fast.,
Start breaking your fast in the evening.,
Break your fast with melon.,
Eat three small meals.,
Add vegetables to your meals.,
Perform the inner cleanse diet for the remaining days.",How to Fast to Lose Weight4," All fasts need to be broken carefully and slowly. Breaking a fast, in general, should take half as long as the fast itself. So if you fasted for 10 days, you need to spend five days breaking the fast.Fasts longer than three days are harder to break than short fasts. This is because your body gets used to not having food and begins to feel really good. Consuming food at this point can actually feel wrong (but necessary).

, The key to breaking a fast slowly is to make sure you don’t suddenly consume a large amount of food too early. In order to help yourself break a fast slowly, start in the evening so your sleep interrupts you and prevents you from eating more than you should., On the first day of breaking your fast eat a small amount of melon (or another really juicy fruit) for breakfast. Drink diluted apple, grape, or orange juice throughout the day. Have another small amount of melon for dinner., On day two of breaking your fast, eat three small meals of fruit for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Drink fruit juice throughout the day., On the third day of breaking your fast, eat fruit for breakfast. Then have a raw vegetable salad for lunch and dinner. Drink fruit juice in the morning and vegetable juice in the afternoon and evening., Starting on the fourth day of breaking your fast, plan your meals based on the ‘inner cleanse’ diet."

Avoid eating certain foods for the duration of the diet.,
Start your day with yogurt and fruit.,
Have vegetable mineral broth with lunch.,
Cook vegetables for dinner.,
Drink as much juice as you want throughout the day.,
Make your own vegetable mineral broth.",How to Fast to Lose Weight5," For the length of this diet you cannot eat the following (unless specifically mentioned): dairy products, potatoes, avocados, dried fruits, grains, beans, tomatoes, baked goods, eggplant, sugar, honey, maple syrup, bananas, pasta, preserved food, meat, coffee, black tea, or alcohol.You should also eat as little salt as possible.
Do not consume any vitamins or mineral supplements while on this diet.

, Before breakfast every day, drink a glass of hot water with the juice of one lemon in it. For breakfast, drink at least 8 ounces (237 ml) of apple or grapefruit juice. Eat up to 5 tablespoons of plain yogurt and at least half a pound of fresh fruit.In the case of the fruit juice and fruit, you can eat more than specified, but you must eat at least the amount specified.

, For lunch drink 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable mineral broth with a salad of at least 8 tablespoons of raw vegetables. You can put olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, ginger or kelp on your salad if you want., For dinner drink another 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable mineral broth. Also, eat at least three different types of cooked vegetables (either steamed or stir-fried). You can have another salad with dinner if you want, or you can have one medium slice of wholegrain bread with butter., This diet allows you to drink as much fruit juice as you want throughout the day. It also allows you to eat as many raw vegetables or fruit as you want in between meals.Don't eat the vegetables and fruit within 30 minutes of each other.

, The vegetable mineral broth is easy to make and includes the following items: 2 cups of carrot tops, 2 cups of ¼ inch thick potato peels, 2 cups of beet tops, 3 cups of celery (including leaves), and 2 cups of fresh parsley.If you can’t find one of these vegetables, you can just leave it out or increase one of the other items to make up for it.
Put all the vegetables into a saucepan and cover with distilled water. Simmer the mixture for 20 minutes on the stove.
Strain the broth from the vegetables and discard the vegetables.
You can add garlic, onion, other vegetables, miso, or other seasonings if you want.

Create your favorite meals and snacks at home.",How to Eliminate Processed Foods From Your Diet," When attempting to eliminate a certain food group or type of food, it will be helpful to journal your current eating habits. This will help you be more aware of what types of processed foods you're eating, when you're eating them, and how frequently you're eating them.


Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Ideally, track a few weekdays and a few weekend days. You might find that your eating habits are different on a weekend day compared to a work day.Many times people choose processed foods out of convenience — they're late to work, don't have time to cook, or didn't have another option handy when they were hungry. Try to dig up any patterns in your diet. For example, you're typically late for work and go through the drive-through for breakfast.;
, A meal plan will be helpful as you slowly eliminate processed foods from your diet. As you remove different foods from your regular meal plan, you can add in a more whole, unprocessed foods to replace them. A written meal plan can help you visually plan everything out for your week.


Spend some time writing up your ideas for all meals and snacks in your free time. This can also be the basis for your grocery list.
When designing your own meal plan, make sure you take into consideration the amount of quick meals that will be necessary for the week. When you plan in advance for quick and easy or on-the-go meals, you might be less tempted to grab a processed food.

, Before you overhaul your diet, think about what you typically buy from the grocery store and what you have stocked in your kitchen. Go through your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry and throw out any processed foods you find, removing the temptation.


Items to look for include: sweets like ice cream, candy, cookies or snack cakes; chips, crackers or pretzels; cereals; sauces, dressings or marinades; deli meats and cheese; and frozen entrees or microwavable meals. These items are generally full of preservatives and loaded with sodium.Since most foods do go through some processing, decide what your limit is for ""tossing"" or ""keeping."" For example, canned beans are a processed food, but are a great source of fiber and protein.In addition, as long as you rinse and drain canned beans, they're considerably lower in sodium.Foods like these might be items you want to keep.
Other processed foods that you may want to keep include no-salt-added or low-sodium canned vegetables, 100% whole grain foods (like 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice), pre-washed/pre-cut vegetables (like bagged lettuce), or all-natural nut butters.
If you feel bad about throwing all of that food away, either donate it to a food shelter or eat it in smaller doses until it's gone and you are mainly eating whole foods.

, Go grocery shopping and leave out the processed snacks. Stick to the outside aisles of the store or perimeter of the store — that's typically where you will find the most whole, unprocessed foods. Aim to purchase the majority of your food from these sections: the produce section, fresh meat counters, dairy, and egg case.


Frozen items are also found on the perimeter of the store and contain both highly processed and minimally processed foods. As long as items are not prepared in sauces or gravies or have a lot of additives, they can be considered an acceptable and nutritious choice.
Be wary of what foods you choose when shopping the aisles. Purchase healthy, nutritious processed foods such as canned beans, 100% whole grains or canned vegetables. Also, make sure these items have few added ingredients as well. For example, purchase plain 100% whole wheat pasta instead of a pasta with a seasoning or sauce mix included or purchase plain, low-sodium canned vegetables instead of canned vegetables that contain a sauce or other flavorings.
If some of your favorite processed foods live in the aisles and are tempting to buy try to skip those aisles completely. For example, don't walk down the candy and chip aisle so you're not tempted to throw something processed in your cart.

, Since the processing of foods can vary widely, reading the food labels will give you the most detailed and accurate information on how processed a food is and what has been changed or added to it.


The ingredient label on packaged foods allows consumers to know exactly what's in the food. It lists all ingredients from the highest quantity to the lowest quantity present in the food. In addition, you'll find any additives, preservatives or flavorings present in the food.
There are a variety of tips or tricks to help consumers decide what level of processing is acceptable. It's typically recommended to not purchase foods with ingredients that you cannot pronounce. For example, some processed foods include ingredients like diacetyl (a butter flavoring) or potassium sorbate (a chemical used to prolong shelf life).Note that if a company has a proprietary blend (of things like spices or flavorings), they are not legally required to disclose those ingredients.If you see this listed on an ingredient label, you may not want to purchase this item.
Note some additives can make a food more nutritious. For example, some companies add in vitamins or minerals to their foods. Even though these additives may not be familiar, they actually improve the nutrition content of the food.

, Fruits and vegetables are nutritious foods that contain essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. It's recommended to make half of all your meals a fruit or a vegetable.Minimally processed, whole fruits and vegetables to focus on include: fresh fruits and vegetables (like apples, bananas, tomatoes or eggplant), pre-washed/-pre-cut items (like bagged lettuce or steam-in-the-bag green beans), and canned or frozen items. Note, with canned foods, choose items that are low-sodium or no-salt-added and prepared without sauces, gravies, or other seasonings.
Avoid highly processed fruits and vegetables like canned fruit in syrup, fruit cups in syrup or with added sugar, and canned or frozen vegetables in a sauce or with added seasonings.

, Protein is essential to a healthy diet and meat is a great quality protein to include in your diet. Most of your meals and snacks should also include a source of protein.Include minimally processed, whole protein foods like poultry, red meat, pork, eggs, and dairy foods. Choose organic products if you want to avoid added preservatives or growth hormones.
Vegetarian protein sources that are minimally processed include dry beans, lentils and peas, canned beans and lentils with no-salt-added (also rinse and drain these items), and frozen beans and lentils with no sauce/gravies added. Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are vegetarian protein sources but are typically considered more processed.
Some moderately processed protein foods you may choose to consume include frozen meat without additives, sauces or gravies, plain yogurt, and cheese.
Highly processed protein foods to avoid include deli meats, hot dogs, sausage, bacon, and pre-prepared and frozen meats or meat entrees.

, 100% whole grains are a great addition to your diet. They're typically high in fiber and nutrients.But not all 100% whole grains are unprocessed. Be careful what you select.


Minimally processed grains to focus on include: dry brown rice, quinoa, millet, 100% whole wheat couscous, or barley. 100% whole wheat pasta does go through more processing, but can be a healthy addition to your diet.
Do not choose pre-cooked, ""microwave"" or quick cooking items as these have been processed further to help decrease home cooking times.
Avoid processed grains including white rice, plain pasta, white bread, desserts, cakes, cookies, and pies.

, Once your kitchen is stocked, you can begin preparing meals without processed foods. Make the basis of each meal whole foods like protein (poultry, red meat, pork, seafood, low-fat dairy or legumes), fruits, and vegetables.


An easy way to start cooking a meal is with the main protein or main dish. Pair this with one to two side items like a fruit, vegetable, or 100% whole grain for a complete meal.
Avoid processed meals like TV dinners, frozen pizza, canned soup, lunch-ables, and pre-packaged sandwiches.
An example of a day of meals with minimized processed foods would look like: 2 scrambled eggs with spinach and feta cheese at breakfast, a salad with home cooked grilled chicken with a homemade salad dressing for lunch, 1/3 cup of homemade granola and an apple for an afternoon snack, baked salmon with steamed broccoli and 1/3 cup brown rice for dinner and grilled pineapple with a drizzle of honey for dessert.

, When hunger hits in between meals, it may mean it's time for a snack. If you don't have an unprocessed snack handy, more processed foods become an easy, fast, and tempting bite to eat. Pre-prepping healthy snacks to take with you is essential if you want to avoid overly processed foods.


Try to keep healthier, unprocessed snack foods handy whenever possible. For example, keep shelf stable fruit (like apples), nuts or homemade granola in your work desk drawer. If you have access to a refrigerator, stock up with items like plain yogurts, raw vegetables, and homemade hummus or hard boiled eggs.
Avoid common processed snacks like: candy, chips, crackers, snack cakes, portion-controlled cookie packs or granola/protein bars.
If you forgot your homemade snack or don't have access to one, stick with the least processed snack foods available. For example, many vending machines sell packages of roasted peanuts or trail mix.

, Many convenience stores or fast food restaurants offer a variety of highly processed foods. Although menu options have improved in the last few years, it will be much more difficult to find whole, unprocessed foods at these types of restaurants.


Hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, pizza, and other similar foods are examples of foods that are commonly available at convenience or fast food restaurants. These foods are not only highly processed but when eaten on a regular basis can put you at risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity.If it's necessary to eat or find food options at a fast food restaurant, try to choose items that are as whole and unprocessed as possible. Salad with grilled chicken is an example of a less processed item you could order.

, Eliminating or reducing the amount of processed food in your diet may help you manage your weight better and improve your health.However, the occasional snack or meal that contains processed foods is appropriate and most likely will not have any serious negative effects. Choose wisely and decide what ""moderation"" truly is for you.


If a few of your favorite foods are processed, instead of eliminating them permanently, maybe you decide to have them every Friday night or just once a month.
Remember, even removing some unprocessed foods from your diet is a great start. How many or what particular processed foods you remove from your diet is ultimately up to you.

, The most common processed foods are sometimes the tastiest. Think about what it is you like about a particular favorite processed food (like sweetness, saltines, or crunchiness) and see if there's a healthy alternative that can replace it.


For example, if you crave a little something sweet after dinner, instead of going for chocolate or ice cream, try cutting up some raw fruit or having a little plain yogurt with a drizzle of honey.
If you're craving something salty and crunchy, try having a few carrots and celery sticks with homemade hummus.

, Preparing some of your favorite items at home allows you to control exactly what goes into your foods while still enjoying them.


Easy items to prepare at home include dressing, sauces or marinades; granola or muesli; soups, stews, and broth; baked goods like muffins, cookies, granola bars or whole wheat bread or dips like hummus.
You can also recreate fast food meals at home. Homemade chicken nuggets and baked fries is a great alternative to the restaurant version.

Remember, take it one day at a time.",How to Eliminate Sugar," The best way to start eliminating it is by removing it from your morning foods. Instead of eating cereal, muffins, or donuts, try eggs, unsweetened yogurt with fruit, or cottage cheese.;
, Try an artificial sweetener or even unsweetened coffee.

,, It is called lactose. In fact, everything the the ending OSE, is sugar, as is honey, corn and maple syrup, and many others. Know your sugars. Do not be fooled. Soy milk is an option, and unsweetened almond milk is quite good and a great substitute.

, Try to eat healthy snacks or fatty snacks. Fat is not your enemy. In fact, after protein it is the thing that will fill you up the fastest, which will make you less hungry and lessen sugar cravings.

, When you feel a craving come on, brush your teeth or gargle mouthwash. Anything sweet will no longer taste good with a fresh mouth.

, Instead of a Starbucks, make coffee at home without sugar, or make tea. Tea is better for you and packed full of healthy antioxidants. Get the sweets out of the house—if you have to drive up to the store every time you want a fix, you're less likely to give in.

, Treat sugar like an addiction. Find out what triggers your desires for sugar and eliminate it. It could be stress, boredom, or mourning. Instead, try something else during those triggers. Take up a new hobby like running. Do it in the morning, when you're stressed or when you're bored. Despite what you may think, over time it will give you energy, help eliminate stress, and give you something to do. Or take up reading. It can help you take your mind off stress, relieve boredom, and if you only have a short time to read in the morning it will give you something to be excited to come home to. Find a new habit to replace sugar cravings.

, If you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world. Just correct the mistake right away. Don't wait till the next day. The worst thing you can do for yourself after a slip up is decide to ""get back on track"" tomorrow. Do it today, right now. If you open up a Twix candy bar, instead of eating both halves, give the other away. If you just opened a soda and realize what you're doing, dump it out. If you forgot yourself and delve into a slice of cake, take a breath, put down the fork, drink some water, brush your teeth and distance yourself from the sweets.

Replace refined grains with whole grains to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.,
Reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes by eating 2 to 3 servings of whole grains every day.,
Reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by increasing the fiber content of your diet.,
Reduce your risk of diverticular disease by increasing both insoluble and soluble fiber.,
Replacing refined foods with whole grains is believed to increase overall health because it helps to reduce the amount of processed foods that are consumed.,
Start an anti-inflammatory diet that includes whole grains.",How to Eat Whole Grains for Health," Whole grains can lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, insulin levels and triglycerides, all of which can lead to cardiovascular disease. The following are easy ways to replace refined grains with whole grains:


Eat bran flakes, shredded wheat or oats for breakfast.
Substitute whole grain breads for refined grain breads in both toast and cereals. Read the labels carefully to see what percentage of the bread was made with refined grains. For example, some brands of refined bread are colored brown to appear to be made with whole grain. White breads can be made with whole grains.;
,


Replace white rice with brown rice or bulgar wheat. Studies have shown that both men and women can reduce the risk of diabetes by at least 11 percent when they replace white rice 2 to 3 times per day with a whole grain.

, You can do this in a number of ways. Whole grains are a great way to increase fiber, but you should pay attention to increasing both insoluble and soluble fiber.


Whole grains that are insoluble forms of fiber are whole wheat, bran, seeds, barley, brown rice, bulgar and couscous. They do not dissolve in water and they have a laxative effect on the bowels. Insoluble fiber is thought to have the same effects of decreasing colorectal cancer as reducing coronary disease.
Whole grains that are soluble forms of fiber include oatmeal, flax seeds and oat flakes. This soluble fiber fills with water and forms a gel that helps food to move more easily through your colon and entire digestive system.

, Diverticular disease starts when little weak pockets are created in your intestines. They become easily inflamed and can burst.

, Cookies, cakes, some cereals and more are filled with processed foods that contain fewer nutrients than whole grains.


Avoid anything that says it contains refined sugars and grains. This switch can lead to weight loss as well as reduction in the risk of disease. The following are good ways to sneak in a few servings of less-processed whole grains into your diet:
Place barley or wild rice in soups and casseroles.
Use rolled oats and bran instead of dry bread crumbs.
Replace white flour tortillas with whole wheat versions. Make sure to read the packaging to be sure they are high in fiber and whole grains.

, Some doctors, such as Dr. Andrew Weil, have developed food pyramids that they believe help people to reduce inflammation from arthritis and other conditions. 3 to 5 servings of whole grains is included in this pyramid.

Understand the importance of nutrition and growth.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Nutrition and Growth," In order to spread the message, it is important to know the facts. The basics are:


A young child should grow and gain weight rapidly. From birth to age 2, children should be weighed regularly to assess growth. If regular weighing shows that the child is not gaining weight, or the parents or other caregivers see the child is not growing, something is wrong. The child needs to be seen by a trained health worker.
Breast milk alone is the only food and drink an infant needs in the first six months of life. After six months, a baby needs a variety of other foods in addition to breast milk to ensure healthy growth and development.
From the age of 6–8 months a child needs to eat two to three times per day and three to four times per day starting at 9 months – in addition to breastfeeding. Depending on the child's appetite, one or two nutritious snacks, such as fruit or bread with nut paste, may be needed between meals. The baby should be fed small amounts of food that steadily increase in variety and quantity as he or she grows.
Feeding times are periods of learning, love and interaction, which promote physical, social and emotional growth and development. The parent or other caregiver should talk to children during feeding, and treat and feed girls and boys equally and patiently.
Children need vitamin A to help resist illness, protect their eyesight and reduce the risk of death. Vitamin A can be found in many fruits and vegetables, red palm oil, eggs, dairy products, liver, fish, meat, fortified foods and breast milk. In areas where vitamin A deficiency is common, high-dose vitamin A supplements can also be given every four to six months to children aged 6 months to 5 years.
Children need iron-rich foods to protect their physical and mental abilities and to prevent anemia. The best sources of iron are animal sources, such as liver, lean meats and fish. Other good sources are iron-fortified foods and iron supplements.
Iodine in a pregnant woman's and young child's diet is especially critical for the development of the child's brain. It is essential to help prevent learning disabilities and delayed development. Using iodized salt instead of ordinary salt provides pregnant women and their children with as much iodine as they need.
As the child's intake of foods and drinks increases, the risk of diarrhea substantially increases. Contamination of foods with germs is a major cause of diarrhea and other illnesses that cause children to lose nutrients and energy needed for growth and development. Good hygiene, safe water and proper handling, preparation and storing of foods are crucial to prevent illnesses.
During an illness, children need additional fluids and encouragement to eat regular meals, and breastfeeding infants need to breastfeed more often. After an illness, children need to be offered more food than usual to replenish the energy and nourishment lost due to the illness.
Very thin and/or swollen children need special medical care. They should be taken to a trained health worker or health facility for assessment and treatment.;

Look for a medically supervised program.,
Start a food journal.,
Monitor side effects.,
Weigh yourself weekly.,
Evaluate your diet every month.,
Talk to a doctor.,
Follow an exclusionary diet for at least two to four weeks.,
Exclude one food or food group at a time.,
Reintroduce foods slowly.",How to Evaluate Exclusionary Diets," Cost is an important factor when evaluating any type of diet. However, elimination or exclusion diets may be more costly than you think. Review whether not your diet of choice will fit into your weekly food budget.


Many exclusionary diets that are designed to help relieve an ailment — like headaches, bloating or chronic constipation — will require you to avoid a certain ingredient in foods (like gluten or eggs). Finding replacement items can be quite costly. For example, gluten-free foods are significantly more costly than the regular gluten-containing items.In this case, however, the increased price is worth it, as you will likely feel much better and may even avoid some costly doctor's visits.
Some exclusionary diets may also promote the consumption of certain foods that can also be costly. They may promote you drinking certain beverages (like coconut water for electrolytes) or only purchasing 100% organic items.
Make sure you review the types of foods they promote and how the costs of those foods will fit into your budget.;
, All foods, even ones that are considered ""unhealthy"" contain nutrients that are used by your body to maintain normal functioning. If you're following an exclusionary diet that restricts multiple foods or food groups, this can lead to an unbalanced way of eating.


If you're looking to improve your health or lose weight, you should still follow a well-balanced and nutritious diet. This means you're eating a wide variety of foods from every food group most days.
The Paleo diet, for example, suggests avoiding large groups of foods including: dairy, beans, lentils and whole grains. The downside of this is that these foods are incredibly nutrient dense and contain a wide variety of nutrients that can promote safe weight loss and a healthy body.
If you're looking at exclusionary diets, choose one that doesn't rely on the avoidance of entire food groups. Limiting a few items is OK, but unless medically necessary, do not choose to follow a diet limiting an entire food group.
It's only recommended to avoid certain foods if you have a clinically diagnosed food allergy or autoimmune disease where food avoidance is the only method of maintaining your health., There are some exclusionary diets that do limit a larger amount of items initially, but then slowly add them back in over time. As long as the duration of the exclusions is not too long, these are generally safe to follow.


Some diets, especially low-carb diets, suggest cutting out foods that are higher in carbohydrates. For example, the Atkins diet suggests cutting out fruits, starchy vegetables, some dairy and grains for the first two weeks. However, if you follow the plan, they are slowly added back in. This type of exclusionary diet is acceptable and generally safe for most healthy adults.
Also consider how long you'll actually be able to give up certain foods. If you love dairy foods, but the diet you're considering suggests permanently giving up dairy, that might not be realistic for you.Review your diets and see just how long you're supposed to exclude or avoid certain foods. It's important to know this information, because if you reintroduce the food you may forfeit the benefits associated with the diet (like weight loss).

, If you're following an exclusionary diet, the basis is that you're going to avoid certain foods or ingredients in foods. Be careful when you replace these items with substitutes as these may not be what you're looking for.


For instance, if you follow a gluten-free diet, you may miss bread or sandwiches. You may look into gluten-free breads to fill this need; however, many of these foods are highly processed and contain more sugar, fat and calories than the original version.If you're following an exclusionary diet, be mindful if you're choosing to replace some of the ""banned items"" with substitutions. Limit your intake of these items, especially if they seem overly processed or end up being higher in calories, sugar and fat.

, Many diet programs — both exclusionary and otherwise — suggest the use of herbal or vitamin supplements to either promote weight loss or other desirable effects on your health. Be careful with these supplements and research them thoroughly before taking.


If you've chosen a diet to follow that suggests taking certain supplements (like B12 or green coffee bean extract) always speak to your doctor first. These supplements are not regulated by the FDA and can seriously react with your current medications and health conditions.Never take a supplement without consulting with your physician.
Some exclusionary diets may suggest taking a supplement to replace the vitamins, minerals or other nutrients that are common in the foods they are suggesting you avoid. For example, they may suggest avoiding dairy foods but also suggest taking a calcium supplement as well. This is generally appropriate, but still should be reviewed with your primary physician.

, If you find that you're having a variety of unexplained symptoms (like constipation, diarrhea, bloating or gas) on a regular basis, you may want to consider following a medically supervised exclusionary or elimination diet.


Many doctors, offer the ability to follow a doctor designed and supervised diet in their office. They will create the diet for you based on your report of symptoms and food recall and monitor your progress.
Your doctor will likely suggest eliminating one food first, followed by other suspect foods. They will also monitor and manage the reintroduction of foods or continued exclusion of certain foods.
They may also suggest that you take some vitamin or mineral supplements if they feel your diet is not well-balanced when following the recommended food exclusions.
These medically supervised programs are generally safe for most healthy adults and you should feel comfortable following one of these programs.

, With any new diet or eating pattern, it'll be beneficial for you to start a food journal. This can help give you insight into your current eating patterns and help keep you on track.A food journal can give you insight into your current method of eating. This might give you some ideas of what needs to change about your diet and how an exclusionary diet may help.
A food journal also helps keep you accountable. If you're following an exclusionary diet, writing down everything you eat may help prevent you from indulging in the foods you should be avoiding.
Also, studies show that those who kept a regular food journal, ended up losing more weight in the long-term. So if you're following an exclusionary diet for weight loss, consider starting up a food journal.

, Another important thing to track when evaluating your exclusionary diet is any side effects. When cutting out certain foods, food groups or certain ingredients, you may notice some changes in your body.


Some of the side effects of an exclusionary diet will actually be beneficial to you. For example, if you're no longer having bloating or diarrhea after cutting out dairy foods while following the Paleo diet, this is a beneficial side effect and should be noted.
However, there may be some side effects that are unpleasant. For example, the Paleo diet limits carbohydrates from grains, starchy vegetables and fruits. Sometimes a lower carb diet may cause headaches, constipation and mental fogginess.Keep notes of any positive or negative side effects in your food journal. This will help you determine whether or not you'll want to continue with that particular exclusionary diet.

, In addition to tracking any possible side effects, also track your weight. This is especially important if the goal of your diet is weight loss.


If you're following an exclusionary diet with the hopes of losing weight, make sure you weigh yourself regularly to track whether or not the diet is effective for you.
Generally, it's recommended to weigh yourself once a week. Aim to weigh yourself on the same day of the week and at the same time so you see the most accurate trend in your weight loss.If you aren't losing adequate weight (less than 1 pound per week) or are not losing weight at all, you may want to reconsider the type of diet you're following or ensure you're following it correctly.
If you're following an exclusionary diet with the hopes of eliminating an ailment (like bloating, migraines or constipation) you should still track your weight. If you're avoiding certain foods or food groups, weight loss may be a side effect of these diets regardless if that was your main goal. If you lose unwanted weight, you'll need to find things to add to your diet that can help prevent further weight loss.

, With any diet plan that you're following, you should check-in and evaluate the diet and your progress about once a month. This will help guide you on whether or not you should continue with your program.


Make a note in your food journal or calendar once a month to check-in with yourself regarding the diet you've been following. Make notes and adjust as necessary.
One thing to consider is how the diet is making you feel. Do you feel more energized since starting the diet or do you feel more fatigued? Are you more hungry or are you better able to control your appetite? If you've had some negative side effects, you may want to consider switching to an alternate program.
Also note whether or not you think the diet will continue to be realistic and sustainable for you. If you're following an exclusionary diet and you find yourself regularly craving the foods you're supposed to be avoiding, it may be difficult to maintain this method of eating long-term.

, Since the basis of any exclusionary diet is avoiding certain foods, it'll be imperative that you speak with your primary care physician. If you think you may have a food allergy and want to try an exclusionary diet, consider speaking to an allergist to make sure this type of eating pattern is safe for you.


If a diet is suggesting you give up sodas, all added sugars or fried foods, it's acceptable for you to give those up without worry of missing out on any beneficial nutrition. These foods should be limited anyways so excluding them from your diet is safe and appropriate.However, if a diet is advising you to avoid dairy, carbohydrates or gluten, you'll need to talk to your physician first. Or if a diet is recommending you avoid large quantities of a variety of foods, also talk to your doctor. They will be able to tell you what's truly appropriate for your current state of health.
If you think you have a food allergy or sensitivity, make an appointment with an allergist. They may do a skin or blood test to see if you truly react to certain foods and whether or not a exclusionary diet would be beneficial to you.

, If you're following an exclusionary diet to relieve symptoms caused by a possible food allergy or food sensitivity, its recommended that you give up certain foods for a minimum of two weeks.


Allergist and registered dietitians advise that an exclusionary or elimination diet should be followed for a minimum of two to four weeks.During the two to four weeks, if the suspected food that you've eliminated is the one causing your symptoms (headaches, constipation, bloating, gas, etc.), those symptoms should go away.This would be a good time to journal — especially in a food journal — and note how well you've been able to stick to the diet, what you've been eating and any symptoms you're noticing (or no longer noticing).

, When you're following an elimination diet, it's important to only exclude one food at a time. It might be tempting to cut out a lot of foods, but this can make things more confusing and more difficult to figure out.


It's unusual that you'll have multiple foods that you are either allergic to or sensitive to. Try to single out one or two foods that you think may be causing some side effects. This is where you should start with your exclusionary diet.
Only exclude one food at a time. If you exclude two, three or more foods, you'll never know which food is the actual culprit and you're unnecessarily avoiding foods without need.

, It's also important to reintroduce foods slowly after excluding and avoiding them for some time. This can help you avoid a serious outbreak of symptoms or allergic reaction.


After an elimination diet, you may or may not notice a resolution of your symptoms. However, that doesn't mean you can add foods back to your diet without careful thought or planning.
If you are not noticing any change in symptoms after excluding one food, it's most likely not the culprit. Slowly reintroduce that food over the course of a week or two.
For example, if you cut out dairy products with no change in symptoms, introduce a few dairy products over the course of a week. You can add in a 1/2 cup of yogurt one day (monitor symptoms) and then add in a serving of yogurt and milk on the 2nd day.
If you do notice a resolution of symptoms after cutting a certain food, you can confirm that it's the source of your symptoms by doing a challenge. Introduce the food in small doses back into your diet and if the symptoms return, this confirms that the food is causing your symptoms.

Eat nuts raw.,
Try snacking on roasted nuts.,
Choose nuts based on the fats they contain.,
Use nuts as a meal’s protein.,
Include nuts in side dishes.,
Add nuts to something sweet.",How to Enjoy the Health Benefits of Nuts1," Snacking on nuts in 1 – 2 ounce servings is one of the best ways to prevent yourself from eating other, less healthy foods. Further, nuts are both enjoyable and nutritious all on their own. This is especially true for raw nuts, or those that have not been artificially dried or seasoned.A 1-ounce serving of almonds will contain 20 – 24 individual nuts. About 16 – 18 cashews will provide a single serving, as will 18 – 20 pecan halves. You only need to eat eight to 11 walnut halves for a full serving, while you can snack on nearly 50 pistachios before you’ve eaten a 1-ounce serving.
Mixing raw nuts with dried fruit and seeds is a great way to enjoy your snack even more, not to mention get more vitamins and minerals.;
, Many people prefer the flavor and consistency of nuts that have been roasted. If you’re purchasing dried nuts, always opt for unsalted, dry-roasted options, as opposed to those that have been oil-roasted. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to find dry roasted nuts outside of extremely popular snacking nuts, such as almonds. Further, roasting of any type will likely decrease the nutritional value of nuts overall.If a nut a has been dry-roasted, it will be specified on the product’s labeling. Otherwise, there was likely oil added to the nuts during roasting.
For maximum nutrition in roasted nuts, try roasting nuts yourself.

, Different types of nuts have different types and amounts of fat. Fortunately, most of the fats in nuts are unsaturated, and can actually help you lose weight and keep your heart healthy when consumed in appropriate portions. That said, there’s enough saturated fats in certain nuts to take note of.Almonds, hazelnuts, and chestnuts all have the benefit of being extremely low in saturated fat. As such, almonds and hazelnuts are especially good snacks, and chestnuts can be added freely to your meal to add nutrients and keep you full for a longer.
Walnuts, pecans, and pistachios all have considerable health benefits, as well as moderate amounts of saturated fats. Definitely include these in your diet whenever possible, but don’t snack on them all day.
Brazil nuts, macadamias, and cashews are among those nuts that have the highest amounts of saturated fat. While these nuts can make great ingredients (especially if substituted for less healthy ingredients), they should be eaten less frequently than the nuts above, or in smaller quantities.

, If you're looking for ways to decrease your meat consumption, nuts provide an alternative protein option. Cashews, for instance, provide 5 grams of protein in each 1-ounce serving, as well as other nutrients, like iron (though it should be noted the iron in nuts is different and not as easily absorbed as the iron found in animal products).They also have much less saturated fat. By using cashews or another nut as the protein base, you can not only remove an unhealthy component of your meal, but add a healthy one instead.For example, cook a stir fry with plenty of vegetables. Instead of meat, add a handful of cashews right before removing the pan from the heat. The nuts will soften, as well as absorb the seasoning. Season with soy sauce, cayenne, garlic, and ginger. You can also mix cashew butter with these spices, and heat with a bit of water to make a sauce., Whenever you’re cooking rice, noodles, or veggies, you can always add nuts. Nuts are great because they can add texture and protein to pretty much anything. They will increase the dish's nutritional value, as well as its ability to keep you feeling full for a longer period of time.For instance, brown rice with walnuts or cashews, ginger, raisins, and nutmeg can make for a great dish. Additionally, pecans and hazelnuts will add great flavor to many savory soups.

, A healthy diet can include sweets from time to time, and nuts will help maximize a treat’s nutritional value. For instance, add nuts and granola to Greek yogurt and sweeten with honey. For an ice cream alternative, blend bananas, almond butter, almond milk, and dark chocolate in a food processor and freeze. Finally, add ground or whole macadamias to brownies or cookies, and reduce the amount of sugar and butter you include in the recipe."

Eat plenty of almonds.,
Get healthy fats from walnuts.,
Stay energized with pecans.,
Don’t forget about other nuts as well.",How to Enjoy the Health Benefits of Nuts2," Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts. They are not only rich in unsaturated fats and calcium, they also have plenty of vitamin E and magnesium. Simply by eating 2 ounces — or about ¼ cup — of almonds per day, you will get significant health benefits such as reducing your risk of heart disease.A handful of raw almonds and an apple is one of the most nutritional snacks you can eat.
Favor whole nuts over flaked almonds, as the almond’s skin contains compounds called flavonoids, which can help protect your heart., These highly antioxidant nuts are particularly good sources of healthy fats. Namely, walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant amount of one of the healthiest omega-3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid, which has a protective effect on bone metabolism. Just an ounce will provide your daily recommended intake.Keep the skin (the waxy, flaky material on the outer surface of walnut pieces), to make sure you’re getting the healthy phenols these nuts offer.Simply chopping and adding walnuts to veggies, fruit, or any other dish is often the way to go.
You can also puree walnuts with cooked lentils, olive or flax oil, and any herbs or spices you favor to make a dip for fresh veggies.
Especially if you don’t regularly eat fish, start eating more walnuts to increase your consumption of omega-3 fatty acids and decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease., Pecans are another especially healthy nut, containing no trans fat and providing plenty of vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, several B vitamins and zinc. They’re great for your heart, as they are known to lower cholesterol levels and prevent plaque buildup in your arteries. They also supply good amounts of the vitamins you need to access the energy provided by the food you eat.


You’ll reduce your chances of coronary heart disease by eating just one handful of pecans per day., Pistachios, for instance, are rich in vitamin B6, which is important for hormonal balance. They also contain antioxidants that help protect your eye health. Further, they are rich in potassium and fiber.Eat just three or four Brazil nuts per day to get your daily recommended amount of selenium. This mineral supports your thyroid function and immune system, among other health benefits.
Get more B vitamins, fiber, and vitamin C from chestnuts. Though lower in protein than most other nuts, chestnuts have the least amount of fat and carbs.
Macadamias are perfect for adding great flavor and texture to sweet dishes. Though they have an especially high amount of fat, they also include good amounts of magnesium, calcium and potassium.

Selecting nuts to purchase.,
Store nuts in the fridge.,
Roast nuts at home.",How to Enjoy the Health Benefits of Nuts3," The best way to buy nuts that have been shelled is in vacuum-sealed containers. Always look for a freshness date. If the nuts themselves are visible, they should be uniform in size and free of any shriveling. If you're selecting nuts that are still in their shells, choose those with shells free of cracks or tiny holes. As a rule of thumb, raw whole nuts should feel heavier than they look.Shake nuts that are still in the shell. Avoid nuts that rattle, as this indicates they are likely no longer fresh.
Tree nuts, including walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts are somewhat seasonal, and will be fresh in late fall or early winter.
When buying bulk nuts, make sure that they are fresh and firm to the touch. Limp, rubbery, musty, or rancid-smelling nuts should be avoided. Unfortunately, bulk nuts lose their freshness rather quickly.
You can purchase nuts either shelled or still in the shell. This is mostly a matter of convenience, though nuts that are still in their shell will keep longer, especially at room temperature.

, The nutritional quality of most nuts will be preserved for a few months at room temperature. However, both flavor and nutritional value will persist longer in nuts that are stored at a lower temperature. Use an airtight container to store your nuts in the fridge, and they’ll last a year or more.Ideally, your fridge should be set to 40 degrees F (4 degrees C). Nuts will last even longer - up to two years - in a freezer set to 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C).
A nut that is no longer fresh will begin to taste rancid. While it is not unsafe to eat a nut that is beginning to taste differently, many people find the taste undesirable.

, If you prefer the taste of roasted nuts but want to maximize their nutritional value, roast nuts yourself. This will allow you to use lower roasting temperatures, and minimize the reduction of the nuts' nutritional value. Arrange a single layer of nuts on an non-greased stainless steel baking sheet. Bake in the oven for ten to twenty minutes.Generally speaking, the shorter the cook time, the better. Feel free to check on the nuts, and shake the pan periodically to ensure uniform roasting.
Don’t roast a large amount of nuts at once for storage. The nutritional quality and flavor of roasted nuts will degrade more rapidly than nuts that are stored raw. As such, only roast as much as you want to eat over the course of a few weeks.

Keep a food journal.,
Avoid highly processed meats.,
Give up the processed carbohydrates.,
Skip processed junk foods.,
Discontinue drinking sweetened beverages.,
Avoid frozen meals.,
Skip fast foods.,
Read the food label.,
Make foods from scratch.,
Pack your lunch.,
Choose healthier treats and snacks.,

Always go for leaner, minimally processed protein sources.,
Make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable.,
Only choose 100% whole grains.",How to Eliminate Ultra Processed Foods from Your Diet," If you feel that you're eating a lot of ultra-processed foods, it's a good idea to think about eliminating them from your diet. To get a good idea of how many processed items you're eating and when, start keeping a food journal.


Buy a paper journal or download of a food journaling app. Start tracking all your meals and snacks before you've made any changes to your diet.
Make sure to track every breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, beverage and little nibbles you take throughout the day. The more accurate you are, the more this food journal will be helpful.
Keep a food journal for a couple of days or a week. Then, look back over your journal and highlight or circle items that you ate that were ultra-processed (like that fast food meal at lunch or diet soda in the afternoon).
Write a list of the ultra-processed foods you typically eat so you can begin to cut these foods out gradually.
You may be tempted to take a cold turkey approach — that is, cutting out all ultra-processed foods from your diet at once. This is often an ineffective approach, especially if the bulk of your meals are processed foods. Instead, make a goal to reduce consumption of these items by half. If you currently drink two diet sodas daily, try to reduce to one diet soda daily for a week or a month. Then cut it out all together and move on to the next item on your list.;
, One common group of ultra-processed foods is the meat group. Items like hot dogs or salami go through a significant amount of processing and even have been linked to adverse health conditions. Avoid these to help you cut out ultra-processed foods.


Processed meats contain a lot of added sodium and preservatives. Studies have shown that when people have eaten large quantities of these items or eat them frequently they have increased risk of cancer (like colorectal cancer).Avoid meats like: hot dogs, bacon, sausage, salami, deli meat, canned meats and beef jerky.
Try to limit how often you eat these foods. Eating a hot dog once a year at the ballpark is reasonable. Grilling hot dogs every weekend is probably too often.
If you do consume these foods, only have a small portion of about 3 – 4 oz or 1/2 cup. Make sure to measure so you don't overdo it with these ultra-processed meats., Another big group of highly and ultra-processed foods are carbohydrates. This group can include things like sugary cereals, cakes, pies, and breakfast pastries. Cut these out so you can minimize ultra-processed foods from your diet.


Ultra-processed carbohydrates are a dangerous grouping of food to eat frequently. They're associated with weight gain and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.Avoid processed carbohydrates like: sugary cereals, white bread, pasta and rice mixes, boxed macaroni and cheese, donuts and breakfast pastries, chips and buttery crackers.
Although a small serving of these foods won't hurt, make sure to measure the portion size so you do not over do it. Most grains (like bread, cereal or pasta) should be measured to a max of about 1/2 cup per portion., If you're in the mood for a snack, definitely skip the processed junk foods. These usually fall into the ultra-processed group and provide little to no beneficial nutrition.


Processed junk foods may include foods that have ultra-processed meats (like jerky) and ultra-processed carbohydrates (like crackers or chips). These foods are known to be high in sodium or sugar and calories. These foods when eaten regularly can lead to weight gain, heart disease and diabetes.In addition, these foods don't keep you feeling satisfied long. You may go for chips as a snack and feel hungry soon after.Try to choose healthier, more nutritious snacks instead of typical junk foods like: chips, crackers, cookies, snack cakes, candies, ice cream, popsicles, pretzels and cakes or pies. Before eating a snack, ask yourself — ""What will this food item do for me? What vitamins/minerals will it give me?""

, Outside of foods, there are also very processed and ultra-processed beverages. Many of these drinks contain very few if any natural ingredients. Stay away from these beverages as you eliminate ultra-processed foods from your diet.


Processed beverages are generally high in sugar. These sweet drinks can cause weight gain, tooth decay, heart disease and diabetes.In addition, your don't feel satisfied or full from drinking so many people do not curb their total calorie intake when consuming high calorie beverages.
Avoid beverages and drinks like: regular and diet sodas, fruit juice cocktails, sweetened coffee drinks, alcohol, sports drinks and energy drinks.
Remember: the only beverage our bodies actually need is water. Water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells, and keeps tissues in your throat, ear, and nose moist.

, One particular section of the grocery store that may have more ultra-processed foods is the frozen aisles. Many of these foods are overly processed and are either higher in fat, sodium, sugar or a combination.


However, you can also find some very healthy, minimally processed foods in the freezer — frozen vegetables. These are actually preferable to canned vegetables, as they have less sodium.
Many other frozen foods (like TV dinners) still are overly processed. Like other processed foods that are high in sodium, fat or sugar, these foods can also increase your risk for weight gain if eaten regularly.Typical frozen foods that are ultra-processed include: TV dinners (even the ""healthy"" or ""diet"" ones), french fries, tater tots, breakfast sandwiches, breakfast bowls, pizzas, desserts and vegan or vegetarian items.

, Outside of grocery store items, you can also find ultra-processed foods at some restaurants (fast food restaurants in particular). Make sure to be careful about where you're eating your meals out to avoid ultra-processed foods.


Many fast food restaurants serve ultra-processed foods. Although they have gotten better about providing less processed, more nutritious foods, some of the ""old standbys"" are overly processed.
Also, foods from gas stations or convenience stores may also be overly processed. The pre-made or pre-cooked items may use foods like processed meats or processed carbohydrates.
Avoid foods like: hot dogs or sausages, chicken wings, frozen ice drinks, chicken nuggets, deli meat sandwiches, pancakes and the accompanying sauces.

, When trying to avoid processed foods, it's important to learn how to read the food label. This is present on all packaged goods and all ultra-processed foods, and can help you determine whether or not you should consume a particular food.


Both the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list are required to be on every packaged item. They are generally found on the side or back of the package.The first thing you need to look at is the serving size. Although this won't tell you how processed an item is, it will tell you how much you're supposed to eat of that item and how many calories, fat, grams of sugar or milligrams of sodium you're consuming for that serving.Pay attention to how many servings are in a container. The nutrition stats for a single serving may not look too bad — until you realized there are four servings in a container.
If a food has a relatively high amount of sugar, sodium or fat (especially saturated and trans fat) it may be highly processed. 20% of your daily value is considered high.
Also read the ingredient list. This is another key area where you'll figure out whether or not an items is ultra processed. Ingredients are listed from the highest quantity to the smallest quantity.
If you see a lot of ingredients you cannot pronounce or do not know what they are, it's most likely an ultra-processed item. In addition, if it's a product that has multiple items listed on the ingredient list, this also usually signals that it's ultra processed.

, An easy way to cut back or eliminate the ultra-processed foods is to quit purchasing them and make more nutritious and more natural versions at home.


When you cook and prepare things from scratch, you're able to control exactly what goes into your foods. You can control whether or not your food is organic, how much sugar you add or how much fat or sodium you add to the food.
You can also use ingredients that are minimally processed as well. For example, you may want to give up eating white bread and make your own bread at home. Using organic 100% stone ground wheat flour is a great minimally processed ingredient to use.
Studies show that when you cook and prepare more things from home, you eat more fruits and vegetables and have an easier time managing your weight., Skip the fast food restaurants and processed deli meat at lunch and pack your own less processed and nutritious meal. This will help you avoid those ultra-processed meals.If you pack your lunch, you may not be as tempted to go out to a fast food restaurant or order lunch in. You'll be confident you have your own nutritious meal to eat.
Try lunches like: spinach salad with home-grilled chicken breast and homemade dressing, roasted turkey breast sliced on whole wheat bread with cheese, homemade chili with a sprinkling of cheese and onions or a homemade ""protein pack"" with sliced cheese, fruit and nuts.
To make sure your lunch stays cold and fresh, consider purchasing an insulated lunch box. Or freeze a water bottle and keep it with your lunch items until you can put it in the refrigerator.

, If you're in the mood for a snack, consider skipping the vending machine (which may be full of ultra-processed foods) and choose a more nutritious and less processed snack.If you can, consider packing your snacks and bringing them with you. That way, you're not tempted to grab something from a convenience store, fast food restaurant or vending machine.
If you're in the mood for a sweet treat, try the following: greek yogurt with fruit, homemade trail mix with dried fruit and nuts, a piece of fruit and peanut butter or a homemade granola bar.
If you rather have something salty or savory, go for: a homemade roasted nut mix, homemade beef jerky, raw vegetables and homemade hummus, a cheese stick and fruit or a hard boiled egg sprinkled with some salt.

, Skip those sweetened beverages and stick to the best drink — water. This will help keep you hydrated and support a healthy lifestyle.


Drinking an adequate amount of water (or other clear, hydrating fluids) is essential for proper health. It's important for your body's fluid balance, temperature regulation and ability to transport nutrients to your body's cells.Without water, you can become dehydrated.
Men should drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids each day and women should drink 9 cups (2.2 liters).Instead of the processed drinks, go for: plain water, sparkling water, decaf coffee or decaf tea.

, When you've cut out ultra-processed foods from your diet, you may find that you need a little extra help planning a more well-balanced and nutritious diet. Write up a meal plan to give you a guide on what you should eat.A meal plan is a list of foods and meals that you plan on eating during the entire day or week. Use a meal plan app or a sheet of paper and write down every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack that you plan on having each day of the week.
This meal plan will also serve as a guide to come up with your grocery list. You'll know exactly what you need to purchase and not rely on buying ultra-processed foods., Since processed meats are not a nutritious food, it's important that you make smart choices when choosing protein-based foods.


Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. By eating a source of protein at each meal and snack you can be sure you're consuming enough of this important nutrient every day.
Make sure to go for minimally processed and lean protein sources. These are naturally lower in calories, fat and preservatives.Measure out a 3 – 4 oz or 1/2 cup serving of protein foods. Include items like: seafood, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, pork, beans, lentils or nuts.
Some proteins, like canned beans, are processed but only minimally. They have very few added ingredients and are an appropriate food to include in a well-balanced diet.

, Another very important set of food groups are the fruit and vegetable groups. These nutrient-packed foods need to make up about half of most of your meals.Both fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories, but high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. This is why most health professionals recommend making half of your plate a fruit or vegetable (or try for five to 13 servings daily).Make sure to measure out appropriate servings of these healthy foods so you ensure you are getting enough. 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or about 1/2 cup of fruit equals one serving.Some fruits and vegetables, like frozen items or lettuce that is pre-washed, are considered processed foods; however, they're moderately to minimally processed and still are appropriate to include in a nutritious diet.
If you choose canned fruits and vegetables, make sure they are low-sodium and are stored in water or their own juices, not sugary syrups.

, Be careful when choosing grain-based foods for your diet. These can be deceivingly processed; however, if you choose plain 100% whole grains, these can be a great addition to a nutritious diet.


Look for only 100% whole grains. These grains in general are less processed than more refined grains (like white rice, white bread or crackers). They contain all the nutritious parts of the grain and are typically higher in fiber and other nutrients.Also choose 100% whole grain products that are plain and without seasonings. So instead of buying a whole grain rice mix with a seasoning blend, choose plain brown rice and add your own seasonings at home.
Make sure to measure appropriate portion sizes. Aim for 1 oz or about 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving.Whole grains to include are: brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, whole grain oats and millet.

This is important because the patient may not want to be dressed, and you have to respect their rights., The patient care plan is important to read because it has all the basic needs and information about the patient. The patients care plan will inform you about which arm is weak and which arm is strong if it is not obvious.

, Your patient may care about what they wear. It is important to promote their rights and let them choose what they want to wear., Go get their clothing from their closet to start dressing them. If taking the CNA clinical test, the shirt will always be a button up.

, A barrier will be used to be put on the table so when you place the patient's clothing on the table, the barrier will protect the clothes from getting dirty. A barrier could be a towel, or small flat sheet.

, Make sure it will be big enough for all the clothing to fit on top of it.

, Make sure the clothing is fully on the barrier and not touching the table.

, When you are ready to dress the patient, it is important to make sure the patient is not exposed to anyone and is comfortable. You have to respect the privacy of patients.

, It important to wash your hands for 20 seconds before touching the patient to prevent any spread of infections to the resident.

, To make this process faster for you, place their bed position in a way that will be easier for you to change them. To move the bed, just use the bed control remote. While lowering the bed tell the patient you are doing so, as the patient could become startled.

, A privacy blanket is put on top of the patient while taking off their clothes so their bodies will not be exposed. This will make the patient feel comfortable and keep them warm.

, While doing so, make sure the patient's body is not too exposed.

, Start with the patients strong arm when taking off their clothes. It will decrease the pain for them, and make it much easier to take off the clothing. This will also allow for the shirt to come off smoothly through the weak arm, without having them tug it off. While doing so, always make sure the patient is comfortable. The Prometric checklist says it is an automatic fail if you do not take off the shirt starting with the strong arm., To get the shirt off to the other side of the body, it is important to lift up the patient's back so the shirt can slide through to the other side without tugging, or pulling on it.

, This will decrease the pain in the weak arm tremendously because removing the shirt would be effortless for the patient and the shirt will just slide off.

, Roll the sleeve up the patient's arm very gently, this will cause no pain for the patient. The Prometric checklist says it is an automatic fail if you do not start putting on the shirt with the patient's weak arm., To get the shirt on to the other side of the body, it is important to lift up the patient's back so the shirt can slide through to the other side without tugging, or pulling on it.

, Put socks on by starting with the toes and pulling them up the ankle one foot at a time. Put on each sock one at a time.

, The dirty clothes and the barrier should be put in the hamper to keep the room tidy.

, Since the patient is fully dressed, he/she does not need the privacy blanket anymore.

, When you are done dressing the patient, it is important to know if they are comfortable with how the clothing is on., To do as so, just use the bed control remote. When you are about to leave the patient, make sure the bed is in the lowest position because if the patient falls off the bed, it will cause less injury. Let the patient know you are moving the bed so they do not become startled.

, The call light is what a patient uses to notify the nurse that they need help. A patient needs their call light by them at all times in case of any emergencies. Make sure it is within the patient's reach so that they can alert you whenever they are needed.

, It is important to open to privacy curtain when you are done with your procedure because if the patient falls and cannot call for help, people could quickly see the patient fall and call for help as soon as possible.

, After the procedure, it is important to wash your hands for 20 seconds to keep your hands clean, not spread any germs, or infections to other patients or people you will be in contact with.

Rotate the sticky notes and stick them in different spots every once in a while, as your eyes will gradually get used to them and start ignoring them. If you place it in a new spot, your mind will not take it in so quickly and it will catch your eye more easily.

, Post that weight loss goal in your bathroom to remind yourself every day that you must lose that weight.

, Make sure you are getting enough of each type of food in the pyramid, and cut down on the food that you eat too much.


For example: If you're consuming lots of dairy and very little protein, consider lessening the amount of dairy in your diet and increasing your protein consumption.

A good source of protein is the healthy protein mix you can stir into liquids, but make sure your liquids are healthy!



, Taking in plenty of liquids is very important to having a healthy journey, as the majority of your body is made up of water. If you dehydrate yourself and refuse what your body needs, it could lead to serious health problems.

, This will help get your mind off of eating unhealthy food while taking care of your health at the same time! Plus, you'll be tired when you go to sleep, making you less prone to waking up for midnight snacks.


Try to have at least thirty minutes of exercise per day, but if you find that you are unable to devote so much time and/or energy in one go, separate the thirty minutes into three, ten minute sessions. That way, you are still getting your needed exercise, but in different time periods.
Note that you must be faithful to your health and exercise every single day.

, Remind yourself that if you keep on eating unhealthily, your physical appearance will only grow worse, giving you an even harder time when it comes to losing the weight!

,, Convince yourself that this is what you will look like if you don't stop eating unhealthily, and promise yourself that it will happen. Take it even further by printing out a picture of a disgustingly overweight person, and post it on your refrigerator to constantly remind yourself of the serious consequences.

Talk to your doctor.,
Write up a meal plan.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Purchase appropriate kitchen tools.",How to Eat when You Can't Chew1," Your doctor will be able to provide you with specific information regarding what restrictions you have with foods and what texture foods you need to consume (soft and mushy vs pureed liquids). Your doctor should also provide you with a timeline of how long you need to follow a modified diet.


Ask your doctor to specify exactly what you can and cannot eat. It's better to be very clear and get too much information than eat something that could cause pain or further injury.
Also ask if you're at risk for any nutrient deficiencies or if there are types of foods or groups of foods that you should be consuming daily or completely avoiding.
It may also be beneficial to see a registered dietitian or nutritionist. These nutrition experts will be able to tailor a diet specifically for your issue and give you examples of types of foods or create a meal plan that's appropriate for you. Ask your doctor for a recommendation.;
, Having a meal plan to follow will be helpful while you're consuming a modified or restricted diet. It can help take the guesswork out of daily meal planning and give you the frame work for an appropriate diet.


Write up a week's worth of meals and snacks that are appropriate for your situation. You may need to get creative with different recipes — especially if you're going to be on a modified diet for longer periods of time.
Sample meals for a soft diet can include: oatmeal for breakfast, beef stew for lunch and meatloaf with gravy and well-steamed broccoli for dinner.
Sample meals for a liquid or pureed diet can include: yogurt with pureed peaches for breakfast, a green smoothie (with milk, frozen fruit, spinach, and protein powder) for lunch, and black bean soup for dinner.
Your doctor may have a sample meal plan on hand. Ask to see if you could have a copy to take home to mimic or start you off for a few days.

, After you write up your meal plan and talk to your doctor, take a trip to the grocery store to stock up on appropriate foods for your diet. Having the right foods on hand will make your modified diet a little bit easier to follow.


Remember, a variety of cooking techniques can be used to get even hard or dense foods to a texture that will be safe for you to consume. For example, apples can be cooked down into applesauce or pureed apples that are easy to chew and swallow.
Also consider purchasing foods or items that are already in the form you need and require little to no cooking. If you're only allowed to consume pureed foods or liquids you can buy: low-sodium soups like tomato soup, butternut squash or black bean soup that are completely smooth liquids.If you can consume more whole foods, but need them to be very soft or mushy, you can purchase: frozen fruits or vegetables (once cooked and warmed through, they are very soft and tender) or soups and stews from the grocery store hot bar.

, Purchasing appropriate kitchen tools may make your modified or restricted diet easier to follow. Plus, they'll give you more flexibility with your food choices so you can prepare more items at home.


A food processor is a great tool and can help break down tougher, denser foods into small pieces or into an almost pureed consistency. You can use them to puree fruits or vegetables or finely chop protein foods (like seafood, chicken, or red meat). This might be a good tool if you can have small, finely chopped food and don't necessarily need to puree everything.
Using a blender may be a good idea if you need completely pureed or liquid meals. You can put a variety of foods into a blender to make liquid meals. Blenders are also great because you can put a lot of raw or hard foods into shakes and smoothies. For example, you can put raw spinach into a smoothie and the consistency will still be completely pureed.
A crock pot or slow cooker is a great tool for those who are looking to prepare foods to a very soft, mushy, or tender consistency. These machines cook low and slow all day and foods are easily gummed or lightly chewed to be swallowed.

"
"
Include soft protein foods.,
Consume dairy for an alternate source of protein.,
Cook and prepare fruits and vegetables until soft.,
Choose carefully with grains.,
Make soups or smoothies.,
Purchase meal replacement shakes.,
Purchase liquid vitamin supplements.",How to Eat when You Can't Chew2," Protein is an essential nutrient to your diet. Going for more than a day or two without protein is unwise and can cause unwanted weight loss or loss of muscle mass.Consuming adequate protein on an all liquid or soft diet may be difficult or unappetizing depending on your diet restrictions or required modifications.


If you need to consume a completely liquid or pureed diet, try to incorporate proteins such as: beans pureed into a soup (like black bean soup), pureed tofu in soups, hummus, or puree canned soups and stews to a completely liquid consistency.You can also process meats (ground meat, chicken, or seafood) into a smooth consistency. Adding a little broth or sauce can turn these foods into a more liquid texture.If you can consume soft or tender foods and do not need a liquid or pureed diet, try foods like: meatloaf or meatballs mashed with a sauce or gravy, soft baked fish (like tilapia or salmon), tuna/egg salad, mashed tofu, scrambled eggs, mashed beans, stews or soups, and braised or roasted meats like brisket or pot roast that are fall apart tender., Many dairy products work well with restricted or modified diets. Dairy is full of protein, calcium, and Vitamin D and can help you maintain a balanced diet more easily.


Add regular or greek yogurt to your day. Yogurts are great smooth foods that are appropriate on a pureed or soft/mushy diet. Regular yogurt may be easier to chew and swallow as it has a thinner consistency compared to greek yogurt. Choose which type is more appropriate for you.
Cottage cheese is another very high protein dairy food that will fit into a liquid or soft diet. If you need your foods completely pureed, add cottage cheese to a blender or food processor for a pureed consistency.
Drinking milk or adding milk to different foods (soups, stews or smoothies) can offer you another easily swallowed protein source.
If you are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy, try dairy alternatives like soy or almond based milks, yogurts, and cheeses.

, Many fruits and vegetables, especially when raw or lightly steamed, are much too hard and dense to chew or swallow. Most times, these foods will need to be altered to the appropriate consistency by cooking.


Try frozen fruits and vegetables. Many times, when defrosted or cooked/warmed through, these foods are really soft and mushy. Examples include: frozen broccoli, frozen cauliflower, frozen Brussels sprouts, or frozen berries.
Steam vegetables until you can mash them with the back of your fork or they are easily pureed into the correct consistency. Many times, over-steaming vegetables (like broccoli) can get them into a soft consistency. Examples include: mashed potatoes or squash, steamed carrots or peas or over-steamed vegetables.

, Grain-based foods like bread, rice or pasta don't always work well on a soft or pureed diet. These foods can be a little sticky or squishy and require more chewing compared to other foods. Choose wisely when incorporating grain-based foods.


Oatmeal, cream of wheat, or other hot cereals can be a great option on either a soft or liquid diet. You may need to puree some of these items to get them to a runnier or smooth consistency.
You can also blend some grains (like oats) into smoothies.

, Making homemade soups and smoothies is a great idea for those needing a pureed or even a soft diet. You can customize them to include a wide range of foods and nutrients.


When making either a soup or a smoothie, try adding in different fruits or vegetables. Blending them in will help you get a few servings of these nutrient dense foods into your diet.
Soups are a great vehicle for lean protein and vegetables. Cook everything until soft and puree if needed.
Smoothies can be made from a wide range of foods including dairy, fruits, vegetables and even nut butters. Blend together for a smooth, liquid consistency.
You can also try mixing in unflavored protein powder into both soups and smoothies for an extra dose of protein.

, If you're in a pinch or need a few quick meals, consider purchasing a few meal replacement shakes. Many of these supplements contain adequate protein, calories and vitamins.


There are a variety of meal replacement shake options. Look for drinks that will fit into your calorie and protein goals.
Many meal replacements come either pre-made or in a powdered form. You can add the powder to smoothies to increase the nutrient level.
Be wary of drinks that contain a lot of added sugars or are high in calories. They could cause weight gain if you're not careful.

, Depending on how long you're on a modified or restricted diet you may want to consider taking a liquid multi-vitamin supplement. This may help you meet your nutritional goals when you're on a diet long-term.Look for a liquid supplement that is a 100% complete multi-vitamin and multi-mineral for the most comprehensive supplement.
You can add your vitamins to your meals or drinks or just take them as is.
Always check with you doctor prior to starting any supplements.

Set your menu for a week in advance.,
Plan your shopping trips around your meals.,
Keep your pantry well-stocked.,
Pick fruits and vegetables that are in season.",How to Enjoy Healthy Meals when You Hate to Cook1," Sitting down and creating a menu for an entire week allows you to shop more efficiently and avoid being paralyzed by indecision when mealtime comes. It also ensures your meals are balanced and healthy.You may want to include options for some meals in which cooking and prep time is minimal. For example, if you typically have a bowl of cereal for breakfast, you might also give yourself the option of having a bagel or a smoothie to change things up.
Remember to have basic staples available. Eggs are a quick, healthy, and versatile option you should keep on-hand. Milk or a milk substitute and your favorite condiments are other items you should always have stocked.
Assuming you work during the day, typically most of your cooking will occur for your evening meal. As you plan, think about the leftovers and how you can incorporate them into a healthy lunch the next day. For example, leftover salad can be stuffed into a pita.;
, Once you've set your menu for the week, go to your kitchen and figure out what you need that you don't have. Add basics that you regularly consume, and you have an efficient list that ensures you won't have to run out to the store every other day.Knowing what you need also enables you to shop around for the best deals and the best quality ingredients. For example, you may want to go to a local farmer's market for fresh produce, then to a regular grocery store for everything else.
The other benefit of doing this is that if you go to the grocery store less often, you'll typically spend less money. This is especially true if you're the type of person who always comes home with a half-dozen items that you didn't really need, but that looked good or were on sale.

, Unless you're sensitive to gluten, grains are part of a healthy diet. These can be bought in bulk to save you time and money, and are found as staple ingredients in many different dishes.Brown or wild rice, whole wheat pastas, and oats are more healthy than white pastas and breads that have been refined.
Make sure you have all the herbs and spices that you use on a regular basis as well. For example, if you like to eat Italian food and pasta dishes regularly, you probably want to stock up on garlic, oregano, and other Italian seasonings.

, There's nothing wrong with frozen fruits and vegetables — provided they don't have a lot of added sugar and preservatives; however, they still won't taste as good as fresh fruits and vegetables grown locally.This is particularly important if you find you don't like certain foods, but you've only ever had them frozen or canned. Prepackaged foods are grown on industrial farms that may grow crops year round, then processed in a factory. The entire process causes them to lose much of their flavor.
Experiment with fresh foods, even things you've never liked before or had any interest in eating — you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. You won't hate cooking as much if you're smelling something that you know you love to eat.
There are many vegetables that will stay fresh for days in the refrigerator, such as cabbage, cauliflower, peppers, carrots, and beets.

Eating healthy and balanced meals and snacks is a good way to promote overall health and prevent weight gain, which can be a particular concern with older adults (usually defined as adults 65 and older) and can cause diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure.Aiming to get between 2,000 – 2,600 nutrient-rich calories can help you eat well as you age.


Calculate approximately how many calories you need based on your age, sex and activity level. You can find the caloric guidelines at https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-2/

Track your intake and calories through an app or website such as SuperTracker: https://www.supertracker.usda.gov

If your activity level is decreasing as you age, you will not need to consume as many calories as you did when you were younger. Focus on foods that are dense with nutrients but low-calorie to keep you healthy, satisfied, and at a safe weight.
Weight loss is generally not recommended for those older than 65 years. If weight loss is necessary, it should be done very slowly, at a rate of about 1/2 to 1 pound per week (reducing 250 – 500 calories per day) and done under medical supervision.;
, Your medical professionals know your health history. If you are concerned about your diet and eating well as you get older, talk to your doctor or other medical professional. The doctor can recommend specific tips on selecting the best food options for you and ways to prepare your meals for health.It may also become necessary to supplement your diet with specific vitamins and minerals.


Ask your doctor about any specific foods you should include or avoid in your diet. For example, many doctors suggest reducing sugar and refined carbohydrates as you age. This can minimize your risk of developing diabetes or heart disease.
Ask your doctor if you have concerns about food-drug interactions. Let your doctor know about any over-the counter-medications or supplements you may be taking, or any medications prescribed to you by another doctor.
Meet with a registered dietitian, who can make additional suggestions on how to eat well as you age.
Talk to your doctor about possible vitamin deficiencies as well. It is often necessary for older adults to supplement vitamins B and D., Many times, people rely on their sense of thirst to inform them when it's time to drink some water. As a person ages, their sense of thirst may be reduced, putting them at risk for dehydration.Try carrying a water bottle with you, or keep a glass on your desk that holds about two cups of water. Tell yourself you must drink at least four of those glasses every day. This may help keep you hydrated.

, This food group contains vital nutrients, such as fiber and vitamin C, that promote wellbeing. Incorporate a wide variety of fruits into your meals every day. This can reduce your risk for heart attacks and stroke.It may also satisfy a sweet tooth so you eat less refined sugar.Eat at least 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit daily. Mixing colorful choices for different nutrients helps maintain your health as you get older. For example, try combinations of fruits such as blueberries, papaya, raspberries, pineapple, strawberries, melons, and bananas.Stick to whole and fresh or frozen fruits if possible. These offer more fiber and nutrients than canned fruits or fruit juices. If you want fruit juice, make sure it is 100% juice and limited to a 4-oz serving size., As we age, our risk for chronic diseases increases. Getting plenty of different vegetables can promote your overall health as you age. They fill you up, provide vital nutrients, and help maintain body functions such as bowel movements.Eat at least 2 to 2 ½ cups of vegetables each day. As with fruit, it’s important to choose different hued veggies at every meal to reap the benefits of their vitamins and nutrients.Incorporate foods from the vegetable subgroups: dark-green vegetables (spinach and kale); starchy vegetables (potatoes); red and orange vegetables (tomatoes and carrots); beans and peas (kidney beans and sugar-snap peas); and other vegetables (eggplant or okra).

, Eating grains such as wheat and oatmeal provides a wide range of nutrients and vitamins. These can help oxygenate your blood, build muscles and bone, stabilize blood sugar, and maintain bowel function. Getting at least the recommended daily allowance of grains can help you eat well and stay healthy as you age.Have at least three to five servings of whole grains daily. At least half of your daily allowance should be whole grains such as brown rice or whole wheat pasta.Vary your choices every day. Have whole wheat bread and pasta one day. Then try ancient grains such as amaranth, buckwheat, bulgur, quinoa, or spelt the next day.Digestion becomes less efficient as we age, so it is important you get enough fiber in your diet. Whole grains, wheat cereals, barley, and oatmeal can all help you reach your daily fiber intake (at least 21 grams for women over 50, 30 g for men over 50).Reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates including white pasta and white rice, both of which contain sugar that may lead to fluctuations in blood sugar., Proteins are any foods made from meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds.Foods from the protein group help vital bodily functions such as building bones, muscles, cartilage, skin and blood.Getting a variety of proteins every day contributes to eating well as you age and promoting overall health.


Aim for 5 – 6 ½ ounces of lean protein every day, depending on your activity level.For example, a small steak of 3 ½ – 4 ounces is the equivalent of one ounce of protein. Likewise, one can of drained tuna is about one ounce of protein as are three egg yolks.
However, fatty meats can contribute to heart disease and obesity, which may be issues for people with diabetes.Choose lean or low-fat cuts of meat and poultry. This includes lean steaks such as eye of round, sirloin lip side steak, top sirloin steak; lean pork, like top loin pork chops or tenderloin; and poultry without skin.Fish and seafood are a great source of protein. Some types are high in fat, like wild salmon, but these fats (omega-3s) are necessary and extremely beneficial to your health.

, Dairy products such as milk and yogurt provide the vital nutrients of calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein. Getting enough dairy is a part of eating well as you age, but also building and maintaining bones and reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes.Eat or drink three servings of dairy every day. One serving of dairy is the equivalent of 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 ½ ounces of natural cheese, or 2 ounces of processed cheese.Remember that soy and nut milk products count as one serving of dairy.
Choose low-fat dairy products including cheeses and yogurt. This limits the amount of saturated fat and calories that can contribute to age-related illnesses including diabetes and high blood pressure.

, As we age, our taste buds begin to decrease. The one taste that lingers the longest is sweet, which makes many people crave sugar as they age. Limiting how much sugar you consume can help you to continue eating well for life.Reduce the amount of starches, candy, and desserts in your diet.
Recognize that foods labeled “low-fat” or “reduced-fat” often contain higher amounts of sugar than full-fat options.
Look out for hidden sugar in your food choices. Make sure to read packaging and look for terms that indicate sugar such as high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, or maltose. Many seemingly healthy options such as canned soups and vegetables, pasta sauce, and frozen dinners have high amounts of sugar.

, Your teeth and gums will change as you age, and you may find it hard to eat certain foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Instead of giving up those foods and the essential nutrients they contain, try cooked or canned foods like unsweetened fruit, low-sodium soups, or canned tuna., Eating well as you age takes a little effort. Planning each meal during the week can ensure you get vital nutrients to promote your health and well-being. It can also save you money if you’re on a budget.Have healthy breakfast every day, which gets you off on the right foot and may help you eat well throughout the day. Make yourself an egg white omelet with low-fat cheese and vegetables, have whole grain toast with avocado with some berries, or have fortified cereal with fruit.Follow this up with a healthy lunch, such as a salad with grilled chicken and some yogurt, and dinner.
Plan for restaurant outings or spontaneous dinner invitations. Call ahead to the restaurant or check their menu online to see what healthy choices they offer. Remember that accepting an invitation for dinner and enjoying something a little unhealthy once in awhile won’t derail your efforts to eat well as you age., Too much dietary fat can contribute to age-related health issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. This is especially true if you are carrying a few extra pounds.Trimming fattier cuts of meat by removing the skin or roasting in a dripping pan can keep you eating well as you age without losing any real flavor.Remove skin from chicken and turkey before cooking it. This decreases the overall fat content.Roast meat on a rack to let the fat drip off. This reduces the overall fat content., Your sense of taste and smell decrease as you age. In fact, the number of taste buds you have also decreases. This may cause you to crave saltier foods, which can increase your blood pressure and contribute to heart disease. Finding alternative ways to season your foods helps you enjoy the taste delicious dishes as you age without adding additional sodium.Drizzle fresh lemon or lime juice over foods such as steamed vegetables, broiled fish, pasta, and salads.Chop or mince garlic and onions to flavor meats and other dishes.
Sprinkle fresh or salt-free dried herbs and spices for a blast of flavor on your food.
Marinate and grill meats with salt-free spice rubs.
Make your own salad dressings with olive oil and vinegar.

, Some fat when you’re cooking won’t hurt you. It may also boost the flavor of your meals; however, using too much or the wrong kind of cooking oils or sprays can add unwanted fat and calories to your otherwise healthy diet. Use a non-fat cooking spray or light oil in a spray bottle to reduce the calories and fat in your dish.Choose oils high in unsaturated fats such as olive, peanut, corn, vegetable, safflower, sunflower, or flaxseed oils. Use enough to just lightly coat your pan.

, How you cook meals can also affect how well you are eating as you age. Avoid fat-laden fried food by grilling, baking, broiling, baking, and stir frying your meals. These techniques provide healthy and delicious meals while reducing unwanted fat and stabilizing blood sugar.Avoid frying foods, which often requires butter or lard.

, Fried vegetables often taste heavenly and some people believe are a healthy choice to get their daily allowance. But fried vegetables contain loads of fat and calories and should be limited to no more than three to four times per week as you age. Instead, steam your fresh vegetables in a steamer or the microwave. Season with a non-salt herb or spice for a flavorful side dish.Add ¼ cup water or low sodium broth to steam vegetables in the microwave. Putting them in a steamer basket inside a pot with a bit of water or broth is another option.

Eat breakfast every morning.,
Take healthy snacks with you.,
Drink water.,
Make smart choices when you eat out.,
Limit alcohol.,
Remove junk food from the house.",How to Eat Well when You Are Busy1," Skipping breakfast is one of the worst things you can do for your body. Skipping breakfast has been connected to obesity, irritability, and reduced mental awareness.Breakfast is important, and you should always eat it, even if you have to wake up five to 10 minutes earlier or take it to work so you can eat it at your desk. Fix a healthy breakfast to start your day off right.


Skip unhealthy breakfasts, like donuts, cake, pizza, or sugary cereals.
Try healthy smoothies with fruit and proteins, like nut butters. You can eat healthy muffins, like these flax seed muffins or vegan chocolate walnut muffins.
Take leftover steamed vegetables from the night before and a boiled egg or a piece of chicken. Eggs, avocado, and nuts are another good breakfast. You can try making your breakfast the night before.;
, Keeping healthy snacks at hand helps you avoid going too long without food, which can lead to unhealthy choices like a candy bar from the vending machine or fast food.Pre-portion these into one zip-lock bag for each day, to prevent over-eating.


Fruit is some of the most portable, pre-portioned foods out there. Bring an apple, orange, or banana with you to boost your blood sugar during a busy day.
Try healthy granola or fruit bars. Avoid bars with a lot of added sugars, hydrogenated oils, and unhealthy ingredients. Make your own granola bars if you can.
Portable protein sources include mixed nuts, cheese sticks, jerky, and no-sugar-added nut butters.

, Staying hydrated is very important, and water is essential for your overall health. Plus, water doesn’t contain additives or extra sugars. When you are at your desk, switch out your calorie and sugar heavy sodas with water. Replacing just a few sodas each day with water will significantly lower the amount of calories and sugar you consume.You should drink eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day.
Buy a reusable water bottle and keep it full and in your bag so you always have access to it.
Try adding a dash of lemon or lime to the water, or drink natural seltzer waters.

, No matter what you plan, you may find yourself going out to dinner or lunch with friends and co-workers, or maybe you are too busy and decide to go out. This doesn’t mean you just give up your healthy eating plan. Instead, make healthy choices by choosing a restaurant that serves healthy food or choosing a healthy entree.Choose health-focused restaurants when possible, include vegan, vegetarian, and all-natural locales.
Search online or ask a server to find the nutrition information of the meals, or ask about ""light"" or healthy meals, such as grilled chicken or fish with a side of vegetables.
Most restaurants offer larger portions than necessary. Consider having an appetizer as your meal, or splitting a meal with a friend. If you order a full entree, stop as soon as you are full and ask for the plate to be taken away (or put in a to-go box).
Skip fried foods, fatty salad dressings and sauces, and other unhealthy items.

, Alcohol adds calories and sugars to your daily diet. While a glass of red wine can be beneficial and an occasional beer or mixed drink won’t hurt, you should limit the amount of alcohol you consume on a daily basis.Dietary guidelines from the U.S. government recommend no more than one drink on a given day for women, or two drinks for men.In this system, one drink is 12 ounces of beer with 5% alcohol, 8 oz of 7% malt liquor, 5 oz of 12% wine, or 1.5 oz of 40% liquor.This means a large glass of wine or a tall cocktail could actually count as two drinks.
When you go out with coworkers or friends, limit yourself to one drink after work. At night, consider replacing your nightly beers with a fruit and greens smoothie.

, If the junk food is there, you will probably eat it. To help keep you from getting home from a long day and binge eating ice cream or chips, don’t buy any junk food. If it’s not there for you to eat, you can’t make bad choices when you are hungry and tired.Instead, keep healthy snacks around the house. Buy cottage cheese and pineapple instead of ice cream, or buy kale chips instead of potato chips.

Start with ingredients you like.,
Make simple one-pot meals.,
Limit your choices.,
Use recipes that are relatively hands-off.,
Look for recipes with fewer than five ingredients.,
Learn a handful of easy recipes.,
Take a cooking class.",How to Enjoy Healthy Meals when You Hate to Cook2," It may seem obvious, but if you're cooking something you don't particularly enjoy eating, it stands to reason that you won't enjoy the act of preparing it. Just because you're eating healthy doesn't mean you have to dislike your food.For example, you may dislike eating ""rabbit food"" — raw vegetables, such as in a salad. There's nothing wrong with that, but there's also no reason you wouldn't like those same vegetables if they were cooked. Cooked vegetables are just as healthy as raw vegetables, and they often taste much sweeter. Try tossing carrots or broccoli with a little olive oil and roasting them in a hot oven for about 15 minutes.

, If you already dislike cooking, the last thing you want to do is juggle a main course and two or three separate sides. Casseroles and stir fry can be healthy and well-balanced without requiring complicated logistics.Soups and stews also are inexpensive and easy things to make that require minimal time in the kitchen. These recipes also are versatile, in that you can often substitute ingredients that you like or add ingredients for variety.

, If you've accumulated dozens of cookbooks or bookmarked hundreds of websites in an attempt to find healthy meals to prepare, you may be overwhelmed. Rather than trying to read everything, choose 10 to 15 recipes you like and isolate them.Each week, look through those few recipes and pick two or three, rather than going through every recipe or cookbook you own before every dinner.
Occasionally, go back through and find a few recipes to substitute, especially if you feel like you're getting tired of a particular thing.

, Especially if you're tired at the end of a busy day, the last thing you want to do is slave over a hot stove for hours. Beat this issue by keeping one or two recipes around that require minimal effort.Look for one-pot dinners and full meals that can be prepared and cooked in 20 minutes or less. With these recipes, you can cook something healthy yourself in less time than it would take to microwave a prepared meal or wait for takeout.
If you've planned your menu for the whole week in advance, take the ebbs and flows of your week into account as you choose your meals. For example, if you know that you have a big meeting on Tuesday and are probably going to be exhausted afterward, plan a quick meal for that evening that is relatively hands-off and requires minimal preparation — or that uses ingredients you already prepped for the meal the night before.

, If you're just starting out and you hate to cook, there's no need to suffer through a complicated recipe with a dozen ingredients that requires hours of prep time.When you're choosing recipes, try to find overlap. That way you can prep foods at once and then you'll have the preparation done for the next meal in advance. For example, if you found a nice broccoli casserole, you might do a beef and broccoli stir-fry the next day.
Simple recipes can be just as delicious and impressive as complicated and temperamental ones, and there's a lot less room for error.

, To enjoy anything, you have to be relatively adept at it. If you use a few recipes repeatedly until you can create the dish without having to dig out the instructions, you'll feel more comfortable experimenting and start having fun in the kitchen.After you've done something several times, you've identified the spots that give you trouble and you'll start to intuitively know what to do each step of the way.
Quick, simple recipes also can serve as back-ups if you have a planned menu for the week, but for whatever reason aren't interested in the meal you had planned for a particular night.
Having a recipe memorized also builds your confidence to try new things, such as more complicated recipes or those that require more preparation time.

, Sometimes people say they hate to cook simply because they've never really tried to cook before, and they don't know how or are afraid they'll mess something up. If you have limited experience in the kitchen, a cooking class can help you get better acquainted.There are some basic skills involved in cooking that you need to learn before you can perform adequately. If you don't know how to use basic kitchen tools, or you're extraordinarily slow, this can impact whether you like to cook.
Check with your local community center or public library and find out if there are any cooking classes in your area. If there's a community college near you, they may offer cooking classes as well.

Those you do have, you may have never used or understand how to use them effectively.For example, a good chef's knife will cut down on prep time by enabling you to slice and chop fruits and vegetables quicker and more efficiently.
You may want to rearrange the items in your kitchen so that utensils and pots and pans are more convenient. If you have to dig through disorganized cabinets to find what you need, you probably will be less interested in the entire cooking experience.

, Sometimes, hatred of cooking is tied to a dislike of a particular preparation skill, or a particular cooking process. For labor-intensive activities such as chopping and slicing, you can buy gadgets that will do all or most of the work for you.For example, you can buy salad chopping tongs that will chop up your salad ingredients as you toss them — saving you time and effort by allowing you to do two things at the same time.
If you've ever been flummoxed by a recipe that called only for one egg yolk, you might consider buying a yolk extractor that can take care of that task for you with ease.
Look for gadgets that are directly related to foods you like to eat on a regular basis, or that can be used in a variety of different recipes for multiple meals. No gadget is worth your money if it's just going to sit in the back of a cabinet gathering dust.

, There are many foods that you can prep — or even cook — in advance and save for later. This can help you enjoy healthy meals when you hate to cook, because you'll be cooking less often.Choose individual-serving sized containers, or containers with dividers so you can separate the main course from the sides. You may want to get a whole set so you have enough containers to hold at least a week's worth of meals.
For example, you can make large quantities of pasta, casseroles, or stir fries and freeze the leftovers to eat earlier. After the initial investment in the containers, your meals will end up being cheaper than buying frozen dinners — and just as convenient.
If you have the time, carve out a couple of hours to cook several different meals at once. Divide them into individual servings and freeze them so you have them throughout the week. Make sure you label each container with its contents and the date you cooked it so you don't keep anything too long.

, Especially during the colder months, stews are a healthy and filling meal option that take minimal prep time and work. Simply add the ingredients to the slow-cooker and turn it on.If you prep your ingredients the night before, then add them to the slow-cooker in the morning, you also minimize the length of time you're in the kitchen. When you get home from work, your dinner will be ready and waiting for you.
The other good thing about slow-cookers for people who hate to cook is that they usually make large batches, which means you'll have plenty of leftovers for other days.

, You can have the cleanest, best-equipped kitchen in the world and still not feel like cooking for whatever reason. On those occasions, it can be best to remember that you can enjoy healthy meals without doing any cooking at all.While some foods must be cooked to be eaten, there are plenty of foods that can be eaten raw and will provide the same health benefits as they would if they were cooked. Some foods are even more nutritious eaten raw.
Include around 20 – 30 grams of protein, some fruits and vegetables, and a good source of healthy carbs, such as whole grains or rice.
For example, you might have a sandwich on whole-grain bread with turkey or chicken sliced in the grocery store deli. Add to this a colorful salad and a piece of fruit and you have a healthy meal without having to cook at all.

Do meal prep on the weekends.,
Buy pre-chopped food.,
Cook meals in one dish.,
Use a slow cooker.,
Divide the work with your household.,
Try a food delivery service.",How to Eat Well when You Are Busy2," If you know that you will be working late every day, you should work on meal prep on the weekend. For example, separate vegetables and meat (raw or cooked) into single-serving portions. Freeze them in separate containers so you can easily and quickly combine ingredients into a stir fry or casserole.Make granola, homemade granola bars, breakfast muffins, or hard-boiled eggs to eat as snacks over the next few days.
Instead of buying prepackaged unhealthy freezer meals, make large batches of food on the weekend that you can freeze for the week. Casseroles are great for freezing and heating back up. Search online for recipes that are great for freezing.

, If you don’t think you will have time to do meal prep on the weekends, buy your food already pre-chopped and pre-separated. You can find pre-cut veggies, like broccoli, cauliflower, or squash, individually wrapped cuts of meat, or pre-packaged fruit and nut butters. Go for healthy soup or side dish mixes to help make it easier.You can grab your pre-chopped ingredients to make a quick lunch or dinner, or take them as a snack.

, Sometimes cooking meals is time intensive because you have multiple dishes to make in multiple pots and pans. Instead, work on putting everything together in one pot. This might be a crock pot, a stove top pot, a wok, a skillet, or a casserole dish.For example, you can throw all your vegetables and some chicken or beef into a wok or skillet to make a stir fry or saute dish. Try putting meat, vegetables, and sauce into a casserole dish for a quick healthy meal.
Most one pot meals make enough that you can carry leftovers for lunch or eat them the next night.

, Cooking with a slow cooker can save you a lot of time. You can throw your pre-chopped ingredients into the slow cooker in the morning, and then when you get home at night, dinner will be done. Slow cooker recipes can be healthy and delicious, and you can cook a wide variety of foods in one.Search online for slow cooker recipes. You don’t have to cook just chili or stew. You can cook just about anything in a slow cooker.

, If you live with someone who shares your healthy priorities, try alternating which nights you cook or pack lunches. Sharing the responsibility makes it easier to stick to a healthy diet when you are busy., If you are too busy to do your own shopping, have someone else do it for you. Many grocery stores offer delivery where you select your foods online and have them delivered straight to your door. You may also choose a healthy snack subscription service, where every month you get a box in the mail full of healthy, convenient snacks.There are also services that will deliver all the ingredients and the recipe for healthy meals to your door. All you have to do is put all the ingredients together and cook them.
Though some of these services can be pricey, it may be worth the convenience of you having healthy foods delivered straight to your door so you don’t have to take the time to do it yourself.

Create menus.,
Make a grocery list.,
Stay dedicated to eating healthy.",How to Eat Well when You Are Busy3," Thinking ahead is a good way to eat healthy when you have a busy schedule. Look at the next week and decide what you want to eat for lunch and dinner every day. This can give you a sense of what you will need to take out of the freezer to thaw, what you need to prepare ahead of time, and save you the time of figuring out a meal on the fly.When you are hungry and get home after a long day, not knowing what you want to cook for dinner can lead to unhealthy decisions, like take-out. Instead, with a menu you will already know what you are going to cook.
If there are days you get home later than others, you can plan easier meals or leftovers for those nights.

, When you go grocery shopping for the week or month, you should take a list with you. This helps you have a clear plan for what you will eat. It also keeps you from buying random ingredients you don’t need, or ingredients that are not healthy for you. Instead, you will have a list of all your healthy ingredients to buy.Taking a grocery list also ensures that you have everything you will need for all of your meals for the week.

, It is extremely easy to slip when we are busy. Having a dedication to your goal of eating healthy can help you maintain your plan and make healthier food choices. This can help you stay motivated even when you are busy.Taking just a moment to think “I want to eat healthy” can help you avoid slipping up and making a bad choice.

Make sure your tourniquet has been applied properly.,
Put a warm pack or water bottle over the area.,
Use proper palpation techniques.,
Tell the patient to relax.,
Verify patient information.,
Locate the vein.,
Disinfect the area.,
Perform the venipuncture.Anchor the vein by pulling the skin below the vein taut.,
Apply pressure to the puncture area for 5 minutes after the needle is out to stop the bleeding.,
Dispose of the needle in a hard sided, biohazard container.

,
Double check the labeling on the tube to make sure it is accurate.

,
Look for another vein if the median cubital vein is not visible.,
Notice sites to avoid.,
Correct improper needle placement.,
Give up and have a colleague do the procedure if your second attempt fails.",How to Draw Blood from Hard to Hit Veins," Applying a tourniquet increases the amount of blood in the vein to make them stand out more. The tourniquet should not be so tight that it cuts off the circulation.The tourniquet should be put on the arm about four inches above the vein.
A blood pressure cuff that is inflated to 40–60 mm Hg also works well.;
, Warmth will make the patient's veins dilate and expand, making them easier to see., Contrary to popular culture, you should palpate the arm, rather than slapping it. Slapping the skin is poor technique that may result in a hematoma. Use your index finger to look for a vein, which feels soft and spongy. Don't use your thumb, as it contains its own pulse.


The warm pack or water bottle should be put on the area before it is disinfected. Nothing more should touch the area after it is disinfected.
Do not apply the warm pack or water bottle directly to the skin. Wrap it in a thin towel to prevent burns. If it hurts, it is too hot.

, Many people have needle phobias and nervousness and apprehension is a normal response. Stress not only makes the veins hard to hit, but it could also negatively affect the test results (particularly for biochemistry panels). Reassure your patient and explain that the pain is very brief and minor.


Tell your patient to try visualization and deep breathing.
Observe your patient and have them lie down on their back if you think they might faint. This will improve the blood flow to their head. It also reduces their chances of falling and injuring themselves if they do pass out.

, Verify the patient name, date of birth and reason for blood draw and check the labeling to ensure no mistakes are made. Mislabeling could lead to difficulty processing or even safety issues down the line.

, The inside of the elbow is generally the preferred location because the median cubital vein is usually easily visible. The median cubital vein runs between the muscles and may be clearly visible as a blue bulge in the inside of your elbow. If it cannot be seen it can usually be felt. It is also relatively easy to access because the tissue around it prevents it from rolling away from the needle.
Avoid drawing blood from a place where your veins divide or join together. Doing so increases risk of bleeding under the skin.

, A common disinfectant is 70 percent alcohol. Wipe an area that is at least two centimeters by two centimeters for at least a half a minute. After a minute or two it will have dried.Alcohol is better than iodine because if the iodine gets into the blood it can alter values that the lab may be looking for. If you do use iodine, follow it with a 70% alcohol swab.
Allow the disinfectant to dry before inserting the needle. Do not blow on or fan it with your hand as this will contaminate the area.

, This will prevent the vein from rolling.
Insert the needle in at a 15 to 30 degree angle and then hold it still while collecting blood.
Fill the collection tube with blood, following the order of draw as specified by your laboratory.
Release the tourniquet after 1 minute and before removing the needle. Leaving the tourniquet on for longer than a minute will affect the concentration of red blood cells, possibly altering the test. Withdrawing the needle while the tourniquet is still on will result in pain.

,,,, If you cannot find the vein in the inside of the elbow in either arm, look for another one.Move down the forearm looking for the basilic vein or cephalic vein. These veins may also be visible through the skin. Have the patient lower their arm and make a fist to make the veins more obvious.The cephalic vein runs along the radial side of the forearm. The basilic vein runs along the ulnar side. The basilic vein is less frequently used than the cephalic. It is more likely to roll away from the needle than the cephalic vein because it is not held as tightly in place by the tissues around it.
If no veins can be accessed, find the metacarpal veins on the back of the hands. They are usually very visible and can be palpated. They should not be used for elderly patients because the skin is not as supple and does not support the veins as well. In addition, the veins themselves become more fragile.

, Do not draw blood from areas that:Are near an infection
Have scarring
Have a healed burn
Are on an arm that is on the same side as where the patient had a mastectomy or fistula placed
Are bruised
Are above an IV line
Are on an arm where the patient has a cannula, fistula, or vascular graft

, Occasionally, you may encounter problems with the needle, such as going too far into the tissues or inserting it at too low of an angle (so the bevel is against the wall of the vein and impedes blood flow).Pull the needle back a little bit without removing it from the skin.
Change the angle of the needle while it is still under the skin so that it can be inserted into the vein.

, Protocol in many laboratories dictates that phlebotomists must attempt a venipuncture two times, and to have another person do it if both attempts are unsuccessful."

As one who did patient care for over a decade before becoming a medical salesman, I'd like to offer these recommendations to those patient caregivers who are perhaps new to their profession:;
,
Do not let those in the pharmaceutical or medical device industries, for example, interfere with or take priority over patient care.

,
Do not let the industry befriend your staff to gain access to doctors that work with them who are restoring the health of their patients.

,
Do have nurses only accept drug samples from drug reps. No literature of any kind from them.,
Do let those you work with know they have a right to refuse interaction with the medical industries in their practice.

,
Do not answer questions from drug reps about what doctors prefer prescribing for their patients as it relates to their promoted products, or anything else about the health care providers at your location, for that matter.

,
Do not accept any promotional material unless it is truly beneficial for their patients, without branding on the material offered to members who work at your clinic or medical institution.

,
Do let the nurses know that drug reps. are overall not in their clinical setting to facilitate patient care, but to rather increase the volume of what they many be promoting, as this is the etiology for their interaction with you.

,
Do let others who you work with that, if asked by medical representatives to have a disease screening day of some sort at your facility, or has invitations for such a screening for you or others to attend, consider refusing this request.,
Do make others you may work with aware, or reiterate to them, that generic drugs are preferred over branded drugs for many reasons, including cost and experience with the medication while providing the safety and efficacy your patients need.,
Do let the nurse know that drug reps have in their possession the prescribing or buying habits of health care providers, and will tailor their interaction with them and the prescribes based on this data.

,
Do let others you may work with know that the drug reps are, overall, decent and friendly people who are just doing what they are instructed to do by their employer, and they should be aware of what they may be doing could be detrimental to the health of their patients, if such situations develop.

,
Do let those you may work with know that medical representatives who may be in your patient treatment area can question doctors about what they may choose to prescribe a patient.,
Do let others you may work with know that there are doctors who receive inducements, incentives, rebates, and remuneration from particular drug reps.,
Let others you may work with know that pharmaceuticals are not the answer to all symptoms or medical conditions.,
Let others who may work with you know that they should make patient care paramount when seeing patients, and should not let the industry coerce them into thinking otherwise.,
Let others you may work with know that, in the U.S., medical reps. have little training, education, or clinical knowledge relevant to what they may be promoting, however may have charming personalities and appear to possess quality genetic stock.,
Let others you may work with know that whatever is done for or with patients should be entirely for their benefit, and not for the benefit of a drug company or a health care provider, if such a situation develops or are noticed.

,
Speaking from the perception of the situation in the U.S., there is a shortage of nurses, and the demands on them are cumbersome and exhausting.,
Let others you may work with know that their vocations are noble and needed, and what they do for others most choose not to consider, such as drug reps., for example.

",How to Do Patient Care Without Interruptions,",,, Likely, any clinical information the drug rep may have regarding the drug samples he or she may leave you is inaccurate.

,,,,, Often, the screenings are conducted by front groups to expand the diagnostic boundaries of a particular disease state.

, Such drugs are listed in what is called an Orange Book.

,,, Yet such representatives should be aware that their time at your patient treatment area is limited.

, These gifts that are actually bribes are largely based on the prescriber's affinity for the drug. rep's promoted products or the volume of prescriptions a doctor writes compared with other health care providers. The potential consequences of accepting such bribes which the industry calls many things, including 'gifts', could have on the health of patients and the choices of treatment for them. Such bribing may cloud the judgment of the health care providers who receive such gifts..

, This is of particular importance when it comes to the issue of utilizing psychotropic drugs and antibiotics, as drugs are very over-utilized in the United States.

, In other words, their idealism and passion straight out of school should be maintained, however difficult this may be at times. As a patient caregiver, you may get overwhelmed at times.

, What they may share with you about their promoted drugs is likely embellished or fabricated, if not fully understood by the medical representative.

,, Remind the nurses that this should not affect the treatment and care they give their patients, as difficult as this may be for the nurses. The pharma industry only amplifies this situation in various ways at certain times and locations. To say again, do not allow others to interfere with patient care.

Paraphrase responses.,
Reflect his feelings.,
Refrain from unsupportive behavior.,
Look him in the eye.,
Keep your body open and relaxed.,
Talk like you care.,
Get her to plan ahead for important dates.,
Encourage him to commemorate with ritual.,
Encourage her to express his grief through art.,
Create a memory book.,
Use the open-chair technique.,
Don't push.",How to Do Grief Counseling," Each person’s experience with grief is different. That means that no level of expertise will equip you to tell the person in mourning how he should respond. Your role is to provide company, listen, and validate their feelings.


Don’t tell, listen.
Constantly reinforce that their response is normal and natural.
Encourage them to use their own skills to cope with grief. If they are an artist, encourage them to use this ability to express his feelings.
Help them understand and recognize their feelings.
Help them develop a schedule that allows them to manage their daily tasks while reducing unnecessary outside stressors.
Remember that your job is to be there, not to take away the pain. That is impossible. Your job is to support them, not to try to fix them.;
, It is important to make it clear that you understand the person's feelings. Be sure that they know that such feelings are natural and that people experience grief differently. It might be useful to explain some of the common responses to grief and make it clear that they are natural.Those who experience instrumental grief focus on problem solving and try to control emotional responses.
Those who experience intuitive grieving have intense emotional experiences that might include depression and thoughts about mortality.It is common for people to blame themselves, feel anger, hopelessness, anxiety, and withdrawal from the world., Don’t ask leading questions or “yes” and “no” questions. Ask big, broad questions, that encourage him to think about his feelings and explore the subjects that he is interested in. Make it clear that you want to know what he feels, but are not questioning the validity of his feelings.


Do not ask “why” questions. These make it sound as if you do not understand or support his feelings.Ask broad questions like “How do you feel?”
Ask “What bothers you the most?”
Instead of asking “Why do you feel that way?” ask “Could you give me specific examples?”, When you are trying to get to the core of her problems, try giving a short summary of what you think she has told you. This will demonstrate that you are listening and might help her get a better grip on what is bothering her the most.


If she tells you, “I stay up every night thinking about him. When I go to work I am tired and can’t think clearly. I am getting more and more nervous and depressed because I can’t function during the day.” Ask, “So your grief is causing sleep problems that disrupt your life?”

, When you get a sense for how he feels, verify that you have correctly understood his emotions. This is a way to demonstrate that you are listening and that you have developed an emotional connection.


Try, “Sounds like you are very angry about what has happened.”
Alternatively, “It sounds like you are having difficulty understanding your emotions.”, Everything you do should be directed at her. Anything that suggests your focus is elsewhere will be counterproductive. You should avoid forcing your own solutions upon her.


Do not watch the clock.
Do not take notes.
Do not look around the room.
Do not try to read too much into her feelings and impose your own idea or her feelings on her.
Do not preach or lecture about what she should do.
Refrain from giving too much advice or asking too many questions.
Do not respond too quickly. Allow moments of silence.
Do not change the subject.
Do not talk too much about yourself., Look him in the eye to show that you are interested in and engaged with what he is saying. Allow your face to demonstrate that you are emotional and supportive. Be dynamic and engaged, possibly nodding in affirmation., Crossed legs and arms may suggest that you are closed off or uninviting. Try to sit straight up, with your limbs open. Your body should appear relaxed and you can gesture with your hands to show emotional support.


Also be sure that your body is facing directly toward the grieving person to indicate that you are engaged with her.
Sit on the same level as the person you are talking to. Do not take a chair that allows you to tower over her, or her over you. This creates a sense of power imbalance that is not helpful for open conversation., Talk naturally and allow your voice to show emotion. Try to develop a soothing tone in your voice. Your conversation style should also demonstrate that you are there to listen. Don’t interrupt him, jump from topic to topic, or rush him to an answer.


It is okay to leave periods of silence. These allow him to think about his feelings and ensure that he does not feel that he has been cut off or is rushed to respond., Holidays or important dates in the person's relationship with the person she lost can trigger feelings of loss. Encourage her to plan ahead to commemorate those days. This can help her create a feeling of continuity with the past or create the sense that you are moving on.


While it is particularly useful to develop a ritual for special dates, there is no reason why the griever shouldn’t plan to celebrate or remember the deceased any other day., There is a plethora of rituals he can use to remember his loved lost one. Which one he picks depends on his relationship with the person and what it was that once brought them together. Some examples include:


Preparing a meal that the deceased enjoyed.
Watch a movie that the person enjoyed.
Go on a walk, possibly where the two of had been in the past, and remember times spent together.
Buy flowers on important days.
Travel somewhere the deceased wanted to go.
Listen to music that reminds the grieving person of the deceased.
Look through a photo album., Ask her to write fiction, personal essays, or poetry that expresses and identifies feelings and blockages. You can encourage artists to paint or draw. Starting a journal can be an important step for dealing with emotions.


Ask her to try writing about the life of the person she lost.
Alternatively, have her write about how that person has influenced her. Remind her that the deceased lives on through her. , Memory books can help in the grieving process. Compile mementos, photos or stories about the deceased person. This helps one come to terms with the magnitude of the loss and to focus on the realities of one’s new life without forgetting the lost loved one., Place an open chair opposite the grieving person and ask her to imagine the deceased person sitting in that chair. Give the bereaved person the opportunity to speak to the person in the chair and say all the things that she would like to have said to that person.Playing out situations from the past or rehearsing difficult future situations may help bring closure.
The use of objects and memorabilia, such as jewelry and other objects which the bereaved person is comfortable with, can be used to facilitate talking and bringing the mourning process to a close.

, Some people will want to clear their heads or process their loss before trying to commemorate their loved one. Many people have difficulty talking about what has happened. It is your job to give the grieving party ideas about how to move on. It is not your job to force them to do something they do not want to do.

Set up an appointment with your doctor to determine which medication and dosage would work best for your specific situation.Armoured Acidophilus is one of these medications that acts on the lining of the lungs.;
, One of the most common treatments of lung infections is an inhalable corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are medications that resemble a chemical, called cortisol, that your body produces.

, Another treatment option is to take an anti-fungal medication that will help to prevent ergosterol formation. Yeast cells need ergosterol to keep up the strength of their cell membranes. Anti-fungal medications include:


Triazoles and Fluconazole.

, Molybdenum is a mineral that may help to stop yeast from producing alcohol in your body. When the production of alcohol is slowed down, you will likely feel less dizzy and your alertness and appetite may increase.150 mg tablets of Molybdenum can be taken twice a day.

, Chlorella is a wholesome food that has a composite combination of minerals, essential vitamins and enzymes. Chlorella helps to boost immune functions, neutralize pesticides in your body, and remove toxins.Dosage: The recommended dose is to take one to two capsules three times a day.

Recognize common signs and symptoms of meningitis.Meningitis frequently begins with flu-like symptoms, and may evolve from there to become more serious.Signs and symptoms to be on the lookout for include:Fever
Nausea and/or vomiting
Severe headache
Unusual sleepiness
Decreased appetite
A skin rash (this is most often a later stage symptom)
Neck stiffness (this is most often a later stage symptom)
Sensitivity to light called ""photophobia"" (this is most often a later stage symptom);
,
Know how meningitis presents in newborns.Meningitis presents differently in newborns (and children under the age of two) than it does in older children and adults.,
Seek immediate medical help when needed.One of the keys to successfully treating meningitis is to diagnose it quickly.,
Seek medical evaluation if you have been around someone with meningitis.Another important thing to note is that, if you have been in the presence of someone who has been diagnosed with meningitis, it is important for you to seek medical evaluation as well to make sure that you do not have it.,
Go for a blood test.One of the first things your doctor will do if he suspects that you may have meningitis is take a blood test.,
Obtain a CT scan of your head.If your doctor suspects that you may have meningitis, you will also be sent for a CT scan of your head.,
Receive a lumbar puncture.A lumbar puncture is the one sure way to determine whether or not you have meningitis.,
Ask your doctor for antibiotics.If there is a great enough suspicion that you may have bacterial meningitis, your doctor will initiate treatment with broad-spectrum (very generalized) antibiotics, even before definitive test results become available.,
Inquire about corticosteroids.Another treatment that may be given in conjunction with antibiotics is corticosteroids.,
Receive supportive treatment.For all types of meningitis, supportive treatment is offered in addition to medications to help with your recovery.,
Understand that viral meningitis is treated differently.Viral meningitis is much less worrisome than bacterial meningitis, and it is important to note that antibiotics will not be effective in treating viral meningitis (although they may still be offered to prevent what is called ""secondary bacterial infection"" - when a viral infection turns into a more serious bacterial one).",How to Diagnose Meningitis,", Signs and symptoms to be aware of in babies include:


Fever
Unusual sleepiness and/or irritability (such as constant crying)
Swelling in the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of your baby's head)
Poor feeding
Neck stiffness

, This is because the faster that medical treatment can be received, the better, both in terms of preventing spread and reducing your risk of dying from it. It is important to seek immediate medical care if you or someone else exhibits any of the following:


Neck stiffness in addition to flu-like symptoms. Neck stiffness is one of the cardinal signs that often differentiates meningitis from a general flu-like illness; if you or someone else presents with this symptom, it is important to see a doctor immediately.
Flu-like symptoms that seem more severe than normal.
It is important to understand that bacterial meningitis can be very serious and even fatal if not treated immediately.
If in doubt, seek a professional medical opinion sooner rather than later.

, This is especially important if the affected person was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis.

, Your blood will be examined for an elevated white blood cell count (a common sign of an infection), and your blood will also be cultured in a specialized dish to see what microorganisms (such as bacteria) grow.


If microorganisms such as bacteria are found in your blood (in what is called the ""blood culture""), your doctor can confirm the presence of an infection and can know which bug is responsible for it.
Your doctor can also test the bug that has grown in the dish for its ""antibiotic susceptibility."" What this means is that he can see which antibiotics are or are not effective at killing the specific microorganism that has infected your body.

, You will most likely receive this through the Emergency Room, to ensure that you get it quickly.


The purpose of the CT scan is to evaluate for any unusual swelling in your head area, and to check that it is safe for your doctors to proceed with what is called a ""lumbar puncture"" (the one test that can confirm for sure whether or not you have meningitis).If there is excessive swelling or inflammation, it may be too dangerous to perform a lumbar puncture (a spinal cord tap) due to the risk of what is called ""brain herniation."" This is when brain tissue gets compressed, which can lead to death.

, After a CT scan has been performed to ensure that it is safe, your doctor will insert a needle into your spinal canal to get a sample of ""CSF"" (cerebrospinal fluid). Your CSF will then be tested for the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms, among other things.


If you have meningitis, your lumbar puncture will most likely show the results of low glucose (sugar), elevated white blood cells (immune cells), and increased protein.
Your doctor can also culture your CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) to see if any bacteria or microorganisms grow.
If so, your doctor can perform ""susceptibility testing"" to determine which antibiotics (or other antimicrobial agents) the bugs that are present are susceptible to (i.e., to determine the most effective choice of treatment for you moving forward).

, This is because bacterial meningitis can be very dangerous and even fatal if not treated promptly. Therefore, doctors are trained to err on the side of caution and to give you the antibiotics until further test results become available.


If a bacterial meningitis is confirmed, your doctor will likely choose a more specific antibiotic for you moving forwards.
The choice of antibiotic will depend upon the results of the ""susceptibility testing;"" in other words, on which antibiotic was shown to have superior efficacy at treating the specific strain of bacterial meningitis that you have.

, These are immune suppressing agents that can reduce potentially dangerous inflammation in the brain area and meninges (the specific area that meningitis affects).


Note that, in more severe cases, anti-convulsant (anti-seizure) medications may also be needed.
This is because the infection and subsequent inflammation surrounding the brain area can lead to seizures in some of the more severe cases.

, Elements of supportive care that will be offered and/or recommended by your physician include:


Stopping all daily activities such as work and other things, and resting in bed until you show enough positive signs of recovery.
Drinking plenty of fluids to keep your hydration levels in a safe and appropriate range. IV fluids may be given in a hospital setting if oral fluids alone are insufficient.
Receiving pain medications to reduce your fever and body aches as needed.

,


If it is determined that you have viral meningitis, the mainstays of treatment are supportive care, as well as plenty of rest and ongoing medical supervision and check-ups until you recover.
If you have viral meningitis caused by HSV (the herpes simplex virus), you may receive antiviral treatment. However, all other causes of viral meningitis do not currently have treatment available.

Accept that nursing work will always come with some situations that aren’t ideal. Look for creative ways to work with or around these situations, instead of trying to change them.You might not be able to control your hours, your co-workers, and your patients, but you can control your reactions to demanding situations.;
, Instead of letting work-related worries get the better of you, shift your focus to problem-solving. When you find yourself stressing about something you can control, figure out what you need to do to resolve the situation. Then break the solution down into simple steps that you can take one at a time.For instance, if you feel like you never have enough time to get everything done during a shift, brainstorm or do some research to come up with organizational techniques that will help you work more efficiently.

, As a nurse, you might put pressure on yourself to do a perfect job every day, but that’s not a reasonable expectation. Notice when you start putting yourself down or thinking in all-or-nothing terms. Remind yourself that you’re doing the best job you can and that you don’t have to be superhuman to care for your patients well.For instance, if you can’t stop thinking about one mistake you made, remind yourself of all the other things you’ve done right.

, Poor time management can be a major source of stress. Get into the habit of leaving for work a few minutes early, so you can feel calm and collected when you arrive. If you struggle to get enough sleep or spend time with your loved ones, use a planner or an app to build these activities into your daily schedule., Taking the time to do some relaxation exercises can help you feel calmer and more centered for the rest of the day. At work, you can use deep breathing techniques or do visualization exercises. At home, try meditating or writing in a journal., Social support is an essential part of keeping your stress levels down. Making connections with your fellow nurses will give you a sense of camaraderie and help you get through tough shifts together. Befriend your coworkers by taking breaks together and finding humor in your work when you can., It’s okay to say “no” when someone asks you to take an extra shift you know you can’t manage. You’re not doing yourself, your workplace, or your patients any favors if you’re too tired to function. Don’t feel guilty for knowing and respecting your limits., Seeing your loved ones can be a great reprieve from work-related stress, and your friends and family can provide a caring ear when you need someone to talk to. Social support is one of the biggest keys to overall wellness, so nurture your relationships outside of the workplace.Even if you don’t have a great deal of free time, a quick phone call or a chat over a cup of coffee can help you stay connected with your loved ones.

, Carve out some time every day to do something that matters to you. Whether you prefer working on creative projects, learning new skills, or participating in faith-based activities, maintaining a well-rounded life will refill your emotional well and keep your overall stress levels down., Burnout is a condition that can happen when you’ve been stressed and overworked for too long. If you feel exhausted, unmotivated, and cynical much of the time, you could be burned out from the pressure of work. Burnout is usually a sign that you need to reevaluate your priorities and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle.Burnout can also show up in physical ways like unexplained headaches or backaches as well as changes in your sleep or appetite. Some people may even turn to drugs or alcohol when work is becoming too stressful.
If you think you’re dealing with burnout, it’s especially important to reach out for social support and build self-care into your routine. Consider reaching out to an employee assistance program to discover more positive outlets for stress or set a goal to seek a new position or a completely different career path based on your interests and skills., Very often nurses may be so committed to the care of patients and their families that they neglect to care for themselves. If you have vacation days that are close to expiring and stress seems to be pulling you under, take a much-needed break. It appears that those who regularly vacation experience reduced stress, more positive thinking, and improved health indicators.Your vacation doesn't have to be lavish and exotic, if your budget or time doesn't allow it. Take a weekend getaway with a partner, your kids, or a close friend to a nearby city that's within driving distance. Explore your own area by visiting museums, art galleries, or finding a local hiking trail. Or, simply find a good book to read and snuggle up on your couch for a few days with a relaxing ""staycation.""

, Sleep deprivation is bad for your mood, your health, and your motivation. If you have an irregular sleep schedule, blackout curtains and earplugs may help you fall asleep more easily. Make sure to communicate with your children and partner about your sleep schedule, so they know not to wake you up.If you find it difficult to wind down at the end of a long day, consider creating a short bedtime ritual. Taking a warm bath or reading a book can help you relax enough to fall asleep.
Avoid consuming caffeine or alcohol close to bedtime.

, Exercise relieves stress, boosts your mood, and keeps you fit, all of which will help you function better at work. If you don’t have time to hit the gym regularly, try to work exercise into your everyday life. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, go for a walk with a co-worker on your lunch break, and adopt active hobbies., To stay energetic all day at work, avoid eating highly-processed, sugary foods. Candy, doughnuts, and other treats might give you a short burst of energy, but they’ll eventually make your blood sugar crash, causing mood swings and sleepiness. Instead, eat whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, which will give you a more sustained boost of energy.Prepare healthy snacks and meals ahead of time, so you don’t end up choosing less nutritious options out of convenience.

, Short naps can help you stay alert for longer periods of time and avoid fatigue-related accidents. If you’re working overnight or taking back-to-back shifts, sneaking in a catnap can be especially beneficial.Use your judgment when it comes to napping. Some workplaces don’t allow nurses to nap during their breaks.

, Caffeine can help you stay alert and energized during a long day, so don’t hesitate to have a cup or two of coffee. Avoid overdoing it, though. Too much caffeine can produce an effect similar to a sugar crash, and it can cause health problems in the long run.Avoid non-diet carbonated drinks or energy drinks. The sugar in these beverages may outweigh the benefits of the caffeine.
It typically takes 20 to 30 minutes to feel the effects of caffeine, so time your cup of coffee accordingly.

Read as much as you can about health administration careers.,
Look into the most in-demand fields of health administration.,
Gather information about getting a degree in health administration.,
Find out about scholarships, grants and fellowships for college study in health administration.",How to Decide on a Career in Health Administration," Health administrators work in the planning, directing and coordination of health and medical services. They often work in the management of medical facilities, or in the management of a clinical department, or possibly manage a group of doctors at a medical practice. As a health administrator, you will need to stay current on new healthcare laws, supervise facility staff, manage finances, and keep records of the services that the facility provides.;
, While the entire health care field as a general rule is growing quickly, some parts of it are growing faster than others. For example, there is a great deal of growth being experienced today in health practitioner offices. A great deal of services that used to be provided in hospitals are now being offered in local offices. This is particularly the case as technology gets better and less expensive.

, For an entry-level job, you should be fine with a bachelor’s degree. If you want to move into better paying jobs in upper management, you will need to eventually get a master’s degree in health administration, or MHA. Some of the top MHA schools in the country include University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and University of North Carolina.

, Even though more scholarships are available for bachelor’s degree students, you still can locate financial aid for an MHA. Once you have done an online search, you should apply for as many scholarships as you can. Then, you can go to your university financial aid office and see if there is further aid available.

Understand how your diet affects the presence of a pulmonary yeast infection.,
Cut out or reduce the amount of sugars and artificial sweeteners you eat during the initial stages of your treatment.,
Read labels on packaged food to avoid certain sweeteners and other ingredients.,
Reduce your gluten intake.,
Cut back on your alcohol intake.,
Switch to a yeast-fighting diet.",How to Cure a Yeast Infection in Your Lungs2," When you have a high sugar, refined carb, and gluten-rich diet, you increase your chances of developing a yeast infection in your lungs. While you can take medications (see Method 2) to clear up the infection, you must alter your diet if you hope to keep the infection from developing again.

, Fructose, which is found in most fruits and honey, and artificial sweeteners like Saccharin and nutrasweet, should be cut out of your diet while you work on getting better. This is because these sweets can create a good growing environment for yeast, which combats the work you are doing to try to get rid of the yeast.Avoid consuming fruit during the first two weeks of your fight against yeast. Other foods like beets and potatoes, which are also high in sugar, should also be avoided.

, Packaged food that contains the following items should be avoided because these are all sugars or sugar alternatives.


Carob powder, Maltose/malt, Aspartame, Dextrose/ crystallized dextrin, Mannitol, Galactose, Disaccharides, Maltitol, Monosaccharides, Sorghum, Xylitol, Corn starch, Maltodextrin, Suamiel, Levulose, and Sucanat.

, Most people who suffer from yeast infections of the lungs are naturally intolerant to gluten. Gluten is an elastic protein that is present in triticale, oats, rye, wheat and barley. It is also present in baked goods.Gluten grains are actually a food source of the candida yeast because they have a similar structure to sugar and a high glycemic index.

, When yeast has infected your body, the yeast actually breaks down carbohydrates you consume and turns it into a form of ethyl alcohol. Drinking more alcohol while this process is occurring will only increase the number of yeast colonies in your body.


You should stop drinking alcohol of any kind for at least the first two months of your treatment. If you start drinking again after this time period, it should be in very small amounts.

, While combating the yeast in your body, you should tailor your diet to help speed up the healing process. While the diet itself is not a definitive cure, it can help neutralize the harm the yeast is causing your body.


The average yeast control diet contains little or no sugar, no processed food and very low carbohydrate consumption. High amount of proteins (except those derived from gluten and soya) must be consumed.
Eat vegetables like cabbage, lettuce, kale, mustard greens, horseradish, celery, pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, onions, tomatoes and garlic.
Cook with coconut, fish, or palm oil, rather than butter.
Meat and fat in your diet should be derived from grass fed animals while fish should be free from contamination of mercury.

Understand the primary cause of pulmonary yeast infections.,
Recognize the symptoms of pulmonary yeast infections.,
Be aware of the risks associated with pulmonary yeast infections.",How to Cure a Yeast Infection in Your Lungs3," Yeast infections are generally the by-product of a weak immune system. People who maintain poor personal hygiene, smoke, or drink excessively are more prone to candida albicans infections.

, Here are certain symptoms that are indicative of a yeast infection in your lungs:


Problems with breathing and congestion in your respiratory tract.
Breathlessness.
Loss of appetite.
Chest discomfort.
Fever.

, When Candida Albicans affects the lungs, your entire body can actually be affected. The yeast can spread throughout your body if left untreated for a long enough period of time.


Lung yeast infections should be treated as early as possible to avoid future complications like lung failure, heart failure and the slow decay of other organs.

Set up your cylinder or concentrator.,
Avoid open flames.,
Use caution around other heat sources.,
Store your cylinder or concentrator in a secure place.,
Take caution in your car.",How to Do Oxygen Therapy1," Since very few oxygen systems work the same way, typically your doctor or medical supplies provider will show you how to work your specific system. You may even be able to have your medical supplier help you set up your system in-home so that you don't have to do it on your own., Oxygen can facilitate combustion, so it is important to avoid open flames and easily flammable materials such as petroleum while using supplemental oxygen. Avoid the use of matches, lighters, candles, cigarettes, and other flammable products in your home.You may choose to place “no smoking” and “no open flame” signs around your house to help remind both you and your guests that you should not use an open flame in a house with supplemental oxygen.
Lotions and creams that use petroleum are more likely to ignite in the presence of pure oxygen. Opt for water-based products instead to help keep you safe., While other heat sources that do not use an open flame can be used in an environment with supplemental oxygen, they should be used with caution. At least five feet of distance is recommended between the oxygen source and the heat source., Your tank or concentrator should be stored upright in an area where it will not be an obstruction, such as areas where people typically walk through a room. Use a secure cart or stand to help you store your tank upright. Do not allow a tank to stand or lean in an upright position, as the tank will be easier to knock over, which could harm you or your home. Do not store your oxygen near heat sources or in a confined, unventilated area such as a closet. Store extra tanks by placing them flat on the floor in an area where others are unlikely to run into them, such as your garage or in a spare bedroom.
If your tank does fall, it is likely still usable. Check for dents or a hissing noise that may indicate damage to the tank. If none are found, return the tank to an upright position and continue use.

, Most portable tanks and concentrators can come with you in your car when you travel. You can even use the seat belt to help hold it in place. They should still be stored upright and secured in the vehicle. Avoid leaving your oxygen in a hot car, and do not smoke in your vehicle while transporting oxygen."
"
Get a prescription from your doctor.,
Choose a supplemental oxygen system.,
Use your oxygen as directed.,
Monitor your blood oxygen levels.",How to Do Oxygen Therapy2," Supplemental oxygen can only be acquired with a prescription from a medical professional. Talk to your doctor about any recent symptoms or illnesses you have experienced, and they will test your blood oxygen levels to determine if oxygen therapy is necessary.Blood oxygen levels are typically tested using a finger probe. Such tests are often quick and painless.

, Your prescription will indicate your specific flow rate and number of hours of oxygen therapy you need per day. Talk to your doctor about your lifestyle, work obligations, and activity level to determine the right oxygen system for you. Three are commonly available:Oxygen concentrators are typically for use in the home. These devices take the oxygen in the air and remove other gasses to output air that is between 85% and 95% oxygen.Oxygen cylinders use 100% oxygen that has been compressed under high pressure into a metal cylinder. Larger cylinders are often intended for home use, but smaller, portable cylinders are also available.Liquid oxygen uses 100% pure oxygen that has been supercooled to store in a canister. These systems do not require electricity, and can be carried or placed in a cart for portability., Your specific oxygen needs will vary depending upon your lifestyle, your blood oxygen levels, and other medical conditions. Your doctor will indicate on your prescription how long you need to use supplemental oxygen each day, and at what flow rate. Follow these instructions precisely.Too much oxygen could lead to hyperoxemia, while too little oxygen could lead to hypoxemia.Both could cause permanent damage to the brain, and in extreme cases may be fatal.This is why it is important to use your oxygen precisely as directed.

, Look into purchasing your own finger oximeter, which will typically be available from the same medical supplies company as your supplemental oxygen. Check your blood oxygen levels to make sure your saturation level stays in the 90s. If it drops below that, contact your doctor immediately to adjust your treatment."
"
Get treatment prescribed by your doctor.,
Have your blood oxygen levels checked.,
Receive treatment.",How to Do Oxygen Therapy3," Short-term oxygen therapy is undertaken at hospitals, in a doctor’s office, or in other medical settings to help raise blood oxygen levels after a temporary drop. A doctor will often prescribe oxygen treatment after checking blood oxygen levels. Typically, patients are unaware that they need oxygen, so diagnosis from a medical professional is necessary.Short-term low oxygen levels are often caused by other conditions including an asthma attack, COPD, or complications with pneumonia. Let your doctor know if you’ve had any other symptoms or illnesses recently so that they can develop a proper treatment plan.

, Checking blood oxygen levels is necessary to determine whether a patient needs oxygen therapy. A medical professional will use pulse oximetry, an indirect test done using a finger probe. Such testing is typically fast and causes no pain., Once your doctor has prescribed short-term oxygen therapy and tested your blood oxygen levels, they will administer the treatment. Oxygen can be provided in a number of ways, but is typically administered through a face mask or breathing tubes.Some conditions, including decompression sickness, may require hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is different than short-term oxygen therapy, and involves the patient being placed in a pressurized room or tube of pure oxygen."

Determine why you currently practice the “living to eat” mentality.,
Improve your nutrition by eating more healthy, whole foods, and fewer sugary, fatty, and processed foods.,
Find new ways to manage stress, or eliminate stressors from your life.,
Get more sleep on a nightly basis.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Take a break from engaging in activities that revolve around food.,

Experiment with trying new, healthy foods and ingredient swaps.,
Spend any free time doing your favorite activities that don’t involve food.,
Make an appointment with a therapist, psychologist, or similar professional who can help you conquer problems with emotional eating, if necessary.",How to Eat to Live," Do you eat out of boredom? Do you enjoy indulging in certain junk foods? Do you practice emotional eating? Determining the root cause of why you live to eat can help you along the path to eating to live.;
, Sugary, fatty, and processed foods often contain chemicals and preservatives that can throw off your body’s natural hormonal balance, and trigger cravings.Consume a higher amount of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, leafy greens, and healthy fats to eliminate cravings for junk food, desserts, and other fatty foods.

, Stress causes your body to release higher amounts of cortisol, which is a stress hormone that disrupts your body’s hormonal balance and triggers cravings and overeating. Coping with stress effectively can also help eliminate problems associated with emotional eating.Start practicing yoga or deep breathing, exercise regularly, listen to relaxing music, or engage in similar activities that can prevent you from becoming stressed.

, Getting too little sleep and not feeling rested on a daily basis will disrupt your hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin, and lead to overeating and poor food choices, respectively.Go to bed earlier every night, and improve your sleeping environment as best as possible by eliminating light and noise, and by sleeping on a comfortable mattress and bedding.

, Exercising regularly can naturally help improve and regulate your body’s insulin levels, which may be high if you have type 2 diabetes or indulge frequently in processed foods, or foods high in sugar and fat. High blood sugar levels can trigger cravings, and contribute to the “live to eat” mentality., In some cases, you may have developed a “live to eat” mentality as a result of engaging in activities that strictly revolve around food. For example, if you usually visit a food buffet or happy hour every week to enjoy pizza or chicken wings with your friends, suggest engaging in a new activity that doesn’t involve food, such as shopping or hiking.

, Sometimes, gaining a better understanding about how certain foods, chemicals, and preservatives affect your health can help steer you toward “eating to live.”

, Eliminating junk foods and introducing new foods and flavors to your diet can help you forge a healthier relationship with food, and can naturally help reduce cravings for junk foods. For example, cook meals using olive oil instead of butter, use Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and flavor your meals with natural herbs and spices instead of using table salt., If you typically live to eat as a result of chronic boredom, pack your schedule with fun activities that can help keep your mind off food. Read more books, go shopping, spend more time with friends and family, or dive into a personal project you’ve been putting off.

, Sometimes, mental health professionals can work with you on becoming healthier so you can focus more on eating to live, instead of living to eat.

Place the steak on a charcoal grill or a stovetop griddle, and grill each side for 2 to 2 ½ minutes so that the center is raw. Allow the steak to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving., Tuna salad is a flavorful, protein-packed filling that can be served on a whole wheat sandwich or on top of crackers as an appetizer. Canned tuna is affordable and has a long shelf life, which makes it a great staple for your kitchen pantry.


To make a yummy tuna salad, drain two cans of tuna and mix with 1/3 cup (80 mL) mayonnaise, a tablespoon (15 mL) whole grain or Dijon mustard, 2 tbsp (30 mL) chopped onion, 2 tbsp (30 mL) chopped celery, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) sweet peppers.

On a stovetop, cook 4 garlic cloves in olive oil until soft. Add a dash of red pepper flakes and oregano before mixing in a can of tuna, drained canned navy beans, and a jar of your favorite go-to tomato sauce. After simmering for 10 minutes, toss with cooked penne or spaghetti. Add some arugula to brighten up this dish., Skipjack is a small species of tuna and is relatively abundant in the wild. It accounts for about 70% of all canned tuna on the American market.Because this fish has a shorter lifespan than the larger species of tuna, it contains less mercury than other types of tuna. You will often see this type of tuna marketed as “light chunk” in a can at your local grocery store. At a sushi restaurant, it may be referred to as “bonito” or “katsuo.”

, Albacore tuna is one of the most popular and common types of tuna. It has a light taste and has a firm texture.This type of tuna can be found across the world’s largest bodies of water, including the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. This tuna accounts for about 30% of all canned tuna, and is often referred to as “white meat” tuna.Albacore contains almost three times the mercury of skipjack.Young children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers should not eat more than one serving of albacore a week.

, Bigeye tuna are sometimes sold or listed under their Hawaiian name “ahi” on a restaurant menu. These fish can grow 8 feet in length and are often used in sushi and sashimi.Bigeye can contain even more mercury than albacore, especially in the Atlantic Ocean. Pregnant women and other at-risk groups should avoid it as a regular part of their diet. Everyone else may want to limit bigeye intake to one serving a week., Yellowfin tuna has a medium to mild flavor and a very firm texture. It is an excellent tuna for grilling and searing. Like bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna is often referred  to as “ahi” on restaurant menus. These tuna can weigh up to 300 lbs in the wild, but commercial yellowfin typically weigh between 8 and 20 lbs.Mercury levels in yellowfin vary but are rising sharply in some areas. At-risk groups should treat this as a high-mercury fish., Bluefin tuna is considered a delicacy across the world and catching one can earn a fisherman or a distributor tens of thousands of dollars. A single fish once sold for 1.75 million dollars. Because this tuna is highly prized and sought-after, the population in the wild has dwindled greatly. Bluefin tuna are unable to reproduce quickly enough to meet the demand, and it is considered an endangered species.Although it is unlikely that you will come across Bluefin tuna in your local supermarket, you may come across it on a restaurant menu. If sustainability is important to you, avoid consuming Bluefin tuna.

There are two forms of Vitamin K: K1(phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone).",How to Eat to Slow Down Bone Loss in Menopause1," Many carbonated beverages contain phosphoric acid, which can affect your body’s ability to absorb calcium. Phosphoric acid causes you to lose calcium when you urinate. To reduce the calcium that you lose from drinking sodas, limit or avoid sodas altogether.Try drinking beverages that do not contain phosphoric acid, such as club soda, water, herbal teas, black or green teas, or fortified orange juice.;
, Sodium is a major cause of calcium loss and a high-sodium diet has been linked with developing osteoporosis. The more sodium you have in your diet, the more calcium you will need to get in order to make up for it.Try to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day to help reduce your calcium loss.

, Caffeine also reduces your body’s ability to absorb calcium, so it is important to keep your caffeine intake under control to prevent low calcium levels. If you want to eliminate bone loss from caffeine intake, you can switch to decaf or choose beverages that are naturally caffeine free, such as peppermint or chamomile tea.Try not to exceed 300 milligrams of caffeine per day. That’s about the equivalent of two eight ounce cups of coffee.
Try switching to tea. It is lower in caffeine and it has been shown to protect bones from calcium loss.

, Food that is processed lacks trace minerals that have a protective effect on bones.To make sure that you are getting the most nutrient-dense diet possible, cook your meals from scratch whenever you can.


Try choosing fresh instead of frozen vegetables, make your own bread, cook whole grains such as brown rice, and avoid pre-packaged prepared foods.

, Since bones are made up of mostly protein, getting enough of the right kind of protein is an important part of maintaining bone density. Try to avoid red meat as much as possible since it tends to be more acidic and may reduce the amount of calcium that your body can absorb.Make sure that you include enough quality protein sources for your size and gender to reduce bone loss. Good sources of protein include:Eggs
Dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt
Poultry such as chicken and turkey
Seafood such as salmon, halibut, and shrimp

, Soy has been found to have adverse effects on the absorption of calcium as well, so it is best to avoid eating too much soy. Even if a soy product is fortified with calcium, the calcium is not absorbed well. If you rely on soy as a primary source of protein, then it is a good idea to take a calcium supplement for extra protection., The combination is sometimes called MK7 in commercial supplement products. You should aim for about 250-1000 mcg of K1 and 45-180 mcg of K2 per day. Eat a good source of vitamin K two to three times a week to get these amounts or take a supplement. Natural food sources of Vitamin K include:Sauerkraut
Aged cheese
Natto (a soy product)
Kimchee (fermented Korean cabbage)
Beef liver
Green tea
Turnip greens
Broccoli
Kale
Spinach
Cabbage
Asparagus
Dark green lettuce

Drink and eat low-fat dairy products.,
Include canned sardines and salmon in your diet.,
Have some leafy greens.,
Choose calcium fortified orange juice.,
Take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet every day, take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To help prevent bone loss, it is crucial to get enough magnesium and vitamin D along with calcium.It may be easier for your body to absorb calcium if you take it in smaller doses with meals (500 mg at a time).",How to Eat to Slow Down Bone Loss in Menopause2," Dairy products provide a significant amount of calcium, so make sure that you include two to three servings of dairy per day in order to get enough calcium. Since dairy products are naturally high in fat, it is a good idea to seek out low-fat and fat free dairy products.Milk has long been known as a good source of calcium and it should be a staple in your diet if you are trying to avoid bone loss. Drink two to three glasses of low-fat or non-fat milk per day.
Cheese and yogurt are also good sources calcium, although they do not contain as much calcium as milk does. Choose low-fat cheese and yogurt to reduce your intake of unhealthy fats.

, Certain canned fish such as sardines and salmon are also good sources of calcium, as long as you eat the bones. The fish bones tend to be softer in canned fish, so they are edible.When eaten fresh, certain types of fish are good sources of vitamin D as well. For example, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D., Leafy greens such as kale, Chinese cabbage, turnip greens, and collard greens are also good sources of calcium. Try sautéing some greens, adding them to a soup, or using them in place of your usual salad greens., Drinking orange juice that has been fortified with calcium may also help you to prevent bone loss. Choose fortified orange juice as well as other types of fortified beverages to get a little more calcium in your diet., However, it is possible to get too much calcium, so talk to your doctor about the best amount and type of calcium supplement for you."

Get regular exercise.,
Spend time in the sun.,
Get tested for osteoporosis.,
Learn your T-score and Z-score.",How to Eat to Slow Down Bone Loss in Menopause3," Performing regular weight-bearing exercise is a good way to build bone mass and prevent bone loss as well. Weight-bearing exercises include walking, dancing, jogging, and dancing. Non-weight bearing exercises include biking and swimming.Try going for a 30 minute walk most days of the week to get in some weigh-bearing exercise and help prevent bone loss.

, The best way to get your daily dose of vitamin D is to spend about 15–20 minutes in the sun without sunblock every day. Exposure to the sun allows your body to produce its own vitamin D. Since this may not always be possible, especially during the winter in some places, supplementing with vitamin D is still advised., One serious problem with osteoporosis is that it can be symptomless. Many women will not know that they have osteoporosis until after a bone fracture. That is why it is a good idea to have a bone mineral density (BMD) test if you are at risk of osteoporosis. This test is often called a DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and can help your healthcare professional to diagnose osteoporosis. Women over the age of 65 are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis, but other women under the age of 65 may be affected as well. Ask your doctor about getting a DEXA scan if you have:broken a bone from doing something that should not have caused a broken bone, like falling from a standing position
A chronic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or an eating disorder
Early onset menopause
Undergone hormone treatments, such as for prostate or breast cancer
Lost a noticeable amount of height
A history of smoking or currently smoke
Family members who have had osteoporosis
Been taking certain medications, such as corticosteroid or thyroid hormone replacement medications
A tendency to drink three or more alcoholic beverages most days

, The results of a DEXA scan are known as a “T-score” and a “ Z-score” though for most people, the T-score is most important. In both the T-scores and the Z-scores, a negative number indicates that your bones are thinner or more porous than they should be. A higher negative number means that you have a higher risk of a bone fracture.If your T-score is between 0 and -1.0, this is considered normal. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates that you have early osteoporosis, known as osteopenia. A T-score of less than -2.5 indicates osteoporosis."

Check food labels for all items you purchase.,
Go for fresh cuts of meat.,
Choose the right packaged vegetables.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Stock up on healthy snacks.",How to Eat Less Salt1," Almost any canned or packaged foods you purchase contain salt. Even sweet items, like jams, cookies, and bread have added salt for taste. Make a habit of checking the sodium content of everything you buy. Always choose the items with the lowest sodium option.Canned foods, like canned beans and soups, often contain high amounts of sodium. See if a store carries low sodium options.
Bread items, such as breads and bagels, can also be high in sodium. Look for breads with little added salt.
Canned sauces often have high sodium contents, so be on the lookout for low sodium choices.;
, Pre-packaged meats tend to contain high amounts of sodium. Instead of purchasing pre-packaged cuts of meat the store, purchase fresh meats, cook them without salt, and then slice off pieces for sandwiches.For example, you can purchase a chicken and roast it, or purchase a lean cut of beef and fry it in a pan.
Keep in mind deli meats still contain sodium, even if the content is lower. If your doctor wants you to track or limit your overall sodium intake, do not forget to count sodium from fresh cut meats.

, If you buy frozen or packaged vegetables, you may be surprised to find they contain high amounts of sodium. Check labels when purchasing packaged vegetables and make sure to go for low sodium options.Look for frozen vegetables that were frozen fresh rather than being processed prior to freezing.
Select low sodium canned vegetables.
Go for fresh vegetables most of the time, as these are healthier than canned or frozen vegetables.

, Processed foods in general contain high amounts of salt. A good way to cut back on your overall salt intake is to steer clear of processed foods most of the time. Make your own meals at home rather than buying things like frozen dinners from the store., Snack foods like potato chips are often loaded with salt. If you're looking to cut back on your salt intake, select healthy snacks to keep you full. Fresh fruits and vegetables and nuts, such as almonds or walnuts, are a better snack option than things like chips and crackers.If you snack on nuts, make sure to only take a small amount as nuts are high in calories. You should also be sure to opt for unsalted nuts.

Replace salt with black pepper.,
Make your own stocks and gravies.,
Do not salt water you boil.,
Explore different flavors and recipes.,
Cut back on your use of condiments.",How to Eat Less Salt2," It is easy to over-salt your food as it can add flavor to an otherwise bland dish. However, if you need to add flavor to your food, try swapping salt with black pepper. Foods like pastas, eggs, and soups can be flavored with black pepper instead of salt.Eating foods seasoned with pepper over salt may test strange at first, but give it time. Your taste buds will adjust.

, Store bought soup stocks and gravies are often loaded in added salt. Instead of purchasing these items at the store, make them yourself at home. Opt for recipes that do not require a lot of added salt.You can also try replacing some or all of the stock in a soup recipe with water, which you can season with spices and black pepper instead of salt.

, When cooking things like pasta, rice, beans, or vegetables, do not salt the water ahead of time. This is an easy way to cut some salt out of your diet.For flavor, try adding other spices to the water like garlic powder or dried basil.

, Try to see cutting back on salt as an adventure rather than a burden. Explore different kinds of flavors and recipes that do not require a lot of added salt. For example, you can add basil, rosemary, cayenne pepper, garlic, and vinegar to recipes for added flavor. You can look up unique flavor combinations online, such as cajun blends, that can add flavor to your favorite foods without over-salting them.If you're consistent about trying new flavors over salt, your taste buds will eventually adjust. Give it time and eventually you will appreciate new recipes and spices and stop missing salt.
You can also add a drop or two of hot sauce. Hot sauce has sodium in it, but if you only use a drop or two then it won’t add too much.

, Things like mayonnaise, mustard, and soy sauce have a high salt content. You should reduce using these foods to add flavor to your dishes. If you want mustard on your sandwich, use a small coin-sized dollop rather than spreading mustard over an entire piece of bread."

Research before dining out.,
Request your food be prepared without extra salt.,
Choose low salt pizza options.,
Opt for plain rice.,
Select the right fillings in sandwiches.",How to Eat Less Salt3," Look up the menu online ahead of time and see if it included nutritional information. Chain restaurants often provide nutritional information online. See which items are lowest in sodium and plan to order those when eating out.See if the restaurant has any specifically low-salt items on the menu. Some restaurants may have a whole section for foods low in salt and sugar.

, Try politely requesting that you not have salt added to your food or that the cook cuts down on salt. Remember to be polite to wait staff. Say something like, ""Is there any way I could request the food be prepared with less salt."" If they oblige your request, say thank you., If you're ordering pizza or going to a pizza place, opt for ingredients that are lower in salt. Chicken and vegetables are generally the lowest salt items. Things like pepperoni and bacon tend to have a lot of salt.Cheese also contains a lot of salt. Request that the restaurant use cheese lightly.

, When eating out at Chinese or Indian restaurants, you often get salt on the side. Instead of asking for something like fried rice or flavored rice, request plain rice. Plain rice is usually much lower in salt., When eating at a sandwich place, order low salt options. Ham, pickles, and cheeses tend to have high salt. Instead, go for things like chicken, eggs, vegetables, and lower salt cheeses like mozzarella. You should also ask for light servings of condiments or request condiments on the side."

Eat produce and whole grains that were grown in selenium-rich regions.,
Purchase organically-grown foods, which have been found to have a higher level of selenium than those grown using conventional methods.,
Snack on one or two Brazil nuts every day.,
Eat seafood regularly.,
Eat whole grains instead of products made with white flour.,
Include these high-selenium foods in your diet on a regular basis:


Egg yolks
Organ meat, especially calf's liver
Button and shiitake mushrooms
Sunflower seeds

,
Taking a selenium supplement can give you more selenium.",How to Eat More Selenium," The amount of selenium in the product is largely determined by the amount of selenium in the soil it was grown in. Therefore, if you only eat products that you grow in your yard and your soil is not high in selenium, the selenium level in your body might be low.


The more volcanic ash in the soil, the higher the selenium content. Soil that is irrigated by sea water is also high in selenium.
Generally speaking, soil in the eastern part of the United States has less selenium than soil in the western part.;
, These products also have higher levels of vitamin E and beta carotene, both of which help selenium in its battle against free radicals.

, Brazil nuts have the highest concentration of selenium of all foods. The selenium content is approximately 50 micrograms per nut, depending on the size of the nut and the soil in which it grew; therefore it is not a good idea to eat more than two a day for an extended period of time.

, The best choices for selenium are:


White flesh fish
Tuna fish
Salmon
Oysters
Shrimp

, Processing the grain into white flour strips the grain of most of its nutrients, including selenium. Some good grain choices include:


Brown Rice
Wheat germ
Oats
Barley

,, You should never take a selenium supplement unless under a doctor's supervision because there is a risk of toxicity from too much selenium.

Consume less than the recommended amounts of fiber daily.,
Minimize fiber in meals and snacks.,
Limit insoluble fiber.,
Minimize fiber-fortified foods.,
Discontinue fiber supplements.,
Write up a meal plan.",How to Eat Less Fiber1," If fiber is affecting your health or making you uncomfortable, it may be ideal to consume less fiber than what's recommended for an average, healthy person.


The total fiber intake recommended for women is: 25 g daily. The total fiber intake recommended for men is: 38 g daily.Keep track of how much fiber you eat throughout the day. You may find it easy to use a food journaling app to help you accurately calculate fiber each day.;
, Fiber is found in a wide range of foods including grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes. Limiting the fiber in each meal or snack can help cut down on your overall consumption and may alleviate GI symptoms.Choose lower fiber fruits or remove fibrous parts of fruits. For example: eat applesauce instead of an apple, because the skin of the apple contains a large amount of fiber, or drink six ounces of 100% juice daily. Fruits that are lower in fiber include: canned fruit, cooked fruit, and fruit without the skin or peel.
Choose lower fiber vegetables or remove fibrous parts. For example: take the skin off your potato or remove the seeds from your zucchini. Vegetables that are lower in fiber include: canned vegetables, well-cooked and very soft vegetables, vegetables without seeds, and 100% vegetable juice.
Choose lower fiber grains. For example: avoid 100% whole grain foods since these are higher in fiber. Choose lower fiber grains like: white rice, white bread, cream of wheat or cream of rice, or plain pasta.

, There are two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber is sometimes called ""roughage,"" as it's main function is speed the process of digestion.


Insoluble fiber may stimulate bowls more than desired causing diarrhea in those who are susceptible or have a chronic health condition.Insoluble fiber is found in the following foods: whole grains, vegetables and wheat bran.Soluble fiber absorbs water, makes stools easier to pass and may slow digestion slightly. This type of fiber is more gentle and may be more appropriate for some people.Although insoluble fiber may have negative side effects for some, in general, it's a healthy addition to your diet and can help prevent constipation.

, Many food companies now add fiber into different foods to help increase fiber intake.Fiber may be added to foods that typically have little to no fiber and should be avoided by those minimizing fiber in their diets. Examples of foods to limit include:


Orange juice with pulp and added fiber.
Artificial sweeteners with added fiber.
Yogurts with added fiber.
Soy milk with added fiber.
Granola bars or bread that have additional added fiber (these may be lower in fiber prior to processing additional added fiber).

, There are a variety of fiber supplements that are available to help people increase their fiber intake. However, these should be discontinued immediately if fiber is posing a problem for you or your health.


Discontinue the use of any stool softeners or laxatives that contain added fiber.
Do not take oral gummies or fiber capsules.
Do not add extra powdered fiber or psyllium husk to foods or beverages.

, Writing up a meal plan can help you plan out all the meals and snacks you eat in a day and provide a framework for you to follow throughout the week.


Calculate how much fiber is in each meal or snack and what your total daily intake will be.
A meal plan will allow you to change things up, make substitutions or swaps so that you don't go over your target fiber goal each day.
Take some of your free time to plan your meals and snacks for one week. Include all meals and snacks you typically eat everyday. Repeat this exercise every week or as needed.

"

Talk to your doctor.,
Add fiber slowly.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Eat Less Fiber2," Many times, people follow a low-fiber diet for medical reasons. Always speak to your doctor prior to advancing yourself to a higher fiber diet or resuming your previous high fiber foods.


Your doctor will most likely give you a specific timeline for reintroducing fibrous foods or give you a certain limitation on your total fiber intake.
Be sure to ask what types of fiber are appropriate, how you should add fiber back to your diet and what your long-term fiber goal should be.
Remember that any time you add or subtract large levels of fiber, you are likely to experience gastric changes such as bloating and constipation.

, If you've been following a low fiber diet for a while and would like to return to a higher fiber diet, it's important to add in extra fiber slowly.A quick increase in extra fiber may cause GI distress and other uncomfortable side effects like: gas, bloating and cramping., As you increase your fiber intake, it's also extremely important to be consuming adequate fluids as well. Fiber can absorb water and you'll need to drink enough fluids to cover this absorption.As you increase your fiber intake, you must increase your water intake as well.


The number of ounces of fluids you should drink each day can be found by dividing your weight in half. So if you weigh 200 lbs, you should drink 100 oz of water, or 12.5 glasses of water every day.This will help your digestive system move consistently and help prevent constipation.
Stick to sugar-free and caffeine-free fluids for your best bet. Water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea are good options.

Think ahead to eating more fruits and vegetables and less junk food, and buy your foods accordingly.,
Purchase frozen fruits and vegetables for convenience or when fresh are not in season.,
Purchase canned to stock your pantry and for cooking.,
Purchase purees and juices for cooking or eating “on the go.” Purees are useful for making smoothies and adding sauces.",How to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables1," Purchase fresh when it fits your budget and timing. Fresh fruits and vegetables can be more expensive, but are worth the money in nutrition and flavor. Usually they can be eaten raw or cooked. Sometimes there is not a substitute for fresh. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be consumed in the week you purchase them to avoid rot or lessening nutritional value. Antioxidant content begins to degrade immediately after harvest as do some vitamins, so the closer to harvest you eat them the more nutrition you will obtain.;
, Frozen vegetables are frozen quickly after harvest and maintain many nutrients. They are easy to cook and can be stored for long periods of time. They are also very affordable and readily available. Frozen fruit is also a good option. It can be defrosted overnight and eaten without cooking, but the texture will have changed because of the freezing process. It is best to use frozen fruit for desserts or to cook with.

, Canned vegetables are great for making soups and casseroles. They are also convenient. Canned vegetables may have lost some nutrients during the high heat cooking process, but they still contain a fair amount. Having canned fruits and vegetables on hand helps with having a fruit or vegetable at every meal. When purchasing canned fruit be sure to read the label. Many canned fruits are packed in syrup, which adds extra sugar and calories. Try purchasing canned fruit in juice or water instead. Canned fruit is great for all ages because it is typically softer and comes pre-portioned.

, Juice has nutrients, but lacks the fiber. It is good for getting a fruit in when you don’t have time or you are not somewhere fruit is readily available. The high sugar and calorie content of juice makes it a tricky choice. The best way to consume is in moderation. Also, remember to only purchase 100% fruit juice.

Shop at your local farmers market or farm.,
Buy in season produce.,
Start a garden.,
Purchase fruits and vegetables on sale.",How to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables2," Farmers markets have local produce at a decent price. This means you get it fresher and cheaper than at the grocery store. Also, many times there are surpluses of certain crops and these can be purchased way under retail cost. If you go towards the end of the day, many vendors drop the prices to deplete their inventory for the day. Before going to the market, do some research on what the shelf life is of certain fruits and vegetables and if they will freeze well. This way you can purchase the right amount. A local farm is another option because they usually sell at a reasonable rate since they are cutting back transportation and storage costs.

, Produce that is in season costs less because it did not have to be shipped from a place that it will grow year-round. If you buy extra, you may be able to freeze it for later months.

, Many fruits and vegetables can be grown in pots or in the ground. They can also be grown indoors or outside. Garden, when done right, can produce an abundance of produce that can be eaten fresh, canned or frozen. If you live in a community with little land, you may be able to start a community garden so the neighborhood can share in the benefits. This is especially helpful if you live in a neighborhood that has little access to a well stocked grocery store.

, Many times grocery stores have more of one item in stock and they need it too sell quickly before it spoils. They will usually advertise the sales in a weekly circular. This is good for stocking up on that item.

Eat fruits and vegetables raw.",How to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables3," Produce is a major source of food contamination and illness. This is because so many people handle the fruits and vegetables and they are exposed to many different environments. To help reduce the risk of contamination, wash your produce before you cut it. This is even true for items with a rind, such as lemons.

, Vegetables can be steamed in a matter of minutes in the microwave. Many frozen vegetables already come in a bag, in which the vegetables can be steamed directly.

, They work well incorporated into roasted meats, crock pot meals and soups. They can also be disguised in these applications to help picky eaters get their daily requirement. Omelets are a great way to get more vegetables at breakfast.

, Roasted vegetables have so much flavor and store in the fridge well for 3 to 5 days.

, A rice steamer helps take the guesswork out of steaming vegetables. Many steamers come with an instruction guide that will tell you how much water to add.

, This is a quick way to get your daily requirement and works well all meals. Raw fruits and vegetables are also great “fast food” because they can be eaten anywhere. Fruit goes well on top of desserts or as dessert itself and requires very little preparation.

Serve your dip or spread alongside crispy pita chips or flatbread.To make a dip, use one tablespoon of yogurt and 1/4 teaspoon honey for every 1/3 cup of roasted, mashed yams.
For a spread, use 1/4 cup yogurt for every one cup mashed potatoes, and omit the honey.
For instance, try adding a light sprinkle of dried chipotle chile powder and salt.

, Dice and peel the sweet potatoes. Select companion ingredients that go well with yams. Because yams have a thicker consistency than water or broth, the more cubed yams you add, the creamier the soup will be.For creamy soup, yams go well with coconut oil, carrots, ginger, and garlic.For a chunky stew with a base that has a broth consistency, try stew meat and chopped onions, tomato, and bell peppers., Look for a recipe for sweet potato salad. Alternately, use your favorite recipe for regular potato salad.

, Make a bread pudding with yams and whole wheat bread. Use candied yams or sweet potato puree. Top it with complimentary flavors, such as chopped pecans and crystallized ginger. Bake the pudding in a baking dish at 350°F (175°C) for twenty-five minutes, until it is set and somewhat puffed up.For example, mix two eggs, three tablespoons of honey, 1/4 cup milk, one slice of crustless wheat bread, and two cups of yams.

, Wash and peel the sweet potatoes. Blend them with softened butter, sugar, milk, and spices. Fill an unbaked pie crust with the mixture. Bake it at 350 degrees F (175° C) for about an hour, until a knife pressed into the middle comes out clean.You can use your favorite pumpkin pie recipe and substitute sweet potatoes for pumpkin.
Try using one pound of yams, 1/2 cup softened butter, a cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup milk, two eggs, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and one teaspoon of vanilla extract in a nine-inch pie crust.

, Peel and slice the sweet potatoes, or use canned yams. Cook the yams in a skillet with a sweet sauce, stirring occasionally. Candied yams have a glaze, typically made with butter and brown sugar.

Balance out unhealthy choices with good ones.,
Treat yourself to a cheat meal (once a week) or cheat dessert (twice a week).,
Make food memories.",How to Eat Healthy While Still Enjoying Yourself1," Request special combinations of sides and mains, recognizing that you don’t have to order straight from the menu. Order a side salad instead of fries with your burger or get the fries with a veggie burger.


Do some menu research beforehand to avoid stress while ordering. This will keep you from making a knee-jerk reaction toward an unhealthy option.
Don’t be afraid to look up a restaurant’s nutritional information online.Try to use the Pareto principle to guide your eating choices. This means that you should choose healthy options 80% of the time and allow yourself to indulge in less healthy options 20% of the time.;
, This is an opportunity for you to cut loose while still sticking to a healthy lifestyle. You may even find that you forget these cheat days after you get more accustomed to enjoying nutritious food. Or, your cheat days may become healthier in composition due to your changing preferences.


If you cheat with desserts, stick to a single 200-300 calorie portion of a high-quality sweet, such as dark chocolate or real ice cream.If you are caffeine-inclined, purchase a rich coffee drink as your cheat.
If you still feel deprived after a cheat meal, you may want to split up your indulgence over the week. For example, break up that chocolate bar into four pieces and enjoy a small piece each day.

, Be aware of the extent to which many of your favorite times are food-related and then harness this awareness to recreate happy moments. Cook your grandmother’s favorite soup or whip up your childhood comfort food.


People who sustain positive emotional connections to food are less likely to practice unhealthy habits, such as overeating."

The edamame will help fill your stomach a bit so that you don’t overeat your main course. Additionally, edamame, or soybeans, are an excellent source of protein and virtually fat-free.You can ask your server for pickled vegetables if you don’t want the edamame.;
, Miso soup is prepared with a stock to which a variety of vegetables (and occasionally tofu) are added. Which vegetables are added depends on which region your chef’s recipe is from and which recipe they’re using. No two miso soups are alike. What is consistent, though, is that this is a virtually fat-free soup full of vitamins and antioxidants. Seaweed salad is also chock-full of minerals and vitamins, and like miso soup, takes the edge off your hunger in a healthy way.Seaweed is used throughout Japanese cuisine, from tofu to salad.
Most Japanese restaurants will have other salad options as well, such as a traditional dinner salad or cucumber salad.
If you’re watching your sodium consumption, skip the miso soup, which can contain half the sodium that you need in one day.

, What constitutes a healthy meal to you may vary from what someone else views as healthy. You might feel that a low-carbohydrate diet equates to a healthy way of eating, whereas your friend might believe that low-fat diets or paleo diets are the way to go. Knowing how you define healthy eating is helpful when eating out, as this will inform your food selections.If you’re on a low-carbohydrate diet or concerned about a low Glycemic Index number, skip rice with your meal and ask for extra vegetables instead.
Japanese food is beautiful and delicious, but many of the sauces are prepared with sugar or large quantities of salt. Ask for sauce on the side so that you can regulate how much you consume.If you want to stick with low-fat options, avoid tempura foods and opt for grilled meats instead.If you’d like a paleo or Whole30 meal, look to the sushi menu. Ask the sushi chef to prepare your meal without rice, or consider ordering sashimi instead. Also, make sure to bring your own bottle of coconut aminos with you to use instead of soy sauce., Finish off your delicious meal with a cup of green tea. This tea is loaded with antioxidants, even more than fruits and vegetables, and boasts a variety of other health benefits. A cup of green tea is also known to boost your metabolism, helping you digest your meal more efficiently and quicker., No matter what sort of cuisine you’re eating, it’s important to practice portion control. Japanese cuisine can be very healthy, but portion sizes are still a necessary consideration. The best way to practice portion control is to be mindful of every bite that you take. Chew it, savor it, experience it, consider it, and wait before taking that next bite. Eating this way will not only increase your enjoyment of your meal, it will help you hear your body when it signals that it’s no longer hungry.Try to order so that half of your plate is made up of vegetables, a quarter of your plate is protein, and a quarter of your plate is of starch (starchy vegetables, rice, etc.).

Resist the urge to binge during special events.,
Eat with others.,
Split dishes with your friends.,
Set up a taste test of various types of the same food.",How to Eat Healthy While Still Enjoying Yourself2," Vacations, weddings, and birthdays all present dining temptations. An array of interesting (and often unlimited) foods can go a long way towards weakening your will power.


Carry a few snacks with you, such as raw granola bars, to take the edge off your hunger before hitting the buffet.Gravitate toward the fresh food options, like the salad station, instead of the heavier, saucy dishes. And, in a buffet situation, limit yourself to one plate, no refills.

, Plan a regular dinner time with your family or set-up consistent meal dates with your friends. Sharing meals with other people encourages you to slow down and enjoy your food. Dining peers can also praise your good choices while steering you away from unhealthy options., You will save money and reduce the impact on your waistline. Or, adopt a ‘family-style’ dining mentality and sample a little bit from everyone’s dishes.


For example, at Panera Bread Company, eating a whole Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich on Sesame Semolina provides 700 calories. A seasonal greens salad provides 180 calories. So, if you split the sandwich and salad with a friend, you'll each be consuming 440 calories, which will probably fit into your calorie goals., Focus on citrus and cut up oranges, limes, lemons, etc. to sample. Create attractive food trays and invite others over to turn this into a group adventure.

Search for a favorite fruit or veggie.,
Educate yourself about particular foods.,
Experiment with different preparations.,
Discover good-for-you substitutes.,
Hide healthy foods in plain sight.,
Plant a garden.",How to Eat Healthy While Still Enjoying Yourself3," Select one fruit and one vegetable to “feature” in your diet each week. Try to include your featured foods in at least one meal a day. Then, at the end of each week write a few quick notes about what you liked and disliked about your choices. Keep going until you can definitively say you’ve found your favorite!Create a tournament bracket for veggies and fruits. Include your friends and see which foods win out as they go head-to-head.

, Choose a single food item and research everything that you can about it. Become an expert on that item. Find out where it is grown, what are its medicinal properties (if any), and what different types are available. This knowledge will make you excited to try out what you have learned in the real world at the table., It’s tough to move away from traditional fried food, but there is a whole array of prep options waiting for you. Squash, for example, may seem like a pretty boring food but it can be transformed by grilling, baking, stuffing, or sautéing. Mastering these various cooking techniques will make food prep an adventure instead of a bore., You can find many alternative versions of your favorite, and most commonly consumed, foods. Identify a particular food or drink item and investigate your options. For example, if you regularly drink whole milk, consider switching to 1% or fat-free. You will get the same amount of calcium and nutrients with less saturated fat.Try substituting for oil and butter when you are baking. For example you can use applesauce or prune puree for half of the called-for butter, shortening or oil in a recipe., Trick your taste buds by subtly adding fruits and vegetables into recipes that you already enjoy. This will ramp up the nutrients in your diet, while staying close to your regular routine, meaning that you are more likely to continue.


Baking is one of the best ways to ‘hide’ the good stuff. Make zucchini bread and ramp up the amount of zucchini or bake banana nut bread with extra bananas.For baked goods, always replace refined oils with olive oil or applesauce. You will not taste the difference and some people even believe that it adds moisture to the final product.

, Take creative ownership over your diet by growing your own fruits, vegetables, and herbs. You will appreciate every bite that you take when you’ve put the effort into the process. Start with herbs, commonly considered the “gateway garden” for beginners.


Thyme, basil, and rosemary are smart and hardy choices, which are also used in many recipes."

Count your calories.,
Eat every meal.,
Order off the kid’s menu.,
Request a to-go box from your server as you order.,
Stop eating when you are full.,
Choose carefully at fast food restaurants, in particular.,
Sign up for a food delivery service.",How to Eat Healthy While Still Enjoying Yourself4," Maintaining a healthy weight often comes down to calories in and calories out. Use an online program or pen and paper to keep track of the number of calories that you consume on a daily basis. Try to stay as close to your ideal caloric target as possible. Dropping 500 calories a day can result in a 1 lb. weight loss per week.Watch your drinks! For example, a 12oz glass of sweet tea provides 88 calories, one 12oz can of Coca Cola provides 140 calories, and cocktails can include upwards of 500 calories per glass.Drinking just a few sweet beverage throughout the day can add a significant amount of calories and this may interfere with your diet goals.

, Skipping meals (especially breakfast) puts you at an energy disadvantage for the rest of the day. You may avoid calories from one meal, but you will likely binge on the next or make other unhealthy choices. Instead, pick specific times for meals and stick to them. If you have to push back a meal, eat a filling snack in the meantime.


Skipping breakfast can increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, fatigue, and poor mental function., This is a creative and fun way to practice portion control. Scan the menu for a healthy option, such as grilled chicken tenders and applesauce, and order away. You will receive a balanced meal while saving money and calories.

, When your food arrives, go ahead and box up half of it to save for later. This will keep you from overeating and gives you enough for another meal the next day!, Eating slowly and methodically will allow you to watch for signs that you end the meal. Carefully chew your food and drink sips of water in between every bite. Resist the urge to clean your plate and don’t automatically order dessert-make sure that you are actually hungry. See How to Eat Slowly to Avoid Overeating.


It takes approximately 20 minutes for your brain to register and signal that you are full., Foods high in saturated fats and sugars are often cheaper, and thus more alluring, but do not be swayed from the healthy path! Instead of purchasing a pre-set meal, buy a group of healthy side items, such as carrot sticks and applesauce.Before you go to a restaurant, do some research to help you make good choices when you arrive. Go online to find their menu and nutritional information.

, Getting your meals delivered to your home is like receiving a gift every day. You can choose from a variety of options, including only certain meals or only particular foods, and this will keep food boredom at bay. Don’t hesitate to test out a number of companies before settling on a particular one.

Stay away from salad dressing.,
Avoid tempura.,
Don’t eat katsu foods.,
Limit your sodium.,
Swap out white rice for brown rice.,
Choose your fish wisely.",How to Eat Healthily at a Japanese Restaurant2," Salad dressing in any restaurant is typically a less healthy choice, and Japanese restaurants are no exception. Your food may come with a dinner salad, or you might order salad as an appetizer. Either way, inquire about the dressing. If it’s described as creamy or oily, ask for an alternative, such as vinegar, or skip the dressing altogether., Tempura is a method of cooking that is largely similar to deep-fried food. Tempura means that a meat, vegetable, or even cake is battered and then lightly fried. Tempura batter tends to be much lighter than other types of batters, like beer batter or traditional flour batter, but is still not the healthiest option. Instead of choosing anything prepared tempura, look for grilled or steamed options., Katsu describes a food that is pan fried. Pan fried foods are cooked with added oils, fats, or butters. If you are opting for a low-fat diet, you’ll want to stay away from katsu-style foods. Just like with tempura, ask your server if they have any grilled, broiled, or steamed versions of the food that you’re interested in., You might be watching your sodium intake, and as you know, any restaurant is going to have an elevated sodium content. Because salt enhances the flavors in foods, you’re likely to find it in just about everything that you order. Ask for your food to be steamed and for any sauce to be put on the side. This will ensure that you get the least amount of sodium possible in your meal.Also, use soy sauce sparingly or ask for a reduced sodium version of soy sauce.

, White rice is a staple in most Japanese restaurants and an excellent accompaniment to your meal. If you’re trying to watch your carbohydrate intake, though, white rice isn’t a healthy option for you. Ask your server if they can swap your white rice for steamed brown rice, which is full of more nutrients compared to white rice — like fiber, B vitamins, and vitamins E and K.If the restaurant doesn’t offer brown rice, ask them to skip the rice altogether or ask if they’ll substitute steamed vegetables in place of the white rice.
You can also ask if the restaurant will swap brown for white rice in your sushi.

, Fish is typically rich in vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals — all nutrients that the body needs. Fish that is prepared healthily, such as steamed or broiled, can be an excellent, healthy choice when eating out. If you’re watching your fat intake, though, you’ll do well to stay away from fattier fish.Examples of fattier fish are mackerel, eel, whitefish, salmon, and sardines.
Examples of leaner fish are bass, cod, flounder, mahi mahi, and tuna.
Some fatty fish, like salmon, are high in Omega-3 acids, which promote heart health.

Order vegetable rolls.,
Watch out for the term “crunchy.” Crunch or crunchy are two signal words that indicate some or all of your sushi roll is fried.,
Opt for sashimi.,
Eat your wasabi.,
Limit your avocado intake.,
Steer clear of fancy sushi rolls.",How to Eat Healthily at a Japanese Restaurant3," Vegetable rolls are exactly what the name suggests — rolls made entirely of vegetables. Some sushi restaurants will even skip the rice and wrap the rolls in paper-thin slices of cucumber or zucchini. Vegetable rolls are low-fat, low-carb, low-sodium, and absolutely brimming with vitamins, minerals, and good nutrients.Make sure that your vegetable rolls don’t have any added oils or cream cheese.

, Frying your sushi instantly makes your meal unhealthy. If you’re looking for crunch in your sushi roll, opt for those with naturally crunchy vegetables like cucumbers and bamboo shoots., Sushi is prepared over vinegared, white rice, whereas sashimi is bare slices of raw fish. Sashimi is a no-carbohydrate, protein-packed way of enjoying Japanese cuisine. You’ll see the term rolls also, which isn’t another name for sushi or sashimi. Instead, rolls are a combination of sashimi and sushi wrapped in dried seaweed. Of the three, sashimi is the lowest in carbohydrates, but all are good options., Wasabi is the green, spicy paste that accompanies your sushi. Wasabi is actually a type of radish and it’s loaded with antioxidants. Be careful, though, and eat your wasabi sparingly. A small amount packs a big punch.You might also be offered pickled ginger with your sushi, which is another excellent flavor enhancer that is chock-full of vitamins and minerals such as Manganese, Niacin, Potassium, Zinc, Pyridoxine, and Iron.
Ginger is also a natural tummy soother.

, Avocado is a perfect filler in many types of sushi. It’s creamy, mild, and packs a heart-healthy bunch of fats. Unfortunately, too much avocado does mean too much fat and the calories add up quickly. If you’re watching your fat or caloric intake, limit the avocado in your sushi., Classic sushi is almost always the healthiest sushi, as it contains rice, fish, and vegetables. Fancier, more modern sushi, on the other hand, might have high-fat or high-calorie ingredients, such as duck, cream cheese, and even sugar.Classic sushi is usually rolled on the inside and typically contains one ingredient. Fancy, modern, or fusion sushi usually has multiple ingredients and the rice typically faces outward.Some classic sushi examples are tuna rolls, cucumber rolls, eel and cucumber rolls, and pickle rolls.
Some fusion or fancy sushi examples are California rolls, spicy scallop rolls, tempura rolls, or crunchy tuna avocado rolls.
If everyone at the table orders a different type of roll, you can all share and sample one of each kind. This is a great way to try a variety of rolls without over-indulging in any one type.

Choose a broth-based soup such as won-ton or egg-drop to start your meal.,
Order brown rice over white or fried rice.,
Ask for your dish to be prepared in the manner of traditional Chinese cuisine.,
Request sauce to be served on the side.,
Ask the chef to prepare your dish without monosodium glutamate (MSG).,
Drink hot tea with your meal.",How to Eat Healthily at a Chinese Restaurant1," Soups are a great choice for helping to fill up without a ton of calories and can be full of extra protein and vegetables without adding calories.


Avoid starters like Chinese noodles or fried wontons. While they may stave off hunger pangs while you wait to be served, it is an easy way to add hundreds of extra calories and unnecessary carbohydrates to your meal.;
, The difference in calories isn't significant, but it provides additional fiber and is a much healthier choice.


Brown rice also significantly lowers the chance of developing Type 2 diabetes. It has a lower glycemic index and contains more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants., Chinese cooking incorporates mostly fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and rice, with very little red meat.Traditional cooking methods include steaming or roasting, rather than frying.Tell the wait staff at the restaurant if you have special dietary needs. They can steer you toward the best and healthiest choices for you on the menu.
Make sure you inform restaurant staff if you follow a kosher, vegan, or other special diet, or if you have food allergies.

, Hoisin, sweet and sour, and other traditional Chinese sauces are highly caloric. By serving it on the side, you can moderate the amount of sauce on your dish.


As for low-sodium soy sauce instead of regular. One tablespoon of regular soy sauce as 1,000 milligrams of sodium, which is about half of your daily recommended sodium intake.Choose mustard-based and chili-based sauces to boost flavor without the calories.

, If you are concerned about possible allergies, then ask that your meal be prepared without MSG. MSG is a flavor enhancer commonly added to Chinese foods, but it also occurs naturally in many foods including tomatoes and cheese.Sometimes called “Chinese restaurant syndrome,” some people report symptoms such as facial swelling or chest pain after consuming MSG. See a physician if you experience these symptoms after eating Chinese food.The FDA has classified MSG as a food ingredient “generally recognized as safe.”However, the FDA requires MSG to be listed on the ingredients list.

, Many traditional Chinese restaurants serve tea as a beverage option or at the end of your meal. This helps signal your brain to stop eating and cleanses the palate."

Avoid breaded, deep-fried dishes, noodle-based dishes, or dishes doused in thick sauces.,
Choose spring rolls rather than egg rolls for an appetizer or side dish.,
Try a vegetarian option.,
Order lean meats such as chicken and pork rather than beef.,
Eat fruit or a fortune cookie for dessert.",How to Eat Healthily at a Chinese Restaurant2," Items like pork-lo mein, sweet-and-sour chicken, fried rice, and General Tso’s chicken each contain well over a thousand calories. Instead, ask for dishes to be steamed, baked, or sautéed in less oil.

, Egg rolls are deep fried, while spring rolls contain a light, rice-paper wrapper and more fresh vegetables and meats or fish. Ordering fresh spring rolls will cut about half the calories and fat., Select one of the restaurant's vegetarian items on the menu, or order other menu choices served with tofu rather than meat.


Dishes like Ma Po Tofu or tofu with garlic sauce are flavorful and contain healthy, low-fat proteins.Buddha’s delight is a great choice, boasting a healthful medley of vegetables and tofu cooked with ginger and soy sauce.
Shrimp can be a healthy option to add to any vegetarian dish. It is low in fat and high in protein., Lean meats are a great source of complete protein, are rich in iron and other vitamins, and have less saturated fat.One cup of chicken and broccoli has about 250-200 calories, and the broccoli provides important nutrients and antioxidants., Traditional Chinese cuisine emphasizes only fruit for dessert, rather than cakes or cookies.Fortune cookies are also a great choice to end your meal, containing only about 30 calories."
"
Stick to a healthy diet the day you plan to eat Chinese food.,
Drink a glass of water before you head to the restaurant, and when you arrive.,
Choose chopsticks instead of a fork and knife.,
Avoid dishes with words like ""house"" or ""combo"" in the name.,
Order from the menu rather than choosing to eat from the buffet.,
Split dishes with friends or family, or take leftovers home.,
Fill half your plate with steamed vegetables.,
Watch your rice portions.",How to Eat Healthily at a Chinese Restaurant3," This can help you keep your daily calories, fat, and sodium in check, and maintain portion control.Choose foods with less sodium and fat for your other meals and snacks.
Before you head to the restaurant, try eating a piece of fruit or another small, healthy snack to prevent overeating during the meal.Fit in some exercise that day or the next to help burn extra calories.

, Staying hydrated can help prevent overeating.Sipping water with your meal will also help your stomach feel fuller and help overall digestion. Drinking water will also reduce the amount of sodium that your body absorbs.

, Ask your waiter for a set of them if they aren't already on the table. Because it takes most people longer to eat with chopsticks, it will help you feel fuller sooner and prevent you from overeating.

, This often means the dish is larger and more caloric than one with a single main ingredient in the title.

, Buffets can encourage overeating.Additionally, you can ask the waitstaff to pace bringing dishes to the table. Eating just one or two dishes at a time will encourage you to savor the food and eat less overall.

, Not only will this help save money, but it will also help you eat proper portions., By making these the focal point of the meal rather than meat or rice, you’ll save fat, calories, and salt, while still feeling satisfied., Each cup of brown or steamed rice adds about 200 calories to the meal."

Read the entire menu at restaurants.,
Choose restaurants with healthier options.,
Stop by the grocery store.,
Purchase convenience store foods.",How to Eat Healthy when in a Hurry1," Even with the best intentions, eating out at fast food restaurants or stopping by a convenience store may be the only option you have. However, reading the entire menu or walking through the entire store can help you get a good idea of what healthy options are available.


Review menus online before choosing a restaurant and make sure you have some healthy options. Or become familiar with the menu of your favorite quick restaurants. Find a few items that will fall into your healthy eating plan and stick to those.
Review the nutrition stats of different foods. Restaurants that have more than 20 locations are required to have nutrition information online and in the store.Find options that fit into your calorie guidelines or other nutrition requirements.
Avoid combo meals. This is when the calorie count can get really high at fast food restaurants. Stick to just a small sandwich or wrap if possible.
Avoid deep fried items if possible. Most fast food chains do offer grilled versions of a variety of sandwiches, wraps, and other meals. Choose grilled over fried for a lower-fat meal.;
, The typical fast food restaurants are not the only quick option. Many places serve soups, salads, lower-calorie sandwiches and other items that are not as processed, are lower in calories, and are slightly healthier for you.


Try using a map app on your smart phone or doing a quick internet search of available options in your current location. Look for something outside the typical burger and fry joint.
Remember, although some restaurants offer fresh salads and sandwiches, their foods aren't necessarily low calorie. Again, it's important to review the menu and nutrition information online first.

, If you're feeling famished and have no time to cook, swing by a grocery store for quick and healthy meal. Most stores will have a variety of options to fit your timeline.


No time at all? Pick up something from the salad bar or hot bar. Choose lean protein, vegetables, fruit and whole grains. Try avoid things that are higher in fat (like mac and cheese) or fried (like fried chicken).
Many stores also offer pre-made meals and cold pre-packaged salads (like chicken or tuna salad). Be wary of the fat and calorie content, but a small cup of chicken salad with a piece of fruit is a great quick meal.

, Not all your meals need to be 100% home cooked or made from scratch. Some convenience foods are still moderately healthy in addition to being quick. Surprisingly, gas stations sometimes have healthier food than fast food establishments.


Healthy convenience store foods can include: frozen low-calorie dinners (but be aware of the sodium content), low-calorie canned soups (again, watch the sodium content), individual packages of nuts, or ""protein packs"" (many stores sell small packages of lean protein foods like nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs or deli meat alongside a fruit or veggie).
Convenience foods to avoid include: high calorie/high fat frozen foods (like pizza or chicken nuggets), fried foods from grocery store/convenience store hot bars, canned pastas, processed meats (like hot dogs) and pre-made sandwiches or subs.
Consume convenience store foods with awareness and moderation. Many times what makes convenience foods ""convenient"" is extra processing. Sometimes this doesn't affect the nutritional value all that much and other times it does. Exercise caution and use your best judgement.

Prep fruits and vegetables ahead of time.,
Prepare entire meals in advance.,
Purchase a slow cooker.,
Double your recipes.,
Prepare and stock healthy snacks.",How to Eat Healthy when in a Hurry2," Washing, chopping, and cooking vegetables and fruits is sometimes the longest or most tedious part of preparing meals. Cut down on cooking time by doing these things ahead of time.


If possible, start preparing your fruits and vegetables right when you get home from the store. Keep everything out on the counter and work through as much as you can.
Wash all produce, dry, and store in appropriate containers or in the refrigerator. If you are planning on using the food whole, you don't have to continue with any other preparation.
For cooked vegetables, cut or chop them and store in zip-top plastic baggies. When it's time to cook them, just pour them into a pan or into a pot and cook!
Consider using a food processor for a super quick way of chopping fruits and vegetables.
If using fruits and vegetables as part of lunches or snacks, portion out what you'll be eating and store it until you're ready to consume it.

, Having some meals completely prepared and ready-to-eat can be handy with a busy schedule. The key to success is being prepared. Having healthy meals ready and waiting will help you make the healthier choice. Not every meal needs to be this way, but they're great in a pinch.


Plan breakfasts on the go. Some foods and meals are easy to eat while you're driving or riding the train to work. Keep foods like these available: protein or granola bars, pre-made smoothies, or hard boiled eggs.
Also try making breakfast on the weekends. For example, make a few scrambled egg, cheese, and English muffin sandwiches and wrap them up in the refrigerator. All you need to do is reheat them in the microwave.
Lunches and dinners can also be made in advance. Put together salads with lettuce, vegetables, lean protein and other favorite toppings and store in a air tight containers. Just add dressing when you're ready to eat. Casseroles are another type of dish that can be made completely in advance and just need to be heated when you're ready to eat.

, Slow cookers or crock pots can be a busy person's best friend. They cook a meal all day long and you have an easy, hot and ready meal to dig into when you get home.


Some slow cookers are relatively inexpensive, falling in between $20-$220. Choose one that's a good size, shape and has the features you need.Slow cookers are also great for making large portions. These can be good for leftovers, lunches, or to freeze for another time.

, If you have a night or two to spend cooking, consider doubling your recipes. Having leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day is helpful. You won't have to worry about grocery shopping or cooking, your meal is already made!


If you're not a fan of leftovers or want to have a different meal, try doubling only part of your recipe. For example, if you're making chicken fajitas, grill up extra chicken (with or without seasonings) to use in another dish (like grilled chicken caesar salads or chicken and broccoli with brown rice).
It may be a good idea to double your recipes even if you don't think you'll need the leftovers in the near future. Portion and freeze doubled recipes for the days when you're in a pinch. You'll be happy you have a full meal that just needs reheating.

, Prepared snack foods or items you can have on hand when you're in need of a quick pick-me-up are a smart idea to have when you're busy. They can keep you from unhealthy tempting fast food or convenience items.


Each week take some to prepare healthy snack foods. Portion out foods and store them in air-tight containers in the refrigerator until you're ready to eat them.
Healthy snacks to prepare in advance can include: carrots and hummus, apple and cheese stick, celery and peanut butter, or individual greek yogurt with fruit.
If you have to dig around to find something sweet or unhealthy, you're less likely to opt for that when you're in a hurry.

"
"
Write out your meals for the week in advance.,
Stock your kitchen.,
Plan for unexpected changes in your schedule.",How to Eat Healthy when in a Hurry3," Following a meal plan each week can make healthy eating a lot easier. Spend some of your free time writing up your meal plan and corresponding grocery list for each week.


Take into consideration how much time you have each week or each weeknight to prepare foods. This may change what you choose to put on your meal plan or purchase at the grocery store.
Plan for super busy nights. For example, you're planning on going to the gym right after work or have a long meeting that will keep you later at the office. Try to schedule prepare quick meals ahead of time or meals with little to no cooking for nights that are extra busy.

, A well-stocked kitchen is essential to healthy and quick meals. The less time you spend traveling back and forth to the grocery store or looking for ingredients, the better.


Make a full shopping list and go grocery shopping before you are hungry. Studies have shown that you'll stick to your list and leave tempting indulgent foods at the store instead of in your cart.Always keep fruits and vegetables on hand. Frozen, fresh, or canned items are all appropriate. Also consider pre-washed or pre-prepared items like bagged lettuce or bagged broccoli florets to minimize preparation time.
Pantry staples can also help make for a quick meal. Keep items on hand like: canned beans, whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, or 100% whole wheat pasta), dressings/sauces, and nuts or nut butters. Also consider purchasing pre-cooked grains like brown rice or quinoa.
Quick protein foods include frozen items (like fish or chicken); fresh, pre-cooked proteins (like grilled chicken strips or or deli meat); and canned tuna or chicken. These are great to have on hand at all times.

, Remember that even the best planning does not eliminate surprises! You might not always have time to cook or buy food.


A well-stocked kitchen can help you quickly prepare a healthy meal in a flash: frozen veggies, pre-cooked chicken breast strips, and pre-cooked brown rice or homemade tuna salad on a whole wheat wrap and a small side salad.
Keep quick items like granola, nuts, apples, or protein bars in your bag or purse. If you need a quick snack when you get caught in traffic or held up at work, you have a healthy option to tide you over to your next meal.
Stock up your office with healthy snacks, such as nuts, whole-grain crackers, and shelf-stable fruit (like apples or oranges). If you have a fridge keep yogurts, cottage cheese or a few low-calorie frozen meals on hand.

Chew more carefully.,
Cut your food into small pieces.,
Cook food thoroughly to soften it.,
Puree or juice food.,
See a dentist for persistent pain.,
Try a night guard.,
Address sinus congestion.,
Think about recent changes in your diet.,
Take an over-the counter pain reliever.,
Try a cold compress.,
Try home remedies.",How to Eat Hard Food When Your Teeth Hurt," The easiest thing you can do to reduce the amount of pain you experience when eating hard foods is to be more careful about the way you chew. This is especially important if you plan on eating hard foods.


Chew very slowly to avoid causing sharp pain.Avoid chewing with the affected teeth. For example, if the left side of your mouth is bothering you, try chewing all of your food on the right side until the pain subsides.;
, Hard foods are even more difficult to chew when you put large pieces of them into your mouth at once. Make chewing easier for yourself by taking an extra moment to cut all of your food into smaller pieces.Foods that you need to bite into with your front teeth, like whole apples, large carrots, and corn on the cob, are especially bad. Be sure to cut these to prevent more pain and damage to your teeth., Cooking food in specific ways can also help make it softer and easier to chew, which means you can still eat the foods you want while experiencing less pain. The more tender the food, the less it will bother your teeth.If you want to eat beef, consider preparing it in a slow cooker instead of grilling it. This will make it nice and tender, while still preserving the flavor.
Try eating steamed or sauteed vegetables instead of raw vegetables.

, Another way to enjoy the foods you love without enduring pain is to puree or juice them. You'll still get all the flavor you were longing for, without the pain.For example, if you want to eat carrots, but your teeth are too sore, consider drinking some carrot juice or eating some carrot soup.

, If your pain is severe or lasts for more than a few days, schedule an appointment with a dentist right away. You may have tooth decay, a loose filling, or a cracked tooth, all of which need to be addressed by a dentist.If your pain is only occasional and not confined to a single spot, you probably have nothing to worry about, but you should still see your dentist regularly for cleanings.The sooner you see a dentist, the less likely your problem is to become more serious, so don't put it off., If several of your teeth suddenly begin to ache, it may be caused by teeth grinding, which people often do in their sleep. Wearing a night guard to bed will prevent you from grinding your teeth, which should make the pain go away.If you are experiencing more stress in your life that you are used to, you may suddenly begin grinding your teeth., Intense sinus congestion can sometimes cause pain that is easy to confuse with a toothache because it compresses nerves that are very close to the roots of your upper teeth. If your teeth have only started hurting since you have been congested, consider taking an over-the-counter remedy to relieve your congestion. You may just find that your tooth pain goes away as well.If your congestion is persistent or accompanied by other symptoms, see a doctor.

, If your teeth just suddenly started causing you pain, it may be due to a change in your eating habits. If you have added any new acidic foods into your diet (like citrus fruits, coffee, or tomato sauce), you may want to cut back on them. Acidic foods are known to break down tooth enamel, which can lead to pain and a variety of dental problems.If you don't want to give up acidic foods, try to rinse your mouth out with water after you eat them. This will help prevent the acid from sticking around on your teeth after you've finished eating.

, For severe pain, try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin. Be sure to always read the bottle and follow the dosing instructions carefully.

, Place an ice pack on your face near the affected tooth. Hold it there for up to 15 minutes. This should temporarily alleviate swelling and pain, making it easier to eat normally.


If you don't have an ice pack, wrap some loose ice in a thin piece of paper or plastic. A bag of frozen vegetables will also work.
Repeat as often as needed.

, Another way to temporarily relieve tooth pain so that you can eat the foods you want is to try using some natural home remedies. You may already have all of the ingredients you need to create one of these remedies in your kitchen.Mix one teaspoon of warm mustard oil with a pinch of turmeric powder until it forms a paste. Apply to your sore tooth and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water.
Mix one teaspoon of asafoetida powder with a few drops on lemon juice until it becomes a paste. Apply to the tooth and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water.
Heat a teaspoon of coconut oil in a frying pan and fry three cloves in the oil. Take the pan off of the heat, let the mixture cool, and then grind it to create a paste. Apply it to your tooth and let it sit for up to ten minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water.

Investigate your risk factors for malabsorption.,
Discuss adverse symptoms with your physician.,
Combine your vitamins.,
Take the multivitamin or supplement within 30 minutes of eating a meal.,
Cut back on or eliminate alcohol.,
Choose raw or steamed fruits and vegetables.,
Drink a glass of orange juice.",How to Best Absorb Folic Acid1," Some people are more prone to folic acid deficiency than others because of genetic causes, chronic illness, and use of certain medications. Talk to your physician if you have risk factors that may prevent you from absorbing enough folic acid.


Genetic mutations such as polymorphism (a genetic variance or flaw) can be a risk factor for folic acid deficiency. Known as a MTHFR mutation, your body may have trouble making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase which is critical for the body’s processing of folic acid.Chronic illnesses that affect absorption in the gastrointestinal tract may also cause folic acid deficiencies. If you suffer from Crohn’s or celiac disease, or are on dialysis, discuss strategies with your doctor to ensure you are ingesting enough folic acid.A number of common medications may interfere with folic acid absorption, including anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and antacids. If you are being treated for a particular condition, do not take folic acid supplements without first discussing it with your physician.;
, Symptoms of anemia, a sign of folate deficiency, include weakness, lack of concentration, and lightness.Other symptoms may include diarrhea, numbness of the hands and feet, muscle weakness and depression., Take Vitamin B12 and folic acid together for best results. Folic acid supplements alone can mask anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency.Vitamin B12 and folic acid work synergistically to support heart and nerve health. , This ensures that your body will process and digest the supplement along with your food.Stick to a schedule. Because daily intake is important for folic acid, take it at a convenient time when you will remember. If you have trouble, set an alarm on your phone or computer.Avoid taking folic acid while drinking green tea. Some research suggests it decreases folic acid absorption. , Alcohol can interfere in the body's ability to absorb folic acid and promotes excretion of folic acid into urine.Alcoholics with folate deficiency are more at risk to develop liver injuries., Folic acid is destroyed by air and heat and the amount present in the foods can decrease significantly if food is improperly stored, overcooked, or reheated.Steaming is an excellent method for cooking vegetables since it preserves vitamins, including folate, better than boiling., Orange juice or a Vitamin C supplement can aid in the body's absorption of nutrients including folic acid."

Remember to eat regular meals.,
Ask for help.,
Have healthy snacks on hand.,
Set realistic expectations.",How to Eat Healthy As a New Mom1," You may feel any sense of routine you had is gone once you bring home a baby. It can be difficult to even remember to sit down and eat when you've been up caring for the baby. Remind yourself that you need to be eating regular meals throughout the day. This will give you steady energy. Eating regular meals will also stop you from making poor food decisions on an empty stomach.If you need to, set an alarm on your phone that reminds you when it's time to eat a meal.
If you have help, have someone care for the baby while you sit down for a meal.;
, Friends and family members often want to help when a new baby comes. A great way they can help is to bring you meals. There are several meal sharing applications or programs, so your friends and family can organize which date and when they want to drop off food. Just let them know that you'd prefer healthy food.


For example, don't be afraid to request no junk food, cookies, or fried foods. Many apps also have a place for you to list any dietary restrictions.

, Since you'll be up throughout the night and be busy caring for your baby during the day, you'll probably find that you're hungrier than usual. This is especially true if you're breastfeeding. Try to have nutritious snacks that you can eat with one hand. If you can, portion them into serving sizes. Some good examples of snacks include:Cut fresh fruit with a yogurt dip
Granola bars
Hard boiled eggs
Cut vegetables and hummus or bean dip

, Talk with your doctor about a reasonable calorie-intake during the postpartum period. One of the perks of breastfeeding is that you'll actually need about 500 more calories a day, so your body can produce milk (for a total of 2200 to 2400 calories a day). If you're not breastfeeding, you'll probably need to get between 1900 and 2200 calories a day.Avoid cutting too many calories in the early postpartum period, since your body needs a chance to recover from childbirth.

Aim for 400 – 600 micrograms of folic acid daily.Diets of males and females over the age of the 13 years should include 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, while pregnant woman of all ages should aim for 600 micrograms each day.,
Eat plenty of foods high in folic acid.,
Take a multivitamin or a complex B-vitamin supplement daily.",How to Best Absorb Folic Acid2," Adults should not take over 1000 micrograms a day from supplements or fortified food unless advised to by a physician.Controlled trials indicate that proper folic acid intake protects against strokes and heart disease.Although most people don’t notice side effects from folic acid, some may experience nausea, gas, bloating, trouble sleeping and other symptoms.There is a possibility to overdose on folic acid. This can result in symptoms such as breathing difficulty, weakness, fatigue, or changes in urine color among other indications., Folic acid that occurs naturally in foods is called folate. The best sources include asparagus, broccoli, chickpeas, lentils and other legumes.Other good sources include eggs, cauliflower, and papaya.The FDA requires that enriched breads, cereals, flours, pastas and other grain products have added folic acid. These are important contributors of folic acid intake to the American diet., While a diet with folate-rich foods is important, most people cannot absorb the daily requirements for folic acid through food alone.Choose a vitamin or supplement that contains at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. The body is able to absorb approximately 100 percent of folic acid taken in supplement form.Because folic acid is water-soluble and is excreted in urine, it requires daily supplementation. The body cannot store folic acid.Avoid eating too many heavily fortified foods while also taking a multivitamin. This can increase your risk for overdosing on folic acid."
"
Take folic acid before you plan to become pregnant.,
Take a prenatal multivitamin.,
Discuss whether you need extra folic acid with your doctor.",How to Best Absorb Folic Acid3," Adequate folic acid intake prevents neural tube defects (NTDs), which affect the spinal cord and brain. The neural tube is the part of the embryo from which the brain and spinal cord develop.Because NTDs happen within the first month of pregnancy, it is important to ensure that you are getting enough folic acid every day, before you even know you are pregnant.Folic acid intake can also prevent other birth defects involving the heart, upper lip, and palate. It can also reduce a mother's risk for preeclampsia, a serious blood pressure disease that can threaten the life of the mother and baby.Neural tube deficiencies adversely affect 3,000 pregnancies per year.The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida, where the fetal spinal column does not close completely, and anencephaly, which results in incomplete development of the fetus’ head, skull, and scalp.Taking folic acid can help reduce a baby’s risk of NTDs by up to 70%., Prenatal vitamins contain 600 micrograms of folic acid, and are a key source for the nutrients needed to prevent serious birth defects.Prenatal vitamins contain more folic acid than standard adult multivitamins., If you have had a pregnancy affected by a NTD in the past, are obese, or have diabetes, you may need extra folic acid during pregnancy.Women who are overweight appear to be more likely to have babies with neural tube defects.With no intervention, women who have previously had an NTD-affected pregnancy have a three to five percent chance of another NTD-complicated pregnancy.If you've previously been pregnant with a baby with a neural tube defect, you'll probably be advised to take 4,000 mcg of folic acid a day.

Stay hydrated.,
Include omega-3 fatty acids.,
Get protein with your meals and snacks.,
Eat iron-rich foods.,
Consume more fiber.",How to Eat Healthy As a New Mom2," Try to drink at least 13 8-ounce (240 ml) glasses of water a day, especially if you're breastfeeding. Be in the habit of drinking whenever you're thirsty or consider carrying around a water bottle, so you can stay hydrated throughout the day. Drinking water can prevent constipation and help your body recover from delivery.Milk, juice, and tea also count towards your daily fluid intake. Just limit the amount of juice you drink since it is high in sugar.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats like DHA and EPA that are often found in seafood or supplements. (Always check with your doctor before taking any supplements.) Studies have shown that getting omega-3s can lower your risk for postpartum depression. You can get omega-3s in your diet by eating salmon, cod, tuna, or sardines. You can also take fish oil to get the health benefits.If you'd rather take a supplement and you're breastfeeding, look for one that contains 625mg of DHA and 410 mg of EPA. If you aren't breastfeeding, choose one with around 300 mg of each. Remember to check with your doctor first before starting any supplements.

, A lot of snacks or convenience foods are high in carbohydrates which can give you a quick burst of energy. But you also need to include protein with your snacks and meals. This will keep you feeling fuller longer and can give you a steadier supply of energy. Good sources of protein include:Peanut butter
Eggs
Yogurt
Cheese

, Most women can get enough iron from eating a balanced diet. Your body needs iron to help it recover from the blood loss from childbirth. Increasing your iron intake is also important if you feel extra tired, dizzy or weak. Try to eat foods high in iron, like leafy greens, lean meats, tofu, and fortified cereals.


If you lost a lot of blood during the delivery or have had more than one pregnancy and delivery within the past two years, your doctor will probably recommend an iron supplement., Your body will go through big adjustments as it returns to the pre-pregnancy state. To prevent constipation, ensure that you're getting plenty of fiber. To include fiber, eat several servings of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains a day. You can also talk with your doctor about taking a fiber supplement.Good sources of fiber include high-fiber cereals, beans and legumes, berries, and dried fruits.

"
"
Avoid extreme diets.,
Talk with your doctor about supplements.,
Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol.,
Get plenty of exercise.",How to Eat Healthy As a New Mom3," You may be tempted to drastically cut back on your calorie intake in order to lose pregnancy weight quickly, but this isn't the healthiest way to lose the weight. Talk with your doctor about making gradual adjustments, so you lose one or two pounds a week. You'll be more likely to keep the weight off and lose the weight in a way that's healthy for you and your baby (if you're breastfeeding).Keep in mind that breastfeeding burns 500 calories a day. If you plan on breastfeeding, you probably won't need to cut any calories for a while.

, If you're eating a balanced diet and not breastfeeding, your doctor may not suggest any nutritional supplements. But if you're breastfeeding or you're concerned that you're not getting the nutrients you need, your doctor might recommend that you take a postpartum vitamin or continue taking your prenatal vitamin. Ensure that the vitamin contains:Vitamin D
Calcium
Iron (if anemia is suspected)

, It may be tempting to drink more coffee or caffeinated sodas to increase your energy levels, but you should limit or avoid them. Sodas are full of sugars that offer no nutritional value. If you plan on breastfeeding, your baby may be sensitive to the caffeine, so plan on cutting or limiting your intake. You should also watch or avoid alcohol intake, especially if you're breastfeeding.Avoid heavy drinking if you're stressed or anxious about caring for your baby. If you're having difficulty coping, talk with your doctor or a friend.

, Fuel a healthy appetite and gradual weight loss by exercising regularly. While you may not have as much time to hit the gym as you did before the baby's birth, you can still do low-key exercises that are recommended by your doctor.For example, you can fast-walk with your baby in a stroller or learn to do pelvic stretches that can improve your healing.

Consider a certificate sonography program.,
Consider an associate's degree sonography program.,
Consider a bachelor's degree sonography program.,
Consider a master degree sonography program.,
Consider a diploma sonography program.",How to Choose a Sonography School1," Certificate programs are designed for students who already have a medical field degree, or for licensed medical professionals who want to expand their medical service offerings. Certificate programs typically take less time to complete than a degree, and are offered through vocational schools, community colleges and medical training institutes.


Evaluate the certificate curriculum. Coursework for a sonography certificate typically includes basic physiology, pathology and anatomy courses, in addition to sonography classes like principles of sonography, obstetric ultrasound, vascular sonography, abdominal ultrasound, instrumentation and medical ethics. Certificate programs usually provide hands-on learning through clinical rotations and classroom practicums.;
, An Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Diagnostic Medical Sonography degree provides the education and training needed for entry-level sonography jobs. Most AAS degree programs take about 2 years to complete at a community college, university or medical training institute.


Assess the curriculum. AAS degree programs typically require courses in anatomy, physiology, pathology, patient care and medical ethics. Students can expect to take sonography classes like ultrasound instrumentation and sonography techniques, as well as specialized courses in abdominal ultrasound and gynecological ultrasound. The curriculum requires classroom studies, lab work and clinical education, which is usually affiliated with a local medical center or hospital.

, A bachelor's degree in diagnostic medical sonography is a 4-year program at a college or university. The Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography degree prepares students for entry- and mid-level sonography jobs.


Evaluate the curriculum. A bachelor's degree in diagnostic medical sonography usually requires courses in anatomy, pathology, physiology and medical ethics. Students take sonography courses that address the principles and methods for abdominal, vascular and pelvic sonographic examinations. Classes may include sectional anatomy, physics of ultrasound, abdominal sonography, vascular sonography, and obstetrical and gynecological sonography. Students usually participate in internships at hospitals, clinics and campus medical centers.

, Working professionals may decide to pursue a Master Degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography because they want to enhance career opportunities. The master degree is usually sought by those who want to become administrators, private industry consultants, academic or commercial researchers or teachers.


Review curriculum to determine applicability to achieving goals. A master degree can be earned in less than 15 months if there are few or no prerequisite courses to take. The classes are focused on topics like healthcare trends and ethics; research methods; epidemiology; writing on medical topics; clinical pharmacology; special issues connected with cardiac, pediatric or vascular sonography; and applied clinical training.

, The diploma programs are an option for students who have already earned a bachelor’s degree or associate’s degree in an area that may or may not be related to medical imaging. The students who do not have an Allied Health degree or a degree in medical imaging may have to complete more prerequisites than someone who has been working in Radiologic Technology or Nuclear Medicine. Typically, the diploma sonography program can be completed in less than 18 months.


Assess how the diploma program will enhance career options. Since students already have a degree, the program consists of courses that concentrate on sonography training. The typical courses include principles of sonography; imaging of the abdomen, obstetrical and gynecological areas; cross-sectional imaging; ultrasound instrumentation; ethics and legal issues; and medical management. Students will also take specialty classes if they choose a vascular or cardiac concentration.

Go to the website.,
Pick how you want to enter the information.,
Choose the correct profession.,
Search through the results.,
Contact the New York State Board of Nursing.,
Use the online Nurses License Verification.",How to Check a New York State Nursing License," You will need the correct spelling of the nurse's name. Make sure it is the same spelling (and name) that nurse used when he or she got the license.You can search with only 3 letters of each name (the first and last), but it's better to have the full name.
If you're an employer, ask the nurse you are checking for this information. You can also pull it from the person's job application. Even if you're not an employer, you should ask the person for this information if you feel the need to check his or her license. You can also pull it from the person's name tag, if he or she has one. You may want to check someone's license if you don't feel they're acting in a professional manner.;
, It may be easier to find the correct license if you have the actual license number. You have the option of putting in either the name or the license number.In fact, this option may be more accurate, as more than one nurse with the same name may have a license in the state.

, While the nurse's aide, licensed practical nurse (LPN), and registered nurse (RN) licenses are fairly straightforward, the nurse practitioner license is divided into subcategories. For instance, you can choose from ""Nurse Practitioner - Adult Care"" or ""Nurse Practitioner - College Health."", Like most states, employers in New York are required by state law to verify employees' licenses, including nurse's aides. The state of New York monitors searches to make sure employers are performing the proper checks., You can check for a nurse's license on the website for the New York State Education Department. It has databases where you can look up licenses by profession. You can find the proper site at http://www.op.nysed.gov/opsearches.htm.Note that you must use a different website for nurse's aides. The website is https://registry.prometric.com/registry/public. You can also call 1-800-918-8818.Both of these websites are free to use.

, You can either enter the name or the license number. The website has separate search fields for each one.When you enter the name, put the last name in first. Add a comma and a space, and enter the first name.The last name must have at least three characters. That means that even if the person's last name only has two characters, you should add a third character in the form of a space.On the nurse's aide website, you'll also choose either the certificate number or the nurse's name. This website has separate fields for last name, first name, and middle name., When searching for a nurse's license, you must find the proper license on the drop-down menu. You can choose LPN, RN, or a variety of types of nurse practitioners.On the nurse's aide website, the profession is already chosen for you., Hopefully, you'll be lucky and only have one or two results. If you have more, you may need to sift through them to find the right one. If you get no results, you may want to check the spelling or number again to make sure you put the information in correctly.


If you're positive that you've entered the information in correctly, that may mean that the person you are searching for is not registered in New York State.
When results are displayed, you can click on the desired name or license number to view detailed information including the original date the license was registered, additional qualifications, and the current status of the license., If you can't verify the license through the website, you can try contacting the the Board of Nursing directly. You can call (518) 474-3817, extension 120. You can also visit them at Education Bldg., 89 Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor West Wing, Albany, NY 12234., Another way you can verify a license is through a national database at Nursys License Verification. Visit www.nursys.com and click on ""Search Quick Confirm,"" where you can search in pretty much the same way as you used the New York State system. However, you also must choose a state for the license."

Ensure the sonography school is accredited.,
Evaluate the school's certification success rate.,
Consider the school's career placement success.",How to Choose a Sonography School2," An accredited school meets the minimum educational and clinical standards set by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers. If a sonography school is not accredited, graduates are not eligible to become nationally certified. Make sure the school is accredited by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers or the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs

, Certification is not required for diagnostic medical sonographers, but many employers require the Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer certification through the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography. In order to earn this credential, participants must pass 2 exams. Most schools track their students' success rates in achieving certification because it provides evidence of the program's ability to prepare students for sonography careers. If the certification statistics are not posted on the school's website, they usually are available upon request.

, In order to evaluate the school's sonography program, it is important to assess the success of its graduates. Most sonography schools provide data about the percentage of graduates working in the sonography field and the types of jobs they are doing.


Inquire about the school's career placement opportunities. Many sonography schools offer career placement assistance to their students, including resume development, job postings and career fairs. Some schools have relationships with local hospitals and medical centers, and offer local job opportunities to recent sonography graduates.

"
"
Determine which learning environment meets your needs.,
Assess the location of the sonography school.,
Evaluate the school's facilities.,
Consider the tuition and related expenses.",How to Choose a Sonography School3,"


Consider sonography schools that offer online courses, which enable students to attend lectures, complete assignment and take quizzes through online learning platforms. However, because hands-on experience is required for most sonography certificate and degree programs, students must complete clinical rotations in person at local medical clinics or hospitals.
Consider hybrid programs that combine online and classroom learning. Hybrid programs provide opportunities for student interaction with the convenience of online learning. Hybrid programs require students to participate in clinical rotations at local medical facilities.
Consider traditional classroom learning programs. While there are many schools offering online sonography degrees, the majority of accredited programs are classroom-based. The classroom-based programs feature lectures, small group discussions and lab work, in addition to clinical rotations at local medical clinics and hospitals.

, If you prefer an online learning program, the school's location may not be a factor in choosing a sonography school. However, if you prefer hybrid or classroom-based learning, the school's location may be a determining factor. Consider not only how far the school is from you, but also the travel time required to get to and from classes.

, Tour the school and observe the facilities. Inquire about the type of laboratory equipment used, specifically the type of ultrasound machines. Ask how old the equipment is and how often the school updates its imaging equipment. Students should look for schools that have the latest equipment and update their equipment regularly. Be sure to inquire about ultrasound training simulators, test mannequins and other equipment used for hands-on training.

, Costs vary between sonography schools, and can depend on factors like the degree level and whether the school is public or private. The tuition for a 1-year sonography school starts at about $4,000, while a bachelor's degree program is typically about $30,000.


Ask about scholarships, financial aid and grants. Some schools offer scholarships and/or financial aid to students, ranging from partial tuition to full tuition. In most cases, students must show financial need in order to qualify.
Inquire about additional costs. Some sonography school tuition costs include books and classroom materials, while others do not. Other schools may charge lab or equipment fees. Some schools require students to wear sonographer uniforms, which may not be included in the program tuition. Ask about all related fees before enrolling in a sonography program.

Re-certify your EMT certificate through Continuing Education classes acceptable to the state (or national) re-certification requirements.",How to Become EMT Certified," While a vision exists to align EMS education and certification procedures nationally, there is still variance at the state level. Each state will have minimum certification requirements and most maintain a list of authorized EMS instructors and training facilities.;
, You might just save a life before you become an EMT! If you're thinking medical, make sure it's a healthcare provider class so that it counts later on.

, Usually you can join a fire department or rescue squad without being an EMT and it's a great source of information for furthering your career. Many departments have Explorer programs for teenagers, which allow you a view on the inside to determine if it is right for you.

, Some employers are looking for certified paramedics to fill EMT slots, but the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) designation may be right for you if you're just looking for an entry level certification to test the waters. Classes will not always be offered close by, you may need to commute to other counties to find a class that will fit your needs and goals. It even helps to take simulated practice tests from viable EMT test prep sources since you must pass the National Registry examination before getting your state license.

, Once you are in an EMT class you will be required to have a certain amount of hours riding along in an ambulance, learning from experienced EMTs.

, Many EMT courses are broken up into two sections: A lecture portion consisting of book work and written tests, and a laboratory portion that includes skills review and a practical test. EMS training facilities are introducing technology such as interactive simulators (patient and ambulance) that allow you to practice what you will do in the field.

, Each state offers at least one EMT test a year (usually more) you must successfully complete the class to be allowed to test at the site. The test will include a written test and practical examination. The didactic portion is now available online in many areas and the skills are sometimes demonstrated during you laboratory final in class, but you may have to attend a practical exam separately from the written test if this is not an option in the training program you select. Find out before you register.

, You can go online and check to see if you are on your state EMT registry weeks before they will send you a letter that lets you know if you pass or not (Google your state name and ""EMT registry"" to find this list)

, You have two more attempts to take the state test if you fail. After a certain number of attempts, you will be required to retake the EMT course before you will be allowed to test again. This is why it's suggested that individuals take test simulations online before tackling the arduous EMT testing process.

, The medical field is constantly evolving. Stay abreast of dynamic changes by joining professional groups an subscribing to educational literature. If you notice a big change, try to take a class so that you can be competent in the new procedures.

, EMTs are required to maintain documentation for their continuing education courses. Most states allow a portion of the requirement to come from online sources, but it's worthwhile to attend skills refreshers for core areas like CPR and Airway Management in person.

In fact, the earlier you starting planning, the better. You need to have a high aptitude for school work, which entails testing well, having good study strategies, and learning things quickly.


Plan to maintain a good high school resume—including high grades, high test scores, community service, and clubs and organizations—in order to get into a top college.
Your college application should also include an impeccable entrance essay, evidence of personal attributes that will do well in college (i.e. leadership qualities), and letters of recommendation from teachers.Classes that are most directly related to orthopedic surgery in high school might include biology, anatomy and physiology, chemistry, and the Advanced Placement (AP) versions of these courses.;
, In high school and college, you should do your utmost to develop good study habits. These habits will be your key to success in medical school, during your residency, and if you have your own practice. Orthopedic surgeons should have strong skills in study management, self-discipline, memorization, organization, and concentration.

, All surgeons need to show signs of a mechanical ability, specifically being good with their hands and fingers. Surgery is a delicate skill, especially when operating on the spine. Orthopedic surgeons must have excellent finger coordination.Do things like playing cards, sewing, playing guitar, or making jewelry.Orthopedic surgeons also need to have extremely good 3-D visualization skills in order to execute successful surgeries. You can develop these spatial skills by practicing drawing or drafting.Orthopedic surgeons are also usually very active individuals, enjoying sports and showing leadership in athletics.

, The first step after high school for an orthopedic surgeon is to get into a good undergraduate college. Orthopedic surgeons should major in biology, pre-medicine, or a field related to this. After obtaining a Bachelor’s of Science in one of these fields, aspiring surgeons can look toward medical school.Just as having a strong high school resume was required to get into a good undergraduate program, a strong and well-rounded college resume is required to get into medical school.
In order to apply for medical school, undergrads must take the MCAT, a standardized entrance exam that proves you are ready for the rigors of medical school.
The MCAT can cost anywhere from $100 to $2,000., After obtaining a BS in biology or pre-med or something similar, and getting a high MCAT score, your next step is to attend medical school. During these four years in medical graduate school, you will earn a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) or Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree. Maintain high grades and skill performance here in order to get a residency.


There are only about 650 residency programs available each year, making this a highly competitive field., The most important part of an orthopedic surgeon’s training is their residency, which should last five years, and specializes in orthopedic practices. Most residencies today include four years of orthopedic surgery training followed by one year of training in general medicine.The final year of general medicine can be in general surgery, internal medicine, or pediatrics.
Some residencies require even more general training, and include only three years of orthopedic training with two years of general medicine.

, Before being able to obtain a license as an orthopedic specialist, you must have two years of practicing orthopedic surgery under your belt. That means that before you can actually obtain a license, which you need for opening your own practice, you must pass through at least 13 years of training after high school.This means that if you graduate high school at 18, you will be at least 31 before you are officially called an orthopedic surgeon.

, After 13 years of training, you must pass two examinations in order to obtain your orthopedic surgery licensure. These exams are usually taken while students are still in their residencies and have both written and oral components., The U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and/or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX) are required in order for orthopedic surgeons to legally practice medicine. The exam contains three steps and evaluates a doctor’s aptitude for being a doctor, including knowledge, concepts, and principles.Each step of the exam has a different fee, costing $70, $600, and $1,275 for different components.This is the general licensure exam that all doctors must take.

, In order to become licensed as an orthopedic specialist, surgical residents must also pass the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) and/or the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery (AOBOS) exams. These exams ensure the safe practices of orthopedic surgeons in the U.S. The exam is called Maintenance of Certification (MOC) and has four sections. Fees for the exam are over $1,000, with a late fee of $350.This test is required again every 7 to 10 years.

, Duties of orthopedic surgeons are usually divided between actual surgery and non-surgical maintenance of injuries or diseases. The split is usually 50% each, so even if you are passionate about surgery and want to always be in the operating room, you should be prepared to spend half your time in the doctor’s office.Surgeries typically performed by orthopedic surgeons are usually done to repair damage done by injury to bones, joints, tendons, skin, nerves, ligaments, or muscles.

, Since half an orthopedic surgeon’s patients do not require surgery, an orthopedic surgeon should be well versed in body care that does not place patients under the knife. They should be able to use rehabilitative methods to treat musculoskeletal injuries just as well as they use surgery.They should also use medical knowledge and physical methods to treat musculoskeletal problems.

, Orthopedic surgeons often work with other doctors to treat many different types of medical conditions. In fact, they treat so many different conditions that their knowledge of the body is extremely vast, which is why residency programs require at least one year of work in general medicine in addition to working in an orthopedic specialty.Orthopedic surgeons often serve as consultants for primary care doctors and others who receive patients with musculoskeletal complaints.
Orthopedic surgeons must be able to treat many different conditions, including but not limited to bone breaks, sprains, torn ligaments, club feet, abnormalities in the fingers and toes, and bone tumors.
Orthopedic surgeons also have the ability to replace joints with prosthetic devices, called total joint replacement.

, Orthopedic surgeons, even after receiving licensure and having their own practice, must maintain understanding of the medical field. They must know current medical technologies, stay abreast of medical ethics, and keep up to date with pharmacology and physiology.This may mean attending conferences and training sessions on top of their responsibilities with their patients.
They must obtain a re-certification from the ABOS or AOBOS every 7 to 10 years.

, Both the prospects for growth in this field and the salary of orthopedic surgeons are hopeful for prospective doctors. Between 2014 and 2024, the entire field of surgery is expected to grow by 14%, which is much faster than average. The median U.S. salary for all surgeons in 2015 was $187,200 per year., Currently only about eight percent of orthopedic surgeons are employed solely by hospitals, although that number is predicted to increase over the next few years. Hospital employment is good for surgeons who want predictable hours and freedom from the stress of managing their own practices.However, working for a hospital means your schedule and activities are dictated.

, About 20 percent of orthopedic surgeons today run their own practices, which is a lot more than the eight percent who work in hospitals. Private solo practices are good for surgeons who want to make a name for themselves, want freedom to dictate their own schedules, and who don't mind paperwork.Having a solo practice means you need to also have head for business, since a solo practice essentially means running a small business.

, The vast majority--42 percent--of orthopedic surgeons work in private practice, which means they either work as part of an orthopedic group or part of a multi-specialty group.As part of an orthopedic group, you share the business management with other surgeons and can find others to cover shifts.


The downside of joining a group of surgeons in the same specialty is that it reduces potential for making a strong name for yourself.

, Some orthopedic surgeons join practices that offer other specialties in orthopedics, such as spine, sports medicine, and hip surgeons. Multi-specialty offices tend to pay surgeons at a higher rate than other locations.For example, orthopedic spine surgeons in multi-specialty groups got paid over $622,000 in 2009, while those in single-specialty practices made around $605,000.

Find employment.",How to Become an Ob Gyn," Some OB/GYNs will eventually specialize in either obstetrics or gynecology, but the majority treat both. Becoming an OB/GYN requires extensive knowledge of women’s reproductive organs and all stages of pregnancy. Before deciding to become an OB/GYN, ask yourself if you are interested in spending years learning about and eventually providing procedures such as:


Cervical exams
Pap smears
Fertility testing
Uterine surgery
Child delivery
Abortion
STI/STD screening
Hysterectomy
Ovarian surgery
Bladder surgery for prolapse
Surgery for incontinence
Surgery for rectal prolapse;
, If you decide on becoming an OB/GYN while still in high school, take upper-level science and math courses, as this will help you later on. Work hard to obtain the high grades necessary to attend the university or college of your choice. Research the reputations of pre-med programs and available scholarship opportunities. Start preparing your university or college applications early so they are polished and stand out.


If you pursue college or university in the United States, start studying for the SAT test right away. An excellent SAT score is necessary for admission to prestigious universities and colleges. Your school may also require ACT scores, so find out if you need to take both tests.
Consider getting involved in extracurricular activities at your high school, and volunteering in your community, preferably at a hospital or clinic. The best universities and colleges prefer well-rounded applicants who give back to their communities.

, A pre-med program is not a degree; it is an educational trajectory that will help you get into medical school. Pre-med entails coursework in fields such as biology, organic chemistry, and statistics. These courses will satisfy medical school prerequisites, and help you prepare for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Although pre-med is not a requirement for entry into medical school, it will give you a big advantage over the competition.
Many pre-med programs offer work or volunteer opportunities at hospitals and clinics. Consider pursuing such opportunities because they can enhance your application to medical school, and affirm that an OB/GYN career is truly what you want.
Keep your GPA at 3.5 or above as an undergraduate, as this will significantly improve your chances of getting into medical school. You should complete a four year undergraduate degree program, and preferably an honors degree.

, This test is a mandatory requirement for most medical schools in North America and many schools internationally. It will require months of studying and preparation; don’t try to “cram” close to the deadline. The test is comprised of multiple choice questions pertaining to the physical sciences, biological sciences, and verbal reasoning. The MCAT is held in designated testing locations with varied schedules and seating capacity, so be sure to register in advance.If unsatisfied with your grade, you can retake the MCAT. But medical schools can see how many attempts you have made, and multiple failed attempts will weaken your application. Each time you take the MCAT costs money, generally around 300 dollars.If you want to become an OB/GYN outside North America, research the medical school examination requirements in your home country.

, Choosing a medical school can be difficult due to factors such as tuition cost, location, and reputation. But try to get into a school that is known for OB/GYN and women’s health. This will result in desirable professional connections and potentially greater employment opportunities down the road.


Do online research to see which medical schools have the best rankings in the area of OB/GYN. U.S. News and World Report has one of the most comprehensive rankings for American schools.Consider contacting OB/GYN physicians for advice on where to apply.

, In general, a medical doctorate takes four years to complete. The first two years entails coursework on a range of medical issues. In the final two years of the degree, you will complete a series of medical rotations, working with patients under the direction of licensed physicians in many fields, such as OB/GYN.


It is particularly important to obtain strong grades in the OB/GYN rotation if you plan to pursue this specialization.
Be sure to complete at least one sub-internship in the field prior to graduation.

, In general, a residency program is four years in length, and entails hands-on experience in gynecology, obstetrics, and benign gynecological surgery. During a residency, you will care for patients under the supervision of more senior physicians, and will earn a relatively low salary (often in the $45,000 dollar range);however, at this phase of OB/GYN training, you will have the rewarding experience of doing everything from helping women through difficult pregnancies, to performing surgeries that will greatly improve lives.


Consider your residency options carefully, as programs vary greatly.
Conduct research into the reputation and stability of residency programs, the support available from peers and superiors, whether schedules are flexible or on-call hours, and opportunities for advancement.
The Residency Navigator is an excellent tool for learning about residency programs. Visit: https://residency.doximity.com/ , Following a successful residency, the next step is to apply for a license to practice medicine. Although the licensing process varies between states and countries, all jurisdictions require a medical licensing examination. In the U.S., there are two licensing examinations: the United States Medical Licensing Examination (required for licensure of medical students from Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) programs and optional for medical students attending from Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) programs) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX), which is required for licensure of D.O. medical students .

, After becoming licensed physicians, many OB/GYNs pursue certification by a professional governing body. Applicants must submit proof of experience and pass an additional written and an oral exam. In the U.S., certification is issued by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and/or the American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology., Following licensing and certification, some OB/GYNs pursue three-year fellowships at teaching hospitals that allow them to specialize and conduct research in areas such as maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric and adolescent gynecology, and gynecologic oncology, reproductive endocrinology.


Pursuing such specializations can double your annual salary.
For example, gynecologic oncologists generally make well over $400,000 a year, while general OB/GYNs typically earn over $200,000 a year., OB/GYNs can work in a variety of settings. Some join or establish private practices or women’s clinics. Others work primarily out of hospitals. Some OB/GYNs focus on obstetrics and childbirth, others emphasize gynecology. A smaller number of OB/GYNs join academic medical schools as full-time faculty members with administrative, teaching and research responsibilities. . The options for OB/GYNs are numerous; choose an employment direction that is in keeping with your personality, goals, and interests.


While obstetrics can be stressful because it entails late-night phone calls and sudden deliveries, many OB/GYNs love being part of the emotionally charged process of childbirth.
A rewarding aspect of gynecology is greater opportunities for surgical research.
While the process of becoming an OB/GYN is long and difficult, once trained and licensed, the job prospects are excellent; there is extremely high demand for OB/GYNs now, and this demand is only projected to grow in the future., The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintains excellent online resources for job-seekers. At http://www.acog.org/, you can browse for jobs by specialization, location, keyword, and other filters.This website also has many articles regarding how to prepare an OB/GYN resume, tips for job interviews, and the pros and cons of working in different cities and regions."

Start with classes like biology, as well as classes like anatomy and physiology.Consider taking concurrent classes at a local college. That way, you can really get an idea of what the field is like before jumping in. Ask your guidance counselor if your school offers concurrent classes.;
, One way to get your feet wet in ornithology, even when you're in high school, is to join a bird-watching club. Most communities have these clubs, and they'd be happy to welcome a high school student.Ask at your local library or parks and recreation department to see if they know of any bird-watching clubs in the area.
You can also use social media to find like-minded friends and clubs in your area.

, To be an ornithologist, you need a college education. Start with a degree in life sciences, such as ecology, zoology, or wildlife biology. These degrees can help prepare you for the field.While studying for your degree, try to take any courses you can that are specifically focused on ornithology.
Another important focus is mathematics, particularly analytic geometry, statistics, and calculus, which can help you when preparing research. English class can also be helpful, as they can teach you how to write well when it comes to making reports., Ornithology is a broad field, and while working on your bachelor's degree or shortly afterwards, you'll need to decide what you want to do in that field. What you plan to pursue can affect your next steps.Consider the specialties in the field. For instance, some ornithologists specialize in marine ornithology, studying birds that live near the water. Others may specialize in the birds in a particular area, such as the birds of south Texas.
For instance, you may want to become a lobbyist, working for the interests of birds by trying to change policy in Washington DC. Alternatively, you may want to do fieldwork or research, where you study the habits of birds in their natural habitats.
You may want to go into education, from working at a nature center to teaching at a university.
Another option is working towards maintaining habitats or helping to conserve the resources that birds have left. You may also work as park ranger in one of the nation's national parks or even a state park.
While doing this work, you may gather and analyze data, watch birds in their natural habitats, record bird behavior, and give reports and presentations.

, If you're not sure what part of the field you want to go into or even if you do know, an internship can help you focus your career. Summer jobs, even more general ones that focus on life sciences, can also give you valuable experience, especially if they teach you about things like researching animals and habitats.Another option is volunteering at a local nature park.
Ask at your school to see if there are any internships in the area. Also, check at nearby national and state parks to see what kind of part-time work they have.

, Ornithological conferences can help acquaint you with what's being done in the field. Plus, you'll be able to hear from a variety of people on a wide range of research, so it can help you narrow down what you want to focus on. Some conferences are free, but for most, you'll need to pay a fee and travel to the conference.While still in school, ask your professors if they know about any conferences on the topic in your area or across the nation.
You can also join local ornithological groups that have a connection to a national group, as many of these groups will have regional and national meetings.
For instance, the American Ornithologists' Union is one national group that is focused on ornithology., While graduate school may not be absolutely necessary, it is preferred if you're working in research or teaching. Once you decided on the area you want to go into, you can narrow the type of graduate work you want to do.For entry-level positions, you may get away with a bachelor's degree. However, if you want to move up in the field, you'll want to pursue at least a master's degree if not a PhD.
You'll need a PhD if you plan to do your own research or teach at a university., One key factor for most ornithologist is being able to observe birds and their habits methodically. In addition, you must be able to record the information you observe so that it can be beneficial to others.Methodical means you are diligent in your study. You go out at least once a day to observe the birds for a certain period of time, and you record the details of what you observe each day. For instance, you may want to observe how often a bird appears in your yard, what foods it seems interested in, and what kind of nest it lays in the spring.
You'll learn some of this type of research in school. However, interning with a researcher will help to develop this skill more.
If you haven't found someone to intern with yet, practice this skill on your own. That is, take time to observe birds in your area every day, making notes on their habits and movements. You may choose to just focus on a single bird.

, Raw data needs to be synthesized before it can be made sense of, and you need mathematical skills to help you do just that. Of course, your schooling should help you develop your mathematical and analytical skills, but you can work on them yourself, as well. The things you do to work on them at home probably won't be the same as what you do in the field, but they will still help to develop your thinking skills.For instance, working on thinking games, such as sudoku, bridge, chess, and cryptic crosswords, can help develop your analytical and problem-solving skills. Other things that can help include strategic computer games and learning how to evaluate sources for academic papers. A librarian, teacher, or professor can help you with learning how to evaluate sources.
You can also do things like learn computer programming and coding, which can help you with analytical skills, but it can also help you more directly in the field, as ornithologists need good computer skills.

, You'll need good oral communication skills to work with other researchers and present your research at conferences. You'll need good written communication skills to write up your research or to make informational booklets for the general public. Taking speech and English classes in college is a good place to start, but you can take other steps to improve your skills.One way to improve oral communication is to think about what you're going to say before you say it. While good listening requires that you don't do this step while another person is speaking, you can pause a moment to gather your thoughts. Doing so will help you be more concise as well as take out filler words such as ""like"" or ""um.""
An important part of communicating is listening to the other person. That means actually hearing what the person says as well as showing that you're hearing it. For instance, try asking follow up questions that indicate that you've heard what's been said, such as, ""That's an interesting point about blue jays. Do you think the same could be said about cardinals?""
Also, be sure to use non-verbal communication, too. That is, when you're talking to someone, use your body language to show you are engaged in the conversation. Incline your body towards the other person, and nod your head, for instance.One way to develop better written communication skills is to read widely. When reading, you naturally begin to pick up on the word order and choice of good writers, and you'll incorporate it into your own writing without even realizing it., If you go into this field, then you need to be flexible enough to work under these conditions.

, Just like in any field, it's important to get your name out there. One way you can do that is to network at events focused on ornithology. Whenever you go to a conference, make it a point to go up to people and talk to them.Networking is just talking to people and making connections. However, to make a connection with most people, you need to find a way to be interesting to them. One way is to figure out how to be useful. What does that person need? Another way is to be more than expected. Maybe you're just a student, but perhaps you've really done your research and know all about the person you're talking to, for instance.Always have your resume ready, as well. That way, if someone is interest in you, you have something to hand them. You can also have business cards printed up fairly cheaply, which can also be good to hand someone (when they ask).

, When you meet someone, especially someone who seems interested in you and gives you a business card, always follow up with that person later so that you stay fresh in the person's mind. Similarly, when you go to a conference and hear an interesting paper, consider emailing that person, even if you didn't actually meet him or her.A simple, ""I enjoyed meeting you at the conference the other day. You are so insightful about the local cardinals. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me,"" can go a long way.
Most people have adequate contact information online. You don't necessarily need to reach out with an objective in mind. Just saying, ""I'm new to the field, and I enjoyed what you read at X conference,"" can be a great jumping off point.

, One point of networking is using who you know to help you find a job when the time comes. You may have more people in your network than you realize. Think about the people you interned with, your professors, and people you've met at conferences. Reach out to them, through the phone, by email, or through online business social networks to see if any of them know of positions in the field.Start by re-invoking your past relationship if you haven't talked in awhile, such as, ""Hi Jess, I haven't talked to you since we worked together at Birds Forever. What have you been doing since then?""
All you're wanting to do is put feelers out to see if any job opportunities are out there. ""Well, I'm partially writing because I've finally graduated with my PhD, and now I'm looking for a job in the field. Do you know of anything where you are?""

, If you haven't already, now is the time to join a professional organization. Not only will you have access to people in the field, but also most professional organizations provide places to post jobs. Therefore, you'll also have access to job postings you might not if you weren't a part of the organization.Nonetheless, if you don't have the money to join all the professional organizations, you can still use their websites as a resource. Many of them have their job postings open to the public.The main national organization is the American Ornithologists' Union, but you might also join a local one that's a part of Ornithological Societies of America., As an ornithologist, you should look for work on websites for state and national parks. You should also look at local nature centers, as well as on government websites. Regular job search engines can be useful, as well. When looking, consider observatories and charity organizations that focus on conservation.Consider government organizations such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state fish and wildlife branches. Also, look at branches in each state devoted to natural resources. In addition, many zoos will want to hire ornithologists.Of course, universities are also an option, though usually only if you have a doctorate in the field.Don't be afraid to start small. Breaking into the field can be difficult, so you need to take a job where you can find one.

, Once you've narrowed down some job prospects, start applying across the board. Make sure the jobs at least match your skill set and experience to a degree, as it will help give you a leg up.Tailor your cover letter. Don't forget that every time you send out your resume it should have a cover letter tailored to that organization or business. The idea is to highlight the skills or experience you have that make you the right fit for that organization. Keep your resume short and simple. Don't let it go past a page, and highlight the relevant experience you have. If you're unsure how to write a resume, consider taking a short class or workshop on it. Check with your local library or parks and recreation department to see if they offer a class.

, Because the work of ornithologists is often research-based, you have the option of grants available to you. You can use a grant to fund research you want to do in the field.However, most grant-giving organizations prefer that you are connected to some organization.
One place to look for and apply for grants is through the government search engines, which list all the grants available through government sources.Also, many professional organizations also offer grants."

Though it's not as physically demanding as many other careers, there are some basic skills and abilities you'll need to possess in order to work well as an optician.Communication skills - you will need to be able to listen patiently to a customer's questions, speak calmly/politely to customers, and explain things in a way that is easy to understand.
Customer service skills - since you will most likely be working in a retail setting, you will need to be knowledgable about your products and answer any questions your patients have. It will be helpful to be friendly, courteous, patient, and outgoing with customers.
Management skills - you may be required to contribute to the business aspects of operating an optical store. As such, you should have a working knowledge of your store's sales and inventory records, and know where to find relevant sales/inventory information as needed.
Manual dexterity - because of the nature of an optician's work, you'll need to have sufficient hand-eye coordination to take measurements and operate the tools used to adjust and repair eyeglasses.;
, Depending on where you live, you may be eligible to work as an optician or take the optician licensing exams with a high school diploma or GED. Other states require a postsecondary education. Whether or not you plan on attending college, it's a good idea to start taking relevant courses while you're still in high school to prepare for a career as an optician.Taking courses in physics, basic anatomy, algebra, and trigonometry can help prepare you for a career as an optician.
Any additional math courses you take may help prepare you for the measurements and adjustments you'll need to make as an optician.

, You will need a high school diploma or GED at the very least. Some states require further education, and some employers may require a postsecondary degree or advanced certificate as well.You may be required to furnish an official transcript from your high school or GED program to your state's governing body.
The transcript must include the date you received your degree, and you may be required to have it sent directly from your school or GED program (not delivered by you)., Some states require you to successfully complete a postsecondary education program. Even if you are not required to do so, it may help make you a more marketable employee once you enter the job market.If you decide to pursue a postsecondary education program, you will have to choose between a two-year associate's degree or a one-year certificate. Your state may have requirements, or you may be able to choose the program you like best.
Check your state's optician requirements by searching online for ""optician education"" and your state.
Make sure you choose an accredited program. As of early 2016, the Commission on Opticianry Accreditation (COA) recognizes 22 accredited programs in 14 different states.
You can search a directory of accredited programs by visiting the COA website at http://www.coaccreditation.com/programs.shtml.

, Because so few postsecondary optician degree programs exist, many states allow an apprenticeship instead of a degree requirement. Apprenticeships often combine hands-on training with a predetermined amount of formal education.The availability and scope of an apprenticeship will vary considerably, depending on where you live. You can find out your state's specific requirements by searching online, or by visiting http://www.opticiantraining.org/optician-apprenticeship/ and selecting your state from the drop-down menu to the right of the page. An apprenticeship program will generally require the following from all applicants:


a completed application and applicant statement of purpose
a diploma, transcript, or equivalency certificate that verifies your completion of high school
your professional history
your health history
a criminal background check
letters of reference

, Depending on where you live, you may be required to take the American Board of Opticianry and the National Contact Lens Examiners (ABO-NCLE) licensing exams. In addition to being licensed, some states require you to pass a written exam, a practical exam, a certification exam, or some combination of these examinations. There may be additional requirements and restrictions in place, depending on where you live. Check online to see what licensing or state examinations your state requires in order to become an optician.As of early 2016, there are 23 states that require you to be licensed in order to work as an optician.
You must be at least 18 years of age in order to be eligible for the licensing exams.Each state's educational requirements may vary. Some states allow you to take the licensing exams and/or work as an optician with a high school diploma or GED, while others require some level of postsecondary education.
Some states require you to be ""of good moral character,"" which may entail a background check for criminal history.Some states require you to disclose any physical or mental health issues, substance abuse/dependency history, or previous loss of license/certification., Before taking the licensing exams, you should review your study materials from your college coursework or certification program (if applicable). The ABO-NCLE also provides some study materials on their website, which may be helpful as you prepare for the exams.When you arrive at the ABO-NCLE website, hover your mouse over the ""Exam Information"" tab, scroll through the drop-down menu, and select ""Practice Area.""

, There are two national competency exams administered by the American Board of Opticianry and the National Contact Lens Examiners (ABO-NCLE) in order to become licensed.The ABO administers the National Opticianry Competency Exam (NOCE), which is required if you plan to measure, adjust, and dispense eyeglasses. The NCLE administers the Contact Lens Registry Exam (CLRE), which you'll need to pass if you want to measure for and dispense contact lenses.The exams are offered twice each year, in May and in November. You must register on the ABO-NCLE website.
Registration will cost $225 for each exam. If you miss the registration deadline you can still register for an additional $75 late fee per exam, as long as you complete your registration by the late deadline date.
You will need to give at least 24 business hours' notice if you need to change the exam time or location before your scheduled exam. There are no refunds, but you can have your exam transferred to the next testing date for a $50 transfer fee.
There are more than 300 PSI testing centers across the United States. Check online to see which testing center is closest to you by visiting https://candidate.psiexams.com/.

, You'll need to take both exams if you wish to be licensed for both eyeglasses and contact lenses, but if you only plan to work with one or the other you'll need to take that exam. You will have two hours to complete each exam, which will be taken entirely on a computer at the testing site.When you arrive, you will need to verify your identity with a valid government-issued photo ID. Photo IDs that are not issued by the government, such as work badges or school IDs, will not be accepted.
You are prohibited from communicating with anyone else during the exam, and you must leave all personal items at home, in your vehicle, or outside the testing site.
There are 125 multiple-choice questions per exam.
The NOCE will test your knowledge of ophthalmic optics, ocular anatomy/physiology, ophthalmic products, instrumentation, and dispensing procedures.
The CLRE will test your knowledge of ocular anatomy and physiology, refractive errors, instruments used for measurement and observation, pre-fitting contact lenses, diagnostic lens fitting, dispensing procedures, follow-up assessments, and regulatory requirements.

, You will not get your results immediately. They will be sent to you by email some time after you've completed the exam.Your score will not be numeric. Instead, you will receive a pass or fail notification in the ABO-NCLE email.
Test results are usually emailed within four to six weeks from the end of the testing window.
In addition to the official email containing your results, you will receive an official certificate that is suitable for framing through the mail. It will be sent to the address you gave upon registration, and it will display the name you gave when you registered.

, Your resume makes a first impression before you ever set foot in an employer's office. It's important to keep your resume looking professional. You should also keep it relatively short, but be sure to include all the necessary relevant information.Choose a professional, straightforward font type, such as Sans-serif, Helvetica, and Garamond.Use a normal font size between 10 point and 14 point.Include your full name and contact information at the top of your resume.
List your qualifications near the beginning of your resume.
Detail any previous experience working as an optician or doing relevant work. Arrange your work experience in reverse-chronological order, with the most recent job at the top.
List your education in reverse-chronological order.
Name any professional opticianry licenses you've received., Searching for a job can be frustrating. It takes a lot of patience and perseverance, but eventually you will find job listings in your area. Start searching online, as this will give you access to the most listings available.


You can search through general career-finder websites like Indeed and Monster, or try a specialized optician jobs board like OpticianJobs.com.You can also find optician job listings through a state-wide professional organization's website. The Professional Opticians of Florida, for example, has a career marketplace on their website for finding optician jobs across the state., Interviews may be the most stressful part of the job hunt. However, once you've gotten an interview, you know you're in a better position than many other applicants. How well you prepare for the interview can make or break your chance at an optician job.Research the company, it's history, and the role you'd be filling at that company.
Brush up on recent developments in the industry so that you can speak knowledgeably and with authority on relevant subjects.
Check into how opticians dress at the place you're interviewing by visiting them in person or having a friend scout it out.
Dress appropriately for the interview. Unless the store flaunts a casual dress code, it's best to stick with business attire (including a tie for men).
Leave early so that you arrive at the interview on time (or a little early, if possible).
Be friendly, courteous, and professional during the interview. Answer all of the interviewer's questions as best you can, and ask follow-up questions to show that you're taking a genuine interest in the company.

, Many opticians receive training from an employer upon being hired. This is particularly the case if your state does not require you to have a postsecondary education. By shadowing your employer and your coworkers during on-the-job training, you'll learn how to track prescriptions, operate the necessary equipment, take measurements, and adjust/repair eyewear., Because many opticians work in a retail setting, you may be required to do some basic office and storefront maintenance on the job. This may include business-related tasks, sales/cashier work, or both.Business-related tasks you may be responsible for include organizing sales records, tracking/sorting customer prescriptions, and ordering/maintaining optical equipment.
Sales/cashier work you may be responsible for include assisting customers as they browse eyeglass frames, helping customers try on frames, and completing transactions at the cash register.

, An optician's main task is to take and record precise measurements. This is the main reason why opticians are required to be proficient in mathematics.You may have to measure a customer's face size, size/shape of the eyes, or distance between the pupils.
Depending on where you work and the size of your office's workforce, you may be required to measure and cut lenses and insert them into eyeglass frames.

, Another important aspect of working as an optician is adjusting eyeglass frames to fit the customer and making repairs when a customer's eyeglasses are damaged. You should have a working knowledge of how to use the necessary equipment to make adjustments and repairs from your apprenticeship, your formal education, or your on-the-job training."

Find a qualified dentist.,
Locate a dentist recognized by a professional dentistry organization.,
Find out how the dentist deals with emergencies.,
Map the distance from the dentist to your home.,
Check the availability of dental care for your child.,
Take your child to a regular dentist if necessary.",How to Choose a Pediatric Dentist1," Not all dentists can provide for your pediatric dentistry needs. Ask your dentist or pediatrician for recommendations regarding a good pediatric dentist. Friends and family members with children might also have useful recommendations, so ask them if they can help.As a last resort, you might choose to utilize online reviews in your efforts to find a qualified dentist.;
, Look for a dentist who is a member of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry or a similar organization. This means the dentist has special interest or training in dentistry for children. A good dentist will also hold membership in the American Dental Association or a similar professional organization., Ask the dentist or a representative of their office, “Have there ever been any emergency situations at your office? How did you – or how would you – deal with emergencies?” Listen carefully to the dentist’s answer. Avoid pediatric dentists who cannot offer a detailed and reassuring reply to these questions., There are a lot of great pediatric dentists out there, but not all of them will be within easy reach. Before selecting a pediatric dentist, determine the maximum distance you prefer to travel for pediatric dental care. Look for pediatric dentists that fall only within the zone you’ve selected.For instance, you might decide that you do not want to take your child more than 45 minutes away for dental care. In that case, only consider dental offices that are within 45 minutes’ travel time.
There is no right way to determine how far you should go for pediatric dental care. Some people will decide 30 minutes is too far, while others are willing to travel 60 minutes or more for pediatric care.

, Depending on where you live, you might have limited options about which pediatric dentist you can select. For instance, if you have a private dental insurance policy, you will only be able to select a pediatric dentist who accepts that type of insurance you have. Contact pediatric dentists you’re interested in patronizing before scheduling an appointment to find out if it is possible to receive care based on your child’s health coverage., In the rare case that you cannot locate a pediatric dentist within a reasonable range, you should be able to get adequate care from a regular dentist. Ask several dentists in the area if they accept children as patients and which ages of children they will treat. Evaluate them using the other criteria you’d use when deciding which pediatric dentist to choose."

Take the right undergraduate courses.Attend a four-year college to earn your Bachelor's degree and take courses that will prepare you for dental school.,
Plan your undergraduate years wisely.It's not enough to just take the recommended classes.,
Learn how the DAT exam is structured.The Dental Admission Exam is split into 4 parts: 1.,
Take a practice exam.,
Find studying resources.,
Be disciplined in your test preparation.,
Apply to take the DAT.You should apply for the exam 60-90 days before you actually want to take it.,
Take the Dental Admission Test.Make sure you know how to get to the testing site and find parking, etc.,
Apply to dental schools.Most dental schools use the American Dental Education Association’s website for the application process, though individual programs will link to their specific application site.Apply to dental schools during the summer after your Junior year, when you have your final DAT scores.,
Pay a deposit for a spot in dental school.If you're offered enrollment in one of the programs you applied to, you may be asked to put down a deposit to reserve your spot.,
Study hard in dental school.,

Research licensing requirements in your area.,
Apply for your dental and/or orthodontic license.,
Take and pass your licensing exam.,
Consider getting board-certified.",How to Become an Orthodontist," The best thing you can do is talk to your academic advisor to help you choose your coursework. While there is no specific major needed for admission, you will need background in specific subjects to pass the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Dental schools will also look for the following classes on your transcript when considering your application:Required: Biology with Lab; Inorganic Chemistry with Lab; Organic Chemistry with Lab; Physics with Lab; An English class with a writing focus
Recommended: Anatomy; Biochemistry; Psychology; Mathematics
Unrelated courses that make you a stronger candidate: Business; A foreign language; humanities or social science courses;
, To best prepare yourself for the DAT and admittance, you have to be smart about the order in which you take them. Some of the courses required for entrance to dental school are not actually tested on the DAT. Take the tested courses first, and save the untested courses for later. Many students take the entrance exam in the summer before their junior year. Though you should create a plan with your academic advisor, a possible roadmap for your coursework is:


Freshman year: Biology, Inorganic Chemistry, and general electives
Sophomore year: Organic Chemistry, Biology electives, Math, and general electives
Summer before Junior year: Take the Dental Admission Exam
Junior year: Physics, English, and general electives
Senior year: Biochemistry and general electives

, Survey of Natural Sciences, 2. Perceptual Ability Test (PAT), 3. Reading Comprehension, and 4. Quantitative Reasoning. The DAT is a one-day test, so you will cover all four sections on the same day. You should read the American Dental Association’s DAT Program Guide for detailed information about the exam before applying to take it.Survey of Natural Sciences: You have 90 minutes to answer 40 Biology, 30 Inorganic Chemistry, and 30 Organic Chemistry short answer questions.
PAT: You have 60 minutes to answer questions testing your spatial ability and logic. The 90 questions cover angle discrimination, cube counting, view recognition, 3D for development, and paper folding.
Reading Comprehension: You have 60 minutes to answer 50 questions testing your ability to pull information from 3 different writing passages.
Quantitative Reasoning: You have 40 minutes to answer 40 questions testing your knowledge of algebra, word problems, data analysis, quantitative comparison, and probability and statistics.

, You should begin preparing for the exam well ahead of time. You may find it helpful to take a practice exam before you begin studying, as this will help you evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. You can use that information to focus your studying hours in the areas where you need the most help. Though you have to buy practice exams from the American Dental Association, many students find the benefits outweigh the small cost.The online practice test costs $37 as of 2015, and the print format practice test costs $27 + tax and shipping.
You can purchase practice exams as often as you’d like throughout the studying process to see how you’re improving.

, There are many test-prep books, guide, and courses available to help you prepare for the exam. The most popular and widely available resources are available through Kaplan and the Princeton Review. Try to make friends with other pre-dental students who have already taken the DAT and ask for their advice on how to study for it. Ask for copies of any study guides they may have used or created for themselves.


Note that the content of the Quantitative Reasoning section changed significantly in 2015. Used or outdated guides from before 2015 will prepare you for information that is no longer on the exam, and will not prepare you for information that is now included in that section.

, When you take classes, you have a teacher setting deadlines and making sure you stay on schedule. For the DAT, though, you'll have to self-motivate. Studying for the DAT is not going to be fun, especially when your friends are out having fun. But if you want to reach your goals, you have to dedicate yourself to test prep. Just passing the test isn't enough to get into dental school — you have to achieve a highly competitive score.


Create a study schedule for yourself. If you just say that you'll study when you have spare time, you'll find you suddenly have no time to spare!
Set aside at least an hour every weekday to study for the test. You should study at the same time every Monday, and every Tuesday, etc.
Set aside more time on the weekends.

, To apply for the exam, you will first have to create a DENTPIN®, which stands for Dental Personal Identification Number.Once you've received your DENTPIN, use it to apply for the DAT on the American Dental Association's website.Test registration costs $25 if you register 31+ business days (excludes weekends and holidays) before the requested date. It costs $60 if you register 6-30 businesses days before the date, and $100 if you register 1-5 days before the test date.

, beforehand so you don't run late on the big day. Get to the test site early on test day to let yourself settle in and get used to your settings. You will need to show two forms of identification to be admitted to the exam, including one government-issued photo-ID.


The test computer allows you to ""Mark"" questions you're not sure about to come back to them. Answer all the questions you're confident about first to make sure you get all the points you can. Return to the harder questions after that.Make good use of the break you'll be given at the half-way point. Eat a snack to re-energize yourself, and stretch your legs and back. Four hours is a long time to sit in one place!
You can take the DAT up to 3 times, total, waiting 90 days between each exam. If you want to retake the exam to try for a higher score, just get back to studying and redouble your efforts.

, Admissions committees take the following into consideration when evaluating dental school applicants:


DAT scores
GPA
Letters of recommendation
Personal statementInterview — find out if your university’s career center offers mock interviews to prepare for the interview process.Experience shadowing at a dental office

, Most dental schools send out their offers in December.


As soon as you know where you're going, contact the program's financial aid office to begin the application process for financial aid.In many cases, financial aid works on a first-come-first-serve basis.

, You will earn either a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DDM), both of which qualify you to be a dentist. During the first two years of these 4-year programs, you receive classroom instruction on foundational science. During the last two years, you get hands-on experience through clinical rotations.Curricula vary from program to program, but most programs require some study of orthodontia for graduation.You'll earn your specialized orthodontic training during your residency, after dental school.

, The DAT isn't the only test you need to pass to become an orthodontist! After you graduate from dental school, you must take the NBDE to either get your license to practice or, in many cases, to apply for postdoctoral residencies. The NBDE is a two-part exam that takes three days to complete.


NBDE I: You will answer 400 questions on Anatomic Sciences; Biochemistry-Physiology; Microbiology-Pathology; and Dental Anatomy and Occlusion.NBDE II, Day 1: You will answer 400 questions on . Endodontics; Operative Dentistry; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery/Pain Control; Oral Diagnosis; Orthodontics/Pediatric Dentistry; Patient Management; Periodontics; Pharmacology; and Prosthodontics
NBDE II, Day 2: You will answer 100 case-based questions about what to do with actual patients. The exam will provide a summary of the patient's health and history; dental chart; diagnostic radiographs, and clinical photographs. From that information you must interpret the information; make a diagnosis; select materials, technique and armamentarium; treat the patient; evaluate his/her progress and complications; and establish procedures for prevention and maintenance., After you've graduated from dental school, you must apply for a residency in your field of specialty — orthodontics. Residencies last a minimum of 2 years, but often last longer. There are two systems used to find postdoctoral education: the Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS) and the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program (MATCH).The programs you apply for may use one or the other, or even both, so you should sign up for both systems.Postdoctoral programs will ask for your undergraduate and dental school transcripts, National Board Dental Exam scores, three or more letters of recommendation, work experience, and a personal statement of career goals., The requirements to practice as an orthodontist varies from state to state. Most states only ask you to get a dental license, which allows you to practice general dentistry or a specialty, like orthodontics. But some states, like Michigan, Oregon, and Idaho, require both a dental license and an orthodontic license.


Contact your state's dental board to find out which license(s) you need before you can begin your practice.Find out what you need to qualify for a license. In most cases, you will need dental school transcripts, a passing score from a national or regional dental board exam, and completion of an orthodontic residency.

, Depending on where you live, the application fee can be anywhere from $300-$600. You will also have to submit to a background check and drug testing.

, Even though you've already passed your DAT and NBDE, you still have to prove to the state that you meet their standards before you can practice. The exam varies from state to state. Contact your state dental board for information on the test's content and structure, and for guides to help you prepare.


Once you pass the licensing exam, you can legally practice as an orthodontist in the state.
If you move to a different state, you will have to repeat the licensing process. Some states will exempt you from the licensing exam if you passed it in another state, though.

, You don't have to be certified by the American Board of Orthodontics to practice — in fact, only about 1% of orthodontists are.However, getting certified can set you apart from other orthodontists in your area because it shows that you have passed yet another bar of excellence.


You will have to take and pass an exam of 240 written questions, as well as a clinical exam.Certification expires every ten years. You must take and pass a renewal exam every decade to prove you are still able to practice at a high standard."

Have it with you when you conduct career research. Makes notes not only about the information you locate during your research, but you personal thoughts and feelings about what you’ve found. Write down questions that arise while doing your research and work to get answers for them. Practice job interview questions and answers. Makes notes about things that went well and didn’t go well in interviews. Your career journal can be as structured or carefree as you want. There are no set rules as to what it should or should not contain. Allow it to reflect your personality so you’ll feel comfortable writing in it on a regular basis.;
, There are many places you can go to research different types of jobs and careers, including your guidance counsellor, a university career center, a career coaches and websites, government websites, journals and magazines, newspapers, blogs, books, and more. Start by selecting one or two of these options and investigate the details regarding a career in medicine, specifically oncology.


Learn about the details of what the job does, what type of work environment they have, educational requirements, potential pay ranges, and even what the future job market may look like.Read the advice and opinions of people who are already medical doctors and oncologists, possibly via personal blogs or a day in the life of articles.Record your findings, ideas and questions in your career journal.

, All major hospitals and medical clinics will have formal volunteer programs. Contact the volunteer coordinator and determine the application process. Apply for a volunteer position. Focus on departments or organizations related to oncology.


Consider volunteering for a local cancer charity event, like a marathon, golf tournament, or daffodil days.Use the opportunity to speak with cancer patients and their families.
Consider volunteering at a camp for children with cancer.Use the opportunity not only to make the kid’s happy, but to see how the disease affects children and the potential you have to help them in the future.
While volunteering think about what it would be like to be in a similar environment on a regular basis. What sorts of things bother you? Can you overcome them? Do you find it emotionally difficult to deal with the patients? Use this as a learning experience to help assess if oncology is still the right career goal for you.

, You will definitely have the opportunity to do something like this while in medical school, but you may want to complete a job shadow at least once before medical school to gain a better understanding of what an oncologist does on a daily basis. Some hospitals may have formal job shadowing programs, but you can also reach out personally to a department or doctor to request a job shadow.The volunteer program at a hospital, or the career center at a medical school, may be able to recommend a specific oncologist to contact directly. Or they may be able to provide you with a formal process to follow to sign up.
Bring your career journal with you to take notes. As a job shadower, you’re there to observe, not necessarily participate. Watch what goes on and write down your questions, ideas and observations.
Once the doctor is finished with his/her patients, go over your questions with them. There are no bad questions.
Dress appropriately. If you’re in a hospital setting you’ll probably be on your feet for a long time, so make sure you’re comfortable. But also dress professionally as you want to project a respectful image to both the doctor and the patients.
Write about your experiences in your career journal.
Send the doctor you shadowed, and anyone else who helped make it happen, a thank you card afterwards. Maybe throw in a coffee gift card too - no doubt every doctor would appreciate coffee!
Be very respectful of the patients. Information you learn that is of a personal nature will be confidential and you should not talk about it with anyone other than the doctor your shadowing. Do not assume every patient is going to want you around, allow the doctor to introduce you and if the patient is uncomfortable, wait outside the room.

, A mentor is someone who is an experienced oncologist who has agreed to advise and counsel you about oncology and an oncology career.You may not be able to obtain a mentor such as this until your internship or residency as a mentee really should be pursuing the career already.


Formal mentoring programs do exist. If your medical school or hospital has one, definitely take advantage of it. If they don’t, actively seek out a mentor informally by becoming involved with the work of an oncologist you admire.Use your career journal to make notes of your observations, ideas and questions.

, Remember to look at your career journal on a regular basis. Determine if you have any outstanding questions you'd like answered - and get them answered. Write down any new thoughts and ideas that have come to mind since the last time you wrote in your journal. Keep track of any experiences you've had that are career-related, even if they aren't specifically related to medicine. Reevaluate your career goals and/or plans if you feel they've changed., Most universities do not have formal pre-med programs. And in fact, medical schools, in general, do not require a specific undergraduate degree in order to apply. As harsh as it sounds, medical schools are more interested in your overall GPA and your MCAT score. Therefore, your goal in choosing an undergraduate program should be that it helps you achieve the highest GPA and MCAT scores possible.Review pre-med program rankings. There are many organizations that rank colleges and universities in different ways, including what schools have the best pre-med program. While you certainly don’t need to apply to the best, if you can, you should.When selecting a program consider the following: Does the program prepare me properly for the MCAT? Does the program maximize my chances of getting the best GPA possible? Does the program help me obtain another career if I don’t end up in medical school? Does the program help me in medical school?Your undergraduate program doesn’t have to be in biology, or even science. If you can get better grades by completing an undergraduate humanities degree, go for it.
Use the Association of American Medical College’s (AAMC) Pre-Med Coursework Worksheet to select a program that will allow you to complete all the course requirements.

, If you’ve selected your program based on school rankings, skip this step. Once you’ve figured out what type of degree program you want to pursue, you now have to find a place to pursue it. Determine if you have any specific restrictions that limit your choices - i.e. financial, geographical, etc. Eliminate any schools do not offer the program you want, or include the restrictions you’ve identified.Make a list of all the possible undergraduate schools that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for an undergraduate school are - for example, low cost, far away from home, also has a medical school, great pubs, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools. Select your top 20 or so schools to investigate further.
Obtain undergraduate admissions packages from each of your selected schools and review them.
Sign-up and attend local school information sessions, if they’re offered.
Sign-up and attend on-campus school tours and discipline-specific information sessions.If possible, speak to a current or former student and ask their opinion about the school.
If possible, speak to a couple of current professors in your programs of interest and ask why you should attend that particular school.
Speak to your high school guidance or university counsellor for advice.
Review university/college rankings.
Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.
Select how many schools you’re going to submit an application for. There is no real limit to how many applications you submit, except money and time. Each application comes with a fee, which is anywhere between $40 and $100. While there is no general consensus on the ideal number, the most common number is between 6 and 14.If in doubt, go with your gut!

, Over 500 colleges accept something called The Common Application, which, when used, can significantly reduce the amount of time required to apply to an undergraduate program. If you are applying to one or more of the Common Application member schools, you can complete the application process on their website and will only need to complete the standard portions of the application once. For any schools who are not Common Application members, you will need to go to their admissions website to complete the application. For the purpose of an example, we’ll use Rutgers University, which does not accept the Common Application.


Go to the university’s undergraduate admissions website and find the location of the online application portal. Go to the online portal and register for an account.
Check the admissions website for application deadlines for the term you’d like to start - most commonly it would be the fall term, starting in September. The timeline will also include the date by which a decision is made and communicated to you, and the date by which you have to tell the university if you’re going to attend.
Take note of the required application fee, and how it is to be paid. Most universities will require the fee to be paid before they’ll even look at your application.
Look for an application checklist which will list all the items you’ll need to submit or do for the application. The checklist will normally include additional items like your self-reported academic record or high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores. Make sure you have these items ready, or have already electronically submitted them to the university.
Review the requirements for an admissions essay, including how it needs to be submitted. Write a first draft of your essay and then have someone (like a parent or guidance counsellor) review it. Revise, edit and complete your essay.
Review whether your application will require a list of extracurricular activities, which would include employment, community service/volunteering, athletics, etc.
Review whether your application will require letters of recommendation. If required, determine how many you need, and who they have to be from (i.e. teachers, parents, employers, etc.). Select whom you’d like to have write you a letter and ask them. Remember to send them a thank you once they’ve submitted the letter! Note that in some cases letters of references must be submitted directly to the university from the referee.
Log into the admissions application portal and complete the application, then submit it.

, Keep track of the decision dates that were outlined on the university’s admissions website. There may be multiple dates if the university allows for early admissions application. Most universities will provide a decision in the online admissions portal where you submitted your application, or via a specific email address that you registered for. Check the online portal (at least) after the decision deadlines to determine which schools you’ve been accepted to.


In general you’ll get one of three types of responses - accepted, rejected or waitlisted.
You are not required to confirm your acceptance before May 1st (for fall admission), so don’t make any final decisions until you’ve received responses from all your applications.Once you’ve received all responses, accept the offer from the highest ranked school you determined in previous steps - unless you’ve changed your mind.
Acceptances are usually followed by an enrolment or registration deposit to hold your spot at the school. You should only submit an acceptance and enrolment deposit to one school.After you’ve been accepted you’ll normally receive invitations to come (back) to the school for tours and events. Attending them isn’t required, but you’ll certainly view the school differently now that you know you’ll be attending!

, The most important part to remember throughout school is to ensure you’ve completed all the required prerequisite courses for your medical school application.Keep track of your GPA. Consider dropping a course before the appropriate deadline (the deadline by which you can drop a course and it will not appear on your transcript) if you think you’ll end up with a bad grade.

, All medical school applications will want to know about your non-academic activities, including awards, employment, volunteer work, sports, school groups, etc.Follow the AAMC’s Timeline for Application/Admission to Medical School PDF to make sure you complete as many extracurricular activities as you can that will be helpful for medical school admission.


Apply for medical or science-related internships during the summer months.
Apply for research assistantship positions (paid or unpaid) during the summer and school terms.

, All medical schools will require at least 2-3 letters of recommendation from someone who knows your abilities and skills. Letters from university professors, doctors, deans and associate deans, etc., are normally required.Volunteering in a professor’s lab, or working in a medical research centre, will make sure the professor knows you well enough to write a letter.

, The MCAT, or Medical College Admissions Test, is a standard test required by all medical schools. It is administered via the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The AAMC recommends taking the MCAT once you have completed any coursework that is relevant to the subjects on the test.However, each medical school will have its own requirements as to how old the score can be when you apply - the norm is 2-3 years old maximum.


The AAMC provides a timeline that can help you plan when to register for the MCAT, when to take it and when to apply to medical school.
The AAMC implemented a new MCAT in 2015, which replaces their previous version from 1991. If you took the MCAT before 2015, it is very important that you check the Medical school policies for accepting scores from the current and the new MCAT exams PDF. Some medical schools will only accept the 2015 version of the MCAT as of certain admissions cycles.
While not required, it is strongly recommended that you take some sort of prep course for writing the MCAT. The way the test is laid out, and the way in which it is timed, are very important and knowing this in advance is extremely helpful. Most prep courses also hold one or more fake exams to give you an idea of what it’ll be like in the real thing.
You can take the MCAT more than once, if you feel you didn’t do well the first time.However, be aware that some medical schools will actually combine the averages of the scores if the test was taken more than once (and you cannot prevent this)., There are over 170 accredited medical schools in the United States.Several medical school rankings exist that help determine which schools are better than others, based on a variety of factors.There are also a number of tools found online that can help you evaluate which medical school(s) are right for you.In the end, however, selecting a medical school will be similar to when you selected an undergraduate school. You may have restrictions, such as financial, geographical, etc., that may limit which schools you can apply to.


Make a list of all the possible medical schools - in your career journal - that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for a medical school are - for example, cost, reputation, class sizes, research programs, faculty, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools.
Read all the information about each medical school on their websites.
Attend any seminars, webinars or information sessions held by the medical school. Ask questions.
Book a campus tour at each medical school, if possible.
Seek the advice of your professors, school career advisors and alumni.
Review the medical school rankings.
Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.
Determine how many applications you’re going to submit. In 2014, over 170 medical schools in the U.S. received 731,595 applications, yet they only graduated 20,343 students in the same year.That’s less than a 3% admissions rate! As with undergraduate programs, there is no limit to the number of medical schools you can apply, but the fees associated with these applications are much higher ($160 for the first one plus $36 for each additional one).If you can afford it, you should try to apply to all the medical schools that interest you.
If in doubt, go with your gut!

, Contact the people who you’d like to write your letters of recommendation and request the letters. Since you might ask one referee to send a letter to more than one school, it will probably be helpful to create a list of the medical schools and the mailing addresses for the letters and send this list to each referee. They’ll probably use the same basic letter for each school, but preparing them will take time.Letters of recommendation have to mailed directly from the referee to the medical school, so don’t have your referees send the letters back to you.

, All medical school applications can be submitted via the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). These services allow you to submit one full application and send it to as many medical schools as you want.The first application will cost $160 and each additional medical school will cost $36.,,
Log into the website, when ready, and enter all the information requested while following the instruction manual.Submit the application online, when completed, and pay all the associated application fees.Check your AMCAS and/or AACOMAS account(s) regularly to check the status of each application and submit any additional information that is requested., Some, but not all, medical schools will require an interview as part of the admissions process. Some interviews may be conducted on the phone or via the internet, but many are done in person.Book your travel to/from each medical school.
For each medical school for which an interview is requested, print out and complete the Mission & Interview Question Worksheet from the AAMC website.
For each medical school for which an interview is requested, review their website and read any information they have posted regarding the interview.
Review your career journal and determine if you have any outstanding questions you wanted to ask during the interview.

, Review the admissions websites for each medical to which you have applied and check the timeline for when you can expect an admission offer and the deadline for when you have to accept the offer.If you’ve been accepted to more than one medical school, check how you ranked the schools and accept the school that you ranked highest - unless you’ve changed your mind.

, In general medical school will take 4 years to complete, and those 4 years are very structured.Your first year, and possibly some or all of your second year, will include mainly coursework. Your second and/or third years will include actual clinical experience where you’ll rotate among most of the major medical disciplines. Your third and/or your last year will be spent on a project that will include additional clinical experience, but this time in a specific discipline of your interest.


Your scholarly project is where you can focus on oncology as a specialty, and be assigned to one or more oncologists as an advisor or mentor., There are three main types of oncologists - medical, radiation and surgical. In addition, there are also oncologists who specialize in gynecology, pediatrics and hematology.Based on your experiences in medical school, select which type of oncology you’d like to focus on - this will help narrow down residency options.

, By this point in your medical education, you’ll have met a lot of medical doctors, specialists, and professors, not to mention fellow students. All of these are sources for ideas on where to do a residency. Do some additional research online and determine what your priorities are for a residency - then compare those priorities to the programs offered. Select more than one program to which to apply.


There are many things to consider regarding a residency, including: the stability of the program (does it have a future?), what type of support you get in the program, how flexible is the program schedule, what is the reputation of the institution, does it provide you with the possibility of advancement after it done, location, and more., Review all the prerequisites and requirements of the application and ensure you have them all in order. Write a draft of your personal statement, walk away for at least 24 hours and come back and revise it. Ask someone (professor, doctor, fellow student) to review your statement for you and provide feedback. Update and finalize your CV. Submit your applications via the method indicated for each program.Many residency programs use the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) which helps potential residents and residency programs find each other.Many residency programs also use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) as a centralized method to receive applications and documentation from applicants., Just like medical school, every residency program will want to interview you before offering your admission to their program. At this level it is likely you’ll need to attend the interview in person, but some programs may help pay the cost of travel., Your residency offers (or matches in this case) will come through the ERAS system where you submitted your application. All residency matches are released on Match Day which is the third Friday of March each year.Due to how the system works, you should receive only one offer - based on how your ranked each programs, and how each program ranked you. You are required to accept that offer, which means you have to be very care how many programs you select, and how you rank them., The experiences you gain in your residency program are vital to your career as an oncologist. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. Use your residency to enlarge your professional network and learn about potential fellowships and full-time jobs.

, The USMLE is a three-step examination that tests potential doctor’s on their skills in medicine and patient care. Medical licenses are granted by each state, not nationally, but each state requires the USMLE as a requirement to licensing.Use the Licensing Examination Services portal of the National Board of Medical Examiners to register for Steps 1 or 2 of the examination.
Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams cost $590 each, Step 2 CK costs $1250, Step 3 costs $815..Step 1 is normally taken after your second year of medical school, while Step 2 is normally taken after your fourth year of medical school. Step 3 is taken while you’re completing your residency.The process to apply for Step 3 of the examination differs between states, but you can use the Federation of State Medical Boards online portal to register and pay for the Step 3 exam.

, Each state has its own medical board which controls licensing of doctors, therefore each state has slightly different requirements for obtaining a license. Find the medical board’s website for the state where you will be practicing and review the licensing procedure.We will use the state of Colorado as our example for obtaining your medical license.
The state of Colorado requires that you have malpractice insurance in the state ‘’’before’’’ you apply for your license.Obtain malpractice insurance if you do not already have it, or determine if you meet one of the exception requirements.
The state of Colorado requires that each applicant meet the following qualifications: proof of graduation from medical school, passage of USMLE or other national exam, completion of postgraduate education (i.e. residency) and reference letters from places where you have previously practiced.Twenty-three states use the Federation of State Medical Boards’ Uniform Application for potential licensees.The Uniform Application is essentially a centralized, online application portal for submitting license requirements. The nice thing about the Uniform Application is that once you’ve completed one application it can be sent to any of the states that participate in the program., Medical oncologists must complete a three-year residency in internal medicine and then complete a two-year fellowship in medical oncology. Surgical oncologists must complete a five-year residency in general surgery and then complete a two-year fellowship in surgical oncology. Radiation oncologists complete a five-year radiation oncology program (residency) but do not need to complete a fellowship., Board certification is not a requirement to practice medicine or oncology. However, board certification will most likely increase your reputation and job potential.


Medical oncology is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).
Radiation oncology is certified by either the The American Board of Radiology or The American Board of Physician Specialties.
Surgical oncology is certified by the The American Board of Medical Specialties.

, During your residency and/or fellowship you would have developed an extensive professional network. Use your network to determine if there are any oncologist positions available in your favoured locations. Search for oncology positions on your own using any and all resources available to you.


The Journal of Clinical Oncology, as an example, has an online Oncology Career Centre with oncology-related positions available in the United States, and around the world. Each posting will provide you with instructions on how to apply to that specific position.
The Society of Surgical Oncology, as another example, has a career website that specialized in surgical oncologist positions available in the United States. Each posting will provide instructions on how to apply to that specific position.
Remember that if you apply to and accept a position in a state other than where you're licensed, you will need to obtain a license to practice medicine in that state before you can begin practicing.
Take advantage of the career centers and advisors available at your medical school to help you find oncology positions. Use their help to update your CV, craft cover letters and personal statements, and practice for interviews."

Take your child to the dental office before their visit.,
Look at the office.,
Ensure the dentist takes a complete medical and dental history.",How to Choose a Pediatric Dentist2," Give your child time to meet the dentist you’re thinking about briefly and familiarize themselves with the pediatric dentist’s office. Allow them to play with some of the toys or games strewn about the office. If your child has a positive first impression of the dentist’s office, you should use that feedback to rank that dentist’s office in a positive way against other dentists.When a dentist’s office makes a good first impression on your child, the child will experience less anxiety than they otherwise might when it’s finally time to receive a checkup or other appointment.

, When you bring your child to the pediatric dentist or dentists you’re most interested in, check out their waiting room. One sign of a dentist who is committed to looking after children’s needs is the presence of child-sized furniture, books, games, and other paraphernalia of childhood. The pediatric dentist’s office should also feature kid-friendly décor – bright colors, cartoon characters, and so on., If your child is going to a pediatric dentist for the first time, they should ask about your child’s medical history and receive a copy of all relevant medical records before their first appointment. If your child is switching from one dentist to another, the new dentist should receive not only a copy of your child’s medical records, but also a copy of the dental records from their previous pediatric dentist.With these records in hand, the pediatric dentist will be able to make the best decisions about your child’s dental health.
