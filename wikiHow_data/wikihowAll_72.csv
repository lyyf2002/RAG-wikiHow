Look for punctuality.,
Ensure your child was cared for.,
Chose a dentist that informs you of your child’s dental health.,
Select a dentist that engages your child in their own dental health.",How to Choose a Pediatric Dentist3," When evaluating your pediatric dental visit, think about how quickly you were seen. If you were scheduled for 10:00, for instance, but you weren’t seen for twenty minutes or more, that pediatric dental clinic may not operate in a punctual and efficient manner. If you are often made to wait, look elsewhere to ensure your time is not wasted and to receive the prompt service you should expect from a quality pediatric dentist.Sometimes emergencies occur that can push back appointments. If a late appointment happens just once or twice and they explain the reasons why, give them another chance.

, While watching the pediatric dentist and their staff, ensure they are thorough but gentle during your child’s examination. After the appointment, debrief your child about their experience even if you were in the exam room with them the whole time. Most kids won’t leave the dentist’s office with a glowing review of the dentist. But they should be free of complaints regarding serious pain and come away feeling that the dentist was considerate of them.You can determine if the dentist and their staff are gentle and thorough by observing the proceedings, listening for cries of pain from your child, and then looking for a sympathetic response from the dentist or the staff member.

, After your dentist sees your child’s teeth, they should promptly let you know the state of your child’s dental health, including any problems that may have developed. They should patiently and clearly listen to and answer questions you might have, and advise you about what steps you can take to improve your child’s dental health, if necessary., A good pediatric dentist will not only apprise you of your child’s dental health, they will also encourage the child to acknowledge their own role in staying healthy. For instance, your dentist and/or their staff might encourage your child to brush and floss daily, showing them the right way to do it. They should also encourage your child to stay away from sweet juices and sugary snacks."

Follow your appointment schedule.",How to Eat Food With New or Tightened Braces," Soft, non-chewy foods are the best food for braces. Not only are they less likely to damage your braces, they are also less likely to cause pain on sensitive teeth. Some foods like hard vegetables can still be eaten, but they should be steamed until they are soft and easy to bite. Some braces-friendly foods that won't upset sensitive teeth include:


soft cheeses
yogurt
soup
non-tough, soft-cooked meats without any bones (chicken, turkey, meatballs, deli slices, etc.)
soft seafood dishes without any bones (fish, crab cakes)
pasta/noodles
boiled or mashed potatoes
soft, cooked rice
eggs
soft-cooked beans
soft breads without a hard crust
soft-shell tortillas
pancakes
soft baked goods, such as biscuits and muffins
pudding
applesauce
bananas
smoothies, ice cream, or milkshakes
jello;
, Hard foods can crack your braces, and may cause mild to severe pain in the days following an installation or adjustment of your braces.Avoid anything that is hard or crunchy, especially following an orthodontic appointment. Common hard foods to avoid include, but are not limited to:


nuts of any kindgranolapopcornicehard bread crustsbagelspizza crustchips (potato and tortilla)hard shell tacosraw carrots (unless cut into very small pieces)apples (unless cut into small slices)corn (unless it's just kernels - avoid eating corn on the cob), Sticky foods are bad for your braces, and may cause pain if you try to chew them with new braces. Candy and gum are the worst sticky foods, and should be avoided with braces.Some sticky foods to avoid include:


gum of any kindlicoricetoffeecaramelStarburstSugar Daddieschocolate
cheese

, One of the biggest risks that could damage the brackets on your braces comes from how you eat food. Biting into foods the way you're used to from a lifetime of eating could cause brackets to come off your teeth or break apart. One way to avoid this is by cutting your food into smaller pieces. This can help you manage how much work your teeth are doing at any given time.


Use a knife to cut corn kernels off the cob. Corn is soft enough that it should be safe to eat, but biting into the cob could hurt your teeth or damage your braces or induce pain in your jaw.Cut apples into slices before eating. Much like corn, biting into the core could cause pain or damage your braces.Even if you're eating braces-friendly foods, you may still want to cut your food into smaller pieces. This can help manage pain and protect your teeth from damage.

, Most people don't think too much about which teeth they use to bite and chew their food. But when you've recently had braces put on or adjusted, your teeth may be extra sensitive. Chewing with your back teeth, which tend to be thicker and better built for grinding food, can help alleviate the pain your front teeth might be feeling.


As you chew, try to avoid tearing or pulling apart food with your front teeth. This is another reason smaller bites may be helpful.It may be helpful to physically put the food in the back of your mouth (but away from your throat, so you don't choke).If you're not used to using a fork in the back of your mouth and worry about biting the fork, try picking up the food pieces with your fingers and gently placing them in place to chew with your back teeth., Though you may be very hungry, especially if your teeth were too sore to eat on the first day of having braces, it's important to eat slowly. Eating too quickly could cause you to forget how to eat (small bites, chewed with your back teeth); you may also risk biting into seeds, pits, or bones.If you chew too quickly, pain and inflammation also might occur in your teeth. This is because the bones and ligaments that support the teeth in your mouth are already weakened from working with the forces that straighten your teeth.


Drink plenty of water while you eat. This can help make swallowing easier if you're having a hard time chewing. Drinking water will also help rinse away any food residue that may get caught in your braces., Your teeth, gums, lips, tongue, and cheeks may be sore for several days after having braces installed or adjusted. This is normal, and can be managed in a number of ways. The easiest way to reduce inflammation in your mouth is by rinsing with a saline mouth rinse.Mix one teaspoon of salt into an eight ounce glass of clean, warm water. Don't make it too hot, as you do not want to risk burning your mouth.Stir until the salt is completely dissolved.Rinse and swish with the saline mix as often as necessary throughout the day, especially during the first week after an installation or adjustment. Spit out the rinse when you're finished., Many people with braces experience pain as the lips, cheeks, and tongue become used to brushing against the metal braces. Other braces wearers may experience a stray poking wire from time to time. Both of these are fairly normal experiences, and the best way to deal with the pain is by applying orthodontic wax to the brackets or wires that are causing pain and discomfort. Wax can be useful as your mouth adjusts to having the new appliances on your teeth, or as a temporary solution until you can get to your orthodontist for repairs. However, if you have a broken bracket or a poking wire, it's best to see your orthodontist as soon as possible to remedy the problem.Only use orthodontic wax on your braces. Ask your orthodontist for a supply of wax to take home with you, or check your local pharmacy for orthodontic wax.If you keep applying wax and it keeps falling off, ask your orthodontist to heat up a small amount of gutta-percha and apply it to your wire. It will cool down after about 40 seconds and will stay on for a longer period of time than normal wax will.

, If you are experiencing significant pain after having your braces installed or adjusted, you may want to consider taking medication to help manage the pain. Common over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) are helpful when it comes to relieving pain.If you are administering medication to a child or teenager, you should avoid administering aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome in children and adolescents. Reye's syndrome is a potentially-fatal condition associated with aspirin in young people., It may be difficult to floss with braces, but it's more important than ever when you're wearing braces. Food can get caught between your teeth or around your brackets, causing discomfort and potentially increasing the risk of infection. Certain dental products, like Floss Threaders or Superfloss, make it easy to thread floss between teeth and around the bars of your braces.Floss under the wire, then feed the floss through above the wire between each set of teeth.Form a C-shape against each tooth as you floss to ensure you remove all debris., Brushing is important when you have braces, and may be particularly useful when your braces are new or recently-tightened. Food debris can be painful on tender teeth and gums, and brushing after each meal and before bed can help remove that debris.Use a soft-bristle toothbrush to reduce the pain of brushing while your teeth and gums are sore.Consider using an interdental toothbrush to clean between your brackets and wires.Brush towards your tongue to ensure that food debris is properly removed. That means using downward strokes on your upper teeth and upward strokes on your lower teeth.Don't rush. Plan to spend about two to three minutes each time you brush to ensure that you cover every surface of each individual tooth.You might even need to repeat the brushing process and rinse more often than you used to. Now, your plaque is now spread onto a wider surface (your teeth and your braces).

, Rubber bands are often recommended to help correct a misalignment between teeth. The braces themselves will help straighten teeth, but if you have a misalignment (such as an overbite or underbite), your orthodontist may recommend that you wear special orthodontic rubber bands. The bands are worn by looping each end around a special hook on two matching brackets (usually one toward the front and one toward the back, top to bottom on each side).Rubber bands should be worn 24 hours a day, seven days a week until your orthodontist tells you otherwise.You should only take out your rubber bands to eat or brush your teeth. Otherwise they should be worn at all times, including while you sleep.Though you may be tempted to skip wearing rubber bands for a few days after each adjustment, it is best for your teeth if you adhere to your orthodontist's specific recommendations., Your orthodontist will most likely schedule monthly checkups and tightenings. It's important to follow the schedule your orthodontist recommends to ensure that your braces are working and that your teeth are in good shape. Avoiding tightenings will only prolong the length of time you have to wear braces. You should also see your regular dentist at least once every six months to ensure that your teeth are healthy and strong, as well as that you are keeping up well with your oral hygiene."

An MRI technician is responsible for operating an MRI machine to conduct tests on patients.First off, you will need a great deal of technical knowledge to operate an MRI machine. You need a thorough understanding of how the technology works as you'll be operating the machine and may be responsible for detecting any problems a hospital's MRI machine might display.In addition to technical knowledge, a good MRI technician will also have good people skills. You will have to instruct patients how to position themselves to use the machine and keep patients engaged throughout a scan. Scans can take up to 90 minutes to complete and patients getting MRIs are often nervous or distressed, so good bedside manner is a necessary component to a good MRI technician.The job is physically demanding. You will be on your feet and operating machinery for long hours and also may need to lift and fit patients on the machine if they're mobility impaired. To be an MRI technician, you must be physically fit and be in good health.;
, If you decide MRI technician is the career for you, you need to start preparing early on. In high school, you should focus on math and science and look into programs you might want to apply for after graduation.


In high school, you should take courses in anatomy, biology, physics, mathematics, and chemistry. Try to enroll in AP programs if possible. Taking electives in courses like health and computer science will also look good on a college application.Certifications look great on an application to a college or technical program. Getting certified in CPR is easy to do at the high school level. Classes are usually offered through local colleges and hospitals. See what is available in your area.You can also volunteer, intern, or get a job at a hospital over summers. Any experience in a medical related field looks good on a college application if your ultimate goal is to become an MRI technician., As you reach your last years of high school, you should be looking into the kinds of schools you want to attend.


An MRI technician needs an associate's degree in radiologic technology or a related field in addition to 1 to 2 years studying in an MRI technology certification program. Your school should be accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiological Technology or the Commission on Accreditation of the American Registry of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists.There are a variety of ways to find programs. The websites of the above listed institutions allow you to browse credited schools by state. You can also ask any MRI technicians you may have met while volunteering or interning at a hospital where they got their training.It's a good idea to apply to a variety of schools and see where you are admitted and what kinds of funding and financial aid you're offered at various institutions. You want to keep your options open so you have a lot of schools to choose from once you've graduated.

, Once you've selected and enrolled in a school, you'll begin the first part of your training to become to become an MRI technician.


Courses in your associate's degree will generally consist of science classes, like biology, chemistry, and anatomy, alongside technical skills like medical terminology, patient care, and radiography.Most associate's programs allow time for hands-on skills to be developed. You'll spend some time working in an actual lab getting acquainted with the MRI equipment you'll be using for your career., Make the most of your time in school. You want to make sure you get into a good training program after college and can secure a job later on.


Volunteer at hospitals. Volunteering is a good start as the work can be as consistent as you want depending on your schedule. Volunteering regularly or semi-regularly at a hospital throughout your time in school will help you foster connections with doctors, nurses, technicians, and other hospital staff members you can use later on in the professional world.
Look for internships related to your field. Ask your professors, classmates, and college advisers about where to apply for internships. An internship looks great on a resume and can bolster your chances of securing a job later on. If you make a good impression, the hospital you work for may eventually want to hire you longterm.
Get a job in a hospital. Even an office job, which may seem unrelated, can look good on a resume as it allows you to interact with patients. As bedside manner and social skills are important to becoming an MRI technician, such experience could prove important down the road.

, The American Registry of Radiological Technologists (ARRT) will only certify you as an MRI technician if you complete a 1 to 2 year training program by an accredited institution. The ARRT also requires the program you attend includes classroom training and training in a hospital setting.


You can browse the ARRT's website to find a list of school and you can search by your state and area. You will have to have completed at least your associate's degree before enrolling in an educational program.Training programs are generally run through colleges, community colleges, and hospitals. Prices vary from program to program, but some form of financial aid may be offered. Programs usually last from 1 to 2 years.During your training, you will work in a classroom setting learning about how to operate MRI technology. You will also work in a hospital setting getting hands on experience in your field., Once you have completed your associate's degree and your training program, you are eligible to take the certification exam. If you pass, you will be a registered MRI technician and can begin applying for jobs.


You can schedule your exam date using the AARP's website. You can find a testing center near you and schedule an exam time that works best with your schedule. Depending on your state, there may be a small application fee. If you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, you may do so 24 hours ahead of time.
You will take the exam on a computer. Children, friends, and family members are not permitted in testing centers. You should arrive 30 minutes early and bring 2 forms of identification, one of which must be a government issued photo ID. Calculators and personal notes are not permitted in the testing room.
Questions are usually multiple choice and scores are based on the total number of correct answers. If you do not know an answer, it's best to guess or pick an answer you're uncertain of rather than leaving a question blank. You will have 4 hours to complete the exam.
While you will see an initial score on screen, this is not a confirmation that you've passed the exam. The AARP will further review your exam and mail you an official report 2 to 3 weeks after you've completed the exam.

, If you fail, a re-application form will be sent with your score. There is a $175 re-application fee. You are allowed to take the exam 3 times within a 3 year period. If you do not pass the exam within this timeframe, you have to undergo training again.

, Once you successfully pass the certification exam, you can begin looking for jobs as an MRI technician.


Create an account on the American Registry of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists website. Login and submit your resume and CV information to their registry. The registry is open to candidates who have passed the certification exam. Work and education information must be entered and updated by individual members.
You can also browse online databases, like monster and indeed.com, to look for jobs in your field.
If you previously interned, worked, or volunteered at a hospital call up old connections and see if anyone is hiring.
Work on your resume. Have a college professor, friend, or co-worker look over your resume for you and offer you pointers on how to improve it.

, Great interview skills are vital to any field. Prepare for interviewing as you begin your job search.


Dress up when you go into an interview in professional attire. Do not wear anything that exposes tattoos or piercings. Go for formal attire. It might be a good idea to invest in some good interview outfits while you're on the job hunt.Always listen during an interview. Nod at what the interviewer says and reiterate some of it when you answer questions.Ask questions at the end of the interview. When someone asks you if you have any questions, never ask something about logistics. Questions like, ""When can I expect to hear back?"" should be avoided. Instead, ask open ended questions like, ""What do you like about working here?"" and ""What is the company culture like?"", ARRT certification requires 24 hours of continuing education every 2 years. Additional training can also lead to more complex and higher paying jobs, like specialists, supervisors and department heads., MRI technicians have the opportunity to specialize in certain areas, like pediatrics, cardiac, or neurological imaging. Advancement means greater job opportunities and higher pay.You may need to further your education if you want to advance your career. Going back to school for a Bachelor of Science degree in the field you're interested in can help. You might also need further training and certification if you want to progress in your field."

Try a fugu drink.",How to Eat Fugu Sashimi," The fugu fish produces a deadly toxin called tetrodotoxin, which causes the body's central nervous system to gradually shut down. People who are poisoned by tetrododoxin are fully conscious as they experience symptoms like dizziness, muscle paralysis, incoherent speech, asphyxia, and cardiac arrest.Fugu is safe to eat when it is prepared correctly by an experienced chef, but if it is prepared incorrectly, a single bite can kill a person.There is no antidote for tetrododoxin, so many people who are exposed to it die.;
, If you are in Japan, you should have a relatively easy time finding a restaurant that serves fugu sashimi. It is very important, however, to ensure that the establishment has a good reputation and is licensed to serve the fish. Most incidents of fugu poisoning occur at unlicensed establishments where inexperienced chefs prepare the fugu.There are a handful of restaurants in the United States that are licensed to serve fugu sashimi, although it must be imported from Japan pre-sliced.Fugu is illegal in the European Union., In order to be legally permitted to prepare fugu, a chef must be licensed. This is meant to ensure that only the most skilled and well-trained chefs are allowed prepare this potentially deadly fish. If you plan on trying it, make sure to ask for evidence that the chef is properly licensed.To get licensed, a chef must undergo a three-year apprenticeship program and take a rigorous exam, which the majority of applicants fail.
Chefs in the United States may not have this license, as they do not slice the sashimi themselves. (This is still done by a licensed individual in Japan.), The liver, ovaries, and intestines contain the highest concentrations of toxins, so these should be avoided by all except the biggest risk-takers. The meat of the fish contains very little poison, unless of course it is contaminated by the organs during preparation.Organs are sometimes served with the sashimi, but they must be specially treated to remove the toxins and are more risky to eat than the meat.The testicles are also very poisonous, but these are considered a delicacy in some areas., There are many different species of fugu, all of which are poisonous. While they are all potentially dangerous, the torafugu or tiger puffer has the least poisonous blood, which makes it the safest to eat., Some companies are raising fugu in captivity and restricting their diets to prevent them from producing their deadly poison. If you want to limit your risks when trying fugu sashimi, consider eating a farm-raised fish.Research is still being done on the safety of farm-raised fugu, so it's best to still stick with a licensed chef, even if the fish is farm-raised., While there is no antidote for tetrodotoxin, immediate medical intervention may be able to save your life if you are exposed. Doctors can use activated charcoal to absorb the poison and can also help you breathe so you don't asphyxiate from the toxin's effects.If your tongue feels numb, you need medical attention right away, as this is usually the first symptom. A slight tingling in the lips is usually okay. Other symptoms include dizziness, vomiting, and muscle paralysis.

, Fugu is an expensive dish, so expect to spend a lot on your meal. Depending on the type of dish you order, you could pay up to $200.The steep price has a lot to do with the complexity of the preparation. It's best to avoid cheap fugu from establishments that are not reputable, as it may not be safe.
Some restaurants offer à la carte options if you don't want to spend too much and you only want to taste a small piece of fugu sashimi., Fugu is a mild, chewy fish. Some people find fugu sashimi bland. If you typically enjoy more flavorful fish, you may be disappointed with fugu, so consider ordering only a small amount when you first try it., Because fugu is very mild, you may want to add a little flavor. Fugu sashimi is often served with garnishes and sauce, so try eating these with the fugu for a more flavorful bite.


Your fugu may be served with radishes and scallions, which will add some wonderful flavor to the fish.Ponzu sauce is often provided with fugu sashimi dish, so try dipping the fish in this to enhance the flavor.This is a vinegar-based sauce that has a slight citrus flavor.

, The wintertime is considered the best time of year for eating fugu because the fish's bodies fatten up during this time of year. If you want to get the most out of your fugu experience, eat it during the prime season.Be aware that because it is at its best, fugu is typically more expensive during the winter., Some expert chefs purposely leave a trace amount of poison in the fugu when they prepare it. This causes a mild tingling effect in the lips, which many diners enjoy. It may also cause a sense of euphoria., If you want to have an entire fugu meal, you may want to start with a salad. Some restaurants offer options that contain fugu skin.In order for the skin to be safe to eat, the chef must remove the fish's spikes., Another popular option for consuming fugu is techiri, which is a hot broth that contains vegetables and fugu.In this dish, the taste of the fugu is hard to detect, as the broth and vegetables have stronger flavors., In addition to serving fugu raw, the Japanese also eat it cooked in a variety of dishes. Popular options include hot pots and fried dishes. Fried fugu is likely to appeal to a Western palate, as it tastes something like chicken.If you're very daring, you may want to try eating some of the more poisonous parts of the fish. For example, in some places you can find cooked fugu testicles., At some high-end restaurants, you may be able to find hot sake mixed with a spoonful of the fugu fish's testes, which are highly poisonous. More commonly, you can find hot sake that has had fugu fins steeped in it.The fugu gives the sake a savory flavor. You should let it steep for a few minutes at your table before you drink it for the best flavor."

Leave the flax seed whole.,
Grind the flax seed.,
Take a flax seed oil supplement.,
Drink flax seed oil.,
Use two to three tablespoons of whole seed per serving.",How to Eat Flax Seed1," Small flax seeds are the perfect size for adding to your food when whole. Make sure you chew the seeds thoroughly to aid in their digestion and access the nutritional benefits flax seeds have to offer. Whole flax seed can be kept fresh for 6-12 months at room temperature, and one year in the refrigerator.;
, The Omega-3 fatty acids present in flax seed are located inside the seeds and therefore the seeds need to be opened to access the nutritional value. You can grind the flax seed using a coffee or spice grinder to ensure that you are reaping the benefits of flax seed. Ground flax can be kept for one week in a room temperature setting or for up to two months in the refrigerator., If you want to get the benefits of flax seed without the taste or hassle of adding it to your food, simply purchase flax seed supplements and take one pill daily.

, You can also buy flax seed in its liquid oil form and add it to your beverage of choice. Flax seed oil has the same nutty taste as the seeds themselves but without the seedy texture.

, If you are simply adding the flax seed to an individual meal, this ratio will give you a beneficial serving without affecting the flavor of your food.

100% organic foods are also not always preservative free. By legal definition, only 95% of the ingredients or additives of a 100% organic food need to be organic. In addition, there are 45 additives that are actually permitted in organic foods.These are there as they have been deemed as ""essential"" to the safety of the foods.There are some phrases like ""all natural"" or ""natural"" that do not really have a legal definition within the FDA.Many food companies use this terminology for marketing and advertising purposes. However, there are plenty of ""all natural"" foods that contain a variety of added sweeteners, natural flavors and preservatives.Don't get fooled by this type of labeling.
After reviewing any labeling claims on the front of the package, you will need to double check and verify with other labels on your food.;
, The ingredient list is required and all food manufacturers need to include an ingredient list on their products. This is where you will find out what types, if any, of preservatives are added.


The FDA requires all food manufacturers to list every single ingredient contained in a food product on the ingredient label.When reviewing the ingredient list, know that the first ingredient listed is the one found in the highest quantity. The last ingredient listed is found in the least or smallest quantities in the product.Preservatives will be listed with a statement about their intended purpose. For instance, the ingredient list may declare “ascorbic acid to improve color retention” or “sulfur dioxide to prevent rotting.” This can give you an idea of why the additive is a part of the food.

, Food manufacturers may add a whole variety of different compounds to foods for many reasons. Preservatives are only one type of additive that food companies use.


In addition to preservatives, you may also notice other types of additives. These can include: colorings, vitamins and minerals, added fiber, artificial sweeteners and additives to improve taste (when fat or sugar is removed from a product).Consider the variety of additives and what you really want to avoid and what you consider to be ""OK"" to include in your diet. For example, many cereals contain added fiber, vitamins and minerals which are beneficial to your health. However, ""low-sugar” or “diet"" cookies may have some added artificial sweeteners or texturants that you do want to avoid.
All additives that are currently in use are approved by the FDA (in the US) and have been deemed safe for human consumption., Although there are hundreds of food additives that function as preservatives, some of the most common appear in a wide variety of foods. Once you learn to identify common preservatives you can quickly avoid selecting foods with those preservatives in the future. You can also make a list or note certain additives, colorings or preservatives that you specifically want to avoid. You may also want to make a list of the foods or types of foods they are typically found in and avoid them as well. Some common preservatives and their uses are:Propionates, ascorbic acid, and nitrates are all used to preserve and maintain freshness in foods.
Glycerine is a humectant that keeps foods moist and prevents them from drying out.
Xantham gum is a popular thickener in foods.
Pectin and agar agar are used also used to thicken and stabilize different foods.
Modified corn or food starch helps increase the bulk of a food without disturbing its nutritional value.

, This is a common saying that refers to mainly shopping and purchasing foods from the sections the line a grocery store's walls. This may help you avoid some preservatives.Many health professionals recommend shopping the perimeter of the store as many of these foods are less processed and are typically considered ""whole foods.""
The main sections on the perimeter include: the produce section with fruits and vegetables, the meat/deli counter, the seafood counter, the dairy case and also eggs and the frozen sections.
Most foods in the aisles are much more processed and will also most likely having varying amounts of additives.

, The produce section will have the most whole foods that are minimally processed.


Typically fresh fruits and vegetables do not contain. Stock up on these foods to help decrease or avoid additives.
Note that not all items in the produce section will be preservative-free. Items like pre-washed, pre-cut fruits and vegetables may have some additives to maintain freshness or color.
Raw nuts and seeds are also good options for avoiding preservatives. These may be available in bulk bins near the produce or in a separate bulk section of your store.

, The meat, deli, and seafood counter will have a bigger range of processed items compared to the produce section.


Try to stick to meats that are uncooked and in their more natural state. For example: raw, whole chicken, raw beef or raw fish.
For example, instead of pre-cooked chicken breasts, purchase an entire chicken or chicken breasts raw and prepare them yourself. Or instead of buying turkey deli meat, purchase a turkey breast to roast and slice yourself.
Also, don't always forego frozen items. Many times frozen meats and seafood do not contain additives because the freezing keeps them fresh and prevents spoilage.

, The dairy and egg case is another area that has a wide range of processing and amounts of additives.


Eggs typically will be preservative and additive free as you cannot add anything to shelled eggs. They do range in what the chickens are fed and how they were raised. Also, liquid eggs and liquid egg whites may contain additives.
You may want to consider avoiding dairy foods with added sugars or flavorings and buy plain or unflavored items. For example, buy plain yogurt instead of fruited yogurts.
Cheeses like sliced or shredded cheese may have some additives to prevent the cheese from sticking to itself. Try buying blocks of cheese and slicing or grating cheese yourself. Also, watch out for highly processed cheeses, such as American cheese and Velveeta.

, The freezer aisles can contain very processed foods and minimally processed items. Be smart on what you choose.


Many frozen fruits and vegetables are minimally processed and contain little to no additives or preservatives. Make sure you read the label to double check.
Frozen fruits and vegetables that come with a sauce or gravy will have additives. Avoid these if you don't want to consume preservatives.
Most other frozen foods will be processed and contain additives. Minimize these in your diet or avoid them all together if desired.

, It will be difficult to purchase only foods from the perimeter to the store. When purchasing items from the inner aisles, be careful about what you choose.


Try to avoid the aisles that contain candy, chips, crackers, cereals or cookies. These foods are guaranteed to be processed and contain a significant amount of additives.
If you're going to buy canned vegetables or meats, choose those with no salt added. Canning does a great job at preserving foods and therefore many of these items contain minimal additives.
For items like salad dressing, condiments or sauces, read the labels for those that contain more natural ingredients and less additives. This is a popular request by consumers, so with a little extra time with the labels, you should be able to find appropriate substitutes.

, Many heavily processed foods will contain additives. Minimize or avoid these foods to help you reduce the amount of additives you consume throughout the day.


Top contenders for highly processed foods include: frozen meals, canned meals, deli meat, breakfast meats and processed meats, condiments, sauces and dressing, sweetened beverages, fast foods and chips/crackers.Many sliced breads contain lots of preservatives as well.
Foods that spoil quickly or that are minimally packaged are unlikely to contain preservatives. Buy fresh, unprocessed produce and natural whole foods to reduce the time you spend reading ingredient lists.If a food is processed and has preservatives, look for items that use more natural preservatives like salt, vinegar, sugar, citric acid or ascorbic acid.

, If you want to get rid of additives in your diet, you'll most likely have to start making some foods from scratch or homemade.


Making items yourself allows you to control what goes into your foods and meals. You can control the calories, sugar, fat, salt and the amount of additives your foods contain.
If you're coming from a diet that contains large quantities of processed foods or those that contain a lot of additives, slowly start switching over to more homemade foods. Making changes very quickly is generally not easy or sustainable long-term.Some examples of items you can make yourself include: salad dressings, sauces or marinades, bread, your own frozen vegetables or fruit, or your own ""freezer meals"" made with homemade items.

, After you have identified foods that are free of chemical preservatives, add them to a “cheat sheet” list to take shopping.


This will spare you the trouble of re-reading the ingredient list on future grocery trips.
In addition, you can provide this list to family, friends or co-workers who may also be purchasing foods for you. They'll know exactly what to get.

, If you choose to go out to eat, you may encounter some highly processed foods or those foods that contain a lot of preservatives. Be choosy about where you go out to eat to avoid this problem.


Many restaurant are now advertising they use foods free of preservatives, all organic ingredients or meats without added hormones. Review the restaurant's website to verify if they truly use these types of ingredients.
Call the restaurant in advance. Talk to a manager or a cook to find out what types of foods they are using to prepare their meals.
Also remember, that even if a restaurant claims to have hormone free meat, do their other products or foods contain preservatives? Check each ingredient used in their meal prep.

Plan on giving in.,
Go for a baked potato instead.,
Enjoy homemade baked french fries.,
Limit restaurant meals and fast food.,
Try other alternatives to fries.",How to Eat Fewer French Fries1," You want may to get rid of your french fry habit or try to only eat a small serving, but sometimes you're going to give into your cravings. Plan for minor slip-ups and times where you overindulge.


It's not realistic to aim to never eat french fries again or think you'll never overeat them either. Be honest and realistic with your goals and how they'll fit into your lifestyle.
Indulge in your favorite fried food in moderation. If you end up going overboard, that's OK. Forgive yourself, move on with your day and make healthy, nutritious choices for the remainder of the day.;
, There are a lot of qualities about french fries that make them crave-able comfort food. They're higher in fat, high in carbohydrates, salty and crunchy.These are the typical and familiar comfort food traits.


If you find yourself craving those golden fries, try having a baked potato instead. Make one at home for yourself or order one if you're out to dinner. Baked potatoes, like fries, contain a high amount of carbs which may help satisfy your craving.
Be aware that a ""loaded baked potato"" can end up having just as many calories or more than french fries. Skip the high fat toppings like sour cream, cheese or crumbled bacon. A little butter, salt and pepper is acceptable.

, Many health professionals also recommend trying to make your favorite comfort foods or favorite restaurant meals at home. You can better control how they're cooked and their overall nutrition content.


Try making homemade baked french fries at home. There are a variety of techniques that get potatoes super crispy and crunchy - similar to a restaurant style french fry.
Baking potatoes reduces the total amount of fat. In addition, you can skip the salt (or reduce the amount) and leave off high sodium seasoning blends.
When you're making homemade fries, leave the skin on the potato. The skin contains a lot of fiber and minerals that are essential to your diet.To make homemade fries crispy, try the following cooking techniques: cut your fries into a thin, smaller fry instead of a wedge shape and coat lightly in one tablespoon (about 15 ml) of olive oil. Bake at 425 °F (218 °C) for 30-40 minutes.Keep in mind that frozen, pre-cut fries are usually pre-fried before freezing, so they will still be higher in fat than home-made fries.

, If your main source of french fries is when you're eating out at restaurants or stopping by for fast food, limit these outings.


Limit yourself to a certain amount of meals away from home where you'll most likely order french fries. This may help cut down on the number of opportunities you have to order them.
Try packing your lunch, cooking more dinners at home and having healthy snacks on hand so that eating out is not as much of a temptation.

, Most restaurants will offer a variety of healthier alternatives, such as salads, steamed vegetables, or broth-based soup. You may be able to get a substitution for little or no charge.

If you’re dining at home, you can get even more creative with substitutions. Try nuts, whole grain crackers, fresh fruit, or sliced vegetables such as carrot or celery sticks.

Plan the size of your meal according to when you will workout.,
Eat breakfast one to two hours before you work out.Make sure the breakfast you choose is full of protein and carbohydrates.,
Eat lunch three to four hours before working out.As with breakfast, choose a lunch that has a good balance of protein and carbohydrates.,
Eat a small snack 30 minutes to an hour before you workout.Eating a snack 30 minutes before you workout is generally a good idea if you haven't eaten recently.,
Eat a protein- and carbohydrate-balanced dinner two to three hours before working out.If you plan to workout in the evening, choose foods with lots of protein and carbohydrates.,
Drink water before working out.,
Drink a cup of coffee before working out.,
Avoid sports drinks.,
Eat fewer calories than you burn to lose weight.,
Speak to a doctor or nutritionist.,
Be aware of your body's needs.",How to Eat Before a Workout," The less time you have until your workout, the less you should eat. Ideally, you want to have had fewer calories to eat than you intend to burn, thus burning excess fat during your workout.


This is a little tricky in the sense that burning fat during the workout has less to do with calories as it does with the type of calories consumed. For instance, if the body is given a large dose of carbohydrates pre-workout, it is less likely to tap into fat stores because the carbohydrates are so much easier to burn and use. It is better to have a combination of complex carbohydrates, proteins and fats.
If you intend to eat a large meal, make sure you eat three to four hours before the workout.
If you eat a small meal, you should eat two to three hours before working out.
If you are snacking, do so one to two hours in advance.;
, A morning meal is important whether you workout in the morning or later in the day, but timing your breakfast to come at least one to two hours before your workout can help ensure that your blood sugar will not be too low, which can make you lightheaded or tired.


Good food choices at breakfast time include: an egg on high-protein toast, a rice cake covered in peanut butter, or a mix of whole grain cereal, low-fat milk, and a banana.

, This is optimum for if you plan to workout in the afternoon. Do not forget sources of healthy fats such as avocado, nuts, seeds, and oil.


A good option for a pre-workout lunch is a turkey sandwich made with 2 pieces of high-protein bread, 2 to 3 oz. of low-sodium turkey, lettuce or sprouts, tomato, and mustard. The bread and turkey give you protein, while the garnishes and bread provide carbohydrates.
Another option is a salad made with spinach, a chicken breast, low-fat dressing, tomatoes, and almonds. The chicken and almonds provide protein, while a salad with spinach provides both carbohydrates and protein.

, For example, if you ate lunch at noon and you plan to workout at 5pm, you should eat a small snack 30 minutes beforehand.


Good snack options include pretzels, smoothies, granola bars, or fruit. Some good choices for fruit include pineapple, banana, or watermelon.

, Good choices include a chicken breast and baked potato, fish and wild rice, or a roast beef wrap.


Do not forget to incorporate healthy fats. These are essential as they actually sustain the individual the longest and provide the longest satiety.
If you workout after dinner, make sure you do not intend to workout too close after eating or too close to bedtime. Evening workouts can inhibit some people's sleep patterns.

, Drinking water before working out helps ensure you aren't dehydrated, which can inhibit your athletic performance. Dehydration can decrease athletic performance significantly—up to 25% just by losing two percent of your body weight in water.Drink 15 to 20 oz. (0.5 to 0.7 l) of water one to two hours before your workout.

, Studies have shown that caffeine can positively boost your workout performance. Some of the benefits include improved circulation, less pain, muscle preservation, and more muscle fuel.Drink coffee 30 minutes to an hour before your workout. Start with 8 oz. of coffee and increase later if you find it helps. This is a great substitute to pre-workout supplements that are typically laden with artificial sweeteners and dyes. In addition, pre-workout supplements usually pack a high dose of caffeine that some individuals cannot tolerate. Coffee is typically well-tolerated and manageable.

, While it is a good idea to drink water to ensure good hydration prior to exercise, it is not recommended that you replace water with sports drinks. This is because sports drinks have a lot of calories, which you are attempting to burn through exercise, so it is better not to add extra calories to your diet that counteract exercise unless you are working out for an extended period and need to replace electrolytes.One popular low calorie sports drink has 30 calories per 12 ounce serving, and the beverage comes in a 32oz. container, so you would be consuming close to 100 calories if you drank the whole bottle during your workout, thus canceling out, for instance, a one-mile run.

, If possible, try to burn 500 more calories than you eat each day. Do so and you should lose one to two pounds per week.One study showed that men and women burned close to 100 calories running one mile, so keep that in mind when you are totaling up the number of calories you'd need to burn to burn 500 per day beyond those you consume.
You do burn calories at rest, and if you figure out how many (what's called your ""basal metabolic rate""), you can compare this to the calories you have consumed to determine how much exercise you need to burn 500 more than you've consumed.
By way of example, if your basal metabolic rate is 2500 calories and you consume 3000 calories in one day, you have 1000 calories to burn via exercise that day.

, If you are unsure about how to adjust your diet as you begin to think about optimizing your diet for exercise, speak to a doctor or nutritionist. Your doctor can ensure you are in good enough physical condition to begin an exercise regimen, and he or she can make diet suggestions as well. A doctor should be able to recommend a nutritionist as well. A nutritionist can help you determine your basal metabolic rate and give you guidelines for diet optimized for exercise.

, Pay attention to your body as you change your meals to better accommodate your workout. If you have any negative side effects, see a doctor or nutritionist to make sure you are not depriving yourself of necessary vitamins or nutrients. Remember that depriving the body of necessary nutrients and/or calories will not result in healthy weight loss that is possible to maintain long term

Inform yourself.,
Stock up with healthy items.,
Don’t break the bank.,
Organize your kitchen the right way.,
Give up calories, not comfort.",How to Eat Better Food and Feel Healthier1," Nutritional information can be overwhelming. Find reliable sources of advice on your diet and stick with them. Be critical of health claims and wary of false or incomplete data.


Government health and food agencies can be a good source for general nutrition guidelines. The FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services, and a wide variety of state and local agencies offer dietary guidelines and nutrition advice. The 2016 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that a healthy eating pattern includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, a variety of protein foods, and oils.
The guidelines also strongly recommend limiting intake of saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, and added sugars. It specifically recommends getting fewer than 10% of your daily calories from added sugars and no more than 10% from saturated fats.
Alcohol consumption, if you choose to do so, should be moderate. The guidelines suggest that women should limit themselves to one drink per day, and men to two per day.
Be careful of sites trying to sell you a specific product, or that make claims that sound too good to be true. Healthy eating takes more than one miracle product.
Diet and health professionals are also a good source for nutrition information. Ask your doctor, or speak with a dietician about what foods are right for you specifically.;
, Organic foods and hormone- and antibiotic-free meats and eggs can have you feeling and eating healthier quickly. Likewise, making sure fresh fruits and vegetables are readily available is a great way to increase your intake of these items.


Emphasize fruits and vegetables in your diet. They are healthier and less calorie-dense than many other foods. Fresh is best, but canned foods can help stretch a thin budget.
Choose whole grains for your carbohydrates. Refined grains, in things like white bread or white rice, lack fiber and cause a response more like sugar in the body. Refined grains are quickly broken down by digestion and they raise blood sugar levels in the body.
Limit sugar. New guidelines suggest that added sugars should constitute fewer than 10% of your calorie intake. Check labels for added sugar in the products you buy. Avoid saturated fats. Not all fats are bad - in fact, some are crucial to good health. What you want to avoid are saturated and trans-fats. These are associated with health issues like heart disease., While it’s true that eating healthy can be more expensive these days, you can get the right foods at the right price with some planning.


Coupons: they’re not just for old ladies. Check grocery store fliers and other places for sales and specials, especially on meats and seafood.
Bulk up. It’s nearly always cheaper to buy food in bulk, and if you have the storage space and access to a warehouse store like Costco you can really save on things like frozen veggies and meats.
Pass on pre-made meals. You pay a premium for buying prepared foods like frozen meals and pre-cut fruits. Take the time to prepare your meal from scratch and you can save significantly.Organic food is nice, but not always necessary. With some foods like oranges or bananas, pesticides do not come into contact with the part you eat, so you can choose the cheaper, non-organic option. Choose organic for fruits and vegetables with edible skins, like grapes and apples. Be aware that tubers like potatoes, on the other hand, can contain pesticides even if you peel them., Having healthy food on hand isn’t enough. Make it as accessible as possible, so that it’s your first option.


Get fruits and veggies out of the fridge drawer. Have some cut up and ready to eat in a bowl, sitting right where you’ll see it.
Prepare healthy meals ahead of time. Make a large portion of a healthy meal on the weekend or your day off, and refrigerate or freeze individual portions for quick, healthy meals all week. Keep some front and center in your fridge so that you remember it’s there when hunger strikes.You may also want to organize your kitchen utensils and cookware. Keep utensils and pots and pans on hand that you use all the time.

, Eating to feel better doesn’t mean you have to give up comfort foods for a spartan diet of celery and water. Instead, seek out substitutions to fill that need in a healthier way.


For dessert there are many options. Rather than cake or a brownie, try some dark chocolate. It generally has less added sugar and even gives some health benefits.If your pleasure is soda, you could switch to diet soft drinks, but there’s some question as to the effects of artificial sweeteners. Instead, consider carbonated water, flavored with fruit slices or juice.Snacking can be the bane of healthy eating. If you’re a fan of potato chips, try substituting popcorn, especially the air-popped variety, which has little or no oil added. Brined foods like olives or pickles can be a lower-calorie option when you want a salty snack.
If you find yourself reaching for a candy bar, try a protein or granola bar instead. They offer better nutrition, while still helping out your sweet tooth."

Order the smallest size.,
Go 50/50 with meals.,
Eat the rest of your meal first.,
Trick yourself into eating fewer fries.,
Eat mindfully.,
Skip the fries altogether.",How to Eat Fewer French Fries2," If you're really in the mood for french fries, decrease the amount you order by ordering a smaller size. The fewer fries that are available, the fewer you can eat.


Try ordering a small with your meals. Many restaurants also offer a ""kid’s size"" which contains even fewer fries than the typical small size.
If you're at a fast food restaurant do not up-size your order. Increasing the size of your meal usually involves getting a larger portion of fries with your meal.
Skip the option to have bottomless fries or free refills. Many restaurants now offer bottomless fries or free refills with your meals. Skip these options and ask your waiter to not refill your fry basket.

, If you're going to order fries with your order, choose a healthier entree. This may help decrease the overall calorie level of your meal.


For example, if you normally get a fried chicken sandwich and fries, order a grilled chicken sandwich with fries instead.
This type of compensation may save you calories and fat by making a healthier sandwich choice, while allowing you to enjoy your true favorite, your french fries.

, If you received fries with your meal, eat them last. Go for your entree or fruit/vegetable side first.


If you're eating your main dish and low-calorie side dishes first, this may help fill your stomach so there will not be as much room for the fries.
You can also try ordering extra vegetables or a small side salad as an appetizer to help fill you up on lower calorie items.

, There are a variety of things you can do, especially when you're out to eat, that can help decrease how many fries you eat.


If you know your entree comes with fries, ask for half a portion or a kid’s portion. They may be able to serve you less.
You can also try having the waiter box up half of your meal, including the fries, before they bring it to your table. If they are out of sight, it'll be more likely they'll be out of mind.
Try asking the waiter to clear your plate the minute you think you've eaten enough fries. Even when you're satisfied, staring at your plate full of fries can be a difficult temptation to manage.
If you're at home, serve yourself a small portion of fries. Package the remaining fries and store them in the refrigerator for another time.

, If you're not paying attention to your meal, you may end up eating more than you planned or you may not feel satisfied with smaller amounts.


Take time to truly savor the french fries you order. If you rush through your meal and don't take the time to smell them or taste them, it may leaving you wanting more. This will make it more difficult to stick to a smaller portion.
Eat slowly and stop when you are only 80% full. Wait 20 minutes before eating again. During this time, your brain will catch up with your stomach and let you know that you are no longer hungry.

, There are times when you're craving fries and you feel there is little chance of only eating a few of them. It may be easier to skip the fries completely.


A rough or stressful day at work may trigger french fry cravings. If you give it, it might be next to impossible not to overindulge.
If this is the case, try skipping the fries altogether. This might prevent a binge or a serious incident of overindulging. If you know you cannot control yourself, be safe by avoiding the temptation.

Plan your meals for the week.,
Seek out healthy recipes.,
Cook smart.,
Reduce your meat intake.,
Make smaller portions.",How to Eat Better Food and Feel Healthier2," Having a plan for what you’re going to eat makes shopping and cooking healthy foods easier, and you’ll avoid impulse or convenience eating., There are many places to find healthy recipe ideas for practically any style of cooking. Cookbooks, magazines and newspapers, and internet sources are all great places to find recipes to meet your needs.


Find recipes for foods you like and want to eat. There are usually simple modifications available to make them healthier. Bake foods instead of frying them, for instance, and steam rather than boil vegetables.

, Using unsaturated fats like olive oil instead of butter to prepare a meal can make a huge difference. Changing cooking methods, substituting ingredients, and other strategies can help you feel better while still providing delicious, satisfying meals.


Moderation is still important since all oils are high in fat and calories.
You can also reduce oils and fats by baking or roasting foods. Roasted vegetables in particular are a delicious alternative to using the frying pan. Try it with cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, or asparagus.Make substitutions in your favorite recipes to cut out extra sugar, salt, and fat. Use light cream or milk instead of heavy cream. Or try using plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream on a taco or chili. Sweet fruits like dried figs or raisins can sometimes take the place of refined sugars. Experiment and see what works for you.

, While meat is certainly a great source of protein, it’s also expensive, and red meat like beef has been linked with heart disease and cancer. Most Americans consume far more than the recommended portion sizes of meat, so there’s usually room for improvement here in most diets.


Opt for meats with less saturated fat like fish or chicken when you can, and avoid cured, processed, or smoked meats.
Beans and legumes are a great, non-meat alternative to augment your protein intake.

, This is the simplest way to reduce caloric intake, and for some, the most difficult. A little discipline here can go a long way toward healthier, happier eating.


It can be very difficult to estimate what a proper portion looks like. Use measuring cups and a kitchen scale rather than guessing.
Remember that “serving size” and “portion size” are not necessarily the same thing when it comes to food labeling. That 20 oz. bottle of soda might contain two “servings,” so read the label carefully to know how much you’re really consuming."

Choose what’s right for you.,
Be restaurant-smart.,
Don’t shop hungry.,
Slow down.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Eat Better Food and Feel Healthier3," Nutrition information on food packaging in the U.S. is based on a 2,000 calorie diet, which may not be right for everyone. Take the time to tailor your diet, including caloric intake and levels of fats and proteins, to your specific body type and needs.


You may need more or less, depending on your health, lifestyle, and level of activity. Don’t assume that the recommended daily allowance is universal - tailor it to your needs., Most restaurants offer huge portions, and it’s very easy to eat poorly while dining out. Social and work obligations frequently include dining out, so it isn’t practical to just avoid doing so. Instead, plan ahead to make restaurant dining healthy and enjoyable.


Go out at lunchtime instead of dinner. If you overdo it, you can make up for it with a lighter evening meal.
Ask for half of your meal in a doggie bag. You’re less likely to overeat, and you’ll have a meal for later.
Eat your veggies first. Fill up on the green stuff before moving on to other foods., Going to the grocery store on an empty stomach is a great way to blow your budget and your diet. Make sure you’ve had a healthy meal or snack before shopping.


Research shows that you make impulsive choices and generally have an acquisitive mindset when hungry. You’re not only more likely to buy unhealthy food, you’re more likely to buy even non-food items on impulse. Save your waistline and your bank account by eating before you shop., If you tend to wolf down your meals, hit the brakes. Eating slowly gives your stomach more time to feel satisfied after a meal. You brain must receive signals from digestive hormones that are secreted by the GI tract. Eating slowly can also increase your enjoyment and sense of well-being.


It can take around 20 minutes for your body to recognize satiety - that is, that it does not want more food. Take your time, if you can, and enjoy the meal.
Taking the time to savor your meal, even a simple one, can improve your satisfaction with what you’ve eaten., Research shows that most people respond better to “do” than “don’t” when it comes to healthy eating. Psychology and self-control are an important aspect for healthy, happy diets.


While negative messages can be effective with nutrition professionals like dieticians or doctors, people with less information at hand prefer to learn what to eat and how it benefits them, rather than just hearing what not to eat and how it can hurt them.
Rather than saying, “don’t eat that pizza, it’s unhealthy,” tell yourself or your loved one to “eat your broccoli because you’ll feel healthier.”"

Eat three bananas per day.,
Combine bananas with other healthy foods.,
Avoid acidic fruits.,
Cook your vegetables and do not eat them raw.,
Limit your alcohol intake to a couple of drinks per day.,
Cut back on coffee.,
Avoid smoking.,
Consider switching from aspirin to acetaminophen.",How to Ease Peptic Ulcers Using Bananas1," Adding three bananas to a healthy diet may help prevent ulcers and reduce ulcer pain. You can simply eat bananas, add them to a smoothie, or consume them any other way you may enjoy. Bananas are effective because they are high in potassium, magnesium, manganese, fiber, vitamins B6 and C, and folate. Some studies suggest they are high in an enzyme that helps stop the growth of the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers.


It is recommended that you begin to eat three bananas per day as soon as you feel ulcer symptoms. You should continue eating three bananas per day until symptoms subside.;
, By combining bananas with a healthy lifestyle, you will have a better chance of preventing ulcers. In addition to bananas add other non-acidic fruit to your diet. Non-acidic fruits includes kiwi, mango and papaya. Also try lightly boiled vegetables like broccoli or carrots. You should eat more leeks, onion, oats, wheat and whole grain.These foods are rich in vitamins and will help to speed up the ulcer healing process.Bananas are high in carbohydrates, so pairing them with healthy fats and proteins can help to prevent blood sugar spikes/lows.

, Acidic fruits include oranges, peaches, berries and grapefruit. Acidic fruits will increase stomach acid and can irritate ulcers by breaking down mucus lining in the stomach. Try non-acidic fruits instead!

, Raw vegetables may be acidic, particularly corn, lentils, winter squash and olives. Again, acidic foods can irritate stomach ulcers.

, Drinking in excess, that is more than a couple drinks per day, can actually promote the development of ulcers by interacting with the bacteria that causes ulcers, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).To reduce your alcohol intake try drinking more slowly, or tell a friend or loved one you will only be drinking two drinks per day to help with your ulcers.Never drink on an empty stomach as this will irritate peptic ulcers.

, It is popularly believed that coffee can cause ulcers, although medical research does not show a connection.However, the acidity in coffee may contribute to upset stomach.In fact, any beverage containing caffeine may irritate an existing ulcer.You may find relief for your peptic ulcer if you

, Smoking, much like drinking, can promote the development of ulcers by interacting with the bacteria that causes ulcers, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). By smoking you are increasing your chance of getting an ulcer.If you are a heavy smoker, try to gradually reduce the amount you smoke per day., If you have headaches or other needs for a pain reliever, consider switching to acetaminophen. Like alcohol and smoking, aspirin promotes the development of ulcers especially in someone who has the bacteria H. pylori already present in his or her stomach.Talk about switching pain relievers with your doctor.

Peel, dry, crush and drink bananas.,
Peel the bananas to begin your natural treatment, the banana should be unripe.,
Cut the peeled bananas into 1/8th inch slices and dry them.,
Use a pestle and mortar to grind the dry bananas into a fine powder.,
Combine two tablespoons of the crushed banana with one tablespoons of honey.",How to Ease Peptic Ulcers Using Bananas2," Doing this will help unlock the most effective treatment for peptic ulcers. Dried bananas contain sitoindosides which helps to increase mucus in the digestive tract, which in turn helps to prevent and heal ulcers. Unripe bananas may promote cell growth in the intestinal tract. Lastly, dried bananas contain polysaccharides, which is also found in anti-ulcer drugs., You can peel the unripe banana either with your hands by gently breaking off the top and peeling down the skin, or by using a knife to cut off the top and then peeling down the skin.

, Dehydrate the bananas by either leaving them on a baking tray in the sun for 7 days, or by placing them in the oven at 170 degrees F for five hours., If you do not have a pestle and mortar, you can try putting the banana in a plastic bag and using a rolling pin or another heavy object to crush the banana., Take this mixture three times per day, in the morning, afternoon and night. You can add milk or another liquid to the mixture if you prefer.

Determine if you are vulnerable.,
Look for the symptoms of peptic ulcers.,
Understand the medical treatment options.",How to Ease Peptic Ulcers Using Bananas3," If you smoke and/or drink a lot of alcohol you are more susceptible to peptic ulcers.Alcohol reduces the mucous lining in your stomach which will increase stomach acid, while smoking increase the risk of ulcers for those with bacteria already in their stomach. Peptic ulcers were once thought to be caused by spicy food, however this is not the case.


You may also be vulnerable if you have a family history of ulcers, take aspirin regularly, or are over the age of 50., The mild symptoms of peptic ulcers include a burning pain in the stomach between meals or at night, bloating, heartburn and nausea. In extreme cases you may experience black stool, loss of weight, severe pain or vomiting blood., Peptic ulcers are caused by a bacteria in the stomach called H. pylori. If you experience any of the severe symptoms, you should visit an emergency room immediately. If your symptoms are mild and persistent you schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics and/or acid reducers to treat the ulcers."

Core and dice the apple.,
Shave the apple.,
Create apple noodles.,
Grate the apple.,
Preserve your apple pieces.",How to Eat an Apple If You Have Braces1," The most straightforward way to eat an apple when you have braces is simply to cut it into small chunks. First, use an apple corer to remove the core and separate the apple into wedges. Then, cut the wedges into small chunks and enjoy.


The smaller the chunks, the less likely you will be to damage your braces. Aim for pieces that measure one half inch or less in all directions.
Choose apples that can stand straight up and don't slant to the side for an easier time coring.
Place the apple on a cutting board for coring. A flat plate will work too, but don't choose an expensive plate.
Apply slow but steady pressure to the corer with both hands until it passes all the way through the apple.
You can chop up an apple without a corer by simply cutting it into quarters, slicing out the core with your knife, and continuing to chop the apple into smaller pieces. This will take a bit longer and you will need to be especially careful not to cut yourself.;
, If you have a mandoline, you can use it to create thin apple slices that will be easy to eat with braces. Simply slide the apple over the mandoline blade and let it do all the work for you.Cut the apple in half first so you have a flat surface to begin slicing.
You do not have to remove the core to slice your apple, but if you choose to, be sure to use an apple corer that will not separate the apple into slices.
Make sure to follow all the instructions for safe use of your mandoline, and always use the hand guard if it has one.

, The spiralizer is another cool kitchen gadget that can help make apples more manageable for people with braces. Simply follow the instructions for inserting the apple into your spiralizer, turn the handle, and you will have thin strips of apple that look just like spaghetti.Eat your apple noodles with a fork or with your fingers.

, If you want super small apple pieces, try shredding it with a grater. When you're finished, place your grated apple in a bowl and use a fork or spoon to eat it.


If your grater stands up on its own, place one hand on top of the grater to keep it steady, and use the other hand to guide the apple over the blades.
If your grater has a handle, hold it at an angle against the cutting board with the blades facing up and use your other hand to guide the apple back and forth over the blades.
Once you get to the core, turn the apple around and continue grating the other sides.
Be careful not to get your fingers too close to grater. You might not be able to grate the entire apple.
Make sure you do this over a cutting board or a large plate. It is likely to make a bit of a mess.

, No matter how you cut up an apple, it will start to turn brown very quickly if you don't eat it right away. If you want to save your cut-up apple for later, splash some lemon juice on it and store it in an airtight container.


Cut-up apples can last in the refrigerator for three to four days. Just because they have turned a bit brown does not mean they are not still good to eat.Using a vacuum sealer to store your apple pieces will also help keep them fresh.

Restrict fatty foods in your diet.,
Avoid chocolate.,
Limit your coffee intake.,
Stay away from peppermint and mint products.,
Don’t drink alcohol.,
Tread lightly with acidic foods.,
Avoid spicy foods if you’re currently having reflux.",How to Ease Acid Reflux With a Change in Diet1," Foods that are high in fat tend to worsen reflux symptoms. The fat affects how long it takes your food to digest and leave your stomach, which means more time and likelihood for acid backup. Try to eat a low-fat diet.Avoid fried foods, red meat, and foods cooked in butter – these are high in “bad” fats. Choose lean meat options that are grilled, baked, broiled, or poached. Opt for fish like salmon or mackerel when possible.
Cook with olive oil instead of butter. Eat fish and nuts like almonds, walnuts, and cashews. These have “good” fats that are better for you.
Stay away from trans fats that are present in pre-packaged and processed foods. Skip the junk food aisle and don’t eat fast food.
Choose low-fat or non-fat dairy options.;
, Chocolate loosens your lower esophageal sphincter (or LES) – the valve that keeps acid in your stomach where it belongs.As hard as it is to hear, natural elements in chocolate like cocoa, caffeine, and theobromine promote reflux., Coffee is a known trigger for reflux. The caffeine and high acid content weaken the LES.If you currently drink lots of coffee, don’t just stop right away – that might cause withdrawal symptoms like headaches and irritability. Wean yourself off coffee by decreasing how many cups you drink per day, and eventually switching to half-caff (half-caffeinated, half caffeine-free) or decaf coffee or tea.

, Like chocolate, mint relaxes the LES because of its chemical composition.Try not to eat foods flavored with mint, especially peppermint and spearmint. This includes chewing gum.

, Alcohol irritates the throat and stomach and is known to loosen up the LES. Minimize your alcohol intake or stop drinking altogether.If you currently drink multiple alcoholic beverages in a day, start to cut back your drinking – stopping all at once can cause withdrawal. Consult a doctor for help or gradually limit your consumption on your own.

, The jury is still out about whether eating foods with high acid content causes reflux, but some studies suggest that it might. Some people may be more susceptible to acidic foods, so you can try to limit them in your diet and watch for improvement. Other than coffee, consider experimenting with limiting these high-acid foods and beverages:Processed, frozen, and prepackaged foods – these usually contain acidic preservatives
Soda and other carbonated/canned/bottled drinks
Citrus fruit like oranges, limes, lemons, and grapefruits (and their juice)
Tomatoes and tomato products, including red pasta sauce and pizza sauce
Onions and garlic, Though spicy foods do not actually cause reflux, if your esophagus is already irritated they can make it feel worse.Don’t eat spicy food during a reflux attack. Once you’re feeling back to normal, eating spicy food shouldn't be a problem.

Add ginger and fennel to your meals.,
Try foods that contain probiotics.",How to Ease Acid Reflux With a Change in Diet2," There’s no such thing as a perfectly reflux-friendly diet. However, eating a well-balanced diet high in fiber can aid digestion and potentially improve reflux symptoms. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis – these provide some fiber and nutrients you need.


Bananas, melon, peaches, pears, berries – these are all good choices. Just stay away from citrus.
Avoid toppings and sauces that contain onions, garlic, tomatoes, or other irritants.Green leafy veggies and root vegetables like potatoes, yams, beets, parsnip, and carrots are good complex carbohydrates and fiber sources.

, Whole grain rice, pasta, bread, couscous, and oatmeal add fiber and nutrients to your diet. Fiber aids in digestion, and adds to a healthy diet without irritating reflux.Try to include a mix of fiber sources in your meals – regularly eat fruits, veggies, whole grains, and legumes like beans, nuts, and lentils., Eating eggs may help with reflux symptoms.Because the yolk of the egg contains much of the fat, you’re less likely to get reflux with egg-white only options. For other protein, eat low-fat meats like fish, poultry, or lean cuts of red meat.Eat meat that is broiled, grilled, sautéed in olive oil (not butter), or baked – not fried.

, Eating ginger may help speed up digestion, lowering the risk of reflux. You can drink ginger tea, or add ginger right to your meals in fresh, dried, or powdered form. Fennel, an herb thought to relieve bloating, might also be helpful., Probiotics are tiny “good” bacteria, usually found in fermented food. Though it’s not scientifically proven, these foods might help balance the bacterial flora in your intestines and improve reflux symptoms.You can try eating small amounts of these foods to see if you experience relief:


Yogurt with live cultures
Kefir (a sour-tasting, fermented form of cow’s milk)
Kombucha (a fermented tea beverage)
Raw sauerkraut, pickles, or kimchi

Consult a doctor or nutritionist for help with meal planning, if necessary.,
Eat at least 3 hours before bed.,
Eat smaller meals.",How to Ease Acid Reflux With a Change in Diet3," Acid reflux is triggered by different foods for different people. You can avoid common irritants, but it will benefit you to know your specific food triggers. Keep a food record – write down everything you eat for two weeks and make note of how you feel and what symptoms you experience. Note what time of day you ate.


Once you have enough data to cross-reference, review your notes. Look for any foods that appear over and over at times when you experienced symptoms. Experiment with cutting those foods out of your diet to see if you get relief.
Continue to add to your notes if you encounter new foods that trigger your reflux.

, The symptoms of acid reflux can be similar to those caused by other more serious conditions. Visit your doctor for a physical exam to be properly diagnosed if you experience symptoms including heartburn, burning sensations in your throat, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, a dry cough, a sore throat, or regurgitation of food or sour liquid.Frequent or untreated reflux can lead to such severe throat irritation that it causes bleeding, narrowing of the esophagus that makes it harder to swallow, and even cancer.Your doctor might prescribe an antacid or other medication to help your symptoms and prevent complications.
If your symptoms occur at least 2 times per weeks, you should consult with a doctor as you may may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)., If you continue to struggle with reflux or identify so many triggers that you don’t know what’s best to eat, consult a professional. Your doctor or a nutritionist can help you develop a new food plan based on the findings from your two-week review. This will ensure you are getting all nutrients you need while avoiding triggers.

, Allow at least 3 hours between eating and going to bed, or even lying down.In fact, try to take a walk for several minutes after you eat, to encourage digestion.


A food that causes reflux when you eat it before bedtime might not give you any trouble if you eat it earlier in the day., If you can, have 4-5 small meals spread throughout the day rather than 3 large meals. Eating smaller amounts at a time may improve reflux symptoms.If this doesn’t work with your schedule, avoid overeating by decreasing your portion sizes during meals and having light snacks in between like nuts or fruit.

Drink milk everyday.,
Add milk to hot beverages.,
Use non-fat powdered milk.,
Make chocolate milk.,
Get creative.,
Try using milk to make smoothies.",How to Drink More Milk Every Day1," The USDA recommends that both children and adults should drink 3 cups of low-fat or fat-free milk (or equivalent dairy products) everyday in order to get the calcium and vitamins your body needs.Children are encouraged to drink whole milk until age 2 and then switch to 2% milk.
If you don't like the taste of milk, try adding flavors like vanilla extract, banana extract, or strawberry juice.;
, Try adding milk to your coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. Milk will make your beverages creamy and smooth while reducing acidity and bitterness.Be aware, though, that adding milk to tea may reduce the benefits of drinking tea. Milk proteins interfere with your body's ability to absorb the beneficial flavonoid antioxidants found in tea., Powdered milk can be added to any recipe that calls for milk, and can be used in coffee as a nutritious, fat-free substitute for non-dairy creamer. You can even add non-fat powdered milk to a glass of milk to double your vitamin intake., For a sweet treat that will satisfy adults and children alike, try making your own chocolate milk at home.


Mix cocoa powder, vanilla, milk, and sugar to taste. It's a simple, delicious recipe that will satisfy your craving for sweets without all the additives of store-bought chocolate milk., You can add milk to various recipes to make the food taste richer and creamier, while giving you an extra boost of vitamins and calcium.

, Adding milk will thicken your smoothie and help you bulk up on vitamins and nutrients.Use a blender to mix ice, fruit, and non-fat or low-fat milk. If low-fat milk isn't thick enough for your smoothie, scoop in some creamy peanut butter for a richer, fuller flavor.

Change your milk.,
Count calories.,
Choose milk over soda.,
Make milk a priority.,
Get your dairy from other sources.",How to Drink More Milk Every Day2," If you're used to drinking whole milk, gradually lower yourself down to skim milk. This will reduce your intake of calories and saturated fat. Step down slowly from whole milk to two percent milk, then down to one percent milk, and finally, skim milk.You may want to consider organic milk without added hormones.

, While most varieties of milk do come with calories, you can make smart choices or substitutions to accommodate for those calories in your daily diet. Cut out ""empty"" calories from your diet and drink more milk instead.


If you're unsure about whether you are getting enough dairy, or worry that you're consuming too much, talk to your doctor or a licensed nutritionist about dietary changes you can make for a better-balanced meal plan.

, One twelve-ounce cup of skim milk has fewer calories than most twelve-ounce cans of soda, and delivers vitamins and nutrients that soda lacks., Milk and dairy products are essential for delivering the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to stay healthy and strong. You may need to cut out other parts of your diet if you're worried about fat and caloric intake, but milk should be a priority because of its many health benefits.



Calcium keeps bones and teeth healthy.Protein is a good source of energy and builds and repairs your muscle tissue.Potassium helps regulate blood pressure and is important for bone and muscle strength.Phosphorus helps strengthen your bones and teeth. It also helps your body filter waste in the kidneys.Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorous.Vitamin B12 helps maintain healthy red blood cells and helps maintain nerve tissue.Vitamin A helps maintain normal vision and healthy skin, teeth, and tissue.Niacin, a B vitamin, can help regulate your cholesterol., If you're worried about adding calories by drinking milk with a meal, try fat-free yogurt as a healthy snack. You can even make a breakfast out of yogurt by adding dry cereal, nuts, and fruit."
"
Drink a glass of milk with food.,
Take lactase enzyme tablets.,
Buy lactose-free milk.,
Try other dairy products.",How to Drink More Milk Every Day3," Some people who have a hard time digesting lactose (found in dairy products) find that combining milk with food makes it easier to digest., These over-the-counter pills can be taken right before meals to help your body digest milk and dairy products., Some dairies and milk producers add lactase directly to milk, so you can get the taste and nutritional value of milk without the risk of digestive problems.Unsweetened almond milk, coconut milk and rice milk are all great alternatives.

, If drinking milk is not an option, opt for other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. Even though these foods are still made with milk, they may be easier to digest."
"
Prioritize drinking water.,
Make small changes to your favorite beverages.,
Do not add sweeteners to coffee and tea.,
Opt for healthier juices.,
Drink more milk.,
Limit your intake of certain beverages.",How to Drink Healthier1," If you're thirsty, opt for water most of the time. Water quenches your thirst better than other beverages and has no calories and carbs. Proper hydration is also important to overall health.Have water when eating out or at home. It can help to store cool water in your fridge so it's easy to pour a cold glass of water with a meal.
If you want to liven up regular water, infuse it with fruits or herbs, such as mint. For example, you could place slices of strawberries in regular tap water.
Staying hydrated throughout the day can help fight the urge to drink unhealthy beverages. Make a point of carrying a water bottle with you wherever you go.;
, Notice where your beverage calories tend to come from. For example, do you frequently have a latte as a pick-me-up after work? Do you drink soda with lunch or dinner? Tiny tweaks can eliminate calories, making your drink choices healthier.If you drink sugary sodas or ginger-ale, opt for diet and sugar-free varieties. This greatly reduces calories and sugar.
Going for smaller sizes can also help. Ask for a small latte rather than a medium one, for example. You can also tweak some of the ingredients. Request fat-free milk, for instance.

, Coffee and tea only have a few calories per cup. However, calories can be added on fast when adding things like sugar and other sweeteners. Try to drink coffee and tea black or opt for low-calorie sugar substitutes if you're a coffee drinker., Fruit juices are often not as healthy as they appear. They're often high in added sugars and even juices without added sugar are high in calories and overall sugar content. Instead of drinking juice straight, pour a splash of juice into seltzer water. This creates your own sparkling juice with less calories and sugar.For healthiest results, go for juices without added sugars and limit your intake to 4 oz (120 ml) a day.

, Milk is a high protein beverage that contains beneficial vitamins and minerals, such as calcium and vitamin D. Adults can enjoy up to three 8 oz (240 ml) cups of milk a day for optimal health., Some beverages should be consumed rarely, if ever, due to their poor effects on health. The following beverages should not be a staple of your diet:Sugar-sweetened soda, fruit punches, fruit juices, sweet tea and powdered drink mixes provide little nutrition and a lot of extra calories and sugar.
Energy drinks are packed with sugar and caffeine, which can lead to a spike in blood pressure.
Sports drinks do contain electrolytes, which can be helpful after a workout in some cases, but are usually too packed with added sugars to be healthy. You should only drink them if you engage in very high intensity workouts of at least 60 minutes and, even then, drink them in moderation.

"
"
Strive to drink in moderation.,
Avoid mixers with liquor.,
Opt for wine when possible.,
Drink light beers only.",How to Drink Healthier2," If you opt to drink alcohol, drink in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.A drink is defined as 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine, or 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of distilled spirits.

, If possible, you should opt to drink liquor neat. Mixers, such as juice and soda, often contain a lot of extra calories and sugar. Drinking liquor straight is a low-calorie option to have a drink at the end of the day without it being too unhealthy.If you dislike the taste of straight liquor, go for flavored seltzer water or diet sodas as mixers.

, Wine is a low-calorie, low-carb option. If you dislike hard liquor, go for a glass of wine instead to reduce your caloric intake. Wine also may have health benefits due to its antioxidants. While studies are inconclusive, there is some evidence wine can lower bad cholesterol levels., Beer is generally not a healthy option as it's high in calories and carbs. If you do drink beer, stick to one or two beers. Always go for light beers, which are lower in overall calories."
"
Be aware of misleading calories on nutrition labels.,
Watch for hidden sugars.,
Ask questions when ordering drinks out.,
Eat before drinking alcohol.",How to Drink Healthier3," Nutrition labels on beverages are often misleading. While the calorie and sugar content on, say, a bottle of apple juice may look low, check the serving size. It's possible the serving size is only a portion of the bottle. You may find there are two to three servings in a single bottle, doubling or tripling the calorie content.Make a habit of always looking for the serving size on a drink you're purchasing.
While you may buy a bottle of apple juice intending to only drink one serving, it can often be too tempting not to down the entire bottle. If you're not sure you can avoid the temptation, opt for a smaller bottle of juice.

, Read the ingredients list for hidden sugars. While a beverage may appear to be low sugar, it may be loaded with products that are essentially the same as sugars. Watch out for the following on nutrition labels:High-fructose corn syrup
Fructose
Fruit juice concentrate
Honey
Sugar
Syrup
Corn syrup
Sucrose
Dextrose
Evaporated cane juice

, Don't be afraid to ask about ingredients when ordering things like smoothies and juices when eating out. You want to make sure you stay healthy at all times.Ask about ingredients like milk at coffee shops. If possible, ask for fat-free or soy milk instead.
When ordering things like fruit smoothies, ask about added sugar. Request a smoothie be served without added sugar whenever possible.
Ask about the smallest sizes and whether it's possible to order a child's size.

, If you're going to drink alcohol, do not avoid eating first to minimize caloric intake. Not only can be it dangerous to drink on an empty stomach, as you'll become intoxicated faster, alcohol will lower your inhibitions. If you drink while very hungry, you may end up binging on unhealthy foods later on."

Pick a date to start your fast!,
Start transitioning into fasting.,
Take time to be gentle with yourself during the fast, as your body is healing.,
Listen to your intuition and body during the fast for clues on what it needs including ending the fast early.,
Transition the same way out of the fast as you went into the fast even slower.",How to Do a Dry Fast," Some people dry fast during holiday, full moons or change of season. Pick how long your fast will be and mark it on a calendar. Dry fasts over 3 days are not recommended but have been completed!


Decide whether you would like to do a soft or absolute dry fast. Some people even do back to back dry fasts and have a drink of water or piece of fruit every 24 hours or only at certain time of day.
Decide whether you are ready to undertake a dry fast. Starting with fruit, juice and especially water fasting will help determine how mentally and physically prepared you are. If the body is too toxic, sudden death can occur because of massive amount of toxins released. Water fasting is the best gateway towards dry fasting.;
, The most gentle of fasts are done after preparing the body and mind. Taking caffeine out of the diet a week in advance helps with side effects. Exploring raw vegan foods, liquid salads and cleansing teas prior aids the body in detox. Cutting down on meals/calories day to day is also encouraged.


Drink plenty of water; urine should be crystal clear before entering the fast. Some people enjoy doing a colonic or salt water flush to insure digestive rest before fast.

, This is a good time for meditation, relaxation and prayer. Journaling and surrounding yourself in nature can be very therapeutic. Many people find activities like Qigong and Thai Chi a way to enhance energy outside of taking in food. Taking naps with the legs elevated help with light headedness, a form of detox.

, True hunger will cause a pain in the stomach that is much different than a growling stomach. Monitoring salvia and urine is also helpful to determine hydration levels. Avoid exposure to high levels of heat and sunlight.

, Sip on water and eat hydrating fruits and raw salad like vegetables. Increase calories and meals gradually over a period time so the digestive tract can ""wake up"". Stay connected with your body and intuition.

Talk to your doctor.,
Start a food/symptom journal.,
Eat a regular diet for two weeks.,
Eliminate lactose-containing products.,
Eliminate foods containing gluten.,
Take a lactose tolerance test.,
Talk to a registered dietitian.,
Continue with your food/symptom journal.,
Use lactose-free foods.,
Consume gluten free foods.,
Take supplements.",How to Differentiate Between a Gluten Allergy and Lactose Intolerance," It's crucial to talk to your doctor (possibly an allergist) if you suspect you have a food allergy. They will be able to guide you on what's appropriate as far as diet, diagnostic tests and treatment.


Tell your doctor about your symptoms. While a food allergy can cause some of the same symptoms an intolerance or sensitivity, other symptoms include: rash, hives, itchy skin, shortness of breath, chest pain, or even a sudden drop in blood pressure. A food allergy usually comes on suddenly after exposure and can be life-threatening.Never start a restrictive or elimination diet prior to talking to your doctor or a allergy certified registered dietitian.
Do not eat any foods that you think could cause life threatening allergic responses unless under the care of a physician.
If symptoms do not resolve after eliminating the suspected offending food, go back to the doctor for further evaluation.;
, Logging all your meals, snacks and beverages along with any symptoms you may experience can help you figure out what type of sensitivity you have and to what food. It will be difficult to determine what food is causing you symptoms without a journal.


It might be wise to do your journal by hand. Start with a notebook and jot down everything you consume (including any supplements or medications) and symptoms you experience. Many food journaling apps are not detailed enough for what you should be tracking.
Make sure to note the time you ate and the time you experience symptoms (if at all). Typical food sensitivities symptoms may include: nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, diarrhea, stomach cramping and gas.
Also include the serving size of the foods you consume. For example, some individuals have an extreme lactose intolerance (meaning they cannot tolerate any lactose), but others may have a mild lactose intolerance (and can tolerate small doses of lactose). By logging how much you eat, you can gauge the amount of your body will tolerate without adverse symptoms.

, To help you decide what food is giving you trouble, you actually need to consume that food. You'll need to trigger the symptoms to be able to associate those symptoms with a specific food and then avoid them to see if symptoms disappear.Continuing with a regular, non-restrictive diet may not be comfortable, but producing symptoms will help point the finger at the suspected food. Only upon elimination of the food and resolution of symptoms will you have an accurate answer.
You may only have one symptom or you may experience multiple symptoms. They usually begin between 30 minutes and two hours after the food is consumed.Typical symptoms of food sensitivities include: bloating, gas, stomach pain, diarrhea and/or nausea.If your symptoms are life threatening, do not consume any food you suspect will trigger symptoms. You can perform oral food challenges in the care of a doctor in a safe and controlled environment., Identify foods containing lactose and eliminate all of them from your diet. If you are lactose intolerant, symptoms you were experiencing during the non-restrictive diet should be alleviated and discontinue.


Milk and milk products contain the sugar lactose. Foods that are mainly dairy or have been made with dairy will contain lactose in varying amounts.
Check ingredient lists on all products. Some lesser known dairy products that contain lactose are whey, caseinate, malted milk, milk derivative and milk solids. The lesser known dairy products are usually used as an ingredient in another type of food.Avoid antacids. Many antacids contain lactose and will make the symptoms worse. Discuss medication options for other alternatives to acid reducers with your doctor if you feel it is necessary.
If symptoms continue after two weeks of a lactose-free diet, you most likely have a different food sensitivity. Dairy and other lactose containing products can be added back into the diet.
If you add lactose back to your diet and your symptoms worsen, you may have dual sensitivities and lactose is only part of the problem. Continue to keep lactose out of your diet.

, Identify foods containing gluten and eliminate all of them from your diet. If you have a gluten sensitivity any symptoms should resolve after you discontinue eating gluten containing foods.


Wheat and wheat products contain gluten. Also, other grains, such as barley and rye contain gluten. Gluten is in a wide range of foods and can be very hard to avoid. It is found in most breads, beer, other baked goods and pasta.Read ingredient labels on all products. Gluten may be added to foods for its functional properties, and may be on the ingredient statement as vital wheat gluten, wheat gluten or just gluten. Also, malt contains gluten and is often added as a flavoring to many processed foods (like soy sauce). Some other lesser known ingredients containing gluten are Atta flour, bulgur, couscous, farina, graham, wheat bran, wheat germ, wheat starch, triticale and matzoh.If symptoms continue after two weeks of a gluten-free diet, you most likely have a different food sensitivity. Gluten containing products can be added back into the diet.
If you add gluten back to your diet and your symptoms worsen, you may have dual sensitivities and gluten is only part of the problem. Continue to keep gluten out of your diet.

, If you feel compelled or a doctor recommends a concrete diagnosis, you can take one of the three tests used by medical professionals to determine lactose intolerance.


The blood lactose tolerance test will measure how well your body digests lactose. It is done by drinking a lactose solution and then having several blood samples drawn over a period of time. This test is mainly used for adults.The hydrogen breath test measures amount of hydrogen during respiration. The more hydrogen that is breathed out, the better the body is digesting the lactose. This test is non-invasive and used for adults.Stool acidity test. The stool acidity test measures the acidity of stool after consumption of lactose. The more acidic the stool, the less the body is able to digest lactose. This test is mainly used for children.There is no diagnostic test for gluten sensitivity. It is ""diagnosed"" by exclusion only. So if symptoms go away or are managed well on a gluten-free diet, you can assume a gluten sensitivity., Living with food allergies or sensitivities can be difficult. This is especially true if you have an issue with more than one food. Restrictive diets or fear of foods may cause you not to eat a balanced diet. A dietitian can help you find a diet that's appropriate for you.


Cutting out or eliminating the offending food is one of the only ways to deal with sensitivities.However, an overly restrictive diet may not provide your body with the recommended amount of a variety of essential nutrients.
Review your medical history, thoughts on what your offending foods are and your food and symptom journal with your dietitian. They are nutrition experts and will be able to provide you with a meal plan and food substitutes that will not cause a reaction.

, Although you may have figured out which food has been causing symptoms, it's still wise to continue with your journal. This will help other health professionals and yourself as you continue to modify and change your diet.


Food and symptom journals are also incredibly helpful to allergists, dietitians and other health professionals. They may see patterns or trends in your journal that you do not.
If you have a flare up of symptoms again, you'll be able to return to your journal to see what the offending food was and how to replace that or avoid it in the future.

, The best way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid lactose containing products. Avoiding most or all foods with lactose will be the primary way you will avoid symptoms long-term.However, it's important to replace nutrients commonly found in lactose containing foods.


Lactose containing foods are generally high in calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus. You can get these nutrients from other foods like: broccoli, canned salmon, fortified juices, pinto beans and spinach.
There are many lactose free and lactose reduced milks, yogurt and cheese. These types of products may not be easy to find and have a slightly different taste than the original, but work great as substitutes. All vegan products, like vegan cheese, will also not contain any lactose. These are a safe bet when purchasing dairy alternatives.
Take a lactase enzyme supplement. These are pills that can be taken before the consumption of lactose to help digest the lactose. They are sold at most pharmacies and health food stores., The best way to avoid symptoms related to a gluten sensitivity is to give up and eliminate all gluten containing foods from your diet. Again, it's important to replace any nutrients that were found in gluten containing foods.


The biggest and most common source of gluten is wheat (followed by barley and rye). Common nutrients found in these grains are folate, thiamin, riboflavin and other B vitamins.Fortunately other food groups contain many of these vitamins - like protein foods. In addition, consuming other grains that do not contain gluten and have a variety of B vitamins include: quinoa, teff, amaranth, rice, corn and buckwheat.
Currently there are many specialty pre-packaged foods that are gluten free. Anything from pasta, muffins, breads, baking mixes, waffles, pancakes, etc. These can be found at most grocery stores.
There is no medication or supplement that can prevent or lessen symptoms from a gluten sensitivity.

, If you plan to avoid lactose or gluten containing foods, talk with a doctor about supplementation. You may need to replace vitamins, minerals and other nutrients found in these foods.


There are a variety of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals that can help you replace nutrients in foods you are avoiding.Note, it's not ideal or recommended to rely solely on supplements for your nutrition. The best source of nutrients is from consuming foods.
Always talk to your doctor prior to starting any vitamin/mineral supplement to make sure it's safe and appropriate for you.

Keep track of when you're planning on drinking.,
Measure your portions.,
Drink 1–2 glasses of wine occasionally.,
Cook with wine.,
Choose red wine over white.,
Go for dry red wine over sweeter wines.,
Pick up a bottle of pinot noir.,
Skip wine spritzers or other wine mixes.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Limit your total alcohol consumption.,
Avoid drinking on an empty stomach.,
Always stay hydrated before and after drinking.",How to Drink Wine for Health," Since there is a fine line between a ""good"" amount of wine and ""too much,"" it's important to track when and how much you're drinking. As a rule of thumb, men should not drink more than two 5-oz (150 mL) glasses of wine per day, and women should stick to one or fewer.Keep track of how much you're drinking and how often. Consider making a note in a food journal or tracking in an app on your smart phone.
For example, if you're considering having a glass of wine with dinner, but know you're going out for happy hour at work the next day, you may want to skip your wine and save it for happy hour instead.;
, Many people pour themselves larger portions than a ""standard"" drink. Measure out 5 ounces (150 mL) per serving to keep alcohol consumption moderate.


If you want to have more than one glass, consider pouring yourself only a 3 oz serving initially and another 3 oz serving so you're not overdoing it.
This amount is based on wines with an alcohol content around 12%.Many wines are significantly stronger, and should be drunk in smaller servings., In addition to measuring the appropriate portion size, you also need to moderate how many glasses of wine you drink at one sitting.


Health professionals recommend that you stick to a certain amount of total alcohol daily to prevent any negative side effects from consumption.
Women should have a maximum of 1 glass daily and men shouldn't consume more than 2 glasses daily.1 glass should be measured at 5 oz total.
If you drink past this amount, the negative health consequences will likely outweigh the positives.

, If you're not a fan of drinking wine or don't want to increase your intake consider cooking with wine. You'll be able to have the flavor of the wine, the nutritious compounds, but not alcohol.Red wine is a great ingredient to cook with. It can really boost the flavor of many foods. It's a great alternative to drinking wine on a more regular basis.
When you cook with red wine, you generally allow the wine to simmer a bit. This causes the alcohol content of the wine to burn off, but leaves all the flavor and antioxidant content of the wine.
Try using red wine in a gravy or sauce to serve over a steak or pork chop. Also use red wine to deglaze the pot when making a stew or a soup to boost the flavor.

, When you're trying to drink wine to promote better health, choose the type of wine that has the most benefits. Not every type of wine provides the same benefits.When you compare red and white wine, they are very similar on some fronts - like total calories or carbohydrates.
However, when you compare the amount of the antioxidants and resveratrol, red wine out shines white wine considerably. Although white wine does taste great, stick to red for your best bet.
Red wine has 7 mcg of lutein and zeaxanthin, 8.4 mg of choline, and significantly higher levels of resveratrol.

, Within the group of red wines you have a variety of options from different types of grapes. Some grapes produce wines that have higher antioxidant contents than others.


In general, it's been discovered that dryer red wines have significantly higher levels of antioxidants (like resveratrol) compared to sweeter red wines.Sweeter wines have a slightly higher sugar content which edges out the antioxidants that are found naturally in wine.
Dry red wines to try include: pinot noir, merlot or cabernet. Wines like dessert wines, port or zinfandels are sweeter and have a high sugar content.

, One specific type of a drier red wine is pinot noir. Different red wines have been studied for their nutrient content and this particular grape and the wine has been found to be nutrient dense.


Not only is it a tasty type of wine, but it also has been found to have the highest concentrations of resveratrol.The reason that pinot noir is especially high in resveratrol is due to the cool, rainy climates it's typically grown in.

, Another option you may find at restaurants, cookouts or a bar may be a wine spritzer or a mixed drink made with wine. These are beverages that you should skip as they do not provide as many health benefits.


Wine spritzers are a mixed drink that contains wine and a sweetened carbonated drink like club soda, seltzer water or soda.
These are higher in calories, sugar and since the wine is diluted, the amount of antioxidants you're consuming is lower.
Wine mixes may be something like a sangria. This is wine mixed with liquor, fruit juice and occasionally a carbonated beverage like club soda or seltzer water.
Sangria especially, has a higher alcohol content, but the wine itself is diluted so you're missing out on the beneficial nutrients of the wine but are consuming a larger quantity of alcohol.

, If you're interested in the benefits that red wine could have on your health, talk to your doctor. It's not advised to start drinking, even for health reasons, without consulting your physician.


Call your doctor or make an appointment to discuss your overall health and whether or not drinking red wine more often would be beneficial to you.
Talk to your doctor about his recommendation on the quantity of alcohol for you. The standard 1-2 glasses may be appropriate, however with some health conditions or prescription medications, it may be recommended to drink less than that.
Also talk to your doctor about what health aspect you want to improve. If you're looking to improve cardiac health, ask about other ways you can improve your health and support your heart.

, There are a variety of health benefits of drinking red wine on occasion. However, just because it's been shown to be beneficial, doesn't mean that you should start drinking or drink more regularly.Health professionals do not recommend that you increase your alcohol consumption - especially beyond the recommended limit of 1-2 glasses a day.
If you drink frequently or drink larger quantities of alcohol, there can be significant negative side effects.
Heavy drinking is associated with: increased risk of breast cancer, heart damage, stroke, cirrhosis and pancreatitis. In addition, heavier drinking can lead to a weakened immune system., Another important thing to remember when drinking red wine (or any alcoholic beverage) is that you should always have a glass of wine with food or after food.


It's not recommended to drink any type of alcohol on an empty stomach. When you do not have food in your stomach, alcohol travels straight to the blood stream which makes you intoxicated much more quickly.As your blood alcohol level rises, you lose more control. It affects your brain quickly which will affect decision making and bodily functions. This usually happens within one minute of consuming alcohol.
Try to have a small snack or meal before drinking. Or, have a glass of wine with your meal or appetizer.

, In addition to monitoring when you drink and how much you drink, you also need to monitor your hydration level. Stay hydrated before and after you drink to minimize any side effects.


Aim to drink at least 64 oz of hydrating fluids throughout your entire day. On days you plan on having alcohol, make sure you focus on getting in all of your fluids.It's also recommended that for every glass or serving of alcohol you consume, that you consume an extra 8 oz of water or other hydrating beverage.
You can drink items like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea or sparkling water. All will keep you hydrated.

For example, you may try Weight Watchers, which is rated the best weight-loss diet according to diet experts. On Weight Watchers, you can eat what you want but you will benefit more from making healthy choices. You are also able to shape your own diet and track your progress.Another option is to try to cut out certain foods in your diet and opt for a specific diet, such as a vegan diet or a raw food diet. You may then focus on eating specific, healthy foods at every meal and cutting out foods that are processed, pre-packaged, and not fresh.

, To get a better sense of how many calories you are consuming every day on your diet, you should track your calorie intake. You can do this by counting the calories in your food every day to ensure you are eating enough food to stay energized but not too much to cause you to gain weight. You may calculate how many calories you need to eat every day to maintain a balance and then consider what meals you can have based on your daily calorie intake.


You should calculate your calorie intake per day based on your lifestyle, your age, and your weight. You can then subtract 500 calories from your daily intake and make sure your diet is 500 less calories than it is normally.
For example, you may decide you want to lose 10 pounds total. You should then aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week through diet and exercise. You may then focus on burning 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day by working out, or reducing your caloric intake by 500-1,000 calories.
There are a variety of apps for smartphones that you can download and use to track your calorie intake.

, You should stick to your nutritional plan by creating meal plans every week. This way, you know what you are eating and when you are eating. Make sure you have three square meals a day, as skipping meals can lead to binge eating and unhealthy food choices. Plan out your meals for several weeks and then make a shopping list so you know exactly what you are buying when you go to the grocery store.You may use your daily calorie intake to help you choose foods for your meal plans. Go for foods high in nutrients and vitamins, but low in calories, so you can make the most out of your meal plan. Going for foods low in calories will also ensure you stay within your daily calorie intake.
For example, you may have a 1,500 calorie limit as part of your diet. For breakfast, you may have a banana smoothie that is 250 calories, followed by a mid-morning snack of toast and ricotta with honey that is 150 calories. You may then have a power salad for lunch that is 400 calories, followed by an afternoon snack of fruit and nuts that is 150 calories. You may finish your day with a quinoa vegetable and tofu bowl for dinner that is 500 calories. You will then have around 1,450 calories for the day, meeting your dietary goal., You should also focus on how much you are eating every day by controlling your portions. Make sure your plate has a balanced portion of vegetables, fruits, protein, and grains. Try to go for portions that are small and manageable, as having portions that are too big can lead to overeating.You can control your portions by using your hand to measure the food on your plate. You should have one finger's worth of dairy, such as a cheese stick and a fist sized serving of milk in a glass as a snack. You should also have one fist worth of vegetables on your plate as well as a protein source, like chicken or fish, the size of your palm. You should also have one fist size of fruit, such as an apple, as a snack.You should also make sure you have small snacks throughout the day that are healthy and filling. Eating smaller portions throughout the day, rather than big meals, can help you lose weight and maintain your nutritional plan.

, When you are creating an exercise plan, you should focus on finding a plan that suits you and your needs. Consider your lifestyle and your fitness goals. You can then develop an exercise plan that fits your routine and feels achievable.For example, you may have a goal of toning up your body and gaining more muscle. You may then develop an exercise routine that focuses on building muscle and toning key areas of your body.
You may also realize that your lifestyle makes it difficult to devote hours to working out or spending a lot of time at the gym. You may then go for an exercise plan that you can do at home in your living room for 30 minutes a day. This way, you have enough time to get fit without disrupting your usual routine.

, You should try to schedule in a set time to workout every day. Put the workout time in your calendar and try to stick to this time every day or every week. Having a set time for working out can make it easier to commit to it and feel like it is a natural part of your day.You may block off workout time in your calendar at work so you are not available for meetings or other work events during your workout time.
You may also let others know of your set workout time so they can schedule around your workout. This could be colleagues at work, family members at home, or friends at school.

, If you struggle to fit in set time to workout every day, you may try integrating fitness into your daily tasks. Take the stairs instead of the elevator and try to go for a walk or run at lunch. Do push ups or sit ups between meetings and do leg lifts while you are on the phone at work.You may also try to walk and talk with friends or colleagues, rather than sit at a desk in a meeting to talk. Doing some movement or exercise for even 5-10 minutes at a time throughout the day can help you stay active.

, After a few weeks to a few months on your exercise plan, you should assess your progress. If you feel you are achieving your goals, you may challenge yourself to create new fitness goals and then meet them. Challenging yourself will ensure you do not plateau and continue to stay in shape.For example, perhaps you have reached your goal of losing 10 pounds. You may then challenge yourself to a new goal of toning up your muscles by doing strength building exercises. You may then create a new exercise plan that focuses on this new goal or add to your existing plan.

, You may consider working with a professional trainer to help you develop an exercise plan, such as a trainer at your gym. Professional trainers can customize workouts for you based on your needs and can help motivate you to stay on track.


You may also try taking a fitness class at your local gym to learn how to workout properly and effectively.

, A big part of achieving your diet and fitness goals is staying motivated and committed. You should focus on staying motivated to achieve your goals, especially if they seem realistic and possible. Having clear goals, such as a goal weight, can help you stay motivated and committed to reaching your goal.You may also find it helps to read motivational texts or posts on diet and weight loss on social media. You may put up motivational texts about fitness around your house or in your office to remind you to stay focused on achieving your goals.

, It can also help to stay motivated to stick to your nutrition and exercise plan by tracking your progress on a day to day and week to week basis. You may create a document on your computer where you track your diet and your workout or use an app on your phone. Try to update the document or the app every time you eat and every time you workout.You may also review your progress once a week to determine how well you are doing. You may then analyze your progress and note any weak spots or problem areas.
For example, you may notice that you tend to drop in progress toward the end of the week, especially when you get busy at work or at school. You may then try modifying your workout plan so you do shorter workouts at the end of the week that still allow you to stay on track and reach your fitness goals.

, You can find motivation by reaching out to others for encouragement and support. You may enlist a friend or coworker to workout with you during lunch or on the weekends. You may join a fitness class with a friend and commit to going every week together. Or you may ask your partner to help you prepare healthy meals as part of your nutrition plan and avoid going out to eat at unhealthy places with friends.You may consider working with a dietitian to help you develop a nutrition plan that is realistic and ideal for you. Consulting with a dietitian will ensure you are consuming enough calories every day to stay healthy.

Register with the court.",How to Become an Anger Management Counselor," One way to get a jump on being a professional counselor is to start in high school. Try to take as many psychology classes as you can so you can already get to work in your field.


You can also take concurrent classes at a local community colleges if your school lets you do that. Talk to your guidance counselor to find out more.;
, To be a professional counselor, you must start with a bachelor's degree. It doesn't necessarily need to be in psychology or counseling, but if you plan to pursue that field, it's a good idea to start learning it in your undergraduate coursework. Plus, having a degree in a related field can help you get into the graduate program you want.During your time as an undergraduate, try to focus on courses that offer training in anger management. You can also take related courses, such as family counseling or substance abuse and addiction. Classes in communication could also be helpful.
If you want to develop your skills, consider joining a peer mediation group on campus, which can help you develop skills you need as a counselor.
While you don't need to be a professional counselor to provide anger management counseling to individuals, you need to take these steps if being a professional counselor who specializes in anger management is your goal.
If you want to just provide counseling in anger management while working in a related field, such as a school counselor or pastor, you can just work on certification for anger management. However, you'll still need a bachelor's degree.

, To work as a professional counselor, you must get a master's degree. Generally, your degree needs to be in psychology, marriage and family therapy, clinical mental health counseling, or something similar.You will need to narrow your field a bit when you enter graduate school. That is, you can work on a general psychology degree, but you can also narrow down to a specific type of counseling, such as marriage and family counseling. Which you choose depends on your own inclinations and desires. You can also find programs focused specifically on anger management. Most programs offer a degree in another type of counseling, such as marriage and family or youth counseling, with a focus on anger management.
To help increase your chances of finding a job, choose a program that is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). You can find a list of programs on the Council's website, or check on your school's website to see how it is accredited.To increase your chances of finding a job, you may even want to pursue a doctorate in your field.

, Once you graduate, you can't immediately start practicing as a counselor on your own. Instead, you must gain an internship or residency to work as a counselor with supervision.Each state varies on how many hours you must work before you can gain your license. Check with your state's licensing board to find out how many hours it requires. You'll need to put in somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 hours to work towards your license.
To find an internship or residency, check with local clinics and hospitals. Your school should also know of available opportunities.
In some cases, you may not need this experience after school if you're in a CACREP-accredited program.

, Working on national certification is important because it shows you meet certain national standards. However, it is not a license to practice in the state you live in, meaning you'll still need state licensing. Nonetheless, national certification can sometimes help you get state licensing.The main step you need to take to become nationally certified is to take the national examination, the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE). You can take this exam through the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC), the primary certification group in the United States. The website also provides prepping guides before you take the exam.
The NCE is focused on assisting people with relationships, human development, diversity, career development, and assessment. It also covers how to conduct yourself professionally and ethically, as well as the ways you are able to counsel people and provide diagnosis.Besides passing the examination, you need to meet the basic requirements for certification, starting with a master's degree and 3,000 hours of experience (with at least 100 of those supervised), though the experience may be waived if you completed a CACREP-accredited master's degree.To take the exam, you register with the site and sit the exam on a specific date. You will need two forms of ID when sitting the exam. You will know your score immediately after the exam, and you can retake the exam if you fail it.A perfect score is 160 out of 200 questions, as 40 questions are used for field testing and do not count against you., Start by finding the licensing board for your state, which you can do through the directory on the NBCC website. The website or board for your state can give you more information on requirements specific to your state.For instance, in some states, you need to be approved by the board as a candidate. You may also need to pay a fee in addition to the exam you take.In some states, the NCE will suffice for licensing. Other states require the the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination (NCMHCE), also administered by the NCCB.The main difference is this test includes clinical simulations, ten of them, where you must apply your knowledge, rather than just answering questions as you do in the NCE. In the simulations, you must choose one or multiple answers from a group of answers., While Anger Management certification doesn't have the national accreditation in place that counseling does, you can find nationally accredited programs. The main certification program is the National Anger Management Association (NAMA). Going through this association means your certification is likely to be recognized by courts that mandate anger management counseling as a part of sentencing.The first component is taking a course in anger management. In the course, you will learn the basics of providing anger management counseling for patients.
Your program should include things like a discussion of what anger is and how it can be managed. It should look at the use of logging anger moments to help figure out what causes episodes. It will also examine other concepts that play into anger, such as lack of empathy and communication, as well as stress.
NAMA has programs across the country where you can begin your certification. Basically, they hold small conferences at different locations where you can become certified. You can attend one near you or go fly across country if you prefer. You'll find a list of these conferences on NAMA's homepage.You can also take NAMA-approved courses through other organizations., The experience you need for anger management is fairly minimal. You need about 2 hours, spread out over 4 sessions, working under a anger management supervisor.You can also gain this training at one of the conferences.
Another option for this training is doing it by teleconference or phone through the NAMA.

, You need a bachelor's degree for basic anger management, which of course you'll meet if you're already a counselor. You'll also need to pay a fee and provide a resume to the NAMA., These requirements only provide you with a basic certification. If you want a more advanced certification, the requirements are tougher. For instance, you'll need to complete at least 500 hours over half year as a basic specialist to become a more advanced specialist.Mostly, achieving higher levels of certification is about putting in the hours. However, the hours need to specifically be in anger management, not just counseling, as you did with your counseling certification.
For more advanced certification, you'll need a master's or a doctorate, depending on what track you want, plus state licensing, which you should already have.

, Just like with most fields, your first step is to apply for positions. Consider local mental health clinics and hospitals. Your local government may also hire anger management counselors for individuals who must take anger management classes, so check government listings as well.You may need to gain some experience as a counselor before you are able to work specifically as an anger management counselor. However, many counseling positions will allow you to do at least some anger management work. Choose positions to apply for that will allow you to do at least some of the work you would eventually like to do full-time.
Remember to tailor your cover letter to each place you apply. It should identify the specific skill set that makes you the perfect match for the position you're applying for.
Don't forget to consider alternatives to these counseling positions. For instance, your experience and training may help you work as a social worker or in a rehabilitation facility. Alternatively, you may do well as a college counselor. Consider all the possibilities when looking for a job.

, Joining professional organizations like NAMA or other national and local counseling associations can you give opportunity to network with other counselors. In turn, those networks can help you make connections and find positions.Also, many professional organizations have jobs lists on their sites, which you can use in your search for a job. Many offer these to insiders and outsiders, though some offer the list to members only.

, Another option is setting off on your own. In this case, you'll be your own boss, but you'll also need to find office space and funding. One option to make this process less scary is to go into business with another counselor or a group of counselors with similar ideas.To find funding, consider applying for a business loan to jump start your business in the beginning. If you're scared about funding it in the beginning, consider renting office space just when you need it. In fact, some buildings will rent to you by the hour, if that's what you prefer.
While it may seem necessary to advertise heavily, counseling is often a referral-based business, meaning it's more important to start leaning on your network to see who can use your services. In turn, those people will likely refer other clients to your services, if they were happy with how things turned out. If you do advertise your services, emphasize that you specialize in anger management.
If you own your own business, you'll do some of the same things every anger management counselor does. That is, you'll provide counseling on anger management, including how to helping the client to figure out what internal and external triggers leads to the anger. You may do all the scheduling on your own or work with an administrative assistant to coordinate scheduling. Because you own your own business, you'll also need to deal with things such as invoicing clients for payment, making payments on your office, hiring cleaning services, and doing your taxes or hiring someone to do them for you.

, Each court system will be a bit different, but many court systems have recommended counseling services. Generally, you need to meet certain criteria to be on the list.For instance, most courts will require that you at least have the anger management certification.
Also, most will require that you be a licensed counselor, or at the very least, be supervised by a licensed counselor.
Contact your local criminal court system to find out more about registering in your area.

Related subjects like computer science will also help develop your interests and skills.Don’t neglect courses in communication, writing, and foreign language. These will give you a good foundation for college-level work, and serve you well when you are a professional toxicologist and have to share your work with peers and the public.
Taking part in extracurricular activities like science fairs, Science Olympiad, or part-time work in a lab is also valuable preparation. Ask a teacher or other mentor for ideas about how you can get involved.;
, Most colleges and universities don’t have degrees in toxicology. Instead, work on a major in a field like biology, pharmacy, chemistry, veterinary sciences, food sciences, or soil sciences. Whatever your major, take as many courses as you can in fields like:Organic chemistry
Physics
Computer science
Statistics
Advanced math (calculus)
Biology
Chemistry
Writing and/or Communication

, While studying for your degree, you should seek out opportunities to deepen your knowledge of toxicology, network with others in the field, and boost your resume. Working with a professor to develop an extensive research project, collaborating with others in a lab, and completing an internship are all great ways to accomplish this.The Society of Technology sponsors summer internships, so check its website for information on opportunities you can apply for.
You can also ask professors for ideas about special projects, or contact labs directly about the possibility of working as an intern.

, Most toxicologists have Ph.Ds, and a smaller number of them have master’s degrees. Very few have only a bachelor’s degree. If you are serious about becoming a toxicologist, you will have more opportunities if you pursue an advanced degree. While earning your Ph.D, you will take coursework, collaborate in labs, and develop a research project in your area of interest, culminating in a written dissertation describing your findings.

Look for graduate programs in toxicology or a related area. Choose a program based on its overall strength, but also its expertise in the area you want to study. For instance, if you are interested in the toxicology of pharmaceutical drugs, make sure that the graduate programs you apply to have labs and/or professors who are also working on this topic.
Learn about the financial support available for graduate programs. Typically, graduate programs are funded by scholarships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, or a combination of these.
Take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) about nine months before applying to graduate programs, and start working on your applications as soon as possible.
It is possible to work in toxicology without an advanced degree, but opportunities will probably be limited to lab assistant positions.

, After getting an advanced degree, many would-be toxicologists first work as a postdoctoral fellow in a research setting, sometimes for a few years. Opportunities are available in academia, government, and industry. While working as a postdoc, you will continue to pursue research or other specialized projects related to your area of expertise, but will gain more experience in supervising others, grant writing, and other areas that will increase yoru skills and job prospects., When you have gained the right combination of education, skills, and experience, you will be ready to find full-time, regular work as a toxicologist. The field is growing, and so opportunities for toxicologists are available in a variety of settings.Some toxicologists work in academia (at colleges and universities), performing research independently or as part of a group, and often teaching courses to undergraduate and/or graduate students.
A wide range of government agencies hire toxicologists to work on topics related to public health, environmental concerns, and forensics.
Some toxicologists work in medical fields, studying the effects of toxins on the human body.
Many toxicologists are hired in the private sector to help industries (ranging from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals) ensure safe products or services, and understand the effects and risks of toxic or potentially toxic materials.

, Toxicology is a demanding field that requires expertise and hard work. Once you enter the field, however, you will find that there are opportunities to do work that fascinates you and makes a real difference in the world. As a toxicologist, you may do things like:Identify toxins in individuals, animals, and the environment.
Plan experiments to learn about the effects of toxins.
Share your knowledge to assist in criminal investigations.
Develop recommendations on how to protect against toxins.
Use highly specialized equipment and computer programs.

, Not everyone who is interested in toxicology has to or wants to work as a toxicologist. Opportunities are available in a variety of related fields, and those with training in toxicology may have job titles including:Forensic scientist
Food technologist
Laboratory technician
Research scientist

, As a practicing toxicologist, you will benefit from communicating with your peers. Professional organizations of toxicologists provide opportunities to network, attend conferences, share research, learn about job opportunities, etc. Depending on your location and interests, you may join societies such as:The Society of ToxicologyThe American College of ToxicologyThe American College of Medical Toxicology.The British Toxicology SocietyThe UK Register of Toxicologists, If you are pursuing research in toxicology, you can share your work with others by publishing in academic journals. This is a great way to establish yourself in the field, and to earn credentials that can help lead to professional opportunities. Journals publishing toxicological research include:Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology
Forensic Toxicology
Toxicological Sciences
Critical Reviews in Toxicology
Journal of Medical Toxicology

, After working for a time as a toxicologist, you can pursue advanced certification to verify your skills and distinguish yourself professionally. Employers and the public will value the work of a certified toxicologist even more. The exact requirements for certification depends on the board offering the certification, but may involve documentation of your work experience, continuing education courses, and the payment of a fee. for You can seek certification from organizations such as:

You will need to thrive under pressure and to enjoy managing crises. You will need the ability to concentrate for long periods of time and to master great amounts of information.If you are curious about becoming a surgeon, you can also look at various texts that discuss a surgeons’ personality and profile. For example, the American College of Surgeons sells a variety of guidance texts online.;
, Even at the high school level, try to see if your school offers a mentorship program that could pair you up with a surgeon for a day or longer. Shadowing a surgeon in their work environment may help you to understand the benefits and negatives of their unique position. Some high schools also offer summer camps tailored to specific professional goals., Make sure to sign up for classes that demonstrate your interest in math and science, such as biology, chemistry, and calculus. You may also want to take communication courses so that you’ll be able to communicate clearly with your patients, peers, and superiors.Taking extra classes at the AP or advanced level is always a good idea, as it will leave you with more flexibility in college.
Try to do your best in all of your classes as your final scores will help to determine which college program you can enroll in. It may also impact the degree of financial aid that you receive.
If you are unable to complete high school on the traditional schedule, you may be able to take the GED (General Education Development) exam instead.

, Medical schools generally don’t require a particular college major in order to apply. However, you will want to cover the basic prerequisites while in college. At minimum, you will need a year of biology, physics, English, and two years of chemistry. This goes for most international programs, too.Try to space out your difficult math and science courses over a period of four years to avoid getting burned out early on. However, you will want to have your major requirements completed by your senior year, to fully prep you for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other admissions test.
Be aware that the expectations facing undergraduate students can vary according to location. In the United Kingdom, a student receives a medical degree upon completing their undergraduate education.

, During your senior year of college in the U.S., you will need to take and do well on the MCAT. Your test scores will then be sent out to your various application schools and this, combined with your overall academic profile, will determine whether or not you are admitted.Be aware that you may also need to provide letters of reference from your college professors as part of your medical school application package.
Go to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website to find out U.S. medical school admissions requirements. If you are applying outside of the U.S., you will want to contact the school and ask for their requirements.Many locations have equivalent testing to the MCAT. For example, in the UK, students are expected to take the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT)., From high school onward, keep an eye out for individuals who can provide with you some guidance and advice from a professional standpoint. Try to stay in touch with those surgeons that you meet and keep them updated regarding what is happening with you. These mentors can provide unique insight into the school process and what your life will be like afterwards.It is a great idea to identify one or more of your professors as potential mentors. Your relationship with them can continue after you complete school. And, they can provide you with much needed letters of reference and connections.

, Medical school usually takes at least four years to complete. You will spend the first few years primarily in the classroom and lab, learning procedures and surgical practices. Then, you will transition to working on your skills under the supervision of an experienced surgeon. You will rotate from specialty to specialty in order to expose you to a full array of options.Obstetrics, pediatrics, and cardiology are just a few of the specialties that you may encounter on your rotation.
Once you graduate, you will be awarded with a degree. In the U.S., you will receive either a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.).

, While you are in medical school, you will begin evaluating certain residency programs that have an emphasis on your desired area of specialty. You will then apply for this program and spend somewhere between three to seven years completing it. You will essentially serve as a surgeon under supervision.Residency programs usually focus on a particular area of medicine, such as urology or critical care. This is the time where you will truly hone your skills in a more specific way.
As another example, in the United Kingdom you move into a phase called “Foundation Training” after receiving your initial medical degree. During this two-year period, you work with patients and begin to explore a field of specialty.

, When you’ve finished your residency, you will have the option to continue training for up to three years as part of a fellowship. This fellowship provides you with the time to focus even more closely on a surgical subspecialty, like cardiothoracic measures. Many fellowships will also provide with financial and academic support for publishing.It is always a good idea to talk with a fellowship program about where their graduates are working now. This will give you a better idea of your career options post-fellowship., Licensing very much varies depending on your particular location. You will want to follow the guidance of your residency or fellowship program regarding the licenses that you will need to apply for. In most scenarios, you will need to pass certain exams in front of a medical board. For example, in the U.S. states, it is necessary to take an exam, such as the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)., As you move through the education process, try to find ways to publish your unique insights in trade journals or hospital publications. Every piece that you publish provides another valuable line on your resume and it also reflects your transition from student to surgeon., Before you decide to move into a specialty, or even pursue a fellowship, some people would recommend taking a few years out to serve as a general practitioner. This will allow you to hone your practical skills. It will also give you more time to determine an exact specialty, if you remain uncertain.After you’ve built up a practice, you can often take a leave of absence to pursue additional fellowships or to develop your skills as needed.
In some locations, general practice exposure is not optional, such is the case in the United Kingdom. In the UK, each doctor is required to spend at least three years working in general practice, culminating with a Specialty Certificate Examination (SCE).

, There are a wide array of fields that you can choose from within a surgical area. If you are a cardiac surgeon, then you work on the heart and the cardiovascular system. If you are an orthopedic surgeon, then you work on musculoskeletal issues. As you move through your residency, try to explore as many options before narrowing down a focus field.This process also takes place in the United Kingdom and is called Core Medical Training or Acute Care Common Stem and lasts for approximately two years. During this time, you will also need to pass the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) exam. You then move into four to six years of additional specialty training., Within your surgical field, you will want to become proficient in a certain type of surgery. This could be open surgery, where you make an incision and work through that opening. Or, you could become proficient in using an ultrasonic scalpel or electrosurgery. Many of these skill sets require additional training on particular machines., After you’ve completed your education and settled into work life, make sure to stay abreast regarding any advances in your surgical field and type. Read the medical journals in your area. Attend conferences as often as you can. Talk with other surgeons about what interests them.Some areas regulate this process more closely than others. In the UK, a doctor is required to a certain number of continuing development hours per year in order to stay licensed.

, If you’ve decided to move away from a solo surgical practice, be aware that there are other job opportunities available to you. For example, you could take on a position at a university as a professor. You could become a full-time researcher. You could head into politics as a lobbyist or policymaker."

, ASEP stands for the American Society of Exercise Physiologists. Any strong undergraduate (or graduate) programs in exercise physiology will be accredited by ASEP. Such accreditation attached to your degree will make it much easier for you to find work after you finish school., Exercise physiologists can be employed in hospitals, fitness centres, physical therapy clinics, cardiac rehabilitation facilities, and other places. Where you hope to work will determine what level of education you need, as well as which programs will be a good fit for you., In general, a master's degree in exercise physiology is required for most professions. However, you may only require an undergraduate degree (a BS in physical education, exercise science, or health science) to work for a community organization or at the community level. If you hope to be a researcher or work at a university, you will need a PhDDetermining what level of education you ultimately hope to seek will enable you to choose the right program.
Some programs will be designed to lead into graduate programs, while others will be designed for you to head into the workforce.

, Once you have been accepted to a program, you will need to spend roughly four years completing it. As an exercise physiology student, you will learn about science and exercise, covering topics like athletic training, exercise science, physiology, kinesiology, nutrition, and others. You will also do some clinical training, giving you hands-on knowledge and experience.

Decide if you would like to further your education.,
Consider an MS. An MS (or Master of Science) degree in Exercise Physiology can open you to more career opportunities.,
Consider a PhD.,
Look for a program that offers assistantships.",How to Become an Accredited Exercise Physiologist2," By the time you are in your fourth year of your undergraduate degree, you should be able to determine whether this is truly the right field for you. If you plan to move directly into a graduate program, you will want to start researching programs near the beginning of your final undergraduate year. Applications will usually be due near the beginning of the Spring semester (around January through March) of your final undergraduate year.


Some programs may require you to take the GRE before applying. (This is similar to the SAT or ACT, but for graduate school.)

, Some programs offer what’s known as a “fifth year Master’s,” meaning that after you complete your undergraduate degree (BS), you simply stay on for one more year to earn your MS. If your undergraduate university does not offer such an option, begin looking for ASEP accredited MS programs that suit your needs.When you find the right program, apply right away,
Once you are accepted, spend 1-3 years completing your degree.
Depending on your program, you may need to write a research report or thesis to finish.

, A PhD in exercise physiology (kinesiology) will be a research-heavy program. Like an MS program, you will continue to study the science of exercise and nutrition. However, as a PhD student, you will be expected to conduct research and contribute new knowledge to the field. In order to complete your degree, you will need to research and write a doctoral dissertation. If you know you would like to complete a Ph.D., look for an MS program that will prepare you for a Ph.D., or better yet, an MS program that leads directly into a PhD program.Begin applying to PhD programs during your final year of your MS.
Once you are accepted, spent 3-5 years (or more) pursuing your PhD.
Make sure that any program you choose is ASEP certified.

, Many MS and PhD programs in exercise physiology will offer assistantships to students. This means that graduate students may complete teaching, research, or other types of work in exchange for a tuition waver. Beyond simply making graduate school more affordable for students, this hands-on professional training is excellent for students of exercise physiology at any level."

Get a high school diploma.,
Undertake post-secondary education in nursing.,
Make sure your school is accredited.,
Get some experience in working in surgery.,
Get licensed.,
Find a job as a nurse.",How to Become a Surgical Nurse1," Admission into a school of nursing requires a high school diploma or, alternately, passing the General Education Development (GED) test.If you want to be a nurse, pay attention to your performance, skill, and interest in courses like biology, physiology, and chemistry throughout high school. The knowledge from these courses will be important in your post-secondary education.


The foundation of nursing is science. If you don’t like science but are interested in nursing in high school you should talk with your school counselor about arranging a day or two to shadow a nurse.
Don't get discouraged if these subjects don't come easily to you. Consider hiring a private tutor to help you in your math and science courses in order to improve and develop effective study and learning strategies.;
, There are three ways to become a registered nurse. Whatever path you choose, the coursework involved will include physiology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and anatomy.Bachelor's degree in nursing (BSN). This level of education is like a bachelor’s program in all other fields. It is awarded by a college or university and usually takes four years to complete. Class offerings are more diverse than other settings and include community health, pharmacology, health assessment, microbiology, human development and clinical practice. A BSN qualifies you for a higher pay grade and a wider variety of certifications and promotions on the job.This is the preferred level of education for new hires at most hospitals.Associate's degree in nursing (ADN). This is the most common way to obtain a registered nursing license and involves a two-year program at a community or junior college. Many students transition to BSN programs after having completed an ASN and holding an entry-level nursing position. In these cases, nurses are able get further education using an employer's tuition assistance program; they're also able to work and earn an income while getting the next level of education.Diploma from an accredited nursing program. You can also be eligible for licensure by completing a vocational nursing program. These accredited programs are often associated with a hospital and vary in length, though they are typically up to three years long. In this program, classroom learning, clinical practice, and on-the-job training are combined. This education path is on the decline since the National Advisory Council on Nursing Education and Practice recommends that at least 66% of the workforce hold a BSN in nursing or higher., The national accreditation agency for nursing schools is the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. This agency ensures the quality and integrity of bachelor, graduate, and residency programs in nursing. Accreditation is voluntary but ensures that colleges and schools providing nursing education are operating at the same professional level and educating future nurses in a manner which ensures that they can provide effective and standardized care., During your nursing program, you will do a rotation in surgery for a brief time. This is an ideal time to discover whether this is an area you'd like to work in in the future.


If this is an area that interests you, speak with your clinical instructor about getting more time to observe in the operating room.

, Registered nurses in the United States must have a nursing license. Take the National Council Licensure Examination - Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) once you have graduated from your accredited program and thus have completed the appropriate education requirements. This test is the nationally recognized licensing exam for registered nurses.Prerequisites to and fees for the exam may differ between states. Check with the requirements for your state, or for the state you plan on practicing in.
Most states have reciprocation agreements, meaning that if you pass your exam in one state, you’ll be able to apply for and receive a license in any other state without retaking the test as long as your license is free from any encumbrances. In other words, if there isn’t anything that would disqualify the state from issuing a license, such as stealing drugs or felony conviction.

, There are more than two million nurses in the United States, making the position the largest in the healthcare field. There are a variety of settings in which a nurse can work, including hospitals, physician's offices, elderly care homes, prisons, college campuses and schools.


Nurses with a bachelor's degree (BSN) have better employment prospects than those who do not.
Most surgical units will only hire nurses who have had one year of experience in other areas of the hospital. Experience working in the recovery room or in the operating room will help you determine if you want to pursue this career path.

Apply for jobs.",How to Become a School Nurse," Many states may require a school nurse to be a registered nurse who holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), but others may have different requirements. The National Association of School Nurses (NASN) can help you determine the requirements in your state. The requirements vary, but may require a school nurse certification., Your state's nursing board should have a list of approved nursing programs from which to choose.You may also want to check with the NASN to see if any of the programs in your area offer any programs that cater to those seeking to become school nurses. The NASN does have information that should help.In general, school nurse is not a separate degree. You will complete your BSN as a four-year degree, then pass the necessary licensure examinations. School nursing can then be learned via internship, mentorship, or getting hired at your first job.

, The NASN recommends school nurses hold a BSN, though some states may require a higher degree than this. Complete the requirements of the program, and graduate with your BSN.Meet with your advisor to be sure you are meeting the requirements of your program in a timely manner so that you can graduate as soon as possible.
Completing the BSN is a rigorous process; there is much to do during this four-year time span. Make sure you receive help in areas where studies are weak. It is recommended by many colleges to maintain at least a 3.0 average throughout coursework.

, Once you graduate with your BSN, take the NCLEX-RN examination, which is a national test that you must take to be licensed as an RN. You must pass this test to be licensed and work as an RN in your state.The preparation of NCLEX examination can be very daunting. Sign up for preparatory course which breaks down test, gives example questions and outlines the percentage of each areas tested. In addition, you can purchase certification exam preparation books to help guide your studies.
Try taking practice tests online. Your can give you insight into which subjects require more of your attention and if you need to work on your time management or other test-taking skills.

, Passing the NBCSN test gives you an advantage when starting a school nurse career. Most states do not require this exam, but it shows future employers that you have mastered the most recent methods for nursing. The examination is administered by the NASN and the National Board for Certification of School Nurses (NBCSN).Some certification renewals can be waived if you maintain log of required continuing education credits.

, The NBCSN certification lasts for five years, after which it must be renewed by way of recertification. To renew, you must have a current RN license and be employed as a school nurse with 2,000 hours of clinical practice in the past five years. 750 of the clinical hours must be within the most recent three years. A fee of $240.00 is also required.Work experience and continuing education is usually enough to maintain certification.
RN licenses also require renewal. Be aware that RN license requirements vary from state to state. Know your specific state requirements to earn and renew your license.

, Use your RN license to work in the acute care field before applying for a school nurse position. Some employers will require a minimum of two years of this type of experience.This will allow you to learn while on the job, as well as have a head start when you do apply.


Often it is said the learning begins after graduation and passing licensure. Two years in an acute care setting teaches many skills that can not be learned in a classroom setting and can only be experienced on the job.

, Most degree programs require internships before graduation, as this kind of experience provides you with the basic information that you will use in the field. Be sure you intern in a school nurse setting. RNs seeking to go into school nursing specifically may find that the internship in the field is required in their state., School nurses sometimes take leave for various reasons, and in such circumstances a substitute is needed. This is a great way to gain experience as a school nurse. Substituting also allows you to see the policies and procedures of school nursing., Your resume is how you introduce yourself and your skills to potential employers. You want to include your name and address, as well as your education, licenses, and certifications. You may want to include an objective statement that outlines your career goal of finding a school nurse position as well., Even community colleges and universities typically have school nurses, so consider whether you would like to work with young adults instead of children — and keep in mind that this may not be the position for you if you're not very fond of children or teens. The duties of a school nurse go beyond treatment — you may be responsible for educating students on health issues, for instance. Because counseling may also be a part of the job,you may want to consider what types of counseling you may need to offer in elementary school versus high school, for instance.

, You can apply for jobs at local schools, even if they do not currently have an opening for a school nurse. They can keep your resume on file for the future. A great place to look for jobs is on the NASN website. They have a listing of job opportunities that may help you."

Work as a registered nurse.,
Get perioperative nursing training.,
Pass the Certified Nurse Operating Room Exam (CNOR).,
Determine which nursing role in surgery you would like to have.,
Consider specializing in a specific surgical field.",How to Become a Surgical Nurse2," As an RN, you can work in the surgical area after graduating and getting your nursing license; however, specialization and certification in surgical nursing, also known as perioperative nursing, will enable you to work in specialized roles and earn more money. Most specialized educational programs, however, require a minimum amount of clinical experience as an RN before you can enroll in the program. These requirements vary upon the area in which you live. On average, the required length of time is one to two years.Most programs also require that 2,000 hours, or one year, of this time be served in an acute care setting. This is to give you an idea of the amount of stress that may be involved in being a surgical nurse.

, Additional training to become a surgical nurse typically involves a two-year program in which you focus solely on the skills and professional knowledge necessary to work within the operating room. Upon completion of this program, you will have a recognized specialty in surgery-related care.Alternatively, you can also pursue a Master's Degree. A Master’s program can take between 18 months and three years depending upon if you had prior experience and are enrolled full-time or part-time. Master's programs blend theory, research, and practice and allow the surgical nurse to take a certification examination.

, In order to obtain specialized roles in the operating room and receive a higher pay scale, surgical nurses are often required to pass a certification examination. An initial certification, the CNOR is offered by the Competency and Credentialing Institute for perioperative RNs. This certification documents the validity of a nurse’s standard of practice in caring for patients before, during and after surgery. Requirement include:An unrestricted RN license
Current full or part-time employment in perioperative nursing, education, administration or research
Completed two years and 2,400 hours of experience in perioperative nursing with at least 1,200 hours in the operating room.
Re-certification is required every five years.

, Inside the operating room, surgical nurses play one of four different roles. Each role requires specialized knowledge and abilities which the nurse brings to the team of professionals. Note that in some cases additional education and certification may be desirable, such as for a Registered Nurse First Assistant.Scrub Nurse. An RN who is sterile and may prepare the operating room prior to surgery, assess the patients when they arrive, and help prepare the patient for the surgical procedure. Scrub nurses will pass instruments to the surgeon during the procedure and help monitor the patient.

Circulating Nurses. An RN who ensures that all paperwork is completed, documents the surgical procedure, replenishes surgical supplies, verifies instrument count after the procedure is completed, and completes the charting of the surgery.

Registered Nurse First Assistant. An RN who directly assists during the operation. The exact responsibilities will vary with the type of surgery and the surgeon’s preference. Generally, the role includes controlling bleeding, suturing the incision, and intervening during complications. Prior to surgery these nurses will provide pre-operative instructions, answer questions, and following surgery, will assess patients for recovery and provide discharge instructions.

PACU (Post Anesthesia Care Unit) Nurse. An RN who cares for patients after surgical procedures and anesthesia.

, After your initial certification, you can also specialize in specific types of surgical fields, such as Certified Plastic Surgical Nurse, Adult Cardiac Surgery Subspecialty Certification, Certified Bariatric Nurse as well as Registered Nurse First Assistant, mentioned above. These specializations typically require a valid RN license, several years of experience in the field, additional educational training, and certification.The specific requirements of each specialization may vary, so it's best you consult a trusted resource, such as the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses, which provides a number of resources on nursing education and clinical practice, and has local chapters located throughout the United States.

Understand the nursing profession.,
Determine if the general responsibilities of nursing interest you.,
Consider the specific field of surgical nursing.,
Know the general skills and qualities involved in nursing.",How to Become a Surgical Nurse3," According to the American Nurses Association, nursing today is designed for the protection, promotion and optimization of health and the prevention of illness and injury. Nurses are advocates in the care of individuals, families and communities.The standardized education of today’s registered nurses, in contrast to the past, reflects the high expectations communities and physicians have on the men and women who fill these roles. In recent years, the employment of nurses has grown and will continue to grow in part because of the aging of the baby boomer population and the associated growing rate of chronic conditions like diabetes.


The nursing profession is not just for women; there are over a hundred thousand registered male nurses working in the US., The foundation of all nursing practice is based in human anatomy and physiology. The chief mission of the nursing field is to protect, promote and optimize health. Key responsibilities for nurses include:Performing physical assessments and taking medical and family histories by interviewing patients on the day of surgery
Providing counseling and education about health promotion and injury protection
Administering medication and providing wound care
Coordinating care and collaborating with other professionals including doctors, therapists and dietitians
Directing and supervising care and providing education to patients and family, which enable patients to be discharged sooner

, Surgical nurses perform specific tasks in the operating room that both assist the surgeon and evaluate the current level of care. Surgical nurses are faced with specific challenges and responsibilities, which include:Doing pre-operative assessments of the patient and giving patients pre-op instructions
Ensuring the right medications are ordered on the day of surgery, the right blood tests were performed and that all allergies were noted on the chart
Working under the supervision of the surgeon but also able to function independently in the OR
Working in a hospital. As a surgical nurse, you will likely end up working in a hospital with a surgical ward and emergency care and trauma center. You may also work in intensive care units and recovery rooms., Beyond having a breadth of knowledge in medicine (and being someone who does not get squeamish easily!), a surgical nurse must also be skilled in other areas. In this sense, nursing is like any other profession in that there are specific individual qualities that make the job easier and a more natural fit for some people. It's important to determine whether your personality and abilities can accommodate the various responsibilities and tasks that come with being a nurse. Key qualities include:Interpersonal and communication skills. Being a nurse requires working with people everyday—doctors, other nurses, technicians, patients, caregivers, and others. To communicate information and do their jobs effectively and clearly, nurses need strong interpersonal skills, patience, and the ability to break down complex information into something that is accessible for ordinary people (i.e., non-specialists).

Compassion. Caring and empathy are valuable when taking care of individuals who are in sick or injured. Remember that patients may be scared or in pain and need to be comforted, reassured, and motivated to fight through their illnesses.

Critical thinking. Registered nurses must be able to assess changes in the health status of their patients and make a quick referrals.

Detail-oriented and organized. Nurses often work with multiple patients and healthcare professional at a time and so they need to be able to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. In addition, attention to detail is key; one small mistake in the operating room can have a big impact on a patient’s condition and life.

Stamina. Nurses are often required to perform physical tasks, such as lifting patients, and also work long shifts of between eight and 12 hours, which may include night shifts.

Avoid adding salt when cooking rice or pasta.",How to Decrease Sodium Levels1," While pre-packaged or frozen meats, fruits, and vegetables often contain a lot of sodium, fresh items will contain much less. Shop for fresh produce, or opt to buy frozen fruits and vegetables that are labeled ""flash frozen"", meaning that they will not contain seasonings or preservatives. Buy fresh cuts of meat and stay away from processed meats like bacon or ham., When cooking, choose spices and garnishes that do not contain salt. For instance, opt for fresh garlic or garlic powder over garlic salt. Fresh herbs (e.g. rosemary, oregano) can add a lot of flavor to your dishes, as well as ingredients like lemon, vinegar, or onion., While foods like pasta and rice can often use a flavor infusion, you should opt to cook them plain to reduce your sodium levels. Prepare these foods as usual, skipping the step where you salt the water before boiling it. It is likely that you will be adding more dynamically flavored foods to these bland items, so extra salt isn't necessary. "

Buy low sodium condiments.,
Drain and rinse canned vegetables and legumes.,
Compare the sodium content between brands.,
Mix salted and unsalted foods.",How to Decrease Sodium Levels2," Condiments like ketchup, soy sauce, and salad dressing can have very high levels of sodium. Read nutrition labels to see the sodium content before buying them. Opt for versions of these products that are ""low sodium or ""reduced sodium""., Canned foods like beans and vegetables contain a large amount of sodium. Pour the contents of the can into a strainer to drain the liquid and rinse these canned side dishes before cooking them. Taking the time to wash the vegetables and legumes will cut the salt by up to 40%., If you are shopping for a particular item, read the nutritional information for various brands. Compare sodium levels and opt for the product with the lowest salt content. Make it a habit to do this whenever you are out grocery shopping., If you do not find the low sodium version of your favorite foods palatable, try mixing the salted and unsalted versions to lower the overall sodium content. For instance, purchase a low sodium soup and mix it with the regular, full-salt version. This combination will dilute the salt, and help you ease into a lowed sodium diet more comfortably."

Request low sodium items.,
Research restaurants beforehand.,
Ask if you can get sauce or dressings on the side.",How to Decrease Sodium Levels3," When dining at a restaurant, ask your server if there are any menu items that do not contain extra salt. If there aren't, ask if an item can be prepared specially without additional salt. While this is unlikely to be an option at fast food restaurants where food is mostly pre-packaged, a local restaurant may be better equipped to comply with your request.E.g. The fish of the day, which will not be pre-seasoned or cooked, might be an easy meal for a cook to prepare for you without salt.

, Before dining out, research different restaurant options for more information. Some well-established restaurant chains publish the nutritional information for their food items online. Restaurants taking this initiative are more likely to offer healthy options to improve the healthiness of their overall menu., Sauces and salad dressings are often heavy in sodium, making an otherwise safe meal an unhealthy choice. Ask for them on the side, where you can use them sparingly for dipping. If possible, request a simple oil and vinegar garnish for your salad."

, You may think that is impossible, because you love bread, but there are alternatives out there that don't have wheat and gluten in them and while you may not want to eat them, you will feel much better for it.

, It is actually in most dairy products, to include ice cream, sour cream, 'natural' products, and unfortunately, is quite often in your health food products. It is used for thickening, to emulsify the ingredients, or to help prevent ice crystals from forming.It is also in some foods, so always check for it., EDTA, otherwise known as Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, has a number of purposes. One of these is used for removing heavy metals (like mercury poisoning) from the body.It is also found in a lot of products, like mayonnaise and salad dressings. Again, watch for it everywhere.

Keep a food journal.,
Write a list of your favorite junk foods.,
Manage stress and emotions.,
Change your routine.,
Make healthy swaps.,
Write up a meal plan.,
Go grocery shopping regularly.,
Prepare and cook healthy meals.,
Prepare healthy snacks.,
Pick better options at restaurants.,
Eat favorite foods in moderation.",How to Cut Down on Junk Food," Recording what you eat for a few days can give you some insight into why you're choosing junk foods over more healthy, whole foods.Jot down notes about when you're eating, what you're eating and why. Consider the reasons why you incorporate junk food into your daily meals like:


Do you stop for a quick bite at a fast food place as you run through your day because it is convenient?
Do you choose to grab your afternoon snack from a vending machine because you didn't pack a healthy snack option?
Are you so pressed for time after a long day of work that a frozen dinner is all that you can manage?;
, If you can identify your top favorite junk foods, this will help prepare you to minimize them in your diet. Once you know what you crave, you can better manage those cravings and plan for a healthy swap.


Go through your kitchen and remove most of those favorite foods. If you don't have those foods at home, you're less likely to eat them.Instead, keep only a few favorite foods on hand and stock your home with healthy foods and snacks.
Also minimize the junk foods that you keep at work.

, Many times a junk food craving hits when you're feeling down, tired, depressed, angry, or stressed. It's a normal response to crave comfort foods after being upset or stressed. Dealing with these emotions or stress without food can help improve your health and cut out some of the junk food you eat.


Journaling can help you see what emotions trigger you to crave certain foods.To find out, ask yourself: Are you bored? Has some emotional event occurred that has caused you to reach for junk foods? Has it been an unusually stressful day? Are you eating just junk food just out of habit or socially?
If you feel like you can indulge with moderation, have a serving of your favorite junk food. But take note of why you might be craving that food item so you can learn for the future.
Also, try to find other activities to help relax, calm or soothe you. Try: reading a good book or magazine, taking a stroll outside, listening to your favorite tunes, or playing a fun board game.

, Many times, we stop to get our favorite snack or meal out of habit. You take a quick work break and head to the vending machine for an afternoon pick me up or you work late and stop by a fast food restaurant for a quick meal. Changing these routines may help you change what you eat as well.


Think about when you typically get your junk food. Is there another activity that you can do instead? For example, if you need a little break from work in the afternoon, instead of heading to the vending machine, go outside for a quick walk.

, If your favorite junk food isn't the healthiest, try making a healthy substitution that can curb your cravings.


For example, if you crave sweets, try having fruit with vanilla yogurt, 1 ounce of dark chocolate, or some sugar-free pudding.
If you crave something salty, try raw vegetables and hummus, a hard boiled egg with a sprinkling of salt, or celery sticks with peanut butter.

, If you want to overhaul your diet and cut down on the amount of junk food you consume each day, writing up a meal plan can help you design your new diet (without the junk food!).Write down notes or ideas for one week of meals. Include your breakfast, lunches, dinners and all snacks. Ideally, meals should full you up so you don't need to smack, or, Don't have three big, set meals, have six smallest dishes throughout the day.
Be realistic with your meal plan. Preparing a home-cooked meal every day might not work for you. It's OK to include a few meals that are eaten out or on-the-go or where you rely on processed foods.
Also jot down notes on which meals you might want to prepare and cook in advance. For example, if you are busy in the evenings, you might want to have dinner ready to go when you get home.
Prepare meals ahead of time on the weekend and freeze them. That way they are ready to go or place in a crock pot.

, One of the best ways to help you cut down on junk food is to stock your home with healthier, less processed foods. If there aren't any junk food snacks at home, you're less likely to indulge in those foods.Farmers markets offer a good selection of fresh produce in season and locally grown.
Try to stick to the perimeter of the grocery store. Most of the foods on the outside are more whole, unprocessed foods like: fruits, vegetables, seafood, butcher/deli meats, dairy and eggs.
Stay out of the central aisles that contain your favorite junk food snacks. Go for the aisles that contain healthier processed foods like: canned beans and vegetables, canned tuna, nuts and whole grains.
Avoid shopping when hungry. When we are hungry, almost everything looks appealing to us. Foods that we would generally be able to avoid become much more tempting and harder to walk away from when we’re hungry.
Make a shopping list and carry it with you to the store. Avoid veering from what is on the list.

, Cooking your meals at home allows you to control exactly what goes into your foods. You can control the amount of added fat, sugar or salt that's contained in your meal.


You can also be sure to add a variety of foods from each food group to help make sure you're consuming a well-balanced diet. Aim to include foods from each food group most days: grains, protein, fruits, vegetables and dairy. This will help ensure you're meeting all your daily nutrient goals.Review cookbooks, cooking magazines or websites to find new recipes that look good to you and may motivate or excite you about cooking at home.
If you noted in your meal plan that you'll need some meals ready-to-go, cook those on the weekends or in your free time. If you are planning on consuming them within a week, you can store them in the refrigerator. If you want to make a large quantity or need the food to last longer than a week, store individual portions in a freezer-safe container and freeze until desired.

, Having healthy snacks on-hand can help keep you away from the vending machine and other junk food.Pre-pack snacks to bring them with you to work and keep a stock of healthy items at home as well.


To help make snacks more satisfying, include lean protein, a high fiber food, and some healthy fats.Examples include: greek yogurt with fruit and nuts; peanut butter and apple slices; a homemade ""protein pack"" with nuts, cheese and dried fruit; or hummus with whole grain crackers and raw carrots.
If you can, stock your office refrigerator or desk with healthy snack items. At your desk you can keep: individual packages of nuts, shelf stable fruit (like apples), whole grain cracker packs, individual packets of peanut butter or protein bars. If you have access to a refrigerator, you can keep: individual cheese sticks, yogurts, or hummus.

, Many times you just can't pass on eating out or grabbing something a little more processed when you're busy. Although the occasional indulgence in your favorite junk food is OK, be prepared to pick a better or healthier option if stopping for a quick meal or snack is a common occurrence.


Many restaurants, especially chain restaurants, offer nutrition information that you can look up online.
Junk foods or processed foods are typically higher in calories, higher in fat content and may contain a lot of sodium.Avoid these items and try to choose foods that have a fruit, vegetable and lean protein.
If you're passing through a fast food restaurant, try ordering a salad (dressing on the side), grilled chicken sandwich or nuggets, soup or fruit and yogurt parfait.
If you're stopping by a convenience store, pick up a low-fat cheese stick, fruit cup, protein bar or hard boiled eggs.
In general, try to pick foods that are not: fried or deep fried, battered, or have added sugars.

, Part of a normal eating pattern and normal eating behavior is including favorite foods. Again, eliminating them completely is not necessary and may not be realistic for you. Include a small serving of your favorite foods in moderation.


You'll need to decide what moderation is for you. It might be getting dessert twice a week or going out for happy hour with friends once a week. Decide what is healthy and reasonable for you.
Be aware that multiple indulgences can add up. If you're including a variety of indulgences each week, that could lead to weight gain.
Avoid extreme eating behaviors. Cutting down on how much junk food you consume is a great move to help improve your overall health. But you don't necessarily need to cut out your favorite foods completely. Extreme behaviors could cause you to overeat down the road."

Determine resting metabolic rate.,
Determine your activity level.",How to Create a Meal Plan for Swimmers1," This is your daily calorie requirement without taking added activity into consideration. Up to 75 percent of calories burned in a day are burned due to normal activities, such as sitting and breathing. The other 25 percent are available for extra physical activities. In order to ensure you have enough extra calories, you need to determine a few things first.


Change weight in lbs to weight in kg. This is done by dividing weight in lbs by 2.2.
Convert height from feet to inches. This is done by multiplying height in feet by 12 and then adding the remaining inches to the answer. For example, if you are 5 foot 6 inches (15.2 cm) you would multiply 5 by 12 to get 60 inches (152.4 cm). Then you would add the remaining 6 inches (15.2 cm) of your height to answer to show your height is 66 inches (167.6 cm).
Convert height from inches to cm. This is done by multiplying your height in inches by 2.54.
Calculate resting metabolic rate. If you are a women, use this equation: (9.99 x weight (kg)) + (6.25 x height (cm)) – (4.92 x age) – 161 = RMR. If you are a man, use this equation: (9.99 x weight (kg)) + (6.25 x height (cm)) – (4.92 x age) + 5 = RMR.;
,


If you swim for 1 hour, then you would be considered active and need to add at least 600 to 800 calories to your normal calorie consumption.
If you swim for less than an hour, you would be considered moderately active and need to add at least 200 to 400 calories to your normal calorie consumption.
If you swim and do other strenuous exercise or lead a very active life, you need to consider yourself active to ensure you take in enough calories.
Add activity calories to resting metabolic rate to get daily energy requirements.
Be sure to increase calories to match workout needs. If you begin training for a race, you may need to increase calorie consumption to match increased activity level.

Eliminate junk food from your diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid alcohol and caffeine.,
Increase fiber intake.",How to Detox Your Diet1," Cut out foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat. These include cookies, chips, candy, and processed meats. You may need to wean yourself off these slowly. Start by restricting how many sodas, snacks, and desserts you take in a week before eliminating them completely from your diet.


Don’t be fooled by labels like “fat-free,” “reduced fat,” or “sugar free.” Usually, in order to replace these missing components, companies fill these foods with other unhealthy additives. Fat-free foods often have more sugar than full fat foods! ;
, Swap sodas and sugary juices for water. Water flushes toxins out of your body via the kidney and bladder, regulates your body temperature, and hydrates your skin. It is essential for most bodily processes. Thus water is an essential part of any detox.


When you’re hungry, try drinking a glass of water. It can help suppress hunger. If you’re still hungry, then have a snack.

, Alcohol and caffeine are antidiuretics, which means that they dehydrate your body. Hydration is key to a successful detox. You should put aside your nighttime glass of wine or morning coffee until the detox is over. If you want something other than water, try non-caffeinated tea, such as green or herbal tea.

, Fiber keeps you full longer (so you don’t snack), and high-fiber diets can reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fruits and vegetables are a key source of fiber. Rely on natural sources of fiber instead of processed fiber bars that may be full of sugar.

"
"
Choose a variety of foods.,
Do not skip breakfast.,
Eat snacks.",How to Create a Meal Plan for Swimmers2," You will need every food group to maintain optimal health while swimming and this includes fats and oils. Meals should contain fruit, vegetable, protein and grain. The meals need to be filling without causing you to be overfull.

, Since you are swimming regularly, your metabolism will increase. This increase in metabolism is for the whole day, not just during and after the workout. It is because of this that eating breakfast is very important. You will need the calories to maintain weight and make it through the day without feeling sluggish or “foggy.”


Include a protein, fruit or vegetable, grain and dairy in breakfast. It should be somewhere between 400 and 800 calories.

, In order to hit calorie amount needed and maintain a healthy diet, snacks are vital. Without the snacks your body may become overtired because of lack of fuel.


The snack can be a protein, fruit or vegetable and should include a grain. The grain, fruit and vegetable helps reload the carbohydrates you have burned and protein will sustain energy.
Go light on high fiber snacks. Fiber will cause bloating if consumed to excess and will interrupt a workout. It is best to start light on fiber and see what works best for you. If you don’t notice issues, then you can increase the amount of fiber. Fiber will be found mainly in whole fruits and vegetables.
An after-workout snack should be eaten within an hour and should consist of protein and carbohydrates to help muscles rebuild. You will need 2 to 7 oz. of protein a day while swimming, the more calories you are consuming, the more protein you will need.

"
"
Plan meals around workouts.,
Eat right on race day.,
Finished.

",How to Create a Meal Plan for Swimmers3,"


Eat larger meals at least an hour before swimming and at least an hour after swimming.
Eat light before swimming, but make sure you eat something to have the fuel for the workout. You should eat less protein and fat before the swim because it takes longer to digest and won’t be able to be used as fuel. Carbohydrates are very important before the workout.
Eat a snack within an hour after swimming to rebuild muscles.
Wait at least an hour after the swim to eat a larger meal. This will give your body time to rest after the activity and let digestion return to normal. Immediately after a workout, you digest food slower and so eating a heavy meal can cause you to feel overly full.

,


Eat more protein. This will help stabilize blood sugar if you need to go longer between meals.
Eat breakfast. Make it a light breakfast if the race is in the morning and a heavy breakfast if the race is in the afternoon.
Bring plenty of high carbohydrate snacks. This can be fruits, fruit juice, vegetables and crackers. You will need these on hand for breaks to boost energy quickly.
Drink plenty of water. You should consume enough water so that you don’t feel thirsty and your pee is clear. Water is important because it keeps you hydrated and keeps muscle cramps and headaches away.

"
Fast at night.,
Eat only rice.,
Go vegan.,
Reintroduce healthy foods.",How to Detox Your Diet2," Fasting for 12 hours or more at nighttime can boost weight regulation, increase energy, and improve sleep. Don't eat anything after 8 PM and try not to eat until 8 AM the next morning.


If you have health problems, exercise frequently, or are underweight, you should not fast. If you are dizzy, nauseous, or lightheaded, stop the fast immediately.
Some may advise that you fast for a full day before you start your detox, consuming only water or juice, but there are dangers associated with full, extended fasting, such as a slower metabolism and nutrient deficiency. . If you plan to fast for longer than a day, consult a licensed dietitian or doctor to supervise your cleanse.

, In this cleanse, you eat cooked rice for a few days. Brown rice is ideal because it is high in fiber, and it will keep you full, making the cleanse easier on your body. After a few days, introduce plain vegetables and broth into your diet. .


If you have never done a detox cleanse before, start small. Only follow this cleanse for two to three days before stopping. If you are experiencing discomfort or feel faint, do not continue. Resume your normal diet and consult a doctor for a nutritional plan tailored to your needs.

, If you want more variety in your diet than just rice, you can try a short-term vegan cleanse instead. For a few days, only eat plant-based products. This means cutting out all meat, dairy, and eggs. Focus on vegetables, especially green vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and kale. Instead of butter, you can cook your foods in healthy oils, such as olive, canola, sesame, and coconut oil. If you need a snack, try nuts or blend chia seeds into a smoothie. If you feel the need to snack, try eating a handful of nuts or some raw vegetables.

, After a few days of a restricted diet, you can begin to start eating other foods again. Start by eating easily digestible foods like broth, yogurt, and vegetable puree soups. Slowly introduce other dairy, meat, and eggs. When possible, keep your food organic and non-processed. Your diet should now consist of healthy whole grains, vegetables, and lean meats with limited consumption of refined sugars.


While you can reintroduce meat into your diet, you should only eat lean meats that have not been processed. Limit your meat consumption, especially red meats like beef.
You should be reintroducing foods by the end of the week of detox. Do not go on a restricted diet for longer than seven days. If you feel dizzy, faint, or nauseous, do not continue the restricted diet.

"
"
Choose organic when eating the whole fruit or vegetable.,
Know which products have the highest risk.,
Choose whole grains over refined, processed grains.,
Find sources of plant-based protein.,
Read nutrition labels.",How to Detox Your Diet3," Pesticides remain on the surface of a vegetable or fruit. If you are eating the whole of a fruit—as you would with a strawberry or grapes— find organic options. If the fruit has a thick outer peel that you remove before eating—such as with bananas, peaches, and pineapples— you can save your money and buy conventional fruit. Regardless of whether you buy organic or not, wash your fruits and vegetables before eating.

, Strawberries, apples, nectarines, peaches, and celery are the most pesticide-heavy of agricultural products. Limit your consumption of these products or choose organic options.

, Whole grains contain more fiber and nutrients, as opposed to the empty carbs found in processed grains like white bread. Whole grains include whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta, brown or wild rice, and bran cereal. , Chickpeas, lentils, and other legumes as well as some grains like quinoa and oatmeal are high in protein and low in fat. Other sources include nuts and soy products like tofu. Protein provides essential amino acids and repairs cell damage. , Terms like “natural” are not regulated by the FDA, which means that the ingredients in the food you buy may not be so natural after all. The best way to make sure that you are eating clean, additive-free food is to check ingredient labels. If it contains an additive which you cannot pronounce, it is a good sign that it is unnatural. You may also want to avoid dyes, MSG, aspartame, and high fructose corn syrup.

"
Read the nutrition labels on food you purchase.,
Compare the calories per serving with the daily percentage of nutrients.,
Consult an online nutrient density scale.,
Look for whole foods when shopping.,
Consume a balance of nutrient-rich foods.,
Avoid foods with high saturated fat content.,
Avoid foods with high amounts of sodium and refined sugar.,
Eat meat sparingly.,
Build your diet around organic foods.,
Buy locally grown produce items.,
Include other nutrition-heavy, calorie-light fruits and vegetables.",How to Determine Nutrient Density," The nutrition label will give you plenty of useful information about the nutrients and calories that you’re putting into your body. You’ll want to look most closely at the number of calories-per-serving provided at the top of the nutrition label (should be right under “Amount Per Serving”) and the nutrients that the food provides.These healthy nutrients will be listed lower on the label and include Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron, and others.;
, Adults generally consume about 2,000 calories over the course of a day. So, if a tablespoon of peanut butter contains 100 calories, that’s 5% of your daily caloric intake. However, if this peanut butter has only 1% of your daily recommended Vitamin A, then the peanut butter has low nutritional density (1% of a daily nutrient versus 5% of daily calories).


You can use this tactic to compare foods against one another to determine which is more nutritionally dense. For example, imagine you’re comparing a whole grain bread (which has .25–.5 mg of Vitamin E) against a white bread (which has .1 mg of vitamin E). Both breads will contain roughly the same number of calories, but the whole grain bread will have much better nutrient density., There are various websites which have compiled information relating to of nutrient-dense food sources; these sites are run by nutritionists who have access to specific food-related nutrient data that typical consumers may find hard to come by. For information regarding nutrition density refer to DrAxe and PeerTrainer, among others.One of the more common means of measuring nutrient density is Dr. Joel Fuhrman’s nutrient density scale, which divides the nutrients in a food by its calories, and produces a value from 1–1,000 (indicating low to high nutrient density) on the Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (ANDI). Produce features heavily on the list: for example, kale and watercress each have 1,000 points, while soda and corn chips have a 1 and 7, respectively., Whole foods are those that are sold, purchased, and consumed as close to their natural state as possible. Whole foods have undergone as little processing or refinement as possible, and have not had additional fats and flavorings added. This allows the foods to retain much of their nutritional value, and consequently, to have higher nutrient density than processed foods.The category of whole foods generally includes fruits and vegetables, grains, legumes, and even starchy foods (like potatoes) and proteins (like steak or chicken) when these are prepared without processing or deep frying.
Whole-grain breads are an example of a nutrient-dense whole food, as their grains have not undergone the processing that other breads have. This bread is much healthier than regular white bread: although it contains roughly the same number of calories, it contains many more nutrients., When planning your diet around consuming foods with high nutrient density, keep in mind that it’s important to consume a variety of types of nutrients. Eat foods that will provide you with a healthy mix of nutrients each day; this will allow you to use one food to compensate for another’s nutrient deficiencies. Eating whole foods from various groups--grains, fruits, vegetables, and proteins--will help you maximize nutritional intake while minimizing calories.You may find yourself debating between foods with different nutritional strengths: for example, one which is high in vitamin A but low in vitamin D, and another which is high in vitamin C and iron. As a general rule, opt for foods with high levels of multiple nutrients.
Also take calories into consideration: if a food offers a variety of nutrients but contains hundreds of calories, its nutrient density may actually be low.

, Your body needs fat in moderation, but saturated fats are not a good option. Saturated fats have no nutritional value other than calories. Foods high in saturated fats have very low nutrient density.Choose fat-free foods when possible. This is not to say that all fat is unhealthy, but that cutting down on the fat content in foods will also reduce the caloric content, and consequently improve the ratio of nutrients to calories.

, These substances have next to no nutritional value and only add unhealthy calories. This drastically lowers these foods’ nutritional density.Sugar-heavy, low-nutrient foods provide what are known as “empty calories”: calories without nutritional value. Soda and corn chips, for example, are among the foods with the lowest nutritional density.


Processed foods are typically high in sodium and sugar, and generally have very low nutritional value and consequently low nutritional density.

, Meat products are high in protein (and consequently high in calories) and many are high in saturated fats as well. Consequently, curb your meat consumption whenever possible. Seafood like shrimp and salmon (and other fish) have a higher nutrient density than other meats.Red meats in particular, including beef and pork, contain saturated fats and are often high in calories. That said, consider eating red meat occasionally as a good source of protein, iron, and all essential amino acids.


Since you’ll be cutting back on meat for the purposes of enhancing nutrient density, you’ll need to find other ways to consume complete proteins so that your overall nutrition doesn’t suffer. Focus on eating beans (kidney beans are relatively nutrient rich), squash, and other high-protein vegetables.

, These food items—primarily produce—will be high in nutrients, including vitamin C and vitamin D, and contain very few calories. Kale, collard greens, mustard greens, and watercress are among the most nutrient-dense foods available. Each of these foods has 1,000 on Fuhrman’s nutrient density scale.Organic produce also has other health benefits, in that it has not been treated with pesticides. These health benefits apply to more than just produce, and include meat.

, In addition to purchasing and consuming organic food items, it’s important for nutrient density to purchase food that have been grown locally and have been freshly harvested. It takes time—often days or even a week—for produce to shipped between cities and across state lines, and the foods lose their nutritional richness during this time. However, locally grown and recently harvested foods will retain the majority of their nutrients.Organic foods are often among those shipped the greatest distances from their place of harvest to the place they’re sold. Before you purchase organic food in a grocery store, check the label: if it’s been imported from several states away, look for a more local option.
A farmer’s market is a great location to find both organic and locally grown produce.

, The majority of nutrient-dense foods are produce and fruits, since these are packed with nutrients and have relatively few calories. Plan to incorporate as many of these into your diet as possible. Other nutrient-dense produce includes leafy greens (especially spinach and romaine lettuce), broccoli, artichokes, and cabbage.Fruits tend to be more sweet and slightly higher in calories, and consequently have lower nutrient densities. However, fruits like strawberries, apples, peaches, and blueberries are still relatively dense nutritionally.

"
Look for the serving size.,
Find ""Total Carbohydrates."",
Note the total sugar amount.,
Read the ingredient label.,
Calculate sugar in homemade goods.,
Start a food journal.,
Tally up your sugar count.,
Differentiate between added sugar and natural sugars.,
Limit added sugars.,
Monitor natural sugar.,
Consider sugar substitutes.",How to Count Your Sugar Intake," No matter what food you're looking at or what nutrient you're tracking, the first thing you need to take note on is the serving size.


The serving size is one of the first pieces of information listed on the nutrition fact panel. It's generally listed right under the title ""Nutrition Facts.""
You will see how much one serving of the food item is and how many servings are in the container.
If it's a single serving container or package it may say ""one package"" or ""contains one serving.""
All of the information listed in the nutrition fact panel is based off of one serving. So if there's multiple servings per container, you'll need to make sure you only consume one serving to match up with the information listed.;
, Total carbohydrates is one of the main, bolded headings on the nutrition fact panel.


Total carbohydrates is listed after sodium and before protein on the food panel.
Total carbohydrates includes the sugar, fiber and starch (not listed on the label) of the food you're eating.
High quantities of sugar will make the total carbohydrate level high as well.

, After finding total carbohydrates, you will see the listing for the total amount of sugar in one serving of the product.


Record the total amount of sugar in one serving. If you eat more than one serving, multiply the total sugar amount by how many servings you have. For example, if one serving has 5 grams of sugar, but you had 3 servings, you consumed 15 g of sugar total.
Note that as of now, the amount of sugar listed here includes both added and natural sugars. You will need to read the ingredient label to find out if there is added sugar in your product.

, Unfortunately, food companies can add a lot of sugar to foods without necessarily showing it on the nutrition fact panel.


The ingredient list is listed right underneath or immediately next to the nutrition fact panel.
The ingredients are listed in order of the most prevalent. For example, the first ingredient listed is found in the highest quantities in the food while the last ingredient is found in the lowest quantity in the food.
Read each ingredient and look for any added sugars listed. At this time you can't calculate how many grams of sugar are from added sugars or are coming from natural sugars.

, If you make many of your foods at home you won't have a nutrition fact panel to help you figure out how much sugar is in the foods you make. Use your recipe for a guide.


Make sure to measure out exactly how much sugar you add (especially if this is your own recipe or you change the recipe as you go).
Research ingredients containing sugar that you're using. For example, chocolate chips or peanut butter will have sugar in them. Look at their food labels or look them up on an online food database for nutrient information.
For example, if you're making cookies add the amount of added sugar you used to make the entire batch. If you make 30 cookies and it takes 1 cup of sugar to make the cookies, then you divide the amount of cookies by by the total grams in a cup of sugar (which is 200 grams). For instance, 30 cookies at 200 grams would be 6.7 grams of sugar per cookie.
Many food diary apps also allow you to input your own recipes and will calculate all nutrient amounts per serving including sugar.

, Whenever you're tracking any component of your diet, it's smart to start a food journal. This ongoing tally can help you get a good look into what you're eating.


Use either a hard copy journal or set up a online food journal or use a smart phone app. Sometimes online or app versions of the journal make calculating your total sugar intake easy as they do a lot of the math for you.
Record everything you eat and drink each day. All meals, snacks, beverages and even a few bites while you're cooking. Recording everything that goes into your mouth will make your end total more accurate.
Try to measure or weigh your foods (especially those that are not divided into appropriate portion sizes) for the most accurate count.
Keep your journal with you so you don't forget to record items that you ate while you were out.

, As you go through your day tally up the total sugar found in each of your meals, snacks and beverages.


Counting your total sugar intake at the end of the day doesn't allow for you to make any adjustments to your diet. For example, if you want to lower your sugar intake, you may skip an afternoon snack if you notice your daily total is higher than where you'd like it to be.
Use an online food database or app to help you figure out how much sugar is in your food if you don't have a food label for the item.
Try to track your total sugar intake for an entire week - including weekends. This will give you a great perspective of your typical diet. You may even want to take an average of your sugar intake as each day is a little different.

, While you're tracking your total sugar intake, it may also be useful to track how much of that sugar is added and how much is natural.


Refer to the ingredient label to see what types of sugar may be added to your foods. It can be listed as: sugar, cane sugar, rice syrup, corn syrup, cane juice, honey, agave syrup, high fructose corn syrup or corn syrup solids.
Natural sugar, although still sugar, usually comes with additional benefits. For example, there is sugar in fruit (fructose) and sugar in dairy (lactose). Although it's still considered sugar, the fruit has fiber, vitamins and minerals and the dairy has protein and calcium. All worthwhile nutritional benefits to these foods.
Added sugars are typically added to foods during their processing. For example, sugar added in desserts, sweetened beverages or candy. Added sugars do not typically come with the same nutritional benefits of natural sugars.
Some foods may have both natural and added sugars. This will make it difficult to tell exactly how many grams are from the added sugar. For example, regular applesauce generally has some added sugars but also natural sugars from the apples.

, If you've kept your food journal and tracked your total sugar intake and feel that it's too much, you may want to decrease your total sugar intake each day.


Decreasing added sugars is an easy place to start. These are more obvious foods and when you limit your consumption of them, can cut out a good chunk of your total sugar intake daily.
Skip sweetened beverages like coffee drinks, sodas, fruit juices, alcohol, energy drinks and sports drinks.
Skip sweetened foods like candy, cookies, cakes, ice cream, pastries, sweetened nut butters, honey, agave syrup and maple syrup.
Skip sweet condiments and sauces like ketchup, tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and salsa.
Also be wary of diet or low-fat foods. Many foods will decrease their total fat or calories and replace those items with more sugar (or salt). Review some of your favorite low-fat or ""diet"" items to see if there is any added sugar in the ingredient list.

, Although natural sugars do contain some nutritional benefit, too much can still have negative side effects.


Natural sugars are found in foods including: dairy products (especially yogurt and milk), fruits and some starchy vegetables (like peas, carrots or sweet potatoes).
These foods shouldn't necessarily be restricted, but the amount you eat should follow recommended serving sizes and be adjusted if necessary.
For an example, a diabetic who eats 4-5 servings of fruit daily might have more difficulty managing their blood sugar due to the fructose in the fruit.

, There is conflicting evidence about artificial and no calorie sweeteners. However, if you really want to cut out your sugar intake but still want to sweetened foods or beverages you may want to consider using a sugar substitute.


Always consult your doctor prior to adding any artificial sugars or other foods to your diet. They will be able to tell you if they are safe or appropriate for you and your current health conditions.
Although these types of sugar are labeled as ""no-calorie"" you shouldn't use them in excess. There are no long term studies on the safety of large quantities of these types of sugars. In addition, large quantities have been shown to have some side effects (like migraines) in some sensitive people.

Check the serving size.,
Tally the fat.,
Take note of the carbs.,
Note the protein.,
Know what you don’t need to count.",How to Count Macronutrients1," Accurately counting macros means using the serving size to determine the macro content of whatever you ate. Look for the serving size just below the large “nutrition facts” header on the nutrition label.Serving sizes vary according to different types of food. Some will be listed in ounces, others in fluid ounces, some in grams, some in units of food (i.e., “10 crackers”) and so on.
Be sure to check the servings per container, too. If a can of beets says that one serving has 80 grams of carbs and there are three servings per container, the whole can of beets contains 240 grams of carbs.;
, Many nutrition labels have a total for all fat, then separate totals for saturated fat and unsaturated fat. There is no need to tally the different sorts of fat differently. Just make a note of the total fat, typically denoted in grams, in a small notebook. Alternately, add the totals in a fitness tracking app of your choice., Just like the fat total, the carbohydrate totals are usually denoted in grams. Make a note of the total carbs in your macronutrient notebook or fitness tracking app.Sugar is often listed as a subcategory just below the carb count. However, you don’t need to create a separate category for sugar, since the total amount of sugar in a given food is included in the total carb count.

, Protein is the third and final element in the macro-counting triumvirate. Protein, like the carbohydrate and fat totals, is expressed in grams. Write the protein count of the food you’re eating in a notebook or in your fitness tracking app alongside the other two., Lots of information on the nutrition label is irrelevant from a macro-counting perspective. For instance, don’t bother counting calories. Likewise, you don’t need to know the cholesterol or sodium contents of a given food (though you should always aim to consume low-sodium and low-cholesterol foods to keep your heart healthy).Dietary fiber counts are also unnecessary when counting macros – though you should aim to get an adequate amount of fiber in your diet. Eat whole grain bread and pasta, and at least four cups of fruits and vegetables each day.

See a chiropractor.",How to Control Hiatal Hernia by Dietary and Lifestyle Adjustments," Lots of foods can trigger heartburn (the spilling of stomach contents into the lower esophagus) because they're either too acidic, sweet, spicy or gassy.Everyone's tolerances and sensitivities are different, but if you have a hiatal hernia, you should avoid peppery foods, tomato-based foods, onions, citrus fruits and chocolate products.


Fried and fatty foods can also trigger heartburn and irritate the esophagus and weaken the valve (esophageal sphincter) between the esophagus and stomach.In addition to heartburn, common symptoms of a hiatal hernia include: abdominal pain, bloating, frequent burping, difficulty swallowing, sore throat, feeling too full, fatigue and sometimes vomiting.Chronic heartburn can also lead to bad breath, but avoid sucking on mints or candy (especially peppermints) because that can make the heartburn worse.
Foods less likely to cause heartburn symptoms include the following: bananas, apples, green beans, peas, carrots, broccoli, grains, cereals, cheeses, milk, and yogurt.;
, In addition to the types of foods you eat, the portion sizes can also trigger the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Thus, eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day (similar in size to large snacks) in order to prevent over-filling your stomach and putting pressure on the esophageal sphincter. Americans tend to take much larger portion sizes than they need for adequate energy and nutrition, so reducing them will not likely rob you of necessary nutrients.


Instead of three large meals per day, eat five smaller (and blander) meals spaced out by about two-and-a-half hours.
Don't let others dish up your plate when at home. Help yourself and don't feel the need to fill up your entire plate to the edges.
If you're very hungry, force yourself to take a small serving initially. Eat slowly and only take a second small serving if you're still hungry.

, Chewing your food properly is important because not only are you ""pre-digesting"" and absorbing some of the nutrients in your mouth, but you're also stimulating the release of extra saliva into your mouth. Saliva is alkaline (which combats the acidity of food) and helps coat and soothe the lining of your esophagus, which can reduce heartburn and other symptoms related to a hiatal hernia.Take smaller bites and spend at least 20 – 30 seconds chewing your food before you swallow it.
Cut up your food into smaller portions to encourage taking smaller bites. Cutting food up will also allow it to cool down faster.
If your mouth feels dry before a meal, suck on a piece of lemon (limes and grapefruits work well also) in order to stimulate the release of saliva from your saliva glands.

, In addition to the type and portions of food, the timing of your meals is also very important for controlling the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. More specifically, you should eat dinner (or your final meal of the day) at least two to three hours before bedtime in order to give your stomach enough time to digest the food and then release its contents into the small intestine.Going to bed full and laying horizontal makes it easier for the acidic contents of the stomach to spill out through the esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus, causing heartburn.
It takes longer for dense meals to digest (such as steak) compared to breads, pastas, salads and cooked veggies.
Always sit up while eating and avoid lying down or bending over immediately after any meal. Go for a light walk if a meal makes you feel very sleepy instead of napping.
Wear pants that are loose around your stomach when eating to reduce pressure you might feel from restrictive clothing., Alcoholic beverages can irritate a hiatal hernia in a few different ways. Alcoholic drinks, especially red wine and beer, are very acidic, so they should be avoided in general (particularly in the evenings) if you have a history of heartburn.Secondly, the alcohol (ethanol) is damaging to the tissues of your esophagus, esophageal sphincter and stomach, which can trigger acid reflux and other symptoms.


All alcoholic beverages can potentially irritate a hiatal hernia, although the least acid types tend to contain the least amount of sugar, such as a vodka and soda, or a white wine spritzer.
Alcohol relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, which allows contents to reflux into the esophagus.
Excessive drinking also increases the risk of forceful vomiting, which can make a hiatal hernia worse.

, Caffeine is a stimulant that affects your body in many ways, most of them negatively. More specifically, it can irritate the stomach and relax smooth muscle tissue (which lines the esophagus), so people with a hiatal hernia should reduce or eliminate caffeine from their diet if they want to control symptoms.Caffeine is found in coffee, black and green teas, soda pop (especially colas), energy drinks and chocolate.
Many of the drinks that contain caffeine are also very acidic, which is like a ""double whammy"" for people with hiatal hernias. Avoid coffee and colas at the very least.

, Although many people believe they need to wash their food down with fluids (such as water, milk or sodas), it's actually not a good idea. Drinking lots of water or other fluids with meals tends to dilute your saliva and the digestive enzymes in your stomach and small intestine, making them less effective. Furthermore, the extra volume in the stomach might encourage some sloshing up of the acidic contents into the esophagus, leading to heartburn.As noted above, chewing your food well produces lots of saliva, which aids with digestion and helps you swallow it comfortably.
Drink no more than a few ounces of water (or milk) with meals. Drink water before a meal if you're truly thirsty.
Drinking or gulping fluids can also lead to aerophagia, which is the swallowing of air while eating. Aerophagia can aggravate a hiatal hernia and lead to belching and indigestion.

, One of the most commonly recommended lifestyle adjustments for people with hiatal hernias is to lose weight if they're overweight or obese.Overweight people are more prone to hiatal hernias due to a combination of factors, including: overeating and large meal portions, chronic heartburn, excessive consumption of caffeine, alcohol, fatty, fried foods — which damage/inflame the esophagus and esophageal sphincter.


Losing weight puts less pressure on the abdominal and chest area, where the stomach and esophagus lay underneath.
The safest and most effective way to lose weight is reducing your daily calories along with regular exercise — at least 30 minutes daily.
Reducing your daily calories by only 500 can result in approximately 4 pounds of lost fat per month, even if you don't exercise that much.Keeping a weight loss journal, either on paper or using an app on your smartphone, to record all of the food that you ingest will help you stay on top of your progress.

, Similar to alcohol, the various toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are damaging to the inner parts of the esophagus/stomach and can damage the esophageal sphincter — essentially making it leaky and unable to fully close. Consequently, it's recommended that people with hiatal hernias stop smoking as soon as they can.Cancer of the esophagus is much more common with smokers too, which can mimic the symptoms of a hiatal hernia (at least initially).


Smoking also damages the airways and increases the risk of chronic coughing. The force of coughing so much can weaken your diaphragm muscles and contribute to the formation of a hiatal hernia.
Further, smoking stimulates the production of acid in the stomach.
In addition to nicotine patches, hypnotherapy can be very helpful for stopping smoking.

, Although sleeping or napping after a meal is a no-no for those who experience chronic heartburn, once you have properly digested your food, raise your head when you lay down on your back. Elevating your head by about 6 inches or so while in bed or on the sofa works with gravity to keep your stomach's contents from spilling up into your esophagus.


While in bed or on the sofa, prop your head up with an extra pillow, although be careful not to get a stiff neck or trigger a headache.
Consider buying a mattress that can be adjusting electronically and adjust the head portion to an incline between 6 – 8 inches.
You can also elevate the top portion of your body if you lay on your side by using extra pillows, but you'll also increase the risk of getting back pain.
Try not to eat anything one to two hours before you do to bed. A good habit to practice is to not eat food too late in the evening.

, Although chiropractors typically focus on treating the spinal column and peripheral joints, some also specialize in soft-tissue treatment of hiatal hernias.The idea is to push the stomach back to its normal position below the diaphragm by applying pressure with the hands — sort of like a deep tissue massage. The procedure can give great relief, albeit sometimes only temporary relief (hours to days).


Other professions that include practitioners that do soft-tissue manipulation for the purposes of controlling hiatal hernias include massage therapists, physiotherapists, naturopaths and osteopaths.
According to mainstream medicine, there's no evidence that such soft-tissue manipulation works to cure hiatal hernias, as no research has been done yet."

Weigh your food.,
Search for nutrition facts online.,
Ask restaurants for nutrition facts.,
Learn to eyeball portion sizes.",How to Count Macronutrients2," Weighing your unlabeled food is important for accurately determining its macro content. Place your food on a food scale in order to weigh it. Be sure to place your plate or bowl on the scale before zeroing it out, otherwise, your weight measurement will erroneously include the weight of the plate or bowl.For instance, you might weigh an apple and find that it weighs 25 grams.
Weighing fruits and veggies is less important than weighing meat because the weight of meat will change significantly when it’s cooked. Always weigh meat when it’s raw.

, Once you know the weight of your food, search online for the macro values (the total fat, carbohydrate, and protein contents, in grams) of your unlabeled food based on its mass. There are many nutrition facts databases online. Use your preferred search engine and a word string like “nutrition facts apple” to obtain the nutrition facts of an apple.For instance, if you weighed a slab of beef and found it weighs 300 grams, you might search online and find that 100 grams of beef contain 15 grams of protein. This would yield a total protein count of 45 grams (three times 15). You’d then repeat the search for your other two macro metrics, carbs, and fat.

, Many restaurants – especially larger chains – offer nutrition data sheets for everything on their menu. If you’re dining out, obtain the restaurant’s nutrition fact sheet and make a note of the macro data.If the restaurant you’re dining at doesn’t offer nutritional information, eyeball your portion sizes/weights, then look the macronutrient content up later based on your estimates.

, Identify the food or foods that you commonly eat, and the volume in which you eat them. For instance, if you eat a banana daily or almost every day, you should, in time, be able to abandon using the food scale for bananas because you’ll be so familiar with the macro counts of an average medium-sized banana. At that point, you can estimate macro tallies for bananas that are slightly outside this baseline measurement that you’ve memorized (whether they’re too large or too small).Use your hand as a baseline. For instance, you might remember that an apple that is about the size of your fist has X amount of carbs, fat, and protein, while a scoop of ice cream that could fit in your hand has Y amount of carbs, fat, and protein.

Adjust your macros for weight loss.,
Adopt a bodybuilding macro regimen.,
Maintain your weight with macros.",How to Count Macronutrients3," If you want to lose weight, you should be getting 10-30% of your macro totals from carbs, 40-50% of your macros from protein, and 30-40% of your macros from fat. For instance, over the course of a day, you might have consumed 35 grams of fat, 15 grams of carbs, and 50 grams of protein.Good foods to eat for weight loss while staying within your macro totals include bananas, apples, grapes, carrots, celery, nuts, groats, and avocados.

, A low-fat, high-carb macro regimen will enable you to build muscle and power through an intense workout. Macro regimens for bodybuilding typically aim for 15-25% fat, 25-35% protein, and 40-60% carbs.When following this division of macros, you might eat 50 grams of fat, 50 grams of protein, and 100 grams of carbs by the day’s end.
Good foods to eat for bodybuilding while staying within your macro totals include potatoes, grapes, apples, avocados, seeds, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice.

, Because of individual variation, there is not a clear way to calculate what the optimal macronutrient balance is for an individual. On average, though, you will be able to maintain your weight by eating the same amount of calories you expend each day and by keeping your macronutrient ratios at about 30-50% carbs, 25-35% protein, and 25-35% fat.Other common macro balances include 45-65% carbs, 10-35% percent protein, and 20-35% fat.Some people believe that consuming each macro in equal amounts is best (for instance, consuming 35 grams of fat, 35 grams of protein, and 35 grams of carbs over the course of a day).
Talk to a doctor or dietitian about how to best balance your macro ratios.

Adults should eat about five servings each of fruit and vegetables per day.One serving is equivalent to one small piece of fruit, or a half cup of cooked vegetables.
Cauliflower and broccoli, peppers, string beans, summer squash, peppers, and leafy greens are great vegetable choices for people who want to control their weight.;
, Fiber, which is a type of carbohydrate, is a filling nutrient that can also reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes, and can help you lose weight because it keeps your digestive tract running smoothly.


A healthy diet should include between 25 and 38 grams of fiber each day.Good sources of fiber include: strawberries, raspberries,almonds, popcorn, and fruits and vegetables.

, Fat is still an essential part of a healthy diet, but at maximum, you should consume no more than two to three servings of fat and oil per day. This includes things like butter, oils, margarine, and mayonnaise., In general, weight gain is caused by consuming more calories than your body is burning, while weight loss is caused when your body expends more calories than you consume. Depending upon your health and lifestyle, try to stick with around 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for adult men.To help reduce the amount of calories you consume, try:


Around 1800 calories for women and 2000 calories for men is a good baseline. You can modify from there if you notice yourself rapidly gaining or losing weight.
Reducing the fat in recipes by half and replacing the lost moisture with either broth (for savory dishes) or fruit purees (for baked goods)., A healthy and balanced diet requires about 0.8 grams of protein for every 2.2 pounds (one kilogram) of body weight,and it’s best to obtain this from plant sources (as opposed to animal sources) such as:


Nuts and seeds
Beans and legumes
Soy products and wheat gluten

, There are many fad diets around that tell you the magic way to lose weight in a short amount of time, and these diets often require eliminating entire food groups, such as fat or carbohydrates, from your diet. However, while these diets may lead to temporary weight loss thanks to the reduction in calories, they aren’t ideal for long-term weight control. Instead, keep an eye on:


Portion control
Calories in versus calories out
Recommended daily values

, One easy way to monitor your calories is by controlling the portion sizes of the foods you eat. Pay attention to recommended serving sizes, and stick to those when serving yourself food at mealtimes. To help reduce or control the amount that you eat at each sitting, you can:Drink a glass of water 30 minutes before every meal.
Swap out some of your protein or carbohydrates for vegetables.
Divide snacks into individual portion sizes. Never sit down with an entire bag of snacks in front of you.
Eat a bowl of soup before lunch and dinner. The liquid will help fill you up and prevent you from overeating.
Use smaller plates and bowls. This will help trick your brain into thinking you are eating more.

, Over snacking is an easy way to consume too many calories, which can lead to weight gain if you don’t burn off the excess. But that doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to snack, especially if you’re hungry between meals. Just make sure to choose healthy snacks, such as:Homemade popcorn flavored with herbs and spices instead of butter
Fresh or dried fruit, nuts, or seeds
Fresh vegetables with hummus
Foods you have to work to eat, such as pistachios and edamame.

, Food cravings happen, and by allowing yourself to indulge once in a while and have that piece of cake or bowl of ice cream, you won’t feel like you’re missing out and won’t over-indulge to compensate for that.


Observe portion control even when you are allowing yourself to indulge. Pay attention to the serving sizes of your favorite desserts and stick to them.

, Sugar is naturally occurring in foods like fruit, but added sugar can be found in processed foods like soups, condiments, and breads, and is even hiding in sauces and salad dressings. Sugar, however, can quickly lead to weight gain, and has been associated with health problems like obesity and diabetes.


The general daily recommended sugar intake is six teaspoons or less., Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 should ideally exercise about five hours per week, spread out over at least three days. For optimal weight control, exercise for about 60 minutes at a time.If you aren’t currently active, slowly work your way toward faster-paced aerobic activities. For instance, start by walking and working your way toward jogging over the course of a few weeks.
Don’t be afraid to mix up your workout routine to prevent getting bored. Try activities like:walking, jogging, and swimming, or use low-impact machines like the treadmill or rower.

, Strengthening activities are a great way to stay in shape and help control weight, because adding muscle mass will help your body burn fat more effectively.For weight control, strengthening activities should be done at least twice per week, and good exercises include:


Push-ups
Weight training
Sit-ups

, On top of exercising each week, you can also increase your activity level—and burn more calories—by making more active choices every day. This includes:Taking the stairs instead of the elevator
Walking or biking to work instead of driving
Parking farther away from your destination

, One of the most difficult parts about controlling your weight can be staying motivated once you’ve achieved your goal. It can be easy to fall back into old habits, which is why it’s important to stick to your proper diet and exercise regimen.


Maintaining a proper weight, and eating a balanced diet is all part of a healthy lifestyle, and it’s a conscious choice that must be made every day.
To keep track of your weight, weigh yourself once a week at the same time of day.

, Don’t try to lose, gain, or control your current weight if you don’t know what a healthy weight is for your body size and type.


There are many calculators you can use online to determine what a healthy weight is for your height, age, and sex. You can also talk to a doctor or healthcare practitioner about the right weight for your body type.
Another way of keeping track of your health and weight is using your BMI, the body mass index, which is a measure of your body mass based on height and weight. There are many online calculators that can be used. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.

, Rapid weight loss or weight gain can be a sign of health problems, and it’s best to consult a doctor or healthcare practitioner if you’re experiencing any issues. Always consult your doctor before beginning a new exercise regimen.


Seek the advice of a registered dietitian for additional information about proper nutrition.

Bake meats and fish, but not vegetables.,
Avoid boiling your food.,
Reheat only when necessary.",How to Cook Food Without Losing Nutrients," Simply put, foods that have a higher nutritional value can usually afford to lose more nutrients than those that have low nutritional content to begin with. Try to include more fruits and vegetables that are dark green or orange, since these typically have more vitamins than produce pale in color. Similarly, lean meats and fish offer more nutrient per bite than fatty cuts of meat.It can also be a good idea to note which vitamins and nutrients are naturally more sensitive to air, light, and heat so that you can be more careful when preparing foods that have them. Proteins, carbohydrates, biotin, and niacin are relatively stable. On the other hand, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin K, vitamin B-6, riboflavin, and carotenes are somewhat sensitive; vitamin C, folic acid, and thiamin are especially sensitive.;
, Prolonged storage can cause produce to lose nutritional value before you ever get a chance to cook it. Buy fresh produce when possible, and try to use it within a day or two of purchase.Buying produce that's locally grown and in season can also help. Food that has to be shipped across the country may not be properly refrigerated the entire way, causing it to lose nutrients before it even reaches you.One way to ensure that you're getting fresh produce is to buy unripened fruits and vegetables. Most produce will have maximum nutritional value as soon as it ripens, so ripening produce at home can be beneficial. Keep produce out at room temperature until it ripens, then use it as quickly as possible., Heirloom fruits and vegetables can be a little more expensive, but they'll usually be denser in nutrients than their hybrid counterparts. Hybrid crops are grown with an emphasis on yield, rather than nutrition, so they may not contain as many vitamins and minerals., Try to only purchase what you expect to use within two days.Since fruits and vegetables can lose nutrients evenly when properly stored, it's best to limit the amount of storage time altogether.


If you do find yourself with more fresh food than you can use within a few days, freeze what you can't eat. Freezing will preserve more nutrients than refrigeration., Loosely packed frozen vegetables are usually prepared when the produce is at its peak nutritional value, and the freezing process does a fairly good job of retaining those nutrients. If you don't think you can use fresh vegetables within a few days, it might actually be better to opt for their frozen counterparts.Avoid using canned vegetables, however, since nutrients can leech out into the water they're packed in. Most canned vegetables also contain added sodium., Ripe produce, meats, and dairy should all be stored in your refrigerator. Light and air can destroy nutrients, so you should avoid exposing food to these elements unnecessarily.Keep your refrigerator at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).
Store vegetables in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.
Buy milk and juice in opaque containers, or transfer these liquids into opaque containers if their original containers are transparent.
If you do happen to have canned goods, store them in a cellar kept between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius) to prevent nutrient loss.

, As noted previously, you should purchase fresh produce, dairy, and meat, and use these fresh ingredients as quickly as possible to minimize the nutrient loss that occurs in storage. Keep fresh food you can’t use within a couple of days in a freezer set at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius)., When cleaning produce, thoroughly wash away dirt, bacteria, pests, and pesticides under cool, running water. Do not soak the vegetables, however, since valuable water-soluble nutrients, like vitamin C, can leech out into the water., Avoid cutting vegetables into small pieces prior to cooking. Instead, cook them whole or in large chunks.When vegetables are finely chopped, more of the vegetable is exposed to air and water, making water-soluble and light-sensitive nutrients more likely to leech out.Furthermore, it can be a good idea to let vegetables rest for about 10 minutes after cutting them before cooking or eating them. Some studies suggest that the additional time allows more nutrients to be activated, making them easier for your body to absorb, Resist the temptation to peel your vegetables. In many cases, the flesh just beneath the skin contains more nutrients than the inner portions. Removing the skins can cause you to either peel away these nutrient-dense layers or expose them to air and water that can dissolve those nutrients away., The microwave can be one of the best ways to retain vitamins and nutrients in vegetables. As a general rule, the best way to prevent nutrient loss is to cook vegetables quickly, with minimum heat and minimum liquid, and the microwave can accomplish this.Consider microwaving vegetables with a small amount of water. While some nutrients can be lost when exposed to large amounts of liquid, adding a little water will steam the vegetables in addition to microwaving them, thereby cooking them faster and exposing sensitive nutrients to less heat., Aside from microwaving, steaming and blanching are probably the best ways to cook your vegetables. These methods use minimal water, minimal time, and minimal heat--minimizing nutrient loss as a result.Cook your vegetables until they are tender-crisp (tender enough to bite into without losing all their natural crunch). Vegetables that are tender enough to break apart when you pierce them with a fork will lose a lot of nutrients during cooking.
Check for color, too. Cooking methods that preserve color, like steaming and blanching, also tend to preserve more nutrients.

, Since stir-frying is a quick way to cook food, you can retain a decent amount of nutrients using this method.Water-soluble vitamins won't leech into the oil like they leech into water, either, which is another benefit of this technique.


To limit nutrient loss when stir-frying lean meats, cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and coat the pieces in whole wheat flour. The flour acts as a barrier, protecting the meat (and protein) from the heat and moisture that could otherwise cause some loss of nutritional value.Also, use as little oil as possible when cooking and choose heart-healthy oils, like canola and olive oil., Baking meat, poultry, and fish is a great way to preserve the proteins and other nutrients in these foods. When baking fish, you might also consider wrapping it in tinfoil to limit the amount of contact the sensitive flesh has with the intense heats of the oven.Roasting is less ideal for vegetables since the prolonged exposure to high heat can increase nutrient loss. If you like the taste of roasted vegetables, though, stick with hardier options that are more resistant to heat, like beets, onions, celery, and green beans., Boiling is probably the worst cooking method you can use if you're concerned about maximizing the nutritional value of your food. Water-soluble nutrients will leech out of vegetables and into the cooking water.The only exception to this rule is soup. Boiling vegetables in soup broth will still cause nutrients to leech out, but as long as you drink the broth, you'll still consume most of those nutrients., Repetitive exposure to heat will cause more nutrients to disappear from your food, so minimize the amount of reheating you do.When reheating leftovers, only warm up the amount of food you can eat in one sitting instead of reheating the entire batch multiple times.

Add more fiber to your diet.,
Eat more leafy green vegetables.,
Drink lots of water.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Limit dairy.,
Drink a cup of coffee or tea.,
Have fermented foods.",How to Cleanse Your Colon1," Fiber adds bulk, softens stool, and contributes to peristalsis (gentle, rhythmic contractions of the colon), which encourages elimination.More fiber in your body means your colon can move waste out of your body more quickly and efficiently. Aim for about 20 to 35 grams (0.7 to 1 oz) of fiber a day. Make sure you have five servings a day of fruits and vegetables as well as lots of whole grains in your diet.Have 100% whole grains in your diet, such as brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, millet, and corn.
Flax seeds, wheat bran, and oats are super-sources of fiber. You can prepare flax seed at home, have it in smoothies, or add it to other foods.
Fruits like strawberries, apples, and blueberries are high in fiber. Beans, seeds, and nuts are also good sources of fiber.;
, In addition to providing fiber, leafy greens provide nutrients that help repair your intestines. Try to have at least one leafy green vegetable in each of your meals or as a snack.Alfalfa, wheatgrass, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, kale, spinach, peas, and barley grass are all good leafy greens.
You can also try snacking on vegetables by dipping them in hummus, tzatziki, or baba ganoush.

, Your colon needs water to function properly and clean out any bacteria or waste in your gut. Try to have at least 13 cups of water a day if you are an adult male and nine cups of water a day if you are an adult female. You may increase your water intake if you are doing strenuous exercise or are in a hot, dry environment.You may get in the habit of carrying around a full water bottle with you wherever you go so you can hydrate throughout the day. You may also set a reminder on your phone so you can remember to have at least nine cups of water a day.
Try adding sliced lemons, limes, and cucumber to your water to make it taste more exciting. You can also add herbs like mint to your water.

, Try to avoid alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine and hard liquor. They can dehydrate you and lead to constipation. Constipation can clog up the colon with large, impacted, hard-to-pass stool. Also, alcohol can suppress intestinal peristalsis and the urge to go, which makes constipation more likely., Milk and dairy products may worsen the symptoms of constipation, especially if you consume a lot of dairy.If you are suffering from constipation, yet are active and drink plenty of fluids, try to limit the amount of dairy products you consume or temporarily take them out of your diet completely.

Limit your cleanse.",How to Cleanse Your Body With Fresh Fruits and Vegetables," Cleanses work best as a way to jumpstart good eating habits. Cleanses do not detox your body. Weight loss resulting from cleanses is usually temporary. Cleanses can help you to be more conscious of your food choices, your eating habits, and help you start eating fresh, healthy foods. If that’s what you’re after, go for it!, Cleanses take effort since you will be radically changing how you prepare your meals and how you eat. You might also notice changes in your energy level. Make sure your schedule is flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen effects of the diet., Before you start your cleanse, slowly cut back on foods that don’t fit into your cleanse such as coffee, fatty foods, alcohol, salt, sugar, and sweeteners. Tapering off ahead of time will help make the adjustment easier and will reduce unpleasant feelings associated with withdrawal.If you are choosing to cut out meat and/or animal products (dairy, eggs, beef, chicken, etc.) then do so slowly, and ensure you are replacing the proteins and other nutrients you lose when cutting out animal products.

, Along with lovely, colorful fruits and vegetables, make sure to purchase whole, minimally-processed foods that will supply your body with energy. Choose foods that contain protein and healthy fat such as eggs (or egg whites), poultry, fish, legumes or tofu., In the morning, eat any raw, ripe fruits you like. You might blend them into a smoothie or eat them as-is. Be sure to include in your meal carbs in the form of vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. You can also add an avocado to your breakfast for a protein-boost and to make your meal more filling., In the afternoon, eat a large salad with as many different vegetables as possible. For dressing, mix olive oil with any fresh citrus juice. Avoid adding salt to your salad or dressing to minimize water retention during your diet. If you’d like to make the meal more substantial, add a steamed potato or yam (hold the butter and/or brown sugar)., In the evening, eat any combination of raw vegetables and fruits you would like. Add 20 – 30 grams of protein to maintain your energy and help your body to function like it should. You can eat three extra-large eggs, a half-cup of diced chicken breast, a four-ounce fillet of salmon, or a half-cup of black beans, for example.1 ounce of meat has about 7 grams of protein, so it is a good option to ensure you get enough protein.

, Hungry between meals? No problem! Snack on raw fruits, vegetables, or smoothies made with raw fruits and vegetables (with no added sugar). You can dip your raw veggies in guacamole made with avocado, red onion, and lemon or lime juice., At any time, drink as much water, sparkling water, peppermint tea or chamomile tea as you would like., Drinking plenty of water will reduce bloating, help you feel more full, and aid in your body’s natural cleansing processes., Carbs get a bad rap but the truth is your body needs them to function properly. Your diet should contain at least 120 grams of carbohydrates a day., Limiting what you eat can leave you with low energy and can be logistically difficult. Limiting your cleanse to three days until you have a lot of experience with what kind of diet your body needs to function at its fullest.

Determine if you have the necessary technical skills.,
Determine if you have the right interpersonal skills.,
Attend a college with an accredited radiation therapy program.,
Follow the work requirements for your state and employer.,
Get certified by the ARRT.,
Interview for job openings.,
Keep a lookout for career advancement.",How to Become a Radiation Therapist," A radiation technician's job can be physically demanding, beyond simply being able to work the machinery. You need good organizational skills to maintain detailed patient treatment records, and must have the physical strength to help patients onto treatment tables.;
, Working with cancer patients on a daily basis can be emotionally difficult. You should be empathetic, willing to provide emotional support during a stressful treatment session, and have good communication skills., In addition to learning about radiation therapy procedures, these programs will generally require coursework in human anatomy and physiology, physics, algebra, computer science, and research methodology. The website of the American Registry of Radiologic Technicians (ARRT)can help you find an accredited school or program.A Radiation Therapy degree can be either an associates degree or a bachelor's degree. Starting in 2015, certification from the ARRT (which is not always necessary for employment) requires a college degree., Many states require licensing in order to practice. Even if you are not in one of those states, your employer may require it.


The American Society of Radiologic Technicians (ASRT) has a list of the licensing requirements by state, as well as contact information for each state agency, on their website., Most employers will require a certification, which is different from the state license. Though it may not be required by every state, having ARRT certification can give you more options of places to work. To receive certification, you must complete certain educational requirements, adhere to the ARRT Standards of Ethics, then pass a computer-based test at a testing center. The exam includes a $200 testing fee.You need to take the ARRT certification exam within three years of receiving your associates or bachelor's degree, and you can take the exam up to three times.
To help prepare for the exam, the ARRT provides an outline of the exam. It does not specifically prescribe any particular preparation book, so you will have to find one that best suits your needs.ARRT certification requires annual renewal by the end of your birth month. You can either renew by mail, on online through their website. Requirements include a $25 fee and continued adherence to the ARRT Standards of Ethics. In addition, you must complete a continuing education requirement every two years and Continuing Qualifications Requirements every ten years.If your registration lapses, you can be reinstated with an additional fee. If you have gone more than six months without renewal, you will need to retake the examination, with a $200 fee.

, The majority of radiation therapists work in hospitals, but there are also opportunities in doctor's offices and outpatient facilities. During the interview process, you should demonstrate a good understanding of patient care activities, the application of radiation, safety protocols, and other relevant activities.

, An experienced therapist can rise to take on additional responsibility in a managerial role. With additional education and certification, you could even become a dosimetrist, who calculates the amount of radiation required for treatment."

Exercise on a regular basis.,
Talk to your doctor before you take over-the-counter laxatives.,
Do your research before taking colon cleansing products.",How to Cleanse Your Colon2," Physical activity stimulates the digestive system to increase bowel movements.Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help to ensure your colon stays healthy and functional. Make sure you are exercising on a regular basis, such as every day or at least three times a week. Go for a thirty minute walk every day or schedule in a workout at the gym three times a week to ensure you are burning calories and staying healthy.


You can also try doing a home workout with resistance bands to stretch your muscles and build strength. Or you may take an exercise class to help you workout regularly, such as a yoga class or an aerobics class.

, Often, maintaining a high fiber diet, drinking enough water, and exercising regularly can help your colon function properly. If you are still having issues after making lifestyle changes, consult with your physician before turning to laxatives. There could be an underlying medical problem. If your doctor recommends that you try taking laxatives, ask for a recommendation. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label of the laxatives and never take more than the recommended amount. Do not take laxatives long term, as this can lead to serious health issues.If you are experiencing irritable bowel syndrome, irregular bowel movements, or digestive issues, you may try bulk-forming laxatives such as Metamucil, Citrucel or Psyllium. Take bulk-forming laxatives with lots of water. Side effects can include bloating, gas, cramping, and increased constipation.
If you are struggling with passing stool, you can try stool softeners. Stool softeners are generally safe for use and generate less bloating than bulk-forming laxatives.
Never take laxatives as a weight loss supplement. This is damaging to your health and may cause other medical issues., If you are considering a colon cleansing product for daily use, make sure you research the product before using it. These products have not been proven to offer any health benefits.Also, keep in mind that these products are not regulated by the government, so the potency, purity and safety of these products is not guaranteed. Just because a product is labeled as ""natural"" does not mean it is safe.Talk to your doctor before using any colon cleansing products.
Check the ingredients list on the product and make sure the specific herbal ingredients are clearly noted. If you are concerned you may be allergic to any of the ingredients or you cannot identify any of the ingredients in the colon cleansing product, do not use the product.Make sure you drink a lot of water while taking a colon cleansing product. This will ensure you do not become dehydrated and that the product can work properly.

Speak to your doctor about colonic irrigation.,
Ask your doctor about an enema.,
Talk to your doctor about taking medication for your colon.",How to Cleanse Your Colon3," Colonic irrigation, also known as colonic hydrotherapy, can help to flush waste material out of your bowels with water. Your doctor may be able to do this procedure for you or recommend a colonic hydrotherapist who can do it for you. Be sure to choose a colonic hydrotherapist who is licensed by a recognized national organization. Before you get the procedure done, speak to your doctor about your medical history to ensure you can safely get the procedure.During the procedure, a pump is inserted into your rectum and about five gallons of warm water are put into your system over a period of time. Once the water is in your colon, the therapist may massage your abdomen to get circulate the water through your colon and to help waste products pass out of your body. The procedure can take about 30 to 45 minutes.
You should not have a colonic irrigation performed if you have certain medical conditions, including diverticulitis, severe hemorrhoids, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, bowel or rectum tumors, recent bowel surgery, heart disease, or kidney disease., Your doctor may be able to perform an enema on you in their office if your bowels have become impacted or you are having issues with your colon. Enemas are often recommended for constipation and poor bowel movement.Your doctor may recommend a certain type of enema for you, based on your needs. The enema insertion should be done by a trained professional in a sterile space with clean equipment.

, If you have had chronic constipation for longer than six months, ask your doctor about drug treatments that can help to stimulate your bowels. You may resort to this option if adjusting your diet and lifestyle, as well as other colon treatments do not work. Medication may also be a good option if you develop a bowel issue like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).Make sure you are aware of the side effects of the medication you are taking. If the side effects become severe, you should see your doctor right away. Side effects of colon medications can include short term nausea, dizziness, and cramps.

Go for ""no salt"" added canned foods.,

Be wary of condiments.",How to Cut Salt Without Cutting Flavor," A chef-inspired trick, drizzling foods with citrus juice or vinegar can help bring out and brighten the flavors of food without adding salt.Acids help stimulate your taste buds and bring out the ""savoriness"" that's inherent in many foods. It's best to drizzle foods at the end of cooking so you don't cook out the bright flavor of the citrus juice or vinegar.
Also utilize the zest of citrus fruits. The zest has a lot of essential oils and a tremendous amount of flavor. Sprinkle foods and dishes with the zest in addition to the juice of citrus fruits.Citrus juice, zest and vinegar are all naturally low in calories and completely sodium-free, so these are great additions to a reduced sodium diet.;
, Like citrus juice and vinegar, another way to brighten up a dish without adding more salt is to give it a little kick with some spicy seasonings or peppers.


Whether you go with black pepper, red pepper flakes or even cayenne pepper, adding a spicy component to your foods can help stimulate your palate and distract your tongue from the missing salt.Try adding spices like: black pepper, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, chili pepper or hot paprika. In addition to spices, try cooking with spicy ingredients like: jalapenos, poblano chiles, banana peppers, hot cherry peppers or even serrano peppers.
Plus, capsaicin, which is the ""spicy"" component of peppers, has been linked to decreased appetite and a healthier weight., In addition to using more intense spices (like cayenne pepper), there are many herbs that you can utilize to make foods more flavorful without salt. You can do both fresh and dried herbs in your new low-sodium cooking.


Fresh herbs add a lot of flavor to foods — especially when they're added at the end of cooking. Dried herbs are great to add at the beginning of cooking and they're a more concentrated and intense source of flavor since they've been dried.Any herbs or spices you want to use are great. You can try green herbs like basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, tarragon or rosemary. Or you can try warmer spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves or dried ginger.
There are also many no-salt added seasonings mixes and blends. You can use these if you want an easy flavoring blend.

, Like spices or acids (like vinegar or citrus juice), there are some aromatic foods and ingredients that add a lot of intense flavor to foods with no added salt. Start mixing some of these items into your meals.


Onions and shallots are very similar, cousins even, and add a lot of flavor when cooked into meals or even used raw.
Ginger and garlic are are pungent spices that offer a huge burst of flavor when cooked into meals or are used raw.
All of these aromatics add flavor to dishes. Consider cooking them into your dish and then adding a touch more just at the end of cooking for an even bigger hit of flavor., Another way to add more flavor to your foods is with fats. Fat adds a lot of flavor to foods — whether you cook with fat or your use higher fat foods (like salmon or tuna). Make sure to use healthier sources of fat so that you get the added heart benefits.


Flavor-carrying molecules dissolve in fat and can be distributed more evenly throughout foods to give them more flavor.Cook with heart healthy fats like olive oil, canola oil, avocado oil, peanut oil (or other nut oils) or even soybean oil.
Also cook foods that contain heart healthy fats like salmon, tuna, mackerel, nuts, or avocados. The fat from these foods can help make your whole dish taste more flavorful., Many people focus on the ingredients of low-sodium cooking by trying to find some way to replace the salt. However, choosing a flavorful method of cooking can also reduce the need for added salt in your meals.Some cooking methods, like poaching, boiling or steaming, don't impart all that much flavor to foods. If you're looking to increase the flavor profile of your meals, skip these types of cooking methods.
Roasting is a great cooking method that uses the high heat of the oven to cook foods. It helps caramelize and brown the outsides of the food leaving a crunchy, flavorful crust. In addition, it helps bring out the natural sweetness of vegetables and ""savoriness"" of proteins because the water content is reduced, making the flavor more dense.

,
Searing is another high heat cooking method you can do over the stove. The heat from the pan sears and caramelizes the outsides of proteins and vegetables for a crispy, flavorful crust.

, One of the easiest ways to cut out excess salt from your diet is by cooking foods from home and from scratch. You can stop using high-sodium ingredients and seasonings and replace them with salt-free or reduced salt items.


When you make foods at home, you can control every ingredient that you use.For example, if you're making homemade soup, you can choose salt-free broth and bump up the addition of herbs and spices to increase the flavor.
Eating at home also helps you control portion sizes. So even if you're foods are slightly higher in sodium, you can control how much you eat. A smaller portion will help reduce the total amount of sodium you consumed at that meal.Some ideas for low-sodium home cooking include: searing salmon in a hot pan over the stove and squeezing some fresh lemon juice on top; sprinkling a salt-free Mexican seasoning blend onto chicken breast and grilling them for fajitas; or making your own tomato sauce by sauteing garlic and onions together with fresh, seasonal tomatoes and finishing your sauce with fresh basil.
Keep practicing with your favorite seasonings. The more spices, herbs or seasonings you try, the more familiar you'll become with them and you'll find more combinations you enjoy.

, Another way to reduce the sodium in your foods is by using seasonal, fresh ingredients. These foods require fewer seasonings, especially salt, because their flavor is more intense.


Most times you have the option of buying any type of fruit or vegetable at the grocery store. Whether it's in season locally doesn't matter since much of our produce is sourced from outside the state or from the West Coast.
However, foods that aren't ripe or have been picked early so they do not deteriorate before making it to the store shelves may be more bland and lacking in flavor. However seasonal and local foods are picked just at the peak of ripeness and will generally taste a lot better.Many grocery stores now have a seasonal section or a section of produce that has come from a local vendor or farm.
You may also want to consider going to your local farmer's market for in season items. In addition, you may be able to find heirloom varieties here which can also have more flavor.

, If you're cooking and making foods from home, it's probably natural for you to reach over and sprinkle a little salt in your meals while you're preparing them. But cutting out this habit is an easy way to cut the salt from your diet.


Many times, salting foods while they're cooking doesn't provide as much flavor as you're looking for (though it still adds all the extra sodium). Instead of salting while you're cooking, skip this step and only salt at the table when you're eating.
You're more likely to taste the salty flavor when the salt has been added directly the foods that you're eating in that moment (instead of while you're cooking). Lightly sprinkle your meals with salt and make sure to measure how much you're using.
If you do add salt while you cook, always measure out how much you're using. You're limited to a total of 2300 mg daily which is about 1 teaspoon total per day., Whenever you make any type of change to your diet, it can be difficult to get used to it at first. This is especially true when you're decreasing a flavor enhancer like salt.


Studies have shown that your taste buds and palate can change and evolve over time. They key is to allow yourself adequate time to adjust your flavor preferences.In addition, make changes more slowly overtime. If you cut out every source of salt or sodium from your diet all at once, this is more of a shock to your mouth. Plan to decrease your sodium intake little by little instead of all at once.
After a few weeks of following a lower sodium diet, you won't really notice a difference in your foods. In fact, many people, when tasting previously enjoyed foods, begin to think they are too salty and dislike that flavor.

, Sodium is present in other foods outside of our salt shaker at home. Be careful when you're eating out — especially at fast food restaurants — as the foods served are generally higher in sodium.


Many fast food restaurants served fried foods, processed foods and they even will add salt to these already salty foods. Limit or avoid these types of restaurants and foods to help limit your overall sodium intake.Prior to going to your favorite place, consider looking up the nutrition information online. Look over the serving sizes and sodium content of your favorite meals and try to pick items that are lower in sodium.
If you do enjoy the occasional burger or fries, consider making these foods from home. As stated, you can control the ingredients and the total amount of salt used. You'll get a homemade, reduced sodium version of your favorite items.

, Another common source of sodium in many American's diet is processed meats.They're quite common and have become a staple in many people's diets.


Processed meats can include foods like: hot dogs, sausage, bacon, deli meat, smoked meats, salami and canned meats.
These types of foods use salt not only as a flavoring but also as a preservative. The sodium content can get very high for these foods.
Instead, try low-sodium canned meats and fish, making your own deli meat by roasting chicken or turkey breast and slicing for sandwiches, purchasing all natural sausage or bacon and purchasing fresh or frozen unseasoned meat.

, Most people know that canned items can be high in sodium. And they're correct — many canned foods are very high in sodium and should be limited or avoided if you're following a low-sodium diet.Canned soup is probably one of the top culprits of high-sodium canned items. They can range from 100 mg to 940 mg of sodium per serving.Make your own soup from scratch instead.
If you're purchasing canned vegetables or beans, look for cans that say ""low sodium"" or ""no salt added."" These will be your best bets.
However, if you cannot find an item that's low-sodium or no salt added, rinse the foods thoroughly before using to help remove some of the excess salt.

, If you're on-the-go and don't always have time to cook, you might be tempted to grab a frozen dinner. However, many of these frozen entrees are very high in sodium — even the ""healthier"" versions.Remember, salt is not only used as a flavoring, but also as a preservative which makes some of these frozen entrees higher in salt.
Make sure to read the food labels on these items. Many frozen dinners are marketed as ""healthy"" or ""low-calorie"" but have a whole day's worth of sodium. So regardless of what you're buying, look at the sodium on the label.
A good tip to follow is to buy a frozen meal with less than 600 mg of sodium per meal or serving., A tricky place that sodium frequently hides is in condiments, sauces and dressings. If you follow the portion size, the total sodium isn't all that bad. However, when you don't measure and use larger quantities, these salty sauces can really add up.The most common higher sodium items include: ketchup, salad dressings, hot sauce, soy sauce, tomato sauce and marinades.
Instead of these items, try making your own from scratch. You can also try looking for low-sodium versions of these at the store.
Also note that many low-fat or fat-free options — like fat-free salad dressings — have more sodium that the regular versions. Companies add the extra salt to make up for the decrease in calories.

Try the Master Cleanse.",How to Cleanse Your Body Through Fasting," While the goal of a fast is to help cleanse your body, that doesn’t mean everyone can do it. If you are have certain health conditions, or are not healthy enough to go without solid food for several days, fasting can be dangerous to your health.Do not fast if you have kidney disease. Cleanses will create high levels of potassium and other minerals in your blood. Because your kidneys aren’t functioning properly, this can be hazardous to you.
If you are diabetic, it is best not to do a juice fast. Relying on juices for your nutrition involves the heavy intake of sugars. This can cause your blood sugar to spike, leading to fatigue, unexplained weight loss, blurry vision, excessive hunger and thirst, and slower healing time for injuries and infections.
Do not do a juice fast if you are undergoing chemotherapy. Your body will be taking in increased antioxidants from the juices, and lower levels of protein.;
, Before undergoing any substantial change in your diet, you should discuss it with your doctor to make sure there aren’t other potential concerns. They will be able to let you know if there are certain aspects of your health you should be concerned about.If you are fasting for a specific health reason, you should make sure to do so under the supervision of a doctor or dietitian. They will help you keep track of your physical goals as well as keep an eye out for warning signs of other health problems.

, There is no one way to do a cleansing fast, and depending on your experience and interest in the program, you can fast for as little as a day, or up to several months.When thinking about your fasting length, consider your health, the cost, and your ability to stick with the program.


There are many different types of cleansing programs out there, each with their own recommendations for fasting time. Whichever one you pick, make sure you follow their guidelines. Extending the fast beyond their recommendations will not make it work better.
If you are new to fasting, you should start with a short fast of a day or a weekend. If you want to fast for longer periods of time, you’ll need to work your way up to that.

, Cleansing, either through a program or by using your own juicer, can be expensive. Cleansing programs can run to around $65 to $70 per day, which adds up for the several days or weeks you are on the program. Juicers are anywhere from $30 to $300, plus the cost of fresh fruits and vegetables to squeeze. Make sure you have saved the money you will need to go through your cleanse., If you are going on a water or juice fast, make sure you calculate how much liquid you intend to drink during your fast. This includes how often you intend to drink, and how much with each serving. You'll also want to be prepared for what comes next.


If you are cleansing through a program, they may supply juices for you. Make sure you don’t need additional supplements to that juice, and if you do, get enough for the length of the entire fast.Make sure you have the food you will break the fast with as well. Shopping for food after not eating for several days or weeks can lead to you buying too much of the wrong things. Make sure you have lots of easily digestible foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as liquid foods like soup.

, If your fast involves consuming teas or liquids at certain points during the day, make sure you do it. In most cases, you are using the cleansing juices as a replacement for your regular meals. Sticking to the schedule will keep your digestive system regular and on track, and help you stay disciplined with the program.Unless otherwise directed, a good rule of thumb is to have one glass of juice or water (depending on your cleanse) during each regular meal time. That means a glass when you wake up (for breakfast), one in midday (for lunch), and one in the evening (for dinner). You can supplement these with smaller glasses between meals to help keep you hydrated.

, The fasting is only one part of cleansing your body of toxins. Use this opportunity to take up other relaxation activities to help de-stress and revitalize your body. Meditation and yoga are both good ways to help clear your mind.Meditate. Find a quiet place and get into a comfortable sitting position. Close your eyes to avoid looking at the world, and focus on something other than your stress. It can be controlling your breathing, thinking about slowly moving each of your body’s muscles, or even just focusing on a distant object to the exclusion of all others. If it helps, you can also repeat a mantra to help clear your mind.

Try yoga. Make sure you have a clear, quiet space where you can move around without obstruction or interruption. Research several stretches to do on your own, and try them. If you aren’t comfortable working by yourself, you can always start attending a class. If you are a beginner, start lightly, and slowly increase the frequency and intensity of your exercise.
Exercise lightly. Fasting means that you won’t be taking in calories and nutrients found in food. If you do need to exercise and move around, stick to low-intensity workouts. Things like walking, or a brief swim, can give you a workout without pushing your body too hard. Avoid things like weight training or long runs., Your metabolism will be lower as you consume less, so you will need to conserve your energy. Make sure you are getting a good amount of sleep, around seven to eight hours each night, and that you are sleeping on a normal schedule. The cleanse is already a shock to your system; you don’t want to add another one by changing the way you sleep.


For the first few days, you may even consider going to bed a bit earlier than usual. This will help your body adjust to your changing levels of energy., Fasting should be temporary, and you will eventually need to go back to eating solid foods. When you fast, you take in fewer calories and nutrients like protein. Lowering your calorie count will diminish your energy and reduce your metabolism. If you don’t get enough protein, your body will begin breaking down muscle tissue for energy, causing you to lose muscle instead of fat., When you are finished fasting, you can’t just start eating like you did before the cleanse. Instead, start with a few days of low-fat foods, and slowly build up your intake of protein and complex carbohydrates. It can be up to a week to 10 days before you start eating like you did before fasting.For the first day or two, it is good to eat things that are similar to what you have already been consuming. These are fresh fruits and vegetables, in solid form this time, as well as natural foods like nuts and seeds. Liquid foods like soup are also good ways to ease yourself back into regular eating.As another way to ease back into the regular schedule, consider swapping out one of your meals with a glass of juice. This is another good way to avoid overloading your digestive system once the cleanse is over., One of the simplest fasts you can do is a water fast, where you consume nothing but water as a way to lose weight quickly. Drink one to two quarts of water per day, spaced out during regular meal times. You can supplement it with a slice of lemon.Your fast should not be very long, preferably under 72 hours. Also make sure you space out some time between fasts, at least 3 weeks, to build up your strength.You’ll want to avoid doing much of anything while on the water fast, so make sure you are prepared to rest often.If you can, spending your water fast in a supervised retreat or clinic, where you can be closely monitored by professionals, is the safest option.When done under medical supervision, water fasting can be a safe and effective means of normalizing your blood pressure. Usually it works best as a gateway to further diet and lifestyle changes, especially since you won’t be able to live off the water fast for more than a few days., This is a fasting practice that isn’t about not eating at all, but more about taking longer breaks between meals. There is a lot of flexibility in this kind of fasting, as you will be making the conscious decision to skip meals. This is a popular way to think about eating among people on the Paleo diet.A good starting plan is 16/8 method, where you restrict the times during which you eat. Find an eight hour window, say 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, and only eat during that time. That will give you 16 hours during the rest of the day where you will fast.
On some fasting plans, you don’t avoid eating on certain days, but simply consume less food. On the 5:2 diet, for example, you could replace a full dinner with something small like a cup of yogurt or piece of fruit two days out of the week. Part of the trick is to keep your calorie intake consistent on the other days, to make sure you are getting the right number of calories.This kind of fasting is meant to be tied to a healthier diet. Make sure you are consuming nutrient rich foods like fresh fruits and vegetables and protein-rich meats. Avoid processed foods and things high in salt and sugar.
This is not a good diet for people who like to snack every few hours. In addition, diabetics should avoid as long periods without eating can cause their blood sugar level to get too low.

, If you have never done a juice cleanse before, you shouldn’t just jump in. Try a beginner fast that will only last for a short time. This will allow you to see if fasting is right for you, and help you get started.You’ll want to get a variety of fruits and vegetables for your beginner’s diet. Look for hard foods with a high water content. These include carrots, apples, celery, beets, ginger, oranges, lemons, and leafy greens. Get a mixture of colors to get a variety of nutrients. Mix and match different vegetables to find flavors that you like. If you don’t like certain vegetables, you don’t need to eat them.
Drink slowly. Instead of making your juice and downing it as quickly as possible, help yourself by going slow. Take small sips, and don’t swallow right away. Swish each sip around in your mouth a bit to mix with saliva before swallowing.Fast for one to three days. If you are beginner, it will be hard to go much longer. Fasting over a weekend, Friday through Sunday, will let you break into the diet. Because it’s the weekend, you’ll also have more freedom in your schedule to make fresh juices and plan your consumption.

, One of the most common and popular cleansing diets, the Master Cleanse is a way to lose weight quickly. By consuming a specially mixed “lemonade” drink, you may be able to lose weight.Be sure to discuss your plan to fast with your doctor before trying it.


Start with the ease-in process. A few days before the fast, you’ll want to prepare yourself physically and mentally for the cleanse. Change your diet, switching your meals to organic fruits and vegetables, then juice.Make the lemonade. Mix 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice from half a lemon, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, 1/10 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and 1 to 2 cups of water. Cut the lemon in half, and juice each half separately. Mix the rest of the ingredients together with the lemon juice in a glass. Drink it right away, don’t let it sit or wait.Fast for 10 days. Most Master Cleanse practitioners won’t recommend going less than 10 days. Some people are willing to push for 14 days, or even as long as 30 days. The first time you try the master cleanse, more than 10 days is not advisable. After a few times going through the fast, you’ll have a better sense of how it affects your body and if you can push further.
After about 10 days, you’ll want to ease out. Start with orange juice, soups, and broths. Increase to raw and organic foods, and try to avoid adding processed foods and dairy."

Reduce your intake of red meat.,
Remove skin from chicken before cooking.,
Avoid foods that are cooked by deep frying.,
Perform a blood cholesterol test regularly.,
Try adopting a vegetarian diet, should the problem of high cholesterol become chronic.,
Control stress levels.,
Switch to foods low in calories.",How to Reduce Your Blood Cholesterol in Simple Practical Ways," Red meat is known to contain high levels of lipids and dangerous fats that makes the blood liquid levels thicker and more difficult to flow through veins and arteries. This fat accumulates around the walls of blood vessels and arteries of the heart, thereby constricting or obstructing blood flow. Trim excess fat from red meat before cooking.;
, Although the body requires natural essential fatty acids, other forms of lipids and dangerous fats present in chicken fat poses great danger to your health. An alternate healthier choice would filleted or deboned chicken.

, Snacks and fast foods like French fries and other savories should be avoided as far as possible. The oil content is extremely high in these foods. The body accumulates these oils as excessive fat reserves, indirectly increasing your cholesterol levels.

, Ask your doctor at a local clinic or community hospital to run frequent tests. In this way you can monitor and be made aware of any changes that are required regarding medicine regimen or eating habits. Rapid tests are also available at pharmacies, should you require one in a short space of time. Home testing devices are also available for regular personal use.

, Although not an ideal choice, vegetables have much lower levels of fats and lipids that are found in plants and are generally less lethal to the body than the animal fat/lipid types. Light salads, cooked or raw with salad dressings provide you with interesting alternatives when thinking of preparing a meal.

, High stress levels are directly linked with high cholesterol levels and cardiac disease. Sufficient sleep and lower stress levels compliments the body's regulating system to maintain optimal health.

, Avoid foods high in starch and sugar. These are stored in your body in the form of dangerous fats which in turn pose danger to your health. Have much fruit and vegetables as possible. Fruit acids occurring naturally in fruit is known to dilute the fats and lipids flowing in blood vessels.

Realize that HDL is not cholesterol.,
Understand new findings.,
Remember that HDL is made by the body.,
Understand that HDL works in tandem with LDL.,
Lose weight by exercising if you're too heavy.,
Quit smoking.,
Drink alcohol in moderation.,
Choose healthier fats.,
Eat more dark-colored fruits and veggies.,
Talk to your doctor about medications.",How to Raise HDL Cholesterol Levels," Contrary to popular belief, HDL is not a type of cholesterol; rather, it's a type of cholesterol carrier or shuttle.There's only one type of cholesterol and it's essential to the body because it's needed to make all cell membranes and some hormones. However, cholesterol doesn't dissolve in blood (it's hydrophobic) so it must be carried by protein-based transporters. HDL is a essentially a cholesterol scavenger because it picks up excess ""free"" cholesterol in your blood and carries it back to your liver for recycling, processing, and/or excretion. HDL is the smallest of the 3 lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL being the other main ones) and it carries the least amount of cholesterol.


HDL is called ""good"" because it supposedly reduces the build-up of cholesterol in arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis.;
, For many years, it has been thought that raising a person's baseline HDL level would also decrease his risk for cardiovascular disease. But this way of thinking is now being retired by scientists, as new information shows that it's more important to look at how HDL functions than simply how much HDL is in the body.


Scientists now believe that cholesterol-efflux capacity, which is a function of HDL, is what is really important to cardiovascular health.
It is not yet clear whether sex, race, obesity, insulin sensitivity or resistance, or inflammation influences cholesterol efflux capacity., Like all lipoprotein cholesterol carriers, HDL is made by the body (liver) and not found in food. The amount of HDL made is mainly genetically determined and is also related to the need for cellular repair, but all lipoprotein levels are influenced somewhat by diet and exercise programs. On the other hand, cholesterol is not only found in food (especially animal products such as meat, poultry, eggs, dairy and butter), but it's also made by the liver and, to a much lesser extent, the lining of the small intestine..


The liver removes cholesterol from the body by secreting it in bile, which is eliminated in the feces. This cholesterol regulation impacts lipoprotein levels, including HDL levels.

, Low-density lipoprotein or LDL is often called ""bad"" cholesterol, but really it's just a transporter that shuttles cholesterol away from the liver towards cells, including the damaged membranes of arteries. The problem occurs when the cholesterol in arterial walls builds up too much, because it attracts macrophages and triggers the formation of plaques — the hallmark sign of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries.HDL is always working in tandem with LDL and trying to balance the amount of cholesterol needed to repair the cracks and fissures in the arteries versus limiting too much accumulation of it.


In a physiological sense, there is no such thing as “good” or “bad” cholesterol, although certain types of lipoproteins are considered more health-promoting than others.

, Carrying around extra weight definitely impacts your HDL levels. In fact, if you are overweight, losing just a few pounds can improve your HDL levels — for every six pounds you lose, your HDL levels may increase by 1 mg/dL.Focus on reducing your daily calorie consumption and exercise on on a regular basis. Just 30 minutes of walking each day can lead to safe, consistent weight loss.


If your BMI (body mass index) is higher than 30, then you need to trim down for the sake of your overall health, not just your cholesterol numbers.
It appears that the most benefit of exercise on HDL cholesterol comes from programs that continue for a long period of time and involve mixed activities, such as aerobic and resistance training.Within two months, daily aerobic exercise can raise HDL levels by about 5% in otherwise healthy adults. Start by exercising briskly for 30 minutes at least five times per week, either by walking, running, cycling, or swimming.

, In addition to being correlated to a variety of diseases, including lung cancer, smoking cigarettes also has an unhealthy impact on cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratios. In essence, smoking tends to lower HDL levels (by an average of five points) and increases total blood cholesterol.Even secondhand smoke lowers HDL. The toxic compounds in cigarette smoke damage the insides of blood vessels and trigger the deposition of cholesterol in efforts to repair the damage. The net effect is plaque formation and a cholesterol ratio that favors LDL. Research proves the quitting smoking has a direct effect on raising HDL levels — in some cases, by as much as 10%.Talk with your doctor about safe options for quitting, such as nicotine patches or gum to help wean yourself off cigarettes.


Smoking damages virtually every organ of the body and causes all sorts of cardiovascular related problems, which contribute significantly to premature death.
Smoking is estimated to increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke by up to four times compared to non-smokers., Ideally, you shouldn't drink any alcohol because ethanol is toxic to the body and a known carcinogen. Regardless of its blood thinning properties, the net effect of ethanol on health is negative. However, at moderate levels (no more than one alcoholic beverage daily) some forms of alcohol have been linked to raising HDL levels.More specifically, red wine consumption is believed to be beneficial to cardiovascular health due to its high antioxidant content, which helps prevent blood vessel damage. Consequently, less cholesterol is needed as ""bandaids"" to repair arterial damage, which increases the liver's production of HDL in order to shuttle the cholesterol out of the bloodstream.


If you currently don't drink alcoholic beverages, don't start in efforts of raising your HDL levels. There are many more healthy methods.
The antioxidants in red wine have no relationship to the alcohol, so drinking fresh grape juice or eating the grapes raw is likely to provide at least as much cardiovascular benefit, if not more.

, A healthy diet always includes some fat — between 25–35% of your daily calories should come from fatty acids.However, saturated fat (from animal products) should be minimized (no more than 7% of daily calories) because it contains cholesterol and healthy plant-based fats should be focused on instead. As such, choose more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, as well omega-3 fats that are found in fish and flax seed. Avoid trans fats, because they are most damaging to blood vessels and can have the most negative impact on HDL levels. Keep in mind that eating cholesterol-rich food doesn't have a big impact on blood cholesterol levels because the liver plays an important regulatory role.


Good sources of monounsaturated foods include olive, peanut, sesame and canola oils, most nuts, and avocados.
Good sources of polyunsaturated fats include soybean and sunflower oils, walnuts, tofu, and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel.
Trans fats (hydrogenated fats) are found in many processed foods including cookies, crackers, fried foods and margarine.

, All fresh produce has health benefits, but those colored dark red and purple may both raise HDL and lower LDL levels. As noted above, grapes and other dark fruits are rich in antioxidants, particularly colorful compounds called anthocyanins. Research shows that consuming anthocyanins (in fruit or as supplements) can increase HDL levels by almost 14%, while decreasing LDL levels.Excellent sources of anthocyanins include plums, purple and red grapes, raspberries, blackberries, purple cabbage, and eggplant.


Eating more fruits and veggies also increases your fiber intake, which has been shown to help control total blood cholesterol levels.

, Although statin drugs are relatively effective at lowering total blood cholesterol levels, they don't have much impact on HDL levels (no more than a five to 10% increase).However, other medications, such as high-dose niacin and fibrates, can raise HDL levels significantly. High-dose niacin (Niaspan, Niacor) is usually considered the most effective medication for increasing HDL levels, although it's exact method of action is not clear. Niacin, also called vitamin B3, is a powerful vasodilator (relaxes arteries and lowers blood pressure) and some studies claim it can raise HDL levels by more than 30% in some people.Niacin must be started at low levels and can have a flushing effect that most people find very unpleasant.


Keep in mind even though the medications may raise your HDL, this will not increase your cardiovascular health.Various over-the-counter preparations of niacin are available, but prescription types are preferred due to less side effects (mainly flushing of the skin at high doses).
Fibrate medications include fenofibrate (Lofibra, Tricor) and gemfibrozil (Lopid).

Determine if you are a candidate for cholesterol testing.,
Determine an appropriate day and time for your test.,
Ask your doctor if you should fast before the screening.,
Don't drink alcohol or eat fatty foods before your test.,
Ask your doctor about any regular medications you should discontinue.,
Exercise for 30 minutes every day.,
Eat foods rich in soluble fiber.,
Consume polyunsaturated fats.,
Quit smoking.,
Ask your doctor if you should take a cholesterol-lowering drug.",How to Prepare for a Cholesterol Test," Most doctors recommend that all adults over the age of 18 get their cholesterol checked every five years. You might want to undergo more frequent testing, though, if you fall into a higher-risk category. Factors such as a family history of heart disease, obesity, lack of physical activity, diabetes, and smoking can exacerbate one’s risk of heart disease, so you should be particularly vigilant about cholesterol if you possess one of these qualities.Children are at a lower risk of high cholesterol, but it’s still recommended that a child receive one screening test between the ages of 9 and 11. Teenagers between 17 and 21 years of age should also get a cholesterol test.;
, While fasting is generally no longer required before a cholesterol test, there are still some considerations, such as prior surgeries, infections, pregnancy, or illnesses, which you should take into account when scheduling. For example, one should wait at least two months after a heart attack, pregnancy, or major surgery in order to ensure optimally accurate results., While non-fasting lipid testing is quickly becoming the standard throughout the world, there are some specific tests and scenarios when your doctor might stipulate fasting. For example, some medical professionals argue that triglyceride monitoring requires fasting for more accurate results.If your doctor has recommended it, you will need to abstain from eating anything for twelve hours before your test. Additionally, don’t drink any fluids but water., Alcohol and fatty or sugary foods can spike your cholesterol levels significantly in the hours following consumption, so you should avoid them in order to receive the most accurate results on your cholesterol test. Some particularly fatty foods to avoid include fried and greasy dishes, fatty steak or pork, and cheesy items.


Wine can also boost your 'good cholesterol' levels, distorting your cholesterol reading results even more.

, Some medications, such as oral corticosteroids, can significantly affect the results of a cholesterol test, so your doctor might want you to discontinue use for a day or two before the screening. Draw up a a full list of the medications you take regularly or semi-regularly and give it to your doctor at least a week before the exam.Don't forget to include any herbal or dietary supplements you take in this list., Whether your cholesterol test results came out high or you're just trying to maintain your good levels, you can help ensure a positive result at your next lipid test by making some basic lifestyle changes. Perhaps most importantly, physical activity is essential to raising levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL)—or “good cholesterol” as it is often called. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, jogging, or swimming, per day.Daily exercise can also be invaluable for managing one’s weight. This is important for lowering your cholesterol levels, as excess weight has been linked to high cholesterol and heart disease as a risk factor.

, Soluble fiber is important to a cholesterol-conscious diet, as it binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract and gets it out of the body. It’s recommended that you consume at least 20-35 grams of fiber a day, with five to ten grams of that being of the soluble variety.Some fiber-rich foods include oats barley, oat bran, beans, and eggplant., Including polyunsaturated fats in your diet can directly lower your low-density lipoproteins (LDL)—or “bad cholesterol” levels. Eat plenty of foods rich in these ‘good fats’—for example, nuts, vegetable oils, and fatty fish—and you may be able to get better results on your very next cholesterol test without taking any medication or supplements.Also be sure to avoid saturated fats and trans fats! Trans and saturated fats have been linked to heart disease and high ‘bad cholesterol’ levels, so keep them out of your diet at all costs. Trans fats are designed to extend shelf life, so you’ll find them mostly in fast food and highly processed products., Smoking is one of the risk factors most strongly correlated to high cholesterol and heart disease. If you’re a smoker, consider quitting this highly addictive habit for a plethora of health benefits. In addition to improving respiratory health and decreasing your chances of contracting cancer, you’ll also improve your HDL cholesterol levels.The cardiovascular benefits of quitting are so significant that it halves your risk of heart disease after just one year., If your doctor deems it prudent, you might be prescribed a regular medicine to help lower your cholesterol. Statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acids, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors are all popular drugs with demonstrated success in this capacity.Even if you end up taking a cholesterol lowering drug, you’ll still need to make corresponding lifestyle changes, such as performing daily exercise and monitoring your diet.

Choose foods in your diet that have been shown to reduce ""bad"" cholesterol and raise ""good"" cholesterol levels.,
Find an exercise program that specifically addresses blood cholesterol levels.,
Take nutritional supplements shown to help maintain normal cholesterol levels.,
Pay attention to your triglyceride levels.",How to Maintain Normal Cholesterol Levels," ""Bad"" cholesterol, also known as low-density lipoprotein or LDL, is responsible for plaque formation. ""Good"" cholesterol may carry cholesterol away from the arteries to the liver for elimination from the body, reducing heart attack risk. The relationship between the two, known as ""total cholesterol,"" is also a significant indicator of heart of health. In general, total cholesterol and LDL levels should be lower, while HDL cholesterol levels should be higher.


To raise HDL levels, increase your intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are found in peanut, canola and olive oils. Omega-3 fatty acids from walnuts, flaxseed and salmon, may also improve the ratio between HDL and LDL in the blood.
One of the best food substances for healthy LDL and total cholesterol levels is oat bran, found in oatmeal and other breakfast cereals. Foods with added plant sterols, such as some orange juice and yogurt products, may also be effective in maintaining healthier LDL levels. Read labels at the grocery store to discover which foods include this important substance.;
, While all types of exercise are healthy for the body, some workouts are more beneficial to the heart and cardiovascular system than others.


Aerobic activity is typically considered the best for maintaining healthy cholesterol levels. This might include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, dancing or bike riding. To get the full benefit, commit to at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity each day. This type of exercise has been shown to raise HDL cholesterol levels, although it does not impact LDL levels to a significant degree. Still, HDL levels are important to a healthy heart and can reduce the risk of medical conditions related to cholesterol.

, Supplements can be a natural, safe solution to medication, and are particularly helpful to those who have healthy cholesterol levels and want to take proper steps to maintain them.


Supplements that have been proven effective in maintaining normal blood cholesterol include fenugreek, garlic and niacin. Clinical trials dating back decades have shown niacin to be an effective ingredient for lowering LDL levels and raising HDL cholesterol. Fenugreek may lower total cholesterol and LDL, while garlic has a similar effect to Fenugreek, but for a shorter amount of time.

, Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the body. Higher levels of this substance may indicate a higher risk for diabetes. Many people who have an elevated triglyceride level may have higher total cholesterol and LDL levels as well.

Keep a Log Book.",How to Lower Cholesterol and Lose Weight," An exercise routine is important. This can be walking around the block, jumping on the treadmill for 30 minutes, or playing a sport.;
, Eating the right foods is the big step. You are what you eat. Below is an idea of how much you should eat. The most important rule: Don't eat any meat or dairy products. Read The China Study, it shows that eating meat is the biggest obstacle to losing weight no one realizes.


BREAKFAST- This is the meal of the day that wakes you up. It can be cereal with orange juice or simply jam on toast with orange juice, bread and low cholesterol butter with juice. You need to remember that breakfast is the energy source you need for the day. But remember, studies have shown that breakfast is the best meal to skip if you are trying to lose weight, so it's okay to skip if you are in a hurry, or just don't feel like eating.
LUNCH- Lunch is 12:30pm-1:30pm. This is when you have your main meals. Below shows what food and what size. Pasta/Rice/Potatoes- should be only the size of the palm of your hand. Bread- No bread at this point, only at breakfast. Again, no meat at all. Get your protein from nuts or beans. Salad- this is the size of your whole hand. Salad is the key to healthy eating.
Dinner- Salad with a piece of fruit.

, Sleep helps your metabolism and your body by relaxing.

, Decreasing stress is a really good option. To cope with stress you could sleep, pat your pet, exercise, playing sport, family time, breathing techniques, etc.

, See a doctor to help you lose weight. He/she may tell you additional options.

, Stop drinking, smoking, taking drugs, having coffee (tea is better), eating animal products, and minimize your soft drinks and all those slim stomach drugs.

, This is probably a really good way to lose weight.

, Have a bit of everything. Slow down on chocolates, candy, sugar, etc.

, Keep track on your progress. Check your BMI online.

Eat a healthy, balanced diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Stop smoking and stay away from second-hand smoke.,
Learn how to measure and manage your health by determining your cholesterol levels, blood pressure and body mass using BMI (Body Mass Index).",How to Prevent Atherosclerosis," Eating healthy meals will prevent atherosclerosis by keeping LDL cholesterol levels (known as ""bad"" cholesterol) low, reducing high blood pressure, and aiding in weight loss. To begin eating healthier, cut salt, sugar and other processed foods from your diet and instead eat high portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and smaller portions of dairy, meats and fish. Meet with your doctor or health professional to discuss and decide on the best diet that works for you.;
, To prevent atherosclerosis, begin exercising daily to lose weight, reduce high blood pressure and to lower your LDL cholesterol levels. Exercise will stimulate the enzymes that move LDL cholesterol from the blood to the liver, which turns it into bile that your body can easily expel. Perform aerobic exercise daily for between 20 and 30 minutes by walking briskly, running, swimming, bicycling or by performing any other aerobic activity you prefer.

, Smoking will cause plaque to build up, damages artery walls, and increase your blood pressure, putting you at a higher risk for atherosclerosis. Quitting smoking immediately will significantly lower many health risks.

, Eating healthy, exercising regularly, and quitting smoking will improve your health and prevent atherosclerosis, however you must know how to look for signs of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and of being overweight.


Check your LDL cholesterol levels. To check your current cholesterol levels, meet with your doctor or health professional to receive a blood test. Although you should keep your LDL cholesterol levels as low as you can, ideal LDL cholesterol levels are lower than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) unless you are at a very high risk for heart disease, in which LDL cholesterol levels should be lower than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Improve your ""bad"" cholesterol levels by eating healthy, exercising, and quitting smoking.
Check your blood pressure. Meet with a doctor or and health professional to determine your blood pressure levels. Doctors and health professionals state that the ideal blood pressure should be 120mm Hg (15.9 kPa) systolic pressure and 80mm Hg (10.6 kPa) diastolic pressure for adults. If your blood pressure falls into the high blood pressure range beginning at 180mm Hg (23.9 kPa) over 110mm Hg (14.6 kPa) then you should immediately begin to focus on lowering your blood pressure back to a normal level to help prevent atherosclerosis. Focus on eating healthy, exercising, and quitting smoking to help lower your blood pressure.
Calculate your BMI and determine your ideal weight. Have your BMI calculated using your current height and weight to determine if you are healthy or overweight. To calculate your BMI, you can visit your doctor or health professional for assistance or locate a BMI calculator on the Internet. If you are considered overweight or obese, begin eating healthier and exercise regularly to achieve your target weight.

Avoid drinking too much alcohol.",How to Keep Your Cholestrol Low," Healthy fats are better for your cholesterol than other types of fats, so picking healthy fats will help keep your bad cholesterol low. Unhealthy fats are mainly saturated fats, like those found in red meat, and trans fats, like those found in processed foods such as cookies and crackers.Monounsaturated fats are much better for your health, and are found mostly in plant-based foods such as avocados, peanut butter, seeds, nuts, olive oil, sesame oil, canola oil, and peanut oil.Also, look for foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as certain fish (think salmon, herring, and mackerel) and nuts.
That doesn't mean that you need to cut out saturated fat altogether, but less than 7% of your caloric intake should be from saturated fats.
However, you should cut out trans fats altogether if possible.;
, Some foods contain cholesterol already. While they don't affect your cholesterol as much as trans fats or saturated fats, they can still affect it somewhat. Some foods that contain cholesterol include egg yolks, full-fat dairy products, shrimp, and organ meats. Try to keep cholesterol to 200 milligrams a day., Both soluble and insoluble fiber are good for you, but soluble fiber, in particular, is helpful in keeping your cholesterol low. Make sure you eat whole grains, oats, fruits, vegetables, beans, and lentils on a regular basis to increase the soluble fiber in your diet.In the same vein, choose whole grains over refined grains, and try to avoid refined sugar as much as possible., You probably know that dairy products can help you get the calcium you need; however, you may not know that the whey protein in dairy products can help with your cholesterol. When choosing dairy, pick low-fat or no-fat varieties. You can also buy whey protein powder at places like health food stores, and you can use it in things like smoothies., If you're not doing it already, exercising on a regular basis can help keep your cholesterol down. Try exercising 30 minutes a day most days of the week. You don't have to do 30 minutes all at once. You can break it up into five- or 10-minute blocks if you need to.When you're first starting out, start with shorter periods of exercise and work your way up to 30 minutes a day.

, When getting exercise, you need to be exerting yourself enough to feel warm and be a bit out of breath; however, you should still be able to hold a conversation with someone, though you shouldn't be able to sing.Try to find an exercise you love. You can walk, run, use an elliptical machine, play tennis, do Zumba, swim, or play volleyball, just to name a few.

, A sedentary lifestyle, or one in which you do not receive regular amounts of physical activity, can lead to serious health problems, including elevated cholesterol.While baseline activities — such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or walking to a nearby store instead of driving — don't necessarily count toward your goal of 30-minutes of exercise (these types of activities are generally light, not moderate intensity), you can improve your overall health by increasing your baseline activity levels.


For instance, you can park your car further away when you go shopping.
When you take a break at work, try making a rotation or two around the office.

, It can be difficult to stay motivated with an exercise program; however, you can take steps to help keep you on track. For instance, make sure to choose programs you know you can stick to. In other words, don't bite off more than you can chew.Make small, gradual changes instead of trying to overhaul multiple areas of your life all at once. For instance, instead of jumping into an intense (and difficult to sustain) schedule of running five days a week, start by going for a 30-minute walk around your neighborhood three times a week.
It's also helpful to have a buddy to exercise with. That way, you both hold each other accountable.
Another option is to offer yourself small rewards. For instance, if you do your exercise for the day, you could allow yourself to watch your favorite television show.

, If you don't smoke, make sure you don't take it up if you want to maintain your cholesterol. Similarly, if you do smoke, try to quit, as smoking can lead to higher cholesterol levels. The best idea is to never start, so don't take it up even recreationally., Your cholesterol levels are affected by your weight; therefore, it's important to maintain a healthy weight for your size and body type. Talk to your doctor about what a healthy weight means for you.Eating healthy and exercising, the other parts of maintaining low cholesterol, should also help you maintain your weight.

, Alcohol can be detrimental to your heart health in a number of ways, though not directly to cholesterol. For one, it adds calories and sugar to your diet, increasing your weight. In addition, it can increase your triglycerides, which is also bad for your heart.If you're not a drinker, it's best not to take it up at all.
Don't drink more than a drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men.

Apply to college early.,
Try the Common Application.",How to Become a Pulmonologist1," While you are in high school, make sure to focus on getting a strong science background. This will set you up for success in your science classes in college. Make sure to take biology, physiology, anatomy, and chemistry, if your school offers them.


Although not as necessary as your science background, it may help to have a strong background in math, with focus on geometry and algebra. This will help you understand how the half life of drugs and the growth patterns of bacteria are determined.;
, While still in high school, look for opportunities outside of school to work, volunteer, or shadow a doctor, or a pulmonologist if possible. This gives you some experience and helps you to determine if you are truly interested in the profession. Through this, you can also meet people who may potentially become mentors or who will provide letters of recommendation for your pre-medical undergraduate work.


A good place to find opportunities is your high school guidance counselor. Their job is to help you find opportunities and they may have connections in the community you don't.
The Association of American Medical Colleges also compiles a list of internships for high school students. These internship will help you learn more about the profession, obtain positive experiences, and develop relationships that may help through medical school. , Before you apply from your undergraduate degree, you will need to take the ACT or SAT examinations.Most colleges and universities accept either the ACT or the SAT, but check where you tend to apply to make sure. You may want to take both and submit your better scores. Because the tests are different, many students find that they do better on one test compared to the other.


You can take these tests as early as your sophomore year and as late as the first semester of your senior. It may be smart to take the exam early so you have time to improve your scores if you don't do as well as you want the first time. You can also take them as many times as you want.
The test results are often available online within six weeks of taking the test. The examining agency will send the score directly to the schools you request because you aren’t able to send the scores yourself.

, Make sure you apply to college in time for early application and early decision. Most of the time, the deadline for this kind of admission is in November or very early December. Check the college or university you want to apply to for the date their application will be available and when their application deadlines are. You also need to make sure you apply for the pre-med program at the school of your choice, which will prepare you for medical school later.


Early decision and early application are different ways of applying. Early decision means that, if you are accepted, you make a binding agreement with that college to accept their offer. Early application means that you will hear about your acceptance or rejection early but still have until May 1st to make that binding agreement for attendance in the fall.
Because pre-med undergraduate programs fill up early and fast, it’s important to use the early application system and make your decision as soon as you can., More than 600 colleges and universities now accept the Common Application.This is one application available online which is then forwarded to all the schools that you want. This can save you time and money if you are applying to numerous programs.


Other colleges and universities have their own application system. For these, the applications are available and also submitted for early application through their websites. If you are unsure, call the office of admissions of the schools you choose to get this information.

It evaluates your problems solving, critical thinking skills ,and medical knowledge base.The average MCAT score for those accepted into medical school in 2013 was 30.Almost all medical schools in the United States and most in Canada require the MCAT for admission. The test results cannot be more than 3 years old, so make sure you plan on going to medical school soon after you take it.

, Just like when you applied to your undergraduate degree, you need to prepare early for medical school. You also need to apply to numerous institutions, because medical school is competitive and hard to get in to. Out of the 48,000 applicants to medical school in 2013, only a little over 20,000 got in. That's just 41% of applicants., Once you get into your choice medial school, the program is pretty structured. There is little chance for any individualization in your courses. All freshman have to take the same courses, have the same clinical options, and go through the same kinds of testing. This is true for all four years in medical school.


If electives are offered, they are often offered without credit., Medical school has a four year curriculum. In the first two years, you will take classes in physiology, embryology, biochemistry, anatomy, human behavior, cellular biology, and immunology. You will also have classes over the principles of each of the major body systems, including the respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, hematology, endocrine systems, and nervous system.


In the last two years, your in class work will focus more on you specialties. You will also shadow doctors in hospitals.
Class work includes information in pediatrics, family medicine, gerontology, obstetrics, internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, acute care, surgery, and ambulatory care. As you progresses through the successive years, you will spend more and more time in clinical practice and less time in the classroom. , During your fourth year in medical school, you will go through a rigorous research, application, and interview process in order to be matched with a residency program in a hospital somewhere in the US. You will then wait for Match Day, which is the third Friday in March each year. This is the date when you will be informed about whether you were matched with the residency program of you choice or if you were rejected.


Once you graduate from medical school, you will go into the residency program you were accepted into in the field of Internal Medicine with a focus in pulmonology, which is a subspecialty of Internal Medicine., Residencies for Internal Medicine are three years long. During this time, you will work long hours at the hospital and do rotations with physicians in their office.You will learn how to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases that affect adults. Once you go through this residency, you will be qualified to work with adults.


If you want to be a family doctor, you will go through a different residency designed to meet the needs of a family from birth to death.

, Once you finish your residency program, you should take a certification examination in pulmonology. This board certification is used to test your knowledge and certify your ability to practice as an Internal Medicine specialist in pulmonology., To practice medicine in any state in the US, you must be licensed. While board certification is encouraged, getting your license is required.Each state has different requirements, but all of them require proof of your graduation from medical school, documentation of your residency program completion, and letters of recommendation.


Individuals must contact their own state licensing board for the particular information required for that state and the application process., After you complete your residency program, you must apply for fellowship program Pulmonary Medicine.This can also be a grueling process and requires applications, interviews, and letters of recommendation. The pulmonary fellowship is typically two years in length, although they can be longer.During this time, you will learn about the symptoms of major and minor respiratory conditions, ranging from asthma to tuberculosis. You will treat people as part of a team with experienced pulmonologists. After this, you will have to pass a second set of board certification examinations in pulmonology. Then you are ready to be a pulmonologist.

Learn about what a pulmonologist does.,
Understand the surgical restrictions.,
Consider the salary range.",How to Become a Pulmonologist3," Before you decide to go to school for years to become a pulmonologist, you should know what kinds of diseases and procedures you will perform as well as your potential salary range. Knowing these factors can help determine if you want to pursue this career. Pulmonologists are specially trained to treat the conditions of the chest and respiratory system.This includes but is not limited to diseases and conditions such as:


Asthma
Bronchiectasis and Bronchitis
Pneumonia
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema
Cystic Fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis
Interstitial, occupational, and rheumatoid lung disease
Sarcoidosis, Surgeries on the pulmonary system are usually performed by a thoracic surgeon. However, as a pulmonologist, you can perform specialized testing. For example, you will be able to use flexible fiberoptic tubing to visualize the inside of the lung and extract tissue. You will also be able to perform angiographic visualization, where you inject dye into the pulmonary arteries to visualize the blood vessels leading to the lungs., If you are going to spend your life doing a job, you should consider how much pulmonologists make. In 2014, pulmonologists made an average of $258,000 per year. This figure was the mid-range between the lower end in Family Medicine, which is $176,000 per year, and the higher end in Orthopedics, which is $413,000 a year."

By quitting smoking you can raise your HDL levels by as much as 10%. Talk to your doctor to learn about smoking cessation programs in your area.You can also visit the American Cancer Society’s website for guides to help you quit: http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-toc
;
, Being overweight is also a factor in low HDL levels, so try to lose some weight if you are overweight. Even a small amount of weight loss can help to raise your HDL levels because for every six pounds that you lose, your HDL level may increase by one point. That means that if you lose 30 pounds, you may see a five point increase in your HDL levels., If regular exercise is not already a part of your lifestyle, then you should try to start an exercise routine. Walking for 30 minutes a day five days per week is a great way to start, but you can try other types of exercise as well. Make sure that you choose an activity that you will enjoy so that you will be more likely to stick with your program. Some good options include:walking or jogging
biking
swimming
dancing
using an elliptical walker
practicing martial arts
ice skating or roller blading
cross country skiing

, Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol has been linked with higher HDL levels, but you should not start drinking alcohol or begin drinking more alcohol as a way to raise your HDL levels. If you do drink, then limit yourself to one drink per day if you are a woman or two drinks per day if you are a man.Do not drink in excess or you may experience negative effects from drinking. If you drink more than the recommended daily amount of alcohol, then you will be putting yourself at a higher risk for high blood pressure, stroke, certain cancers, obesity, accidents, and suicide., Trans fats have a negative effect on cholesterol. They can raise LDL cholesterol levels while lowering HDL levels.To protect yourself from these negative effects, make sure that you avoid foods that contain trans fats such as:packaged baked goods such as pies, cookies, and crackers
margarine
nondairy coffee creamer
fried foods like French fries, doughnuts, and fried chicken
refrigerated cookie dough, pizza dough, or biscuit dough
snack chips like tortilla chips and potato chips

, Complex carbohydrates take longer for your body to process, so they will keep you feeling full longer and may even help you with your weight loss efforts. Eating complex carbohydrates will also help to ensure that you get more fiber, which can increase your HDL levels and lower bad (LDL) levels by causing you to excrete excess cholesterol.Some good complex carbohydrates include:oats
barley
millet
quinoa
buckwheat
rye
whole wheat bread and pasta
brown rice

, Red meat contains a high amount of cholesterol, which can raise your bad cholesterol levels.Limit your intake of red meat as much as possible and when you do eat red meat, make sure that it is grass-fed (not corn-fed) red meat. Other good protein choices include:Skinless poultry. It is important to avoid the skin because it contains a lot of fat and cholesterol, so it may raise your bad cholesterol levels.

Fish. Wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and they can also increase your HDL cholesterol levels.Beans. Beans contain protein and they are also low in fat and high in fiber. Try to include a serving or two of beans every day, such as black beans, garbanzos, white beans, and kidney beans.

, Eating more fruits and vegetables will increase your fiber intake and it will also help to ensure that you are getting plenty of vitamins and minerals. Green leafy vegetables also have high levels of sterols and stanols, which have help to improve your cholesterol ratio. Make sure that your diet includes plenty of:leafy green vegetables such as mustard, collard, beet, turnip greens, spinach, kale
okra
eggplant
apples
grapes
citrus fruit
berries

, It is crucial to drink lots of water to help with the elimination process. Try to drink eight 8 ounce glasses (about two liters) of water every day. You can add lemon, cucumber slices, or some fresh mint leaves to your water for some extra flavor.


Try carrying a one liter water bottle around with you during the day and make it your goal to drink the whole bottle by midday. Then refill the bottle and try to drink another full bottle by the end of the day.

, Niacin (taken as niacinamide) is a B complex vitamin that can increase HDL cholesterol levels and lower triglycerides. To increase your HDL cholesterol, you can take a niacinamide supplement of no more than 1200 to 1500 mg per day. Check with your doctor for a specific recommendation.


Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dosing as well.
Niacin is also available by prescription and prescription niacin tends to be more effective. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription niacin supplement., Beta-sitosterol and gamma oryzanol are plant sterols that can help to increase HDL levels and lower LDL levels. Check with your doctor first to see if this supplement is a good choice for you.


If your doctor says it is okay, then you can take one gram of beta-sitosterol three times per day or take 300 mg of Gamma oryzanol once per day. Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
You can also get plant sterols from eating seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils. Some foods are even fortified with sterols, such as orange juice and yogurt. Eating a couple of daily servings of sterol-rich or sterol-fortified foods may help to raise your HDL levels., Omega-3 fatty acids can lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL levels as well. If you eat a couple of servings of omega-3 rich fish (such as salmon, mackerel, or sardines) each week, then you may be getting enough omega-3s.If not, then taking a supplement may be useful.


Take two 3,000 mg capsules of combined EPA and DHA (total milligram count of these two fatty acids should not exceed 3,000 milligrams per capsule) every day.

, Garlic may help more with lowering LDL cholesterol than increasing HDL cholesterol, but it does decrease the cholesterol ratio.Try including a garlic supplement to see if this helps to improve your cholesterol ratio.


Try taking 900 mg of garlic powder every day. Make sure that you check with your doctor first because garlic can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners., Psyllium is a bulk forming laxative, which may help your body to excrete more LDL cholesterol and increase your HDL cholesterol levels. Try taking a daily psyllium husk supplement to support this process. These supplements are available as powders, capsules, and biscuits. You can use these supplements to help you meet your daily fiber goal of 25-35 grams.


Try taking two teaspoons of psyllium husk powder every day. This amount has about four grams of fiber.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.

Include soluble fiber into your daily diet.,

Include insoluble fiber into your daily diet.,

Eat the right amount of fiber.,

Eat foods made with whole grains.,

Read food labels.,

Try different food items.,

Incorporate high fiber foods into your breakfast.",How to Increase Fiber to Lower Cholesterol,"

Soluble fiber works in the digestive system to directly help lower your cholesterol level. In the small intestine, fiber binds to the cholesterol molecules and prevents the cholesterol from entering the blood stream and traveling to other areas of the body like the arteries. The bound cholesterol is then eventually excreted through the feces. Soluble fiber also forms a gel from absorbing water, which keeps the stomach full longer. This can help with weight loss. Weight loss also helps to promote lower cholesterol levels.
Oats have the highest proportion of soluble fiber of any grain. Some oat food sources high in soluble fiber include beans, peas, barley, citrus fruits, strawberries and apple pulp.;
,

Although insoluble fiber doesn’t directly affect your cholesterol level, it can help to decrease it by helping you with weight control. If you are overweight, insoluble fiber can help you lose weight by helping you feel full while eating fewer calories. When you eat fewer calories, you’ll lose weight, and most people who lose excess weight will see a resulting decrease in their cholesterol level.
Insoluble fiber also helps with weight control by adding bulk to your diet. It helps to prevent constipation, which will allow the soluble fiber to work more efficiently by moving undigested food through the intestines. Another benefit of insoluble fiber is that the foods high in insoluble fiber are more difficult to eat and chew, which takes longer to eat. This helps with weight control by preventing you from overeating; if you eat slower, you are much less likely to overeat since it takes your brain approximately 20 minutes to signal that you are full.
Some of the food sources of insoluble fiber include: whole wheat breads, wheat cereals, wheat bran, rye, rice, barley, cabbage, beets, carrots, turnips, cauliflower and apple skin.

,

Although many people do not eat the recommended amount of fiber daily, consuming the right amount of fiber is important in lowering cholesterol levels. The average daily fiber intake of Americans is approximately 12 to 15 grams per day. This recommended amount of daily fiber is based on the discoveries of both the health risks and the benefits of eating fiber made through hundreds of studies on the subject.
The average amount of fiber needed by most people is 25 to 30 grams daily. The number of servings of grains, fruits and vegetables that you need depends upon your calorie needs. If you need a total of 2,000 calories daily, you should eat 6 to 11 servings of grains and 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. If you need to restrict calories or have a lower calorie need, you should eat 6 to 7 servings of grains and 5 to 6 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.
It is not fully understood how fiber works to prevent diseases; however, studies indicate that over time a lower fiber diet can contribute to certain diseases and medical problems. Eating a diet low in fiber contributes to constipation, bloating, and weight gain even after only a short time period. After years of consuming a low fiber diet, diseases such as heart disease, some forms of cancer and many gastrointestinal disorders have been associated with this eating pattern.

,

Refined grains are those that are stripped of their outer coat, which lowers their fiber content. Foods that include whole grains have the outer coat incorporated into their recipes and are thus higher in fiber. The darker colored grains are typically higher in fiber content. For example, whole wheat bread will be higher in fiber than white bread.

,

Although you may think certain foods are high in fiber, remember to read food labels and choose those highest in fiber content. Many wheat breads vary in their fiber amounts, depending on how processed they are.
It is also important to observe the serving size of the food item so that you are aware of how much you need to eat to get the stated fiber amount. If the food is high in fiber, it will contain at least 5 grams of total fiber per serving.

, Many people tend to eat the same foods they ate when they were young. If you are trying to decrease your cholesterol level by increasing your fiber intake, you may need to add new foods to your palate.

Look through the grain section of your grocery store where rice and pasta are located and read the labels, looking for the fiber content of different grains. Select grains you’ve never had and use them like others you have used frequently. Some examples are: bulgur, quinoa and whole grain pastas. These can be cooked and kept warm or chilled in salads.
Add fresh or frozen vegetables to dishes you normally eat without those. Try adding broccoli to spaghetti or spinach and carrots to soups. You can also add more whole grain foods to chili like carrots or beans.
Add crushed bran cereal or oat bran to recipes like cakes, breads, muffins and cookies. You could also include whole grain breads in casserole dishes. You may have to adjust some recipes in regard to proportions of other ingredients. Sometimes adding a little more fluid (water, milk, etc.) will prevent the food from becoming too dry. In some cases, you can substitute the cereal or oat bran with the flour in the recipe.
Use dried beans whenever possible. Some examples are: pinto, lima, navy, black and red beans. Whether you use canned beans or cook them from raw sources, they will contain the same fiber content and quality. Dried beans are very high in fiber and are versatile in recipes. You can add them to pitas and salads for a cold meal, or add them to many hot meal recipes like chili, lasagna, casseroles, pizza, burritos and tacos. Beans can also be a protein replacement if you are out of meat products or do not eat meat.

, Many breakfast foods are high in fat and low in fiber. It’s important to choose high fiber foods when you start your day to help get the amount you need for the day.

Eat high fiber cereals or oatmeal. If you are lactose intolerant or do not consume milk products, you can try almond or soy milk in your cereal.
Add high-fiber foods to smoothies or yogurt. If you like a lighter breakfast, try mixing whole fruits and yogurt in the blender to make a smoothie. Another example of a light breakfast meal is to add whole grain cereal, pumpkin seeds, or dried fruit to yogurt.

You can also eat walnuts with plain or Greek yogurt or in trail mix. Try making granola with walnuts, or adding it to granola you have purchased.;
, An easy way to get walnuts into your diet is to include them in your breakfast. Throw a handful of walnuts in your cereal, quinoa, or your oatmeal. You can even have a few walnuts as a side to eggs.Mix walnuts with fruit and even yogurt for a breakfast parfait.

, Walnuts are easy to add to your lunch. When you eat salads, just place walnuts on top. If you’re having a bowl of soup, sprinkle chopped walnuts on top as a garnish. You can even put walnuts into pasta., Walnuts taste great when you add them to sauteed vegetables. As you saute the vegetables, just toss some in walnuts right before you remove the vegetables from heat.If you make a vegetable casserole, include walnuts in it.


You can also add walnuts into lentils, beans, rice, millet, or quinoa for a side dish.

, For a snack or topping, make walnut butter or a walnut spread. Puree walnuts into a walnut butter to spread onto bread or crackers. You can also thin the puree with olive oil or flax oil to get even more healthy fats. Use this as a dip, similar to hummus.Add any herbs you want to the spread for extra flavor. Some suggestions would be garlic or onions, dill, sage, thyme, or oregano.

, Walnuts pair great with meat. Use walnuts in turkey or chicken stuffing. Use them to make walnut-crusted chicken or fish."

Cut high-cholesterol foods from your diet.,
Try adding whey protein to your diet.,
Add soluble fiber to your diet.,
Use more olive oil.,
Add some avocado to your salad.,
Grab a handful of nuts for a quick snack.,
Feast on fish.",How to Get Bad Cholesterol Down1," Consume fewer foods derived from animals, like meats, dairy products, and eggs. These can be high in saturated fats and bad cholesterol. Even if you’ve been eating unhealthy for years, it’s never too late to modify your diet and make healthy changes.Saturated fats are solid at room temperature as opposed to healthier unhydrogenated fats, as those found in olive oil.
Avoid eating trans fats, too, like margarine, packaged cookies, cakes, and crackers. These items raise LDL and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is known as good cholesterol.
Trans fats may appear on labels as ""partially hydrogenated oil.""
A food that claims to be ""trans fat-free"" may in fact contain up to 0.5 grams of partially hydrogenated oils per serving. Check the serving size as well, as people often consume more than one serving in a sitting.;
, Whey protein is one of the two proteins found in dairy products. Adding it to your diet can offer the health benefits of dairy, without the added cholesterol and fat that can be found in many dairy products. Powdered whey protein is available at grocery and health food stores. Instructions on the product's label will tell you how to use it.Choose low-fat dairy when consuming whey based products, as these contain less animal-based fat (saturated fat).

, Soluble fiber helps reduce absorption of cholesterol into the bloodstream, so add high-fiber foods to your diet. The best strategy to add fiber to your meals is by eating more grains and fruits. Consider choices like oatmeal, oat bran, whole grain cold cereals, kidney beans, apple, pears, bananas, and prunes.5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber per day effectively decreases your LDL cholesterol levels. Every 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal, for example, equals 6 grams of fiber.

, Olive oil contains antioxidants, which help lower bad cholesterol. Swap out other fats in your diet, butter in particular, for about 2 tablespoons of olive oil daily. Extra-virgin olive oil is considered best, as it is the least processed.Swap out creamier, fattier salad dressings for a little oil and vinegar.
Use extra virgin olive oil, or another healthy cooking oil like canola, to sauté veggies, baste meat, and other cooking needs.

, Avocados are packed with nutrients, and it’s recently been suggested that an avocado a day can lower bad cholesterol and improve heart health. Slice up half or a quarter of an avocado, and add it to sandwiches, a salad, or eat it as a side dish. Guacamole is great, too, but skip out on the chips, which can be high in saturated fats and sodium. Instead, try out a crunchy veggie, like cucumber or carrot.Keep in mind avocados are high in calories. There are 9 calories per gram of fat, compared to 4 calories per gram in protein and carbohydrates, so a little can go a long way.
Avocado, and other foods containing poly- and mono-unsaturated fats, increases your ""good"" cholesterol.

, Nuts are a great, fast, and healthy source of energy, and a great alternative to other snacks that might be high in unhealthy fats or cholesterol. Make sure, of course, that they are not salted or sugar coated. However, since nuts are high in calories, it’s best to eat only a few at a time.Walnuts, pecans, and almonds are all heart-healthy nuts.

, Trade that hamburger or steak for salmon, halibut, albacore tuna, trout, or mackerel. Swapping out red meat for fish can lower your blood pressure and increase your overall health. Fatty fish contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which don’t reduce LDL levels themselves, but do reduce the risk of a blood clot or heart attack.Bake or grill to cook, so you don’t add any unhealthy fats.
If you don’t like fish, you can also get omega-3 fatty acids from canola oil or ground flaxseed, or add a fish supplement to your regimen. Always consult your doctor before taking supplements to make sure it’s appropriate and to verify the proper amount you should take.

Base your diet on whole, unprocessed foods.,
Plan your meals and shop weekly.,
Cook meals at home based on whole foods.",How to Eat to Lower Your Cholesterol1," The first step to lowering your cholesterol through food is to start basing your diet on whole foods and limiting the consumption of processed foods. This means eating foods that have been minimally processed or not processed at all.


Eat whole grains like brown rice or whole wheat pasta, oats and barley.
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Apples, grapes, strawberries and citrus fruits are rich in soluble fiber called pectin that lowers cholesterol.Try making a smoothie each morning to get the recommended five to seven servings each day.
Stick to lean, unprocessed meats. For example, choose chicken breast over a hot dog.;
, Adopting new food practices means taking some time to plan for meals and then shop for the necessary ingredients. Set aside 30 minutes each week to plan your meals.


Try making a master list of healthy and easy weeknight dinners. When you sit down each week to meal plan, you can draw from this list.
Ask your family to help with meal planning. Let them look over your master list and make suggestions for the week ahead.

, Whenever possible, cook your own meals or eat foods you have previously prepared at home. This will give you control over the ingredients and allow you to make healthy food choices.


Prepare foods ahead of time like chopped raw vegetables, grilled chicken breasts, or brown rice. These can easily be turned into a variety of whole foods-based meals during the week.
Try making rice bowls for an easy weeknight dinner. Top bowls of brown rice with your favorite meats, vegetables, and seasonings. Try brown rice topped with grilled chicken, black beans, veggies and salsa. You can even make the rice and grill the chicken ahead of time.

Eat 30 grams of walnuts each day.,
Keep walnuts properly.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Improve Your Cholesterol with Walnuts2," To help reduce cholesterol, you should eat at least 30 grams of walnuts each day. This is approximately 1/4 cup or one to one and a half ounce.This amount of walnuts is 196 calories, but since they are healthy fats, they are good calories., You can buy whole walnuts or buy them already shelled and in pieces at the grocery store. If you prefer whole walnuts, choose those that have their shells intact. If you are buying walnut pieces, make certain they are not shriveled. The walnuts should smell fresh. The polyunsaturated fats in walnuts can go rancid. When they do, the walnuts will smell bad.


You can store shelled and unshelled walnuts in the refrigerator for six months. If you store them in the freezer, they should be good for at least a year. You can store unshelled walnuts in a cool, dark, and dry place, but check them for unusual odors after a few months.If you have the room to store them, buying in bulk can often save money.
Make sure that your walnuts are not blanched. They should have the skin on them, which is a flaky, whitish, sometimes waxy covering on nut. The skin contains many of the healthier parts of the nut.

, Before starting any diet change for your cholesterol, make sure to discuss it with your doctor. Talk to your doctor, or a dietician, about your cholesterol, any cholesterol medication you are taking, and your health goals."

Know the difference between good and bad cholesterol.,
Understand the importance of walnuts.,
Recognize the nutritional value of walnuts.",How to Improve Your Cholesterol with Walnuts3," There are two main types of cholesterol, commonly referred to as “good” cholesterol (HDL) and “bad” cholesterol (LDL). Bad cholesterol is what leads to the hardening of arteries, which causes disease. Good cholesterol helps remove bad cholesterol from the blood.When you are trying to improve your cholesterol numbers, it is important to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels at the same time.

, Walnuts are tree nuts and rich in a number of different nutrients, including flavonoids which are highly effective antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, a form of Vitamin E that appears to be effective in protecting against heart disease, and substances that are effective in protecting against diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and potentially both prostate and breast cancer.


Walnuts are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are critical in reducing inflammation and in improving the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids that can effectively increase HDL-cholesterol while lowering the LDL-cholesterol levels at the same time., Walnuts are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. Just eating 30 grams will provide about 113% of the recommended daily value of omega-3 essential fatty acids. Additionally, 30 grams provide significant amounts of minerals, such as copper, calcium, iron, manganese, and molybdenum. Walnuts are also relatively rich in B vitamins.30 grams of walnuts is equivalent to ¼ cup of chopped walnuts or walnut pieces.


Walnuts also have significant amounts of fiber and a very low glycemic index, which means they release very low amounts of sugar into the blood.
The calorie levels are relatively high. A serving of 30 grams has about 195 calories. However, remember that these calories come from healthy fats.Limit your consumption of walnuts to no more than 1-2 servings per day, or ¼-½ cup (30-65 grams).

"
Stop smoking.,
Exercise daily.,
Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.",How to Get Bad Cholesterol Down2," Smoking lowers good cholesterol and increases the risk of heart disease. It damages your circulatory system and increases plaque buildup in your arteries. Both of these put you at greater risk of a heart attack or blood clot., If you get the okay from your doctor, exercise for at least 30 minutes every day. Additionally, try to be more active and less sedentary throughout your day. Regular exercise increases HDL levels and decreases LDL levels.Even simple exercises such as walking or stretching can help. If you don’t have time for 30 minutes straight, squeeze in 10 minute intervals.
Losing weight through diet and exercise is also beneficial: trimming even 5 – 10% of your body weight will lower your bad cholesterol levels and put less stress on your heart.Remember to talk to your doctor first to make sure daily exercise is recommended.

, Lowering your alcohol intake is recommended for those at risk for cardiovascular disease or who have high LDL levels. While there’s evidence that moderate drinking can improve HDL levels, or good cholesterol, the evidence doesn’t support starting to drink if you don’t already do so. Limit consumption to one drink a day for women, and two drinks per day for men."
"
Get a blood test to determine your cholesterol level.,
Consult with your doctor about taking supplements.,
Take a cholesterol lowering medication.,
Work with your doctor on a comprehensive plan.,
Understand the role of HDL cholesterol.",How to Get Bad Cholesterol Down3," Cholesterol testing should be routine for any adult. If you are at risk for cardiovascular disease, such as being overweight or having high blood pressure or diabetes, your LDL level should be kept low. Most doctors feel your target LDL level should be less than 70.


Those with moderate risk should target a level under 130. Low risk patients can reasonably keep a level of less than 160.
With HDL levels, however, the higher the number, the better. A score of 40 and under (50 and under for women) is considered a major risk. 60 and over is actually protective against LDL cholesterol.

, Studies have shown some natural supplements might help lower bad cholesterol levels. Examples include fish oils, artichoke extract, fiber supplements, and green tea extract. Ask your doctor about what you can add to your diet to improve your numbers, which choices to avoid, and what amount you should take., Anti-cholesterol drugs, known as statins, help eliminate LDL cholesterol. All medications have side effects, and many experts feel medication should be used as a last resort. Most would suggest diet and lifestyle changes be attempted first.


If a cholesterol-lowering medication becomes necessary, ask your doctor for a range of options and for a thorough list of side effects for each potential prescription.
Ask if you need to make any dietary changes specific for that medication, such as drinking more water than you usually would.

, Don’t let your doctor act as a prescription pad alone. Work together to build a plan that involves diet, exercise, and, if necessary, medication. If medication becomes necessary, ask how your doctor about lifestyle changes that will help lower the dosage of your prescription. They can help you put together an exercise routine and a diet tailored to your specific needs., It is important to remember that not all cholesterol is bad. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) picks up extra cholesterol in your blood and transports it to your liver, where it can be broken down.Raising HDL cholesterol by exercising, quitting smoking, or improving your diet can lower your risk of heart attack."

Nibble on dark chocolate.,
Drink red wine in moderation.",How to Eat to Lower Your Cholesterol2," If you’re not already using olive oil as your primary oil, you should be. Olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids which lower “bad” cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels when compared to corn oil.Olive oil is also rich in nutrients essential to cell health, as well as vitamin E., These all contain soluble fiber which reduces your “bad” cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by making it more difficult for your blood to absorb cholesterol. Aim for 10 grams of soluble fiber each day.


Try fiber-rich fruits like bananas, apples, pears, and prunes.
A cup and a half of oatmeal will provide you with 6 grams of fiber and is an easy breakfast option.

, Fatty fish are rich in omega-3s which have been shown to lower triglycerides. Salmon, tuna, trout, herring, sardines, and mackerel are good choices. The American Heart Association recommends all adults eat at least two servings per week.A filet of black cod, also known as sablefish, can be grilled, broiled, or seared for a quick and easy dinner.
If you eat freshwater fish caught locally by friends, family, or other anglers, be sure to heed local advisories about how much fish is safe to consume. These fish can sometimes contain high levels of heavy metals like mercury., Avocados are high in monounsaturated fatty acids. One study found that eating an avocado each day improved LDL levels in overweight and obese people. Spread some avocado onto a turkey club sandwich instead of mayonnaise.
Mash up an avocado with salt, pepper, and a dash of hot sauce for a quick afterschool or post-office snack. Serve with baby carrots, zucchini, or baked corn tortillas.

, Almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts are high in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids and work to keep your blood vessels healthy. They can also improve blood cholesterol.A handful is about 1.5 ounces or 42.5 grams.
Don’t eat nuts that are covered in salt, flavorings, or sugar. These will add empty calories and unnecessary salt and sugar to your diet.

, Not only has garlic been shown to reduce cholesterol, it also helps to prevent blood clots, reduce blood pressure and acts as a natural antibiotic.Add minced, pureed, or chopped fresh garlic to your dish — try to include 1/2 to one full clove daily. Dried garlic powder will also do the trick.
While garlic can significantly lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, the effects do not last long-term if you stop using it. Consider it a complimentary treatment to eating a balanced diet of whole foods., Studies have shown that drinking tea can lower your bad cholesterol. In one study, drinking tea lowered LDL cholesterol between six and 10% in only three weeks.Try replacing coffee and soda with a cup of black tea., The antioxidants in dark chocolate can raise your good cholesterol — in one study, participants saw their HDL cholesterol increase up to 24%.The flavanols found in chocolate can also improve blood flow to the brain and heart and can make platelets less sticky and prone to clotting.Choose dark or bittersweet chocolate, or use real cocoa powder to make yourself a cup of hot cocoa.

, Consumption of Tempranillo red grapes, which are used to make some red wines, can lower your LDL cholesterol.The resveratrol found in red wine also prevents blood clots and may reduce inflammation.

If you don't already drink, don't feel that you need to start just to reap the cholesterol-lowering benefits of red wine. Not drinking at all has greater health benefits overall.

Limit the amount of convenience foods you eat.,
Shop the outer perimeter of the grocery store.,
Allow yourself to cheat once in awhile.",How to Eat to Lower Your Cholesterol3," Frozen pizza, macaroni and cheese, and chicken nuggets might be quick dinner options, but convenience foods like these are often high in cholesterol, salt, unhealthy fats, and sugar. Whenever possible opt for dinner choices based on whole foods that you prepare yourself.


Make your own pizza at home rather than popping a frozen one in the oven. Use a whole grain crust and top it with fresh veggies if you have them handy.
Try making your own healthier versions of convenience foods you love, like homemade baked chicken nuggets.

, The outer edges of the grocery store usually contain the whole foods we need for a healthy diet including meats, fruits, and vegetables. Staying away from aisles containing processed foods will limit temptation to buy processed foods.


Stick to sections containing the nutrient-dense whole foods needed for a healthy diet, like the produce and meat departments.
Avoid aisles that contain items like frozen meals, potato chips, or soda.

, Many of us live in a world where processed food is readily available, cheap, and sometimes the only option. And that’s okay! Just try to limit your overall consumption to one meal or less per week.


It’s okay to eat your favorite potato chips as a snack once in awhile. Try dividing the bag into individual servings and limiting your consumption to a few times a week.
If you’re in a rush and a frozen pizza is the best option for dinner, that’s okay! Serve it up with a spinach salad.

Cut out bad fat sources.,
Choose healthier fats.,
Eat high-fiber foods.,
Look for plant sterols or stanols.,
Take whey protein supplements.,
Lower your carb intake.,
Consider a plant-based diet.",How to Lower Arterial Cholesterol1," Trans fat and saturated fat are the worst forms of fat, as they carry the highest risk of heart disease.Saturated fat is one of the biggest sources of cholesterol in many people's diets.Reducing or eliminating your intake of trans and saturated fats can help significantly reduce your cholesterol levels, when combined with other dietary and lifestyle changes.


Common sources of saturated fat include red meat, poultry, and full-fat dairy products.Trans fat is found in some meat and dairy products, as well as baked goods, chips (potato, corn, and tortilla varieties), fried food, margarine, and some non-dairy creamer.Avoid foods labeled with ""partially hydrogenated,"" as these are often high in trans fat.Health experts recommend limiting your saturated fat consumption to 10 percent or less of your total caloric intake, but advise even lower levels (no more than seven percent of your total calories) to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease.Trans fat intake should be kept as low as possible, as many doctors consider it one of the worst types of dietary fat in existence.;
, Our bodies need some fat, and it's important to choose healthy types of fat instead of harmful forms. Healthier sources of fat include monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and omega-3 fatty acids.Good sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats include avocados, olive oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, and corn oil.Common plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids include ground flaxseed, canola oil, soybean oil, walnuts, and sunflower seeds.Fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids. Choose healthy fish like salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines, and herring., Certain high-fiber foods have been shown to be beneficial to the heart, and can even lower cholesterol levels when paired with other lifestyle changes.That's because soluble fiber reduces the absorption of cholesterol in the bloodstream, and can reduce your overall LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels.Good sources of soluble fiber include oatmeal, oat bran, kidney beans, apples, pears, barley, and prunes.Aim to eat at least five to ten grams of soluble fiber each day to help lower your total and LDL cholesterol., Sterols and stanols are naturally-occurring plant components that have been shown to help block the absorption of cholesterol in the body.Incorporating plant sterols and stanols into a heart-healthy diet can help reduce your cholesterol levels and lower your risk of heart disease.


Plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels by five to fifteen percent, according to some studies.Eat at least two grams of plant sterols/stanols each day to see results in your cholesterol.Sterols are naturally occurring in all plants. Excellent sources of naturally-occurring plant sterols include vegetable oils, nuts/legumes, grains, cereals, and many leafy vegetables.Sterols/stanols are usually added as a fortified supplement to certain foods, including some types of margarine, orange juice, and yogurt drinks. Not every margarine or orange juice will be fortified, so check the label to confirm that a given product has added sterols/stanols., Whey is one of the two primary proteins in dairy products. Whey protein supplements have been shown to lower both LDL cholesterol and overall cholesterol levels.Whey protein powder is a common form of this supplement. You can find it at most health food stores and many grocery stores. Dosing will vary depending on the brand and formula you use, so it's best to follow the instructions on the package., Some studies suggest that a diet low in carbohydrates can help reduce the arterial accumulation of lipids, including cholesterol. Though more research is needed on the subject, it shows promising results in potentially preventing atherosclerosis in people with high cholesterol levels.A heart-healthy low-carb diet should focus on lean protein sources, like poultry, fish, eggs, or tofu, as well as non-starchy vegetables.Most low-carb diets limit daily carbohydrate consumption to roughly 60 to 130 grams.Talk to your doctor about low-carb diets and other options before beginning any dietary plan.

, Studies have shown that plant-based diets, like those followed by vegetarians and vegans, can help lower LDL cholesterol and significantly reduce the risk of heart disease compared to meat-based diets.While many vegetarian- and vegan-friendly foods are still high in sugar and trans fat, a plant-based diet that incorporates fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils is generally considered to be very heart healthy."

Lower your cholesterol intake.,
Reduce your consumption of saturated and trans fats.,
Evaluate the meats you eat.,
Increase the amount of fruit and vegetables you eat.,
Eat more fiber.,
Monitor your sugar consumption.,
Talk to your doctor about supplements.,
Don’t take red yeast with lovastatin.,
Ask about niacin.",How to Control Cholesterol Without Statins1," The Mayo Clinic recommends that people eat 300 milligrams or less of cholesterol per day. For people with heart disease, the recommended amount is even lower, at 200 milligrams per day. You can reduce the amount of cholesterol you eat by:Using egg substitutes instead of eating eggs. The yolk is high in cholesterol.
Drinking skim milk instead of whole milk.
Eating lean meats like fish and poultry.
Avoiding organ meats.;
, These fats increase your cholesterol levels. A better alternative is to eat monosaturated fats. You can do this by:Cooking with monosaturated fats such as olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil.
Avoiding saturated fats such as butter, solid shortening, sausage, hard cheese, milk chocolate, lard, cream, coconut and palm oil.
Eating lean meats such as poultry and fish. If you eat fatty meats, trim the fat away.
Reading the packaging of commercially prepared foods. Many foods that are marked trans fat-free do actually contain trans fats. If the ingredients list partially hydrogenated oils, the product contains trans fats. Common products with trans fats include margarine and store-bought cookies, cakes, and crackers.

, You can reduce your cholesterol by trimming the fat from your meats and opting for lean meats such as poultry and fish. Some types of fish are even better than eating poultry:Cod, tuna, and halibut have less fat and cholesterol than poultry. Try substituting fish in place of beef, pork, or chicken at least twice per week.
Salmon, mackerel, and herring contain omega-3 fatty acids which are good for your heart.

, Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and vitamins and low in fat and cholesterol. Try to eat four to five servings of fruit and four to five servings of vegetables per day. A serving is approximately a half a cup of cut vegetables. You can:Substitute a piece of fruit for dessert in the evenings. Healthy alternatives to ice cream and cakes include apples, bananas, and fruit salads. Don't add sugar to the fruit salads because this increases the calories.
Take fresh fruit and vegetables with you to snack on throughout the day. Carrots, peppers, apples, and bananas are easy to bring with you wherever you go.
Start your meals with a salad. By eating the salad at the beginning of the meal, you are likely to eat more of it because that is when you are most hungry. You can keep the salads interesting by putting different combinations of fruits and vegetables in it.
Serve vegetables as part of your main dish. Substitute squash or cooked vegetables for pasta or rice.

, Fiber can help lower cholesterol. In addition, foods that are high in fiber, like whole grains, will help fill you up so that you don’t overeat. Tasty options include:Brown rice instead of white
Whole-wheat pasta
Whole grain bread
Oatmeal
Bran

, Sugar and other simple carbohydrates may increase your risk for having high triglycerides. Triglycerides are additional fatty materials that are in your blood. Eating a low sugar diet will help prevent them from getting too high.Cut sweets like candies, cakes and pastries from your diet.
White flour is also a simple carbohydrate. Reduce the amount of baked goods you eat that are made from processed white flour. This includes white breads and many store-bought crackers, cakes, and muffins.

, Many natural supplements have not been scientifically demonstrated to reduce cholesterol. In addition, it is important to discuss supplements with your doctor because some may interact with other medications, including over-the-counter medications. Supplements are not strictly regulated, so the dosages and ingredients may be be inconsistent. It is particularly important to discuss any supplements with your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child. That being said, some people have reported positive effects from the following:Whey protein
Artichoke
Barley
Beta-sitosterol
Blond psyllium
Garlic
Oat bran
Sitostanol

, Lovastatin is the active ingredient in the drug Mevacor. When it is taken as part of a supplement, it is not regulated to make sure that the dosages are consistent. This means you could be taking a dangerous amount without realizing it.Check the ingredients on any red yeast supplements. If it contains lovastatin, do not take it.

, Niacin is a B3 vitamin that can inhibit production of bad cholesterol, increase your good cholesterol, and lower triglycerides.Niacin must be taken in high doses in order for it to work, so you'll need to take it with the guidance of a doctor, as risks include liver damage, gastrointestinal problems, or glucose intolerance.You may also experience flushing while using niacin (characterized by a warmth, itching, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin). However, as you continue to take niacin, flushing should subside.
Flushing can be made worse by drinking alcohol or hot beverages.

Get more exercise.,
Lose excess weight.,
Stop smoking.,
Limit or avoid alcohol.",How to Lower Arterial Cholesterol2," In order to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, it's important to live a healthy lifestyle. You should aim to get at least 30 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic activity at least five days each week. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, or 75 minutes per week of high-intensity exercise.Walking, bicycling, swimming, and jumping rope are all excellent forms of aerobic exercise., Doctors recommend a weight-loss plan for patients who are overweight and have high cholesterol. That's because being overweight puts more strain on the heart and raises your blood pressure.Even losing just a few pounds of weight will help improve blood pressure and lower the risk of atherosclerosis.If you are overweight and experiencing high cholesterol levels, talk to your doctor about a weight-loss plan that's right for you. Often times, changing your diet and increasing your daily exercise levels can help you lose weight and live a healthier life.

, Smoking is widely considered a factor in atherosclerosis and heart disease.Even occasional or light smoking habits can damage the heart and blood vessels, and increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis.If you're a current smoker, talk to your doctor about ways to give up tobacco and lead a healthier lifestyle., Regular consumption of alcohol in excess has been shown to raise blood pressure, and may contribute to atherosclerosis. Excess alcohol consumption can also cause weight gain, which is another factor that contributes toward atherosclerosis.To track alcohol consumption, adhere to the recommended consumption limits.The NHS calculates units of alcohol in a given serving by multiplying the strength (alcohol by volume) times the volume (in milliliters) and dividing that total by 1,000. The recommended daily maximum for alcohol consumption is approximately one to two glasses of wine or beer."

Know when to seek help.,
Try statins.,
Take Ezetimibe (Zetia).,
Try bile acid resins.",How to Lower Arterial Cholesterol3," If diet and exercise alone do not lower your cholesterol levels, you may need to take medication. If you are concerned about your weight, your cholesterol levels, or your overall lifestyle, talk to your doctor about developing a plan and taking cholesterol medication., Statins are a class of drugs that slow down or stop one of your body's enzymes responsible for producing cholesterol. Statins are one of the most successful medications for lowering cholesterol levels. Some studies suggest statins can reduce LDL cholesterol by 20 to 55 percent.Common statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).Some people experience muscle pain, joint pain, and changes in liver enzyme levels. Do not take statins if you have liver disease or are pregnant., Ezetimibe helps lower the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the body. It can be taken in conjunction with statins, but even on its own Ezetimibe has been shown to reduce LDL levels by 18 to 25 percent.Ezetimibe may cause joint pain, diarrhea, and sleepiness. Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how Ezetimibe will affect you., Bile acid resins are a class of drugs that bind to cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestines, then eliminate them through bodily wastes. This class of medications has been shown to reduce LDL levels by 15 to 30 percent.Common bile acid resins include cholestyramine (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid) and colesevelam (Welchol).This class of medication may need to be taken with other cholesterol medications to effectively reduce cholesterol levels.Possible side effects include stomach pain and constipation."

Cut sweets from your diet.Added and refined sugars may cause an elevation in triglycerides, so one of the fastest ways to lower your triglycerides may be to cut down on your sugar intake.,
Reduce your refined carbohydrates.,
Eliminate alcohol.,
Eat more omega-3 fatty acids.Omega-3 fatty acids are considered to be ""good"" fats, and the regular consumption of omega-3s can help your body develop lower levels of triglycerides.,
Consume plant-based foods.,
Get plenty of fiber.,
Monitor your fat intake.,
Limit fructose.Fructose is the sugar that is found naturally in most fruits, and is also present in honey and some forms of table sugar.",How to Lower Triglycerides Quickly1," This is because sugars are often unneeded calories that are converted to triglycerides (a form of fat) for storage in the body.


Limit your added sugars to less than 5 to 10 percent of your calories. For women, this means that sugars can take up to 100 calories per day. For men, this means that sugars can take up to 150 calories per day.
Avoid things like sweet desserts and concentrated fruit juices.;
, White rice and baked goods made with white flour or semolina can cause elevated triglycerides in some individuals. If your doctor suspects that it might be an issue for you, reducing your refined carbohydrates can have a quick impact on your triglycerides.


Instead of eating refined carbohydrates, choose breads and pastas that are made from whole grains.
Diminish your overall intake of carbohydrates, and consume more protein in your diet instead. Proteins have a lower ""glycemic index"" than carbohydrates, meaning that they are absorbed more slowly into the bloodstream. This, in turn, is helpful to lower blood sugars as well as to lower blood ""lipid"" levels (including triglycerides). Healthy fats are also a great dietary addition as these help to stabilize blood sugar and can in turn help to lower triglycerides.

, Alcohol can increase triglycerides, especially in those who are more sensitive to it. It is strongly recommended that you eliminate alcohol from your diet while you are trying to lower your triglycerides.


After your triglycerides have returned to an acceptable level, you may gradually re-introduce alcohol back into your diet. However, avoid drinking too much or too often, since having too much may cause your levels to jump back up again.

,


Eat roughly two servings of fatty fish per week. If you do so consistently, you may see a change in your triglyceride levels.
Fatty fish rich in omega-3s include salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, and trout.
Other sources of omega-3s include ground flax seed, flaxseed oil, soy, legumes, walnuts, and dark, leafy green vegetables. Mix these additional sources into your diet on a daily basis.
A good-quality omega 3 supplement can be extremely beneficial as these help with overall omega-3/omega-6 ratio.

, Particularly if you select the protein in your diet from plant-based sources (rather than from red meat), you may find that your cholesterol and triglyceride levels can be lowered significantly.


Dried beans, peas, and soy are all plant-based products that are rich in protein.
You can also consume chicken as a replacement for red meat, as this is a better alternative to moderate your triglyceride levels.

, Fiber helps regulate the way that food is absorbed and passed through your body, and high-fiber foods can significantly lower both your triglycerides and cholesterol.


Fiber combines with water in your intestine to form a gel-like matrix to which fats attach; this diminishes the percentage of fats (including triglycerides) that are absorbed into your body. An added bonus is that fiber maintains the health of your digestive tract in other ways too.
To get more fiber in your diet, increase the amount of whole grains you eat. You should also eat more beans, fruits, and vegetables.
Fiber also makes you feel full, which can prevent you from over-eating.
Drink more water when you increase your fiber. Otherwise, you may experience moderate to severe intestinal upset.

, Saturated fats and trans fats can be especially harmful, and cutting as many as possible from your diet can greatly affect your triglycerides in a positive way.


Packaged foods and fast foods are big culprits responsible for these ""bad"" fats. Animal products and anything made with hydrogenated vegetable oil may also be a problem, as well as shortening, lard, or margarine.
Opt for mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, instead. Your body needs to take some fat in, but these sources are considered healthier and will not impact triglycerides as much. They include olive oil, canola oil, rice bran, walnut oil, and flaxseed oil.

, Limiting fructose levels to less than 50 to 100 grams (1.8 to 3.5 oz) per day can help you lower your triglycerides faster.


Fruits lower in fructose include apricots, citrus fruits, cantaloupe, strawberries, avocados, and tomatoes; if you are going to consume fruit, these are the preferable ones to choose.
Fruits higher in fructose include mangoes, bananas, plantains, grapes, pears, apples, watermelon, pineapples, and blackberries; these are fruits to avoid, or at least limit in your diet.

Choose oatmeal or oat based snacks.,
Include healthy omega 3 fats.,
Snack on fruit.,
Sip on a cup of green or black tea.,
Indulge in a piece of dark chocolate.,
Skip the sweets treats.,
Ditch snacks with saturated or trans fats.,
Avoid refined white flours.,
Skip sweetened beverages.,
Munch on guacamole and whole grain corn chips.,
Make your own heart healthy trail mix.,
Cool down with frozen chocolate covered banana pops.,
Whip up an high fiber oat smoothie.,
Snack on a tuna and white bean salad.",How to Choose Snacks That Lower Cholesterol," You may know from TV commercials that oatmeal or oats can help lower cholesterol. This high fiber grain has been shown to help lower cholesterol levels making it a great food to include in a snack.


Oats contain a type of fiber known as soluble fiber. This particular type of fiber (also found in foods like beans, apples, prunes and barley), helps decrease circulating levels of LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol in your body by binding to dietary cholesterol in the gut and preventing its absorption..Since oatmeal falls into the grain food group, you need to follow appropriate portion sizes for grains. Measure out about 1/2 cup of cooked oats or about 1 oz of oats per serving.Incorporate oats into your favorite snacks. Try: having a small bowl of oatmeal in the afternoon, a homemade granola bar made with oats, making homemade granola with oats (sprinkle over your favorite yogurt) or using oat flour to make high fiber cookies or muffins.;
, Another group of foods that is commonly associated with improve cholesterol levels are foods that contain healthy fats. These fats, known as omega 3 fats, can help improve and manage your cholesterol levels.Studies have shown that those people who eat more of these heart healthy fats typically have higher HDL levels (""good"" cholesterol), lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Omega 3 fats are found in a wide variety of foods like salmon, tuna, mackerel, nuts or avocados. However, not all of these are the best snack foods.
Instead try foods like: salmon or tuna jerky, a small handful of nuts (maybe mixed with oat granola) or avocado.

, Another great snack option is fruit. This food group offers a lot of fiber (especially soluble fiber), vitamins and is relatively low in calorie making it a great option for a cholesterol lowering snack.


Some fruits have higher levels of pectin which is a soluble fiber. Similar to oats, soluble fiber helps your body decrease circulating levels of cholesterol by limiting absorption.Like all foods, fruit needs to be portion controlled. Measure out about 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or have 1 small piece of fruit.Limit your daily intake to 1 1/2 to 2 cups per day. If measuring dried fruit, consider a 1/2 cup of dried fruit to be the same as 1 cup of fresh fruit.
The fruits with the highest levels of soluble fiber include: apples, grapes, pears, citrus fruits, peaches, apricots and strawberries.
To incorporate these fruits into your snacks, just eat them plain, dice them up into a salad, add to a bowl of high fiber oatmeal or add on top of a yogurt.

, Many types of tea have become a more popular healthy food due to the amount of antioxidants they have been found to have. Black and green teas in particular contain antioxidants that have been shown to help lower cholesterol levels.Green and black tea has cancer-fighting antioxidants known as theaflavins.Studies have shown that this compound in particular is responsible for improving blood lipid levels.
One study from the USDA in particular showed that black tea was able to lower blood lipid levels like cholesterol by about 10% in 3 weeks.Green tea can also help to lower your cholesterol in small numbers. It won't reduce your cholesterol from a high risk number to a low risk one, but drinking green tea in combination with avoiding foods high in cholesterol will help you lower your cholesterol.Brew either hot or cold black tea to sip on with your afternoon snack. Try to limit how much sugar, honey or agave syrup you add. If you use sugar, keep it to one teaspoon per cup of tea.

, Need a good reason to grab that piece of dark chocolate? Studies have shown that small quantities of dark chocolate can help lower cholesterol levels and even prevent it from sticking to the insides of your artery walls.Dark chocolate contains a few compounds that can help you manage your cholesterol levels. This sweet treat contains antioxidants known as procyanidins and epicatechins and oleic acid (a type of fat) that have shown to have positive effects on cholesterol levels.
The antioxidants have been shown to help prevent the oxidation of LDL (the ""bad"" cholesterol) from sticking to the inside of your artery walls. The oleic acid, even though its a type of fat, has been shown to reduce total cholesterol levels.
Choose a type of dark chocolate that is comprised of at least 60% cocoa solids. This is where all those beneficial nutrients are.
A small 1-2 oz serving of dark chocolate makes the perfect snack. However, be careful not to down the entire bar or several pieces.

, Newer research has now clarified that one of the key food ingredients in Westernized diets has a more significant effect on cholesterol. Sugars, especially added sugars, have been found to be more harmful than foods that contain cholesterol (like eggs).Sugar is a common part of the Westernized diet. Unfortunately, studies have shown that these sugars have had negative side effects. Sugar lowered the HDL or ""good"" cholesterol and increased both total cholesterol and triglyceride levels.To limit how much sugar, especially added sugar, you're getting in your diet, skip sweet treats.
Items like cookies, cakes, muffins, pastries, ice cream and candy should all be limited in your diet. Only have these items very occasionally and in a very small portion.

, Unlike omega 3 fats, there are some types of fats that are actually harmful to your body and can raise cholesterol levels. Both saturated and trans fat need to be monitored in your diet when you're trying to manage cholesterol levels.


Both saturated and trans fats have been implicated in the increased occurrence of elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, heart disease and diabetes.Although some newer research does show that saturated fats may not be as harmful as previously thought, you should still consume these in moderation.
Saturated fats are found in foods like: fatty beef, lamb or pork and full fat dairy products like butter, cheese or whole milk.Trans fats are found in foods like: fried foods, fast foods, pastries, cookies, cakes, crackers, margarine and frozen pizzas., Like refined sugars, refined flours like white flour are equally as detrimental to your health and cholesterol levels. Do not choose snack foods that are made with refined grains either.


Studies have shown that foods made from refined carbohydrates are even more detrimental to your cholesterol levels than saturated fats.Refined carbohydrates are the result of flours, like wheat, being highly refined. All of the beneficial nutrition has been stripped away. Unfortunately, many foods in Westernized diets are full of refined carbohydrates like white flour.
To avoid having an impact on your cholesterol, avoid snack foods that are made from refined carbohydrates like this.
Avoid items like: white bread, crackers made with white flour, snack cakes, bagels, muffins, pastries and sugary cereals.

, In addition to foods that can cause high cholesterol, there are beverages that are equally as unhealthy. Just like foods, sweetened beverages have been linked to higher cholesterol.


Skip sugary, sweetened beverages like: smoothies, sodas, fruit juices, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas, lemonade and sweetened coffee drinks.
Instead, stick to unsweetened, beverages like: water, sparkling water, flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee and tea.
Health professionals recommend consuming at least 64 oz or about 8 glasses of clear fluids each day. However, you may need even up to 13 glasses daily.Keep in mind, though, that these recommendations do not take into account chronic health conditions that might be exacerbated by excess fluid intake.

, Get a little healthy fat into your afternoon snack by having some homemade guacamole. It's a tasty snack that's healthy for you and your cholesterol levels.


Mash up an avocado in a large bowl. Use the back of a fork, spoon or potato masher. You want to get it to a fairly smooth consistency, however a few lumps is OK.
Add in about 1/4 cup of diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup of diced onions, 1 clove of garlic minced and 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice and season with salt and pepper.
Bring half of your guacamole mixture as your afternoon snack. Keep it sealed in an airtight container. Serve with whole grain tortilla chips for an extra hit of fiber.

, If you're craving a little sweet and salty for your snack, consider making your own homemade trail mix. You'll get a dose of heart healthy fats in this tasty snack.


Start by picking out two or three of your favorite nuts. Walnuts, almonds, pecans, cashews and peanuts all contain varying levels of heart healthy fats.
Measure out 1 cup of each type of nut. You want to end up with about 3 cups of nuts total.
Also measure out 2 cups of your favorite dried fruit. Try to find unsweetened dried fruit to keep the sugar content low. You can do dried cherries, blueberries, cranberries or strawberries.
Toss together and keep your trail mix sealed in an airtight container or baggie until read to eat. Measure out about 1/3 cup for your snack serving.

, If you want a sweet treat in the afternoon, indulge with a dark chocolate covered banana. It's the perfect afternoon snack.


Make these snacks in advance so that you can pull one out whenever you get a snack craving.
Start by halving a few bananas. Carefully push a popsicle stick about half way up the banana.
In a small bowl, melt about 1 cup of semi sweet or dark chocolate chips. You can melt in the microwave. Heat for about 30 seconds and then stir. Repeat until the chocolate is melted.
Dip your banana pops into the chocolate until thoroughly coated. Lay flat on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Keep frozen banana pops in an airtight container in your freezer until ready to eat.

, If you want to sip on something sweet and creamy, make a fruit and oat smoothie. You'll never know the oats are in there providing you with an extra hit of soluble fiber.


In the cylinder of a blender add: 2 cups of your favorite fruit sliced, 1/4 cup of almonds, 1 cup of your favorite yogurt and 1/2 cup of rolled oats.
Turn on the blender and process until your smoothie is creamy and smooth. You may need to scrape down the sides of blender one or two times during the processing to get everything combined.
Taste and adjust for seasonings and consistency. This recipe serves 2.

, If you want a little bit heartier afternoon snack, consider making a tuna and white bean salad. This is perfect to serve with whole grain crackers in the afternoon.


Start by draining a 5 oz can of tuna. Place tuna in a medium bowl and flake gently with a fork.
Also add about 1/2 can of drained and rinsed white beans. It'll be about a cup of beans that you add to the tuna.
Drizzle in 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1-2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of minced basil and salt and pepper to taste.
Stir gently and taste for seasonings - adjust as needed. Serve alone or serve with some whole grain crackers.

Public screenings, while sometimes cheaper, are not recommended for adolescents or children. Adults should also be wary and make sure the screenings are done by a reputable company. They must have appropriate recruitment, reliability, properly trained staff and referral, and the necessary educational materials available to be acceptable.
Some worksites provide screenings. These focus more on small-scale screenings with the potential of a higher reward, especially in follow-up and referrals.

, A cholesterol test measures your HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The test is conducted by taking a small blood sample from your arm, which is then analyzed in a laboratory. The result will show your cholesterol level in millimoles per liter of blood (or milligrams per deciliter of blood in the United States) and it will be interpreted by your physician based on your age, family history, and blood pressure.You will get three numbers back from your cholesterol test: your total cholesterol, your total HDL (good cholesterol) and your total LDL (bad cholesterol). A high overall cholesterol score does not necessarily equal bad health, as it could be high due to a prominence of HDL.To find your cholesterol ratio, divide your HDL (good) cholesterol number into your total cholesterol number to get your ratio. For example, say your total cholesterol level is 200. Your HDL level is 50. This would make your cholesterol ratio 4:1.A desirable total cholesterol number is below 5.2 mmol/L (below 200 mg/dL)
A near optimal level for LDL is 2.6 – 3.3 mmol/L (100-129 mg/dL)
The best HDL level is 1.5 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) and above.
The estrogen hormone in women might cause higher levels of HDL cholesterol.

, High blood pressure is one of the first major indicators of heart disease and stroke. If you have high blood pressure it is because the strain on your heart, arteries, and kidneys is unhealthy and likely caused by high cholesterol.You can control your blood pressure by eating healthy, exercising regularly, reducing stress, staying fit, avoiding tobacco products, and limiting alcohol. It can be difficult to make lifestyle changes. Consider asking your regular physician for a referral to a therapist who can help you manage the transition.
Most importantly, be aware that you have high blood pressure. There are few, if any, symptoms of high blood pressure, so it is your responsibility to get it checked. You get your blood pressure checked each time you visit the doctor's office but if you have issues with high blood pressure your doctor may recommend an at-home testing kit.

, High blood sugar could lead to complications related to diabetes. Diabetes is known to lower HDL (good) cholesterol and raise LDL (bad) cholesterol, increasing the risk for heart disease and stroke.


This condition is known as diabetic dyslipidemia. A side effect of this condition is atherosclerosis in which the arteries become clogged with cholesterol.
If you have a family history or are at risk for diabetes, reduce your weight, eat healthy, and increase your physical activity. These actions can greatly reduce the progression of diabetes.
Medication is also available if you have trouble controlling high blood glucose levels and to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

, An active lifestyle is not only rewarding but also helps to prevent many conditions associated with high cholesterol. Make an effort to participate in daily physical activity. It will maximize your health and increase the length and quality of your life.Any exercise that makes your body warm enough to perspire, and breathe heavily is healthy for your heart and helps reduce cholesterol. Some options include walking, swimming, cycling, jogging, skiing, or climbing.
Pick something that is comfortable for you and that you enjoy. That may be a structured exercise program, an individual daily routine, or a routine you engage in with a workout buddy. Keep in mind that if you genuinely enjoy your exercise routine you're more likely to stick to that routine.

, Eating healthy is the most impactful action that you can take to better your health and lower your risk in numerous health categories, including high cholesterol. Make an effort to adopt a healthier overall diet.Learn how calories work and how many you should consume daily. Consider that most food labels are based on a 2,000 calorie diet and that you will need to figure out if you need more or less than that depending upon your age, gender, and level of physical activity. Talk to your doctor or a certified dietitian about making a meal plan that's healthy for you.
Regular physical exercise is a good way to maintain your weight and lower your cholesterol.
Variety and balance is the best strategy. Make sure to get enough nutrition from each of the recommended food groups. Foods rich in minerals, proteins, and whole grains are low in calories and can help you control your weight.
Limit saturated and trans fats, sodium, red meat, and sugary products as all these can raise cholesterol levels.
Refrain from adding salt, sauces, or creams to your food.
Drink fat-free (skim) and low-fat (1%) dairy products; choose plenty of fiber-rich whole grains; and two to three servings of fruits and vegetables daily.
Eat fish containing omega-3 fatty acids twice a week, or consider other good sources of omega-3s, like avocado, olive oil, or nuts.
Drink alcohol in moderation. This means one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men.

, Maintaining a healthy weight will reduce the burden you place on your internal organs, especially your heart. Living an active lifestyle that helps you reach and maintain a healthy weight will keep your blood pressure down and your high cholesterol at bay.The simple equation is to reduce the amount of calories entering the body compared to the amount of calories burned by the body. By eating more calories that your body burns, your body will store the excess energy as fat and you will gain weight.
One pound is equal to approximately 3,500 calories. To lose one pound per week you would need to reduce the intake of calories by about 500 per day through a combination of diet and exercise.
Learn how many calories are in the foods you normally eat and take the appropriate measures to either cut unhealthy food out of your diet or reduce it to an acceptable level.
It is hard to keep track of calories at the grocery store; therefore, make a quick list with the calories written down beside them in a typical meal. This way you can better gauge what you are buying and eating.

, High cholesterol can be deadly because there are rarely any symptoms associated with it. Other factors —like risk for heart attack or stroke, which result from high cholesterol — should be taken into consideration when deciding to get tested or not.Work with your doctor to develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle plan to lower your cholesterol levels and improve your overall health. Your doctor can give you the best advice as they are familiar with your specific medical history and risk factors.
High cholesterol is usually the direct result of a poor diet, obesity, lack of exercise, and exposure to tobacco products. Strive to manage your diet to lower cholesterol. Aim to eat less meat and more fresh vegetables and fruits.

, Many health organizations recommend that all people between the ages of 20 and 79 get tested every four to six years. Other organizations recommend getting a cholesterol test based on age and risk factors for heart disease.For men, testing is recommended if you are 35 or older; however, if you're between the ages of 20 and 35 and are at risk for heart disease, testing might be recommended sooner.
For women, testing usually starts when you are 20. It may start earlier if you have an increased risk of heart disease.
Children should only get tested if family history indicates they are at risk.
All adults who already have high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, or diabetes should get tested at least once a year.

, Cholesterol does not dissolve in the blood. Instead, it must be carried throughout your blood stream by lipoproteins (lipid proteins). There are two types of lipoprotein carriers: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Your total cholesterol count consists of both LDL and HDL, and one-fifth of your triglyceride level (type of fat).LDL, the bad cholesterol, contributes to the thick, hard deposit of plaque that clogs arteries, leading to a condition known as atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and tries to pass through the blocked artery it will prevent blood from getting to your heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.
HDL, the good cholesterol, helps remove LDL cholesterol from the arteries by carrying it back to the liver to be broken down. Blood cholesterol consists of 25 – 35% HDL.

"
Regulate your caloric intake.Pay close attention to how many calories you consume in a day and see if you can cut back (consult your doctor to find a safe and achievable goal).,
Eat smaller portions.,
Exercise.Moderate exercise is an essential part of lowering both cholesterol and triglyceride levels.,
Quit smoking.Quitting smoking is an essential step in reducing one's risk of heart disease, and also in lowering triglyceride levels.",How to Lower Triglycerides Quickly2,"


This is especially useful if you are overweight or obese. Excess weight could be a source of elevated triglyceride levels.
Most women should aim to consume 1,200 calories per day, while most men should aim for 1,800 calories per day (this may vary depending on activity level and other factors). If you are in graver need of losing weight or lowering your calories, your doctor may put you on special diet involving even fewer calories, but you should not put yourself on such a diet without approval from your doctor.
Also avoid snacking late at night before you go to sleep.

, Consuming smaller, more frequent meals is better than eating two or three large ones.

,


Resist the temptation to set a rigorous exercise regimen. You may think that starting out with a challenging exercise program will lower your triglycerides quicker, but this is a bad move in the long run. Starting with something too difficult increases the likelihood of you quitting the program sooner. Begin by introducing 10 minutes of exercise into your daily routine, adding a minute or two every week until you can comfortably reach 30 to 40 minutes.
Add variety to your routine. Walk one day, bike another, and follow an exercise DVD on yet another. Get creative. By introducing variety into your exercise program, you can keep things from getting boring. It may also help you to find a form of exercise you actually consider to be fun!

,


Smoking contributes to several ""cardiovascular risk factors,"" including increased blood clotting, damage to the arteries, and worse control of ""lipid levels"" (including triglycerides) in the blood.
If you quit smoking it will dramatically improve multiple areas of your health. See if you can find a program in your area that helps people with the process of quitting. Or, visit your physician, who can also provide guidance and support.

Take a fibrate.Common fibrates include gemfibrozil and fenofibrate.,
Try nicotinic acid.,
Find out about prescription omega-3s.,
Learn about statins.",How to Lower Triglycerides Quickly3,"


Fibrates are carboxylic acids, a type of organic acid made of carbon and oxygen. They area also amphipathic, meaning that they are drawn to both fats and water.
These drugs increase HDL levels while decreasing triglyceride levels. They accomplish this by reducing the liver's production of a particle that carries triglycerides.
Be aware that fibrates can cause digestive upset and liver irritation, along with gallstones. They are also dangerous to use with blood thinners and may cause muscle damage when used with statins.

, The most common nicotinic acid is niacin.


Nicotinic acid is another carboxylic acid.
Like fibrates, nicotinic acid reduces the liver's ability to produce triglyceride-carrying particles called VLDL, or very low density lipoproteins.
Nicotinic acid raises HDL cholesterol (""good cholesterol"") more than many other medications of this type.
Consult your doctor prior to using this medication as it can interact with other medications and have dangerous side effects. Possible severe side effects include difficulty breathing, severe stomach pain, jaundice, and dizziness. Although these are uncommon, they are important to be aware of.

, Naturally consuming more omega-3 fatty acids can make a difference in triglyceride levels, but high doses of prescription omega-3 supplements can lower triglycerides even more effectively.


Prescription omega-3s usually come in the form of fish oil pills.
Only take high doses of omega-3s under the instruction and care of a doctor, as they could interact with other medications. Too much omega-3 can severely thin out the blood and lower blood pressure. It can also lead to elevated levels of blood sugar and may impair liver function. Mental disorders can also be triggered.

, The most commonly used statin is atorvastatin. Other statins include fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin.


These drugs lower cholesterol by blocking an enzyme known as HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme has a key function in producing cholesterol.
The main purpose of a statin is to reduce LDL cholesterol. It can also reduce triglycerides, but the drug tends to be less effective than many other types of medications prescribed for this purpose.
Statin side effects are rare but severe. Muscle damage is the main side effect, especially when used in conjunction with a fibrate, but it can also cause liver problems and increase your risk of diabetes.
Beware of symptoms of excess omega-3 intake. These may include oily skin/breakouts, cravings, greasy hair and overall feeling of sluggishness.

Substitute water and green tea for high-calorie beverages.",How to Raise Good Cholesterol and Lower Bad Cholesterol," HDL, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acts as the body's waste-disposal system in the blood. HDL combs through blood for bad cholesterol, LDL, and flushes it out to your liver for disposal. HDL lowers inflammation throughout the body and may even help against Alzheimer's., High cholesterol does not have overt side effects, but it can be devastating on your health.Illnesses that come from bad cholesterol are serious, and should only be treated by a healthcare professional. Your doctor may suggest changes in lifestyle or diet if your HDL measures less than 60 mg/dL.


While in-home cholesterol tests are on the market, they have not yet been as accurate or trustworthy as a basic blood test.

, Having ‘good cholesterol’ is a combination of limiting LDLs and increasing HDLs. While you may be doing one of these very well, it is helpful to see the big picture if you are falling behind on the other. To calculate total blood cholesterol, add your LDL, HDL, and 20 percent of your triglycerides.Triglycerides are body fat, so you want this number to be lower.
Aim for a total blood cholesterol under 200. Above 240 is considered to be high., Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood. People whose HDL levels are beneath 60 mg/dL are considered at risk for heart disease. Aim for a higher number of good cholesterol (higher than 60 mg/dL but less than 200 mg/dL).People whose HDL levels are less than 40 mg/dL are considered seriously at risk for heart disease.

, If you lose 6 lbs (2.72 kg), you can increase the good HDL that removes bad low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Losing weight involves a combination of eating healthy and exercise. You can lose weight without doing both, but most successful weight loss regimens have both at their core. For more on losing weight, see this guide.


Don't starve yourself. Losing weight is all about eating healthy foods, according to correct portions, at the right times. If you starve yourself, your body will prime itself for deprivation and begin to store fat, almost like a bear before hibernation. Eat well in the morning, and progressively less as the day wears on.
Don't expect to lose weight quickly. If you shed a couple pounds a week, consider yourself very successful. Most people who try to lose serious weight get discouraged and quit just as the real battle begins because they don't see real results. Remember that slow and steady wins the race to reduce the chance that you yoyo.

, Increase your heart rate for at least a half hour 5 times a week by doing things like playing basketball, raking, walking, running, bicycling or swimming. Gyms can be great exercise tools, but try not to completely upend your daily routine at once. Enthusiasm for drastically new and exciting exercise routines often ends with a return to inactivity.


If you have trouble finding time to exercise, break your exercise into three 10-minute sessions. At work, take a break and go for a brisk walk for 10 minutes before your lunch break and during or after lunch and when you get home. If you find it difficult to do this, you may not be ready to move onto an intensive workout routine yet.
To get the most out of your exercise, try interval training.Interval training involves short bursts of intense activity followed by longer periods of lower activity. Try running around the track at full speed for one lap, followed by three laps of jogging.

, You should eat meat in moderation, and opt for leaner cuts.Try swapping out meat for vegetable or bean alternatives once or twice this week in meals you normally eat meat. Those with vegetarian diets should also take care to make sure they are getting the right nutrients throughout the day.


In an ideal world, most of your fats should be monounsaturated fats, as they lower overall cholesterol but maintain HDL. Monounsaturated fats include nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, pecans), avocado, olive oil, sesame oil, and tahini., Alcohol consumption has been linked to lower rates of heart disease, interestingly enough. A drink or two per day may improve your HDL. Red wine especially has been linked to higher HDL and even lower LDL levels., Smoking has been linked to lower HDL levels. Your risk of heart disease and other related illnesses decreases drastically within hours of quitting. Additionally, quitting smoking may make it easier to do the exercise necessary to lose excess weight., Due to age, disability, or other health issues, your body may not be able to regulate cholesterol. The optimal level of low-density lipoproteins is less than 100 mg/dL, although numbers between 100 mg/dL and 129 mg/dL are okay.Your doctor may recommend drugs if your LDL level is at 160 or higher.


Statins are the most common and preferred cholesterol-lowering medication.
For those who display adverse reactions to statins, other prescribed cholesterol-fighting treatments include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, resins, and lipid-lowering therapies.

, Consume oats, whole grains and high-fiber foods. Brazil nuts, almonds and walnuts may help lower LDL. Since many of these can be snacks, it is easy for you to supplement your diet with heart-healthy foods.Omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish, flax seed, flax seed oil and fish oil supplements can help lower LDL and raise HDL. Fatty fish include salmon, flounder, haddock, catfish, sardines, bluefish, herring, albacore tuna and anchovies.
Eating substances called sterols and stanols may help. Sterols and stanols are in orange juice, some yogurt drinks and some margarines formulated to help fight bad cholesterol.An easy way to add good fats is to swap out butter for canola or olive oil, or add flax seed.

, Saturated and trans fats are the ""bad"" fats, and double-whammies at that: they lower your HDL and heighten your LDL.Replacing saturated and trans fats with good fats (see above section) will help you lower your LDL levels.


Saturated fats include butter, lard, shortening, whipped cream, coconut, and palm oil.
Trans fats include partially hydrogenated oils, margarine, ramen noodles, and fast food.

, Water provides essential nutrients to organs and doesn't contain any sugars that promote LDL. Green tea has substances that reduce bad cholesterol. While tests continue to shed more light on coffee’s risks and benefits, most agree that coffee corresponds to increased cholesterol levels. Since most recent research has debunked many long-standing myths about coffee's negative health effects, it may not be necessary to abstain entirely. With a balanced diet, you can safely consume coffee in moderation."

Use a cholesterol-free egg substitute.,
Replace fats with fruit purees.,
Use banana in recipes.,
Include soy-based products in your baking.,
Lower baking times and temperature.",How to Enjoy Cholesterol‐Friendly Desserts1," To remove cholesterol from dessert recipes while baking, substitute for the eggs with a cholesterol-free alternative. A whole, regular egg has 210 milligrams of cholesterol, while egg whites and egg substitutes (e.g. Egg Beaters) contain none. Eggs generally serve as the binding agent in recipes and must be replaced in specific ratios.One large egg should be replaced by two large egg whites or 1/4 cup of egg substitute.;
, Fruit purees can be a sweet, light substitute for fats in recipes, such as butter and shortening. Fats usually add moisture to baked desserts, which results in a lighter, finer texture. Apple sauce and pureed, canned pears are good alternatives that do not significantly alter the taste or appearance of your baked goods.Replace fats cup-for-cup with fruit purees.

, Mashed banana can be used to replace eggs in recipes (1/2 cup for 1 egg) to lower cholesterol. Bananas also add sweetness, bind the mixture, and provide potassium and magnesium. Note that bananas will lend their distinct flavour to the recipe, so make sure this addition will work in your dessert., Soy protein is a good alternative for many foods that are high in animal fats. Whenever possible, use soy as a substitute for its cholesterol-heavy counterparts in dessert recipes. For instance:Substitute soy nut butter for butter
Use soy milk instead of regular milk
Use soy cheese in place of regular cheese (e.g. in a cheesecake)

, Low-cholesterol recipes are often likely to bake faster than regular recipes because of the lower fat content. Try lowering the recommended temperature of the oven by 25 degrees, and start checking your dessert 5-10 minutes before it should be done baking. Check your baked goods for lightly browned edges or a springy texture to make sure they are done."

Be aware that you might be sensitive to vitamin E. Some people do develop sensitivities to oils that contain Vitamin E; however, it is not certain that the Vitamin E is responsible for the allergy.,
Use the correct dosage.,
Use Vitamin E that is combined with another oil.,
Use very little of the oil in your daily skin regime.,
Finished.

",How to Use Vitamin E Oil," It acts as an antioxidant, removing damaging substances from the skin. These substances, called free radicals, can arise from normal cellular metabolism. Vitamin E also performs a number of other functions on the skin:Vitamin E also absorbs UV radiation from the sun and can help prevent sunburn, functioning as a natural sunscreen.
Vitamin E may also act as an anti-inflammatory agent on the skin surface.
Vitamin E has also been implicated in promoting skin wound healing and may be involved in reducing scar formation.;
, If you are trying to reduce the size or the look of a scar, use a Q-tip or a cotton ball to apply the oil directly onto the scar. Consult your physician or dermatologist to determine how often you should treat.


If the area of scarring is relatively small, it may be simpler to snip the top off of one or two Vitamin E capsules. You can also puncture it and squeeze out the oil directly onto the scar.
If you have any skin conditions, including eczema, psoriasis, or acne, consult with your physician or dermatologist before using Vitamin E.

, Vitamin E can refresh dry, brittle hair. It is also great for dry scalps. Vitamin E promotes circulation, which is key to a healthy scalp. Pour out some of the oil and dip your fingers in it. Work it into your scalp. Focus on the roots of your hair, where the vitamin can soak into the hair and the scalp.You can also apply it to the length of your hair to moisturize dry hair.
Unless otherwise advised by a health professional, treatment once a week should be sufficient. Again, you don’t want to over do it.
If you have any skin conditions, including eczema, psoriasis, or acne, consult with your physician or dermatologist before using Vitamin E.,


Vitamin E also plays an important role in the immune system, cell-to-cell signaling, the regulation of the expression of a number of genes and a variety of biochemical (metabolic) reactions.
Alpha-tocopherol also may play a role in stopping or slowing down the growth of certain types of tumors and decreasing the chances of heart disease by possibly slowing down the formation of plaques within the arteries and preventing the aggregation of platelets (slowing the formation of blood clots)., To lessen the change of a bad reaction, get natural, organic Vitamin E oil.


The Vitamin E oil will be mixed with other oils, such as sesame oil, coconut oil or cocoa butter. Make certain that you don’t have any sensitivity to those by testing the oil on a small part of your skin. Put just a little bit on your wrists and wait for about 30 minutes to an hour. If you have no reaction, such as itching, blistering, redness, or any other problems, you should be able to use that oil.
Some products may also contain vitamin C, in the form of lemon or another citrus oil. This is believed to increase the degree of skin protection., Consult with a dermatologist to figure out the best dosage for your particular needs. Many of the commercial products have over 5,000 IU (an international unit of pharmaceutical measurement) of Vitamin E listed. This is actually a really large dose. There have been few studies to determine what dose is the most useful for skin. In addition, many labels don’t give you a good idea of how much Vitamin E is in each dose. Thus, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much to use on your own.


The temptation is always to use more but the fact is, we just don’t really know. It may be just fine to use as much as you want, but the research just has not been done.

, Unless you are working with a dermatologist, the most prudent approach is to use Vitamin E oil on your skin in a mixture of other oils that can also moisturize and help nourish the skin. Many of the oils contain Vitamin E as well. Choose other oils in the mixture that won’t clog your pores, which are called non-comedogenic. The best non-comedogenic oils, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, include:Hemp seed oil is a relative of cannabis and contains sterols, antioxidants and essential fatty acids but very low levels of THC.Shea butter is extracted from the shea nut. It is high in Vitamin E, which acts as an anti-oxidant.
Sunflower oil is derived from sunflower seeds and contains polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E.
Castor oil is derived from the castor bean and is used to treat a number of inflammatory conditions. It contains essential fatty acids and undecylenic acid, which is germicidal for a number of microbes.
Calendula oil is derived from the petals of the calendula flower and has been traditionally used for its healing properties. It is especially good at healing scars, including acne scars.
Argan oil is rich in Vitamin E, carotenes (precursors of Vitamin A), and essential fatty acids. It is often used to treat skin infections and to moisturize the skin.
Almond or Hazelnut oil both contain essential fatty acids, B vitamins, and are anti-inflammatory.

, Rub a very light layer of the oil onto your skin. In fact, no matter what you are using the Vitamin E oil for always use a very small amount. These oils are very effective in moisturizing your skin and providing protection. In other words, a little bit goes a long way.


Most of these oils can stain clothing and bedding. Be cautious when applying it and let it absorb thoroughly. If it can’t be absorbed into your skin because it has been absorbed by your clothing or bedding, then you aren’t getting the benefit.
Even if you pick a non-comedogenic oil, it may clog your pores if you use too much. That could cause break-outs and acne.

Try adding a nattokinase supplement.,
Consider taking lumbrokinase supplements.,
Add omega-3 fish oils to your diet or as a supplement.,
Look into supplementing with evening primrose oil.,
Prevent venous insufficiency with bioflavonoids.,
Reduce your risk of venous deficiency with digestive enzymes.",How to Use Supplements to Avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)1," Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soybeans. This enzyme acts directly on clots to break them up and it also balances the levels of other chemicals that affect clot formation.There no known side effects of this supplement, but you may want to talk to your doctor about taking it, especially if you are on other medications.Follow the package instructions, but a common dosage is 100mg of nattokinase taken three times a day.;
, Lumbrokinase is another type of enzyme derived from earthworms. This enzyme works like nattokinase by breaking up any blood clots that may form in the veins.Lumbrokinase may cause mild nausea and bloating. Be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin supplementing with lumbrokinase.Follow the package instructions or consult your doctor for a recommendation, but a common dosage amount is 40-80 mg taken twice a day.

, Omega-3 oils contain EPA and DHA, which are omega-3 essential fatty acids. Your body uses these acids for many different purposes, including anti-inflammatory purposes. EPA and DHA prevent platelets from clumping together, which can help to reduce clotting.Try taking an omega-3 supplement or get your omega-3s from seafood like sardines, salmon, mackerel, cod, tuna, and shellfish.

, Evening primrose oil (EPO) contains gamma-linoleic acid, which is an omega-6 essential fatty acid. The way that EPO works to prevent DVT is not clear, but it has been shown to help to reduce clot formation.EPO may also cause mild nausea and diarrhea.Follow the package instructions, but a common dosage is 300mg taken three times a day. Also, make sure that you talk to your doctor if you are on anti-seizure medications, blood pressure medications, antidepressants or blood pressure medications. EPO may interact with some of these.

, Venous insufficiency may cause DVT, so taking supplements that act against this condition may be helpful as well. Bioflavonoids can help with venous insufficiency. Bioflavonoids are plant components that give berries their color, which is why berries are good sources of bioflavonoids. These antioxidants act on the veins to improve circulation, decrease micro-bleeds in capillaries, and reduce inflammation and swelling.


Rutin is a type of bioflavonoid that has been shown to be effective against venous insufficiency.Try taking 1–2 g daily. You may also want to talk to your physician for a dosage recommendation and to make sure that rutin will not interfere with any of your medications.

, Bromelain is an enzyme that is derived from pineapples. You can also get bromelain from eating fresh pineapple. Bromelain may increase prothrombin time (PT), which may help prevent coagulation.


Talk to your doctor about supplementing with bromelain and for a dosage recommendation. The recommended dosage varies from 80-320 mg two to three times a day.

Maximize post-exercise recovery.",How to Use Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)1," Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fatigue, itchiness, nausea, and a tendency to bruise and bleed easily. Cirrhosis is caused by alcoholism, viral hepatitis, or fat accumulating in the liver.Taken regularly, BCAAs have demonstrated an ability to reduce feelings of weakness and fatigue associated with cirrhosis, and help sore muscles heal faster.BCAAs can improve your quality of life if you have liver cirrhosis.The odds for medical complications related to cirrhosis are lower when you take BCAAs.Brain encephalopathy, for instance, tends to improve with BCAA use.;
, Studies indicate that BCAAs can improve brain function and short-term memory.You might also be interested in using BCAAs to boost your ability to concentrate., Soccer players, race car drivers, and boxers might want to take BCAA to boost their response., Taking BCAAs as part of your post-exercise recovery regimen can help you refuel, boost immune function, and reduce pain after an intense period of physical activity.Consuming whey protein or a similar BCAA powdered mix within 30 minutes of concluding your workout might help you avoid or minimize soreness while building muscle.Doses of up to 2 grams are usually suggested following a workout to aid muscle recovery."

Consider medication.",How to Calculate LDL Cholesterol," Part of the fasting test requires you to avoid alcohol for at least 24 hours before the test. Everything you put into your body can affect your LDL cholesterol levels, and a spike caused by recent alcohol consumption could skew your overall LDL test results.Do not drink any alcohol for at least 24 hours before the test.
Stick to water and avoid any juice, soda, milk, coffee/tea, and other beverages (besides water) for at least 12 hours before the test.;
, Your LDL cholesterol levels can be affected by anything you've recently consumed. If your doctor recommends a fasting test, you'll be required to avoid eating or drinking anything but water prior to the test.Fasting will help your doctor more accurately measure the lipid levels in your body.
It's important to follow your doctor's recommendations very carefully, or your doctor may have you come back to perform the test at a later date after a proper fast.

, As you fast, it's important to remain adequately hydrated. Water is the only thing you will be able to ingest beginning 12 hours before the test, and if fasting is stressful to your body it may be best to compensate with more water than you'd normally drink.The average man needs to drink approximately 3 liters (13 cups) of water each day. The average woman needs 2.2 liters, or approximately 9 cups of water each day.
You may need more water, depending on the climate you live in, your level of physical exertion, and the prescription medications you take on a day-to-day basis.
The best way to gauge your level of hydration is by checking your urine. You should be urinating every two to four hours with a light-colored to clear stream of urine if you're well-hydrated.
If your urine is dark yellow or infrequent, you may need to drink more water.

, Your cholesterol is measured by drawing a sample of your blood. It's a quick and relatively painless procedure, and you shouldn't need to do anything to prepare for it other than fasting.The procedure will likely be done by a specially trained medical personnel called a phlebotomist.


The test will most likely be administered in the morning so that you do not have to fast far into the day.
The phlebotomist will stick you with a hypodermic needle in your upper arm and collect a small sample of blood into a vial or syringe.
The procedure will only take a few minutes at most. After that you will be able to resume eating as normal.

, Your results will most likely be processed within 24 hours from the time your samples arrive in the lab.This may take slightly longer if the lab is backed up. Once your doctor receives the results and examines your LDL cholesterol levels, they should call you or have someone from her office contact you about your results.The test does not directly measure your LDL cholesterol levels. Instead, your doctor will arrive at an approximate LDL calculation using the Friedewald equation.
The Friedewald equation derives your LDL cholesterol levels by dividing your triglyceride levels by five and subtracting it from your from your total cholesterol and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) levels.
Your triglyceride levels should ideally be below 150. Anything above 200 is considered high, with levels at 500 or higher considered very high.
Your LDL cholesterol levels should be under 100 if you want to keep it optimal.
LDL levels between 100 and 129 are considered near optimal to above optimal.
LDL levels are considered high if they are between 160 and 189, though anything between 130 and 159 is considered borderline high.
If your LDL levels are above 190, your levels are very high. Your doctor may recommend medication and immediate lifestyle changes., The direct LDL cholesterol test is significantly more expensive than the fasting test. Though it's more convenient for you as the patient, it may not be as efficient as some doctors would like.Direct LDL tests are considered far more accurate and have a lower chance of inaccuracy (3% to 4%) compared to the fasting test (11% to 26%).Because of their precision and the corresponding lab work involved, direct LDL tests can cost hundreds of dollars.
While direct LDL tests are more precise, they also provide doctors with additional information that isn't usually useful or relevant to your cholesterol levels. For this reason, some insurance policies do not cover direct LDL costs.
Check with your insurance company to see if direct LDL tests are covered by your policy.

, The test is quick and relatively painless, just like the fasting test. The phlebotomist will stick you with a needle to extract some blood, and your samples will be sent to the lab for processing.The direct LDL test will be performed just like the fasting test, but there is no fasting required beforehand.
You will simply eat/drink as you normally would and show up at your scheduled time for the appointment.
A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm.
The test will determine your body's levels of LDL cholesterol, without having to derive that number from any other figures.The test should take a few minutes or less, and then you'll be free to go home.

, Your test results should be received within approximately 24 hours after the samples arrive at the lab. This may take slightly longer, depending on how backed up the lab is and when your samples are delivered. If you have not heard anything from your doctor and are concerned about your test results, contact your primary care physician's office to find out about your blood samples.Just like the fasting test, your direct LDL test levels should ideally be below 100., Changing your diet is one of the best ways to lower your cholesterol. What you eat and drink has a direct impact on your levels of LDL cholesterol, as well as your levels of HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol).Choose healthy fats by consuming lean meat, low-fat dairy products, and monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and canola oil).
Reduce or eliminate your consumption of red meat.
Cut trans fats out of your diet.
Opt for foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, as these fats help increase your HDL cholesterol without adding to your LDL cholesterol. You can get omega-3 fatty acids from salmon, mackerel, herring, walnuts, almonds, and flaxseeds.
Eat more soluble fiber like oats/oat bran, fruits, vegetables, lentils, and beans. Soluble fiber found in these foods can actually lower the LDL cholesterol levels in your body.
Increasing your daily fiber consumption by just an additional 5 to 10 grams has been shown to help drop your LDL levels.

, Exercise can help you lose weight, which in turn can help lower your LDL cholesterol levels. Start slow if you're new to exercising, and remember to stay hydrated any time you work out.Aim to get in at least several 10 minute sessions of physical activity throughout each day. If you can get more exercise, you'll be even better off.
Ride your bike or walk instead of driving. You can do this for running errands or even for commuting to/from work.
Spend part of your lunch break everyday going for a brisk walk outside.
Try swimming laps. Swimming is an excellent form of exercise that works all your muscle groups and does not cause stress on your knees like running can.

, Losing weight is one of the best things you can do to lower your LDL cholesterol levels. Dropping a few pounds can also help you become more physically active and feel healthier.Losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body's fat can help significantly reduce your LDL cholesterol levels.
Count calories. You can do this using a notebook or with an app on your smartphone.
Go for a walk to alleviate boredom instead of snacking when you're at home.
Aim to lose one to two pounds a week. Losing more weight quicker than that can be unsafe and may increase the risk that you'll ""rebound"" back to that weight in the future.

, Smoking can have a huge affect on your cholesterol levels. If you're currently smoking, find a program to help you quit, or talk to your doctor about how you can kick the habit today.Smoking raises your LDL cholesterol levels and lowers your HDL levels. It can also narrow your arteries, increasing the effects of cholesterol accumulation.Stay away from secondhand smoke. Even if you're not actually smoking, breathing in others' smoke can have the same negative effects on your LDL cholesterol.

, Stress can cause your cholesterol levels to spike when you're under a lot of pressure. Over time, living a very stressful lifestyle can take a toll on your physical health, and it can also have serious consequences on your mental health.Try reading a book you enjoy, spending time with friends, or engaging in yoga or meditation.
Exercise can help reduce stress and lower your cholesterol.
Listening to music can be very relaxing. Choose music that helps you unwind and de-stress.

, Try making lifestyle changes and, after six months, see if there is any improvement. If not, medication may be necessary. Some people are at risk for high cholesterol based on familial tendencies no matter what they do. These medications can help reduce your LDL levels while elevating your HDL (""good"" cholesterol) levels.Common classes of cholesterol medication include:



Statins — this class of medication lowers your LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while also increasing your HDL levels. Common statins include Altoprev (lovastatin), Crestor (rosuvastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin).

Bile acid binding resins — this class of medicine lowers your LDL levels. Common bile acid binding resins include Colestid (colestipol), Prevalite (cholestyramine), and Welchol (colesevelam).

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors — these medications lower your LDL levels, slightly decrease your triglycerides, and slightly increases your HDL levels. The most common cholesterol absorption inhibitor is Zetia (ezetimibe).

Combination cholesterol absorption inhibitor and statin — these medications lower your LDL and triglycerides while increasing your HDL levels. Vytorin (ezetimibe-simvastatin) is the most common form of this medication.

Fibrates — this medication lowers both LDL and triglyceride levels while increasing your HDL levels. Common fibrates include Antara, Tricor (fenofibrate), and Lopid (gemfibrozil).

Niacins — the most common niacins include Niaspan and Niacor.

Combination statin and niacin — the most common form of these combo medications is Advicor (niacin-lovastatin).

Take NADH to fight fatigue.,
Reduce symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.,
Treat Alzheimer’s symptoms.,
Talk to your doctor about NADH and depression.",How to Use Coenzyme 1 for Health1," People who suffer from energy-sapping disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may benefit from NADH supplements. Specifically, NADH is involved in the production of another chemical called ATP that your cells need to produce energy. Talk to your doctor about taking NADH in a treatment regimen if you suffer from fatigue, especially chronic fatigue syndrome.Your doctor may recommend taking niacin so that your body can make NADH. They may also recommend 10 mg of NADH daily with water on an empty stomach.Further research is being done on the potential for NADH supplements to assist those who are chronically fatigued.;
, Some of the drugs used to treat Parkinson’s may cause patients to have depleted levels of vitamin B3 (niacin). NADH supplements may also help remedy this depletion. Ultimately, NADH can help improve brain function in those with Parkinson’s disease, and thus reduce some of the disease’s symptoms.Talk to your doctor about taking NADH if you have Parkinson’s disease. They may recommend 5 mg twice a day, potentially taken via injections.

, Those who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease may suffer from diminished mental function. NADH supplements, however, may help reduce these symptoms. Talk to your doctor about taking NADH. They may recommend 10mg of NADH per day. Further research is necessary to confirm the benefits of taking NADH to treat Alzheimer’s., Vitamin B3 (which, again, allows your body to make NADH) is known to help increase the levels of dopamine in your brain. Technically, dopamine and serotonin are the chemicals in your brain that allow you to feel happiness and contentment. Specific studies have tied NADH to a reduction in symptoms associated with depression. Supplementing with B3 or NADH may help people with depression. Talk to your doctor further about using NADH to treat depression."

Wear compression stockings as directed.",How to Use Supplements to Avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)2," Part of the reason why people develop DVT is because they are bedridden or otherwise unable to move around. As a result blood pools in their legs and clots form. Getting regular daily exercise, such as going for quick frequent walks throughout the day, is a great way to reduce your risk of developing DVT., Smoking increases your risk of developing DVT as well as many other serious health conditions. If you are a smoker, ask your doctor for help to quit. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that can help and there are smoking cessation programs that may also help you to quit., High blood pressure is another risk factor for DVT. Keep your blood pressure under control by getting it checked regularly and following your doctor’s recommendations for reducing blood pressure.Common recommendations include following a low sodium diet, getting regular exercise, and taking medications.

, If you are on any blood thinning medications, then it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions and take them every day until you have been told to stop taking them. If you plan to supplement and you are on other medications, make sure that you ask your doctor first to make sure that there are not interactions., Compression stockings are often recommended for those who are at risk of developing DVT. These stockings help prevent DVT by compressing your legs and improving circulation.If you are at risk of developing DVT, ask your doctor about compression hose.
If you have been told to wear compression hose, make sure that you do.

Consume dairy.,
Eat meat.,
Eat legumes.,
Eat nuts and seeds.,
Take a BCAA supplement.",How to Use Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)2," Dairy is a food group that includes milk, yogurt, and cheese. Eating dairy can help you boost your BCAA intake. For instance, you might want to make a grilled cheese sandwich or have some milk in your whole-grain cereal for breakfast.The USDA recommends limiting your dairy intake to no more than three cups per day based on an average 1,800 calorie per day diet., Beef, raw salmon, and chicken are also great sources of BCAAs. For instance, you might eat a hamburger or eat some salmon nigiri.Identify meat-based dishes you enjoy and consume them regularly, up to the limit recommended by the USDA.The USDA recommends consuming no more than 5-6 ounces of meat, poultry, and eggs per week, assuming you consume 1,800 calories per day.This is equal to about four average-sized boneless chicken breasts per week., Legumes are a type of vegetable that includes peas, lentils, and beans. Consuming legumes in dishes like pea soup, lentil soup, and baked beans is a great way to eat BCAAs., Pumpkin seeds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, macadamia nuts, and sunflower seeds are good sources of BCAAs. For instance, you might want to snack on some trail mix with peanuts or walnuts, or spread peanut butter on whole-wheat toast., Supplements are a great way to work BCAAs into your diet, and are most popular with athletes.They might be available in the form of whey powder or a similar protein powder that can be mixed to make a refreshing drink or smoothie. You can also obtain liquid drops that you take by the spoonful, or in a more traditional capsule form.Always use supplements as directed.
Talk to your doctor before adding any supplement to your diet.

Always consult your doctor before taking BCAAs.,
Know how much to take.,
Recognize when you cannot use BCAAs.",How to Use Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)3," If you’re thinking of adding more BCAAs to your diet – whether through food or supplements – consult your physician. Your doctor will be able to determine how you can safely take more BCAAs.Only your doctor is qualified to determine how much and how often you should supplement your diet with BCAAs based on your age, gender, and health.

, Most people require 3-20 grams of BCAAs per day. Assuming you are in good health, the average diet provides an adequate amount of BCAAs for you, and there is usually no need to supplement with additional BCAAs.Talk to your doctor to determine if you might benefit from taking additional BCAAs in supplement form.Do not take more than the recommended dose. Taking more than 20 grams of BCAAs per day could lead to toxicity within your body., If you have certain medical conditions or are taking certain medications, using BCAAs is not a good idea. For instance, if you are taking glucocorticoids or thyroid hormones, you might not be able to metabolize BCAA. Medications used to treat high blood glucose could adversely react to supplemental BCAA. And if you have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or maple syrup urine disease, avoid taking supplemental BCAA."

Take NADH with a grain of salt.,
Eat food rich in Niacin.,
Talk to your doctor about any supplement you take.,
Always follow your doctor’s dosing advice.",How to Use Coenzyme 1 for Health2," Some people also take these sorts of supplements as a general health and performance supplement. For instance, there are claims that this chemical boosts concentration and memory, and even improves physical endurance. No scientific studies have proven that NADH is either safe or effective when taken for these purposes., Most people get plenty of niacin and niacinamide, which the human body converts into NADH, from the food their diet. Make sure you’re eating plenty of foods that contain niacin, such as mushrooms, green peas, chicken, pork, beef, peanuts, and avocado. This will ensure that you do not become vitamin B3 deficient.If you do not eat meat, consider taking a niacin or niacinamide supplement. Talk to you doctor about where to get health supplements.
The amount of niacin you need daily depends on your age, gender and, for women, whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding. The maximum daily intake for any adult is 35 milligrams. While eating a diet rich in niacin will help keep you healthy, NADH supplements provide a more aggressive treatment approach. Do not attempt to replace NADH supplements with dietary changes unless you are told to do so by your doctor.

, There are various supplements that can ultimately boost your levels of NADH. These may be labeled as vitamin B3, niacin, niacinamide, NADH, or coenzyme 1. While these are very similar, you should talk to your doctor about which source makes the most sense for you. You also want to ensure you’re getting supplements from a reputable source.


Get a recommendation for a specific brand of supplement from your doctor or pharmacist. The FDA does not regulate supplements, and they are often found to contain fillers or other ingredients not listed on the bottle. Look for supplements labeled “USP Verified” which means they been inspected by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention.

, While a supplement bottle may advise certain dosages for daily intake, your doctor may advise different doses based on the reasons you’re taking the supplement. Always follow your doctor’s advice.

, If you suffer from bloating, gas and/or cramps, then taking acacia fiber daily may alleviate these symptoms. Before a meal, drink a solution of acacia fiber and water. Or, add it to your meal by mixing it in with your food., Because it is a fiber, consuming acacia fiber with your meal can help you feel full for a longer amount of time. To curb your cravings for unhealthy snacks in between meals, supplement your meals with the suggested amount of acacia fiber.Once acacia fiber is in your stomach, it absorbs water and turns into a gel-like substance. This gel-like substance slows digestion, helping you feel fuller for a longer period.

Recognize the different types.,
Get the right amount.,
Learn the correct dosage.,
Take the supplement.,
Get your levels tested.",How to Take Vitamin D31," There are two forms of vitamin D. Vitamin D2, also known as Ergocalciferol, is a plant-derived form that is added to milk, juice, and cereals. Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is generally considered a better form because it is the form your body produces when it is exposed to sunlight. It is also found in animal products.


Vitamin D2 is safe for vegans and vegetarians since it is plant derived.Vitamin D3 is not, however, because these supplements are derived from the fat from lamb's wool.;
, The general recommended daily amount for vitamin D vary depending on your age, though men and women need the same amount at the same age. The daily recommended dose for each age group is:Infants from birth to 12 months need 400 IU (10 mcg)
Those who are one to 70 years old need 600 IU (15 mcg)
Individuals over 70 years old need 800 IU (20 mcg)
Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant need 600 IU (15 mcg)
Remember that those that are deficient in Vitamin D3 are more likely to need higher doses to build levels up. Once they are consistently having good D3 blood readings, they may be able to switch to a lower maintenance dose.

, Although your body needs a certain amount of vitamin D each day, you should take more than that as a supplement. This is because your body will not absorb all of the vitamin D from the supplement each time you take it, so you should have a dose larger than the amount you need each day.


Most doctors currently recommend 1000 IU of vitamin D3 per day to ensure that enough vitamin D is absorbed.
The Linus Pauling Institute, one of the leading research centers in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, recommends 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 a day.If you have certain conditions that might benefit from vitamin D3, your doctor may suggest a higher dosage. Always follow your doctor's instructions when it comes to increased or decreased dosage., You can buy pure vitamin D3 supplements as well as multivitamins with vitamin D3 in them. However, these multivitamins generally have low levels, so you may be better off taking it as a separate supplement. Most supplement capsules are 1000 IU each, but some can be as low as 400 IU. Pay attention to the kind you get. Take one to three daily, depending on the dosage per capsule.


It is recommended that you take your vitamin D3 with a meal., Once you have been taking vitamin D for awhile, you should have your serum levels tested. This will ensure that you have the right levels vitamin D in your system. Ask your doctor to perform this test as your yearly checkup or during your next visit. Your levels should be at least 50 nmol/L.


Your levels may still be low after taking supplements for awhile. Your doctor may increase your supplement dose to help increase your levels. He or she may also check for issues that might be blocking your absorption of vitamin D3.
This testing should occur at least once a year."

Learn how it works.,
Recognize a deficiency.,
Know the risks.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Take Vitamin D32," As soon as sunlight hits your skin, it is absorbed into your skin cells. This triggers the production of vitamin D, which occur next in the liver and then the kidneys. Once it is in your body, vitamin D helps promote calcium absorption, helps with the remodeling and growth of bones, is involved with making your immune system function properly, and helps with cell regulation and cell growth.


Vitamin D also prevents softening of the bones, brittle bones, and rickets in children. , So many people assume they are not deficient, but in fact many of us are deficient. There are groups of people who are particularly at risk for vitamin D deficiency, though it is something everyone should be aware of. People who are more at risk include:Elderly adults
Infants who are breastfed
Those with darker-toned skin
Those with limited to no exposure to the sun
Anyone with conditions that limit fat absorption, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
People with excess weight or who are obese
Those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery

, There are some risks involved with both low and high levels of vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D might increase the risk of pancreatic and colon cancer. Low levels are also associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, pre-diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and high blood pressure.


Having too much vitamin D can also cause health issues. It can cause weight loss, anorexia, and a dangerously high heart rate. , There are a number of medications, such as Cerebyx and Luminal, that can decrease your vitamin D levels. If you are taking these, ask your doctor if you need to take supplements to increase your levels.


Some medications decrease the absorption of the vitamin D in your body, which include Questran, Xenical, and Colestid. Ask your doctor about possible interactions with these medications. As a general rule, make sure you wait at least two hours after you take these medicines to take your vitamin D supplements."

Replace soy sauce.,
Use it instead of salt.,
Add it to dishes to deepen the flavor.,
Top your snacks with it.",How to Use Coconut Aminos1," Substitute coconut aminos any time a recipe calls for soy sauce. This will lower the salt content of the meal. Coconut aminos are vegan, so this is a great option if you’re vegan or paleo and your recipe requires soy sauce.Try dipping sushi in coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.
Use it in stir fry.;
, Because of its high salt content (90mg per teaspoon), you can use coconut aminos in recipes instead of adding extra salt. This will enrich the flavor as well as giving you the salty taste you want., Add a few dashes of coconut aminos to almost any dish to enrich the flavor. Though it’s made from the coconut palm, the product doesn’t taste like coconut and is actually made from a different part of the plant. It’s slightly sweet but mostly rich and savory. Incorporate small amounts – 1-2 teaspoons – into soup, broth, curry, fried rice, or anything you sauté for a boost in flavor., Drizzle your popcorn with coconut aminos. Bake potato or sweet potato chips with coconut aminos, garlic, olive oil, and dill for a delicious snack.Even add a small amount of coconut aminos to a semi-sweet dessert like pecan pie."

Distinguish between the two types of licorice root supplements.,
Reduce gastrointestinal discomfort with DGL supplements.,
Boost your energy with licorice supplements.,
Talk to your doctor about taking licorice root for other reasons.,
Take your blood pressure daily while using licorice supplements.",How to Take Licorice Root1," Licorice root naturally contains an extremely sweet component called glycyrrhizin. While glycyrrhizin is completely safe in small, infrequent amounts, it can leads to health complications if consumed long-term. As such, if you are considering taking licorice root supplements habitually, make sure to choose a deglycyrrhizinated (DGL) supplement.The bottle should report the amounts of glycyrrhizin the DGL supplements contain. It should be no more than 2% of the supplement for safe long-term use.
Licorice root supplements that still contain glycyrrhizin, and thus glycyrrhetinic acid, are recommended only for fighting stress-induced fatigue.;
, Conditions such as heartburn, ulcers, and gastritis can lead to significant discomfort associated with digestion. DGL supplements can diminish this discomfort significantly.Take anywhere from 380 – 1200 milligrams of DGL about thirty minutes before you eat.
Since tablets are usually 380 – 400 mg, start with one tablet and see if your symptoms are reduced.

, Licorice root that still contains glycyrrhizin, sometimes called ""whole"" licorice, can temporarily help you fight fatigue. Your adrenal gland can become overworked when constantly producing cortisol, which occurs when you experience stress. Whole licorice root supplements, however, can postpone the body’s destruction of cortisol and lessen the adrenal gland’s need to produce more.Note that licorice root that has not had the glycyrrhizin removed should not be taken regularly.
To help keep cortisol levels normal, take the supplement with breakfast and lunch, but not with dinner.
Reduce your use of ""whole"" licorice root supplements as your energy levels return to normal.

, There are several other health benefits accredited to licorice root that have yet to be fully substantiated by rigorous scientific study. For instance, licorice root may help reduce blood sugar and insulin resistance, and can potentially help those at risk for diabetes.Furthermore, licorice root may help protect you against cavities.
Finally, licorice root has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, and it is used in some countries to treat conditions ranging from allergies to infections.

, This is especially important if you’re using “whole” licorice root supplements. Even with the glycyrrhizin removed, a daily DGL supplement may affect your blood pressure. As such, check your blood pressure daily for the few weeks of supplementation. If your blood pressure shifts outside of your normal range, notify your doctor.If your blood pressure remains stable for the first few weeks of treatment, you can begin checking it less often, such as once or twice a week.

Use isabgol to treat constipation.,
Follow the official instructions.,
Take the supplement with a full glass of liquid.,
Treat diarrhea by mixing isabgol in curds.,
Rely on isabgol to regulate your digestive system.,
Relieve pain associated with anal fissures and hemorrhoids.,
Treat acid reflux.,
Lose weight by drinking it with lemon water.,
Keep your heart healthy.,
Battle diabetes by regularly consuming isabgol.",How to Take Isabgol," The primary benefit of isabgol is its ability to treat mild to moderate constipation. While it is believed to treat a range of other health troubles, these other uses are not approved for professional labeling purposes.


Isabgol increases the amount of bulk in your stools. This increase in mass promotes movement through the intestines.Moreover, isabgol increases the amount of water in your stools. As a result, the stools become softer and easier to pass.
Most studies suggest that isabgol does contribute an increase in stool weight and bowel movements per day, as well as a decrease in total gut transit time. This product has even been used as an ingredient in bulk laxatives.;
, If a doctor prescribed isabgol to you, follow his or her instructions regarding dosage amount and frequency. If you are using isabgol without being told to do so by a doctor, follow the directions provided on the label.


Usually, you will need to take 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of isabgol with 8 oz (240 ml) of fluid daily until your constipation passes. The exact dosage may vary depending on age, medical condition, and response to treatment, however.
It is highly recommended that you consult with your doctor before starting treatment with isabgol, no matter what you plan on using it for.
If you have any concerns or questions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

, You can usually take isabgol as a powder, tablet, or wafer. No matter which form you take it in, you should always consume the supplement with 8 oz (240 ml) of water or another liquid to prevent choking.


Swallow isabgol tablets with at least 8 oz (240 ml) of water.
If you are using the powder, dissolve the powder in 8 oz (240 ml) of liquid. Add it to the liquid, stir well, and drink immediately. Note that isabgol can plump up and become thick if you allow it to sit and absorb the liquid.
If you are taking isabgol wafers, chew them thoroughly before swallowing. Follow by drinking 8 oz (240 ml) of liquid.

, Mix roughly 2 tsp (10 ml) of isabgol with 3 tsp (15 ml) of fresh curd until well combined. Eat this mixture directly after a meal.You should do this twice daily to see positive results.
The consistency of curds causes the isabgol to react differently in the cut. Instead of softening the stools further, the isabgol adds bulk and helps solidify loose stools.
The combination of curds and isabgol also gives your stomach a good dose of probiotics, which can help heal an underlying cause of diarrhea.
In professional medical settings, this product is commonly used to treat diarrhea in patients who are tube fed.

, If you have some form of irritable bowl syndrome (IBS) or other chronic digestive problems, mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of isabgol in 8 oz (240 ml) of water and drink it immediately. Repeat once daily until your disorder is under control.


You could also drink it with buttermilk or regular milk for a similar effect.
Since isabgol contains both soluble and insoluble fibers, it helps cleanse your stomach more regularly while enhancing your bowels' ability to push waste through quicker.
A healthier, toxin-free stomach and a colon that regularly evacuates waste products will lead to an overall healthier, more regular digestive system within a few weeks.

, Right before you go to sleep for the night, mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of powdered isabgol in warm water until dissolved. Drink the mixture immediately.


The soluble and insoluble fibers in isabgol help clear your bowels. By absorbing water from the rest of the intestines, it isabgol also causes your stools to be softer, making them easier to pass without pain.
Both anal fissures (tear and cracks in the anus) and hemorrhoids (also called ""piles"") can result due to chronic or acute constipation. If you continue to pass hard stools, these conditions can become more irritated and eventually worsen.
By passing softer stools, your anus does not have to stretch and distort as much. As a result, past injury and trauma has a greater chance to heal.

, If you deal with acid reflux or any other condition resulting from high acidity in the stomach, take 2 tsp (10 ml) of isabgol mixed in 1/2 to 1 cup (120 to 240 ml) of cold milk after each meal.


Both the milk and the isabgol help nullify excess acid.
The husk of the isabgol coats the lining of the stomach, intestines, and lower esophagus. This coating limits the amount of burns and overall damage caused by high stomach acidity.
Isabgol also regulates the amount of stomach acid secreted by the organ. Less stomach acid means less irritation.

, Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of isabgol in 8 oz (240 ml) of warm water, along with 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of freshly-squeezed lemon juice. Prepare the mixture before a meal and drink it immediately.


Similarly, you can drink the same mixture as soon as you wake up in the morning.
The bulk produced by isabgol makes you feel fuller, so it is easier to eat less during a meal.
Isabgol is also a colon cleanser, so it can help clean out any waste products clogging up your digestive system and slowing down your metabolism.

, Eat an isabgol wafer once a day immediately after a meal to help your heart health.


Alternatively, you could take the isabgol as soon as you wake up in the morning for similar results.
The fiber content in isabgol is believed t help reduce cholesterol in your system. Since the supplement is also low in fat, it does not contribute anything harmful to cholesterol problems.
Theoretically, isabgol coats the walls of your intestines and helps prevent the blood from absorbing cholesterol from other foods you eat. As a result, the cholesterol levels in your blood drop.

, Dissolve 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of powdered isabgol into 8 oz (240 ml) of milk or water after every meal. Do this on a regular basis.


When your digestive system processes isabgol, a thick, gel-like substance forms and coats the walls of your intestines. This coating slows down the breakdown and absorption rate of glucose. Since your body will be absorbing glucose more evenly and slowly, your blood sugar is less likely to spike.
When you have diabetes, you should avoid having isabgol with curds. Due to the imbalances in your body, the isabgol is more likely to cause constipation when taken with curds if you have diabetes.

Ask your doctor if you are a candidate.,
Identify conditions that glucosamine could worsen.,
Determine whether you are at a heightened risk for other conditions.,
Research manufacturers thoroughly.,
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a recommendation.,
Choose the correct type of glucosamine for your particular condition.,
Opt for a third-party verified product.,
Take your supplements with food and as instructed on the label.,
Follow the accepted daily dosages based on body weight.,
Augment the recommended daily dosage.,
Use caution when taking glucosamine over a long period of time.,
Monitor conditions likely to be affected by glucosamine supplements.",How to Take Glucosamine Supplements," Glucosamine may be effective in reducing pain caused by a number of different conditions. However, you should talk to your doctor before you start taking supplements to find out if they would be beneficial for you.For example, you might say ""Since my diagnosis of osteoarthritis, I've been reading a lot about glucosamine supplements as a possible treatment. Can you tell me about any risks and benefits to taking glucosamine supplements for me?""
Keep in mind that there haven't been extensive studies on the effects of glucosamine supplements on many conditions. For this reason, your doctor may decide the potential benefit to you isn't worth the risk of trying them.
There may be little benefit to taking glucosamine unless you have been diagnosed with a specific condition.
For example, if you want to take glucosamine to treat your back pain, you generally should have a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Absent a diagnosis, your doctor should rule out other causes for your back pain before you try supplements.You also will want to talk to your doctor about the potential benefit. Most studies have shown only a modest improvement of symptoms in patients taking glucosamine supplements, so you may decide that such a small benefit is not worth the cost of the supplements.;
, While glucosamine supplements typically are safe for most adults, they can cause problems if you have certain other medical conditions such as diabetes.If you have diabetes, you may want to avoid glucosamine. It can adversely affect your insulin resistance and your blood-sugar levels.
Another thing to keep in mind is that since glucosamine is harvested from shellfish, you shouldn't take these supplements if you are allergic to shellfish.
Children under 18 should not take glucosamine supplements, which means you also shouldn't take glucosamine supplements if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Glucosamine supplements also can interfere with drugs you're already taking to treat particular conditions such as depression or high blood pressure. Discuss this with your doctor in light of all medications you currently take, even those you only take on an as-needed basis.
For example, you might say ""If I take glucosamine supplements, will it cause more bleeding or bruising than I'm currently experiencing? I've read that glucosamine can increase bleeding in people like me who are taking warfarin.""

, Glucosamine supplements may increase your risk of certain medical conditions such as heart disease or bleeding disorders. Ask your doctor about any conditions that you personally may be susceptible to if you take glucosamine supplements.For example, if you are already at an increased risk for heart disease, your doctor may advise against prolonged use of glucosamine. The supplements may cause heart palpitations or other irregularities.
If you have dry eyes or an increased risk of cataracts, glucosamine supplements may further increase this risk or cause cataracts to develop.
Your regular doctor may not know about your eye health. If your ophthalmologist has told you that you are at risk for cataracts, let your regular doctor know. For example, you might say ""My ophthalmologist told me I was at risk for cataracts, and I've heard taking glucosamine supplements can increase that risk. Would you still recommend I try the supplements to treat my osteoarthritis, or should I talk to my ophthalmologist first?""
Since glucosamine supplements can increase the risk of bleeding, first tell your doctor if you have a bleeding disorder or are currently taking drugs such as warfarin that increase your risk of bleeding.

, In the U.S. and many other countries, nutritional supplements aren't regulated by the government like other drugs are. This means you must take care to evaluate the brand of supplements you're taking.Focus on major brands that have strong reputations in the industry, particularly pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription drugs as well as nutritional supplements.
Read information and articles about the manufacturer from reputable, unbiased sources. You also can search the internet for any complaints, recalls, or other customer satisfaction incidents that may have occurred.
If you are allergic to shellfish but still want to try glucosamine supplements, look for specific manufacturers such as Schiff or Weider Nutrition Group which contain lower levels of shrimp allergens and may be safe for consumption by people who are allergic., Given the lack of regulation of nutritional supplements, rely on someone with education and experience about the brands and types of supplements available to help you choose the right ones.If your doctor knows of a particular brand that has been used by many patients – particularly patients similar to you – they can recommend that brand based on experience and tell you more about the benefits you're likely to achieve, as well as your potential side effects.
Keep in mind that your doctor is likely to recommend a brand-name product that may be more expensive than other supplements that are available. They aren't trying to make you spend more money – they are recommending a brand that typically is more trusted by healthcare professionals.

, Glucosamine generally is available alone, as glucosamine hydrochloride, or as glucosamine sulfate. Discuss which is best to take with your doctor.For example, glucosamine hydrochloride is recommended to treat bone disease, while glucosamine sulfate is recommended for high cholesterol.
Health care professionals specifically advise against using certain types of glucosamine for specific conditions. For example, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons advises against glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.If you do decide to take glucosamine sulfate or glucosamine hydrochloride for knee osteoarthritis, it is recommended that you take relatively low doses of 300-500 milligrams three times a day, and only take it for 12 weeks at the most.

, With higher quality, you are more likely to notice benefits. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate for content, purity, labeling, or claims, so you’re best off if you and your doctor choose a supplement that has been verified by a third party, such as The United States Pharmacopeia (USP).If you take the supplements for a month or two and notice an improvement in your pain or joint function, ask your doctor about switching to a different brand to see if those benefits continue.
Allow two months before you decide glucosamine isn't doing anything for you and discontinue taking the supplements.
Take extra caution switching brands if you're allergic to shellfish, or have other medical conditions. You may want to consult your doctor before you move to a cheaper manufacturer.

, The most common side effects of oral glucosamine supplements are gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn and nausea. These side effects typically are reduced or eliminated by taking your supplements with food.Since dosage recommendations often involve taking the supplement three times a day, you can easily take it after eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
If you're only taking glucosamine supplements once a day, it’s usually best to take them in the middle of the day after eating lunch, unless your doctor recommends otherwise., Even though supplements aren't regulated, there is general agreement regarding the amount of glucosamine that is appropriate for an adult based on their body weight.For example, if you're taking glucosamine sulfate supplements, you should take no more than 1,000 milligrams daily if you weigh under 100 pounds. if you weigh more than 100 pounds, you can safely take up to 1,500 milligrams. However, you should consult your doctor if you weigh over 200 pounds or are categorized as obese.
Talk to your doctor about whether you should space these dosages out over the course of the day, or take the entire dosage once a day.
The total dosage may differ depending on whether you are taking glucosamine, glucosamine sulfate, or glucosamine hydrochloride. For example, 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine sulfate is roughly equivalent to 1,200 milligrams of glucosamine, while 750 milligrams of glucosamine hydrochloride is about 625 milligrams of glucosamine.

, Some dosage other than what is listed on the bottle may be recommended by your doctor for the treatment of certain conditions, or depending on other medications you're taking.For example, if you're treating general osteoarthritis, your doctor may instruct you to take between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams of glucosamine daily for up to 18 months. However, for knee osteoarthritis usually requires a divided daily dosage that’s only between 300 and 500 milligrams three times a day.
When getting glucosamine injected, you generally get a much lower dose than you would if you took supplements by mouth.

, Even at the recommended doses, glucosamine supplements may cause complications if you take them for longer than six months.At the same time, keep in mind that you may need to take glucosamine supplements for at least a month before you realize the full benefit of the substance. After four to six weeks, if you don't notice any improvement in your condition you may want to talk to your doctor about discontinuing your supplements.
The length of time you should take glucosamine supplements depends on the condition for which you are taking them. However, you generally shouldn't take glucosamine supplements for more than six months unless directed to do so by your doctor.
Osteoarthritis is an exception to the six-month rule. For general osteoarthritis, your doctor may have you take oral glucosamine supplements for up to 18 months.

, If you have a medical condition such as asthma, high blood pressure, or a bleeding disorder, watch these carefully and see your doctor about discontinuation if you have any changes.For example, if you have problems with blood pressure or are at risk of heart disease, you should check your blood pressure daily while you are taking glucosamine supplements.
A wide range of gastrointestinal problems are associated with taking glucosamine supplements. If you have heartburn, gas, nausea, indigestion, upset stomach, or similar problems that become unbearable, you may want see your doctor about discontinuing glucosamine supplements.

Watch for early warning signs.,
Get a diagnosis early.,
Be aware of circumstances that can lead to low potassium.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Low Potassium1," The first signs of moderately low potassium can be muscle aches, cramps and abnormal weakness ((including respiratory and gastrointestinal muscle weakness if severe).Low potassium levels won’t allow neuromuscular cells to recharge quickly, which prevents them from firing repeatedly, meaning that muscles have difficulty in contracting.


Faintness, muscle spasms, and muscle tingling or numbness can indicate worsening potassium deficiency and should be checked by a physician right away.;
, Extended or severe low potassium can affect the heart. Low potassium levels can cause change in its proper function. This can include irregular heartbeats, such as dangerous arrhythmia in severe cases. Prolonged low potassium can cause structural and functional changes in the kidney.

, If you are experiencing diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, constipation, or weakness, then you may need to have your potassium levels tested. This test involves having blood drawn and getting a basic metabolic panel of tests (BMP)including ones for electrolytes (which include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen carbonate).


Depending upon your situation, your doctor may alternatively want you to have a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),which adds liver function tests to the basic panel.

Inspect the herbs.,
Check the label for important information.,
Make sure the bottle has a USP seal.,
Look for herbal supplements produced in the US or Europe.,
Watch for misleading claims on the package.",How to Use Herbs to Treat the Flu2," Any herbs that you decide to use should be herbicide and pesticide free. Look for herbs that have been organically and sustainably grown.


Find a local herbalist if possible. A local herbalist is likely to have higher quality herbs than the ones you may find online.
If you must buy herbs online, look for manufacturers that follow organic, sustainable growing practices and that use Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). This information should be easy to spot on their website. If not, then try calling and asking about their growing and manufacturing practices.

, Consider the color, smell, and taste of the herbs before you buy them.Greener herbs are fresher. A greener color also indicates that the herbs have not been exposed to excessive heat. Make sure that you smell and taste the herbs as well. Aromatic herbs should keep their odor as well and all herbs should retain their taste.


Try asking the herbalist or manufacturer for a sample so that you can inspect the herbs before you decide to buy them.

, Herbal supplement labels should include certain basic information on the package. Before you purchase an herbal supplement, read the label carefully to be certain that it includes:the name of the herbal supplement including the common and Latin name for the herbthe manufacturer’s or distributor’s name and address
the amount, serving size, and active ingredients
a full list of ingredients including inactive ingredients

, Herbal supplements with a United States Pharmacopeial (USP) seal are often higher quality than those without a USP seal. The USP seal means that the ingredients have been lab-tested and that what you see listed on the bottle is what is actually in the bottle. An herbal supplement with a USP seal has also been tested to make sure it does not contain any harmful ingredients. USP seal bottles have also been produced under sanitary conditions that meet the FDA’s guidelines.Only buy herbal supplements that have a USP seal.

Check the label to determine where the supplement was produced. Only buy herbal supplements that were produced in the United States or Europe., If a manufacturer claims the herb will prevent, treat, or cure a disease, that should be a red flag. Herbal supplement manufacturers may include information about health benefits of the herb as long as they are backed by studies, but they do not have to submit the studies to the FDA. Therefore, some herbal supplement manufacturers may claim to do things that have not been verified.Also, keep in mind that terms like “natural,” “certified,” “standardized,” or “verified” are not evidence of a product’s safety or quality.

Get regular exercise.,
Use compression hose.,
Stay on your medications.,
Ask for help to quit smoking.,
Control your blood pressure.",How to Use Herbs to Avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)2," Part of the reason why people develop DVT is because they are bedridden or otherwise unable to move around. As a result blood pools in their legs and clots form. Getting regular daily exercise, such as going for quick frequent walks throughout the day, is a great way to reduce your risk of developing DVT., Compression stockings are often recommended for those who are at risk of developing DVT. These stockings compress your legs, which helps to improve circulation and prevent DVT. You will need to wear the compression hose for a set amount of time each day, according to your doctor’s recommendations.If you are at risk of developing DVT and you have not been instructed to wear compression hose, ask your doctor about getting some.

, If you are on any blood-thinning medications, then it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions and take them every day until you have been told to stop taking them. Do not try to replace your medications with herbs.

Recognize symptoms of DVT.,
Seek medical attention if you notice symptoms of DVT.,
Identify your risk factors.",How to Use Herbs to Avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)3," DVT has some noticeable symptoms that you should learn how to recognize. DVT may affect your legs or your arms, but keep in mind that it is more likely to affect your legs. If DVT occurs in one of your legs, you may also notice some swelling around your ankles.

Have your potassium level checked.,
Have an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).",How to Recognize Symptoms of Low Potassium2," A serum potassium level of less than 3.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) may be considered low; the normal range is 3.6-5.2 mmol/L)Additional electrolyte levels such as calcium, glucose, magnesium and phosphorous may be checked at this time.


A blood assay may also include the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, which are indicators of kidney function.
Patients who are taking digitalis also need their digoxin level checked as this medication affects heart rhythm.

, This will monitor the heart’s functioning for signs of damage or other problems.The doctor may have to shave parts of your skin if you have a lot of hair, and she will place 12 electrical leads on your arms, chest and legs. Each lead transmits electrical information about the heart to a monitor for 5 to 10 minutes. The patient should remain as still as possible and it may be necessary to repeat the ECG.


Low potassium levels may also be related to low magnesium levels. This could prolong intervals on the EKG and could lead to Torsades de Pointes."

Talk to your doctor about diuretic usage.,
Assess your lifestyle for potential causes.,
Get tested for other medical conditions.,
Adjust your diet.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Low Potassium3," Use of diuretics can contribute directly to low potassium. Some patients with medical conditions such as high blood pressure may require diuretics for treatment. However, if these are leading to low potassium, you may need to talk to your doctor about an alternate medication.Diuretics are a class of medication that includes furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Diuretics attempt to relieve high blood pressure by increasing the urination rate. However, this can cause minerals like potassium to be hard to maintain in balanced to the bodily needs, as they are excreted from the body in the urine.

, While some causes of low potassium are medical, some can be prevented by lifestyle changes. If you drink alcohol excessively, use laxatives too frequently, or constantly sweat profusely, you could be causing your low potassium.Talk to a medical professional about changing these habits or altering your environment to assess the problem.


You may need to seek treatment for alcohol addiction if you do not feel that you can drink less on your own.
If you overuse laxatives, talk to your physician about how to reduce your reliance on them through natural methods.
If you sweat profusely, you may need to change your work or living environment. Keeping cooler, staying hydrated, or taking medical steps to sweat less may be necessary.
Other conditions that can lead to low potassium include chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, diarrhea, aldosteronism, hyperaldosteronism, and antibiotic use.

, Low potassium can be an indicator of other serious medical conditions. Chronic kidney disease and diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to low potassium and should be addressed immediately.Additional conditions that may lead to low potassium are a folic acid deficiency or stomach ailments that cause persistent vomiting or diarrhea.


Hyperaldosteronism leads to a syndrome that includes hypertension and hypokalemia., The best way to increase your potassium level is by eating potassium-rich foods. You can also take a potassium supplement, but be sure to talk to your doctor so that you do not overload on too much potassium. Some potassium-rich foods include:


Bananas
Avocados
Tomatoes
Potatoes
Spinach
Beans and Peas
Dried fruits

Ask your doctor about chondroitin supplements.,
Identify potential risks.,
Be realistic about the potential benefits.,
Determine whether you also want to take glucosamine.,
Evaluate manufacturers carefully.,
Get a specific recommendation.,
Check amounts in combination supplements.,
Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle.,
Alter your dosage according to your specific condition.,
Be patient.,
Take your supplements at the correct time.,
Treat your supplements as you would a drug.,
Pay attention to side effects.",How to Take Chondroitin Supplements," If you have back or knee pain and think chondroitin might help you, get advice from your doctor on whether you should start taking supplements, particularly if you haven't been diagnosed with osteoarthritis.Even though you can read about chondroitin online, you'll get much more benefit from talking to your personal doctor, since they have a complete understanding of your personal medical history.
If you've been diagnosed with arthritis and are currently taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief, chondroitin may treat your pain so you can decrease your dosage of NSAIDs.
For other medical conditions, there is less information and evidence on the effectiveness of chondroitin to relieve symptoms. Your doctor may know of other treatments that would potentially have more benefit for you.;
, There are risks involved in taking almost any drug or natural supplement. You and your doctor can work together to determine if chondroitin might benefit you based on your medical history and any other conditions you have.For example, if you have asthma, taking chondroitin supplements can worsen your symptoms.
The same is true if you have diabetes, because chondroitin supplements may affect your blood sugar levels.
If you have a bleeding disorder or are on a medication such as warfarin, taking chondroitin may cause additional bleeding.

, Although studies have shown that many people experience improvement in their symptoms after taking chondroitin supplements, that improvement typically is only mild to moderate.While chondroitin is marketed and used to improve a variety of medical conditions, it has not been thoroughly tested to treat many of these conditions.
There are studies showing a decrease in pain among people with osteoarthritis, but the decrease typically is limited and the improvement minor. If you've been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, you shouldn't expect any improvement as a result of taking chondroitin supplements above and beyond what you've been able to achieve on other drugs. However, taking chondroitin may enable you to decrease your dosage of NSAIDs.
Chondroitin typically is not recommended as an initial treatment for osteoarthritis. However, if you've been taking other medications to treat the condition, chondroitin may be helpful as a supplement to other medications.

, Chondroitin supplements most commonly are available in a combination form with glucosamine. There is some evidence that glucosamine also may reduce pain and loss of motion for people with osteoarthritis.If you have diabetes you should avoid glucosamine, which can interfere with insulin resistance.
Glucosamine also can have additional side effects, such as nausea or upset stomach, that might not be present with chondroitin. Taking the two in combination or taking your supplement with food may decrease these side effects.
If you have moderate to severe knee pain as a result of osteoarthritis, you may experience significant relief by taking a combination supplement that includes both glucosamine and chondroitin.

, Chondroitin supplements are prescribed by doctors in Europe. However, in other countries such as the United States these natural supplements are not subject to the same regulations that other drugs are. As a result, the quality and quantity of active ingredients can vary widely among different brands of supplements. Choose a brand that has been verified by a third party, such as USP.Additionally, some cheaper brands or generic supplements may not have the same quality controls in place when processing and manufacturing the supplements for distribution.
If you're buying chondroitin supplements over the counter, research brands carefully. Look for recalls or consumer complaints regarding the manufacturer's products.
Once you've found a brand that works for you, stick with the same brand rather than trying to substitute something cheaper. Even though it may seem to have the same active ingredients, you may not get the same results.

, Because the quality of supplements can vary significantly, you may want to ask your doctor or health care provider if there's a particular brand they recommend based on your condition and overall health.If your doctor has experience with chondroitin, or has other patients who currently are taking chondroitin, they may have a particular brand they can recommend for you based on your personal health history.
The source of the chondroitin or glucosamine in your supplements also may matter, and you wouldn't necessarily know this information by looking at the bottle. For example, while most glucosamine is harvested from shellfish, there are a few brands that are generally considered safe for people with shellfish allergies, as they have very low levels of shrimp allergen.Your doctor also may be able to tell you about possible side effects or interactions between the inactive ingredients in a supplement you're considering and any other conditions you have or medications you take.

, There are no regulatory requirements regarding how much of each active ingredient must be included in a combination supplement. If you've decided to take a combination supplement that contains chondroitin and glucosamine, be aware that different brands may contain different amounts of each.When you've found the supplement brand you think you want, talk to your doctor or to a pharmacist about how many pills you should take each day to treat your condition.
Review the amounts with your doctor so you can figure out which particular supplement would be the best for you personally given your lifestyle and any other medications you're taking.

, In the absence of other instruction from your doctor, you should not exceed the amount or frequency of dosage recommended on the label of the supplements you're taking.Generally, you should take between 800 and 1,000 milligrams of chondroitin sulfate each day. You may want to split this dosage up into three equal doses, or your doctor may recommend that frequency.
If you also are taking glucosamine, you should take no more than 1,500 milligrams each day.
You may want to decrease this dosage if you weigh under 100 pounds. If you weigh over 200 pounds or are considered obese, talk to your doctor about how much your daily dosage should be.

, Depending on the reasons for which you're taking chondroitin, your doctor may recommend you take a different dose than that described on the label your bottle of supplements.If your doctor recommends a specific dose, take that rather than what's listed on the label. However, you may want to bring your specific bottle of supplements into your doctor to verify that they want you to depart from the label's recommendations.
Your dosage also may vary depending on how you're taking chondroitin. While typically you take it by mouth in pill form, you also may have chondroitin in a cream applied to your skin, or in eye drops if you're taking chondroitin for cataracts.

, It can take as long as two or three months to achieve results from chondroitin supplements. If you quit taking it after a few weeks, you may not have any relief from your symptoms., You need to take chondroitin supplements consistently for at least two months before you will see the full effects. Make sure you're taking them at roughly the same time every day to maximize the effect.Particularly if you're taking chondroitin in combination with glucosamine, you typically want to take your supplements with food to avoid possible gastrointestinal side effects.
Gastrointestinal side effects are less common if you're taking chondroitin alone and not in combination with glucosamine.

, Even though you may not have a prescription for chondroitin, your supplements can have harmful effects if not used as directed or if used by others who are not taking them under a doctor's supervision.Chondroitin has not been tested in children and the supplement is not considered safe for children to ingest, particularly if combined with glucosamine.
Keep in mind that chondroitin can take months to show any significant effect on your symptoms. In the first few weeks you're taking it, you shouldn't increase your dosage just because you don't notice any improvement.

, If you have significant side effects while taking chondroitin supplements, you may find that they outweigh any benefit you might achieve as a result of taking them. This is especially true if you have other health conditions, or are at significant risk for developing other health conditions.Your doctor will discuss with you any possible interactions between chondroitin and other medications you're taking.
If you have diabetes, a bleeding disorder, or a heart condition, you should monitor your symptoms carefully while taking chondroitin. Discontinue the supplements if the symptoms of any other medical condition worsen.
Even without side effects, if you take chondroitin for more than two months and don't notice any change in the condition it was supposed to treat, you may want to stop taking the supplement. If it hasn't provided you any benefits after that time, it's unlikely to provide noticeable benefits if you continue taking it.

Consider your age.,
Think of your level of sun exposure.,
Take into consideration your skin tone.,
Check your weight.,
Consider existing medical conditions.,
Be aware of your diet.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency1," Infants and elderly people are at a higher risk. Infants often receive little sun exposure and do not ingest much vitamin D from their diets, especially if they’re breastfed and do not take any supplements. Elderly people require more vitamin D than younger adults and may not spend enough time outdoors due to limited mobility.


The recommended daily allowance, according to the Institute of Medicine, is 600 IU/day for adults and 800 IU/day for the elderly.;
, Because the body can synthesize vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, people whose occupations or lifestyles limit their time outdoors, or whose clothing choices keep their skin protected from the sun, may not get enough sun exposure to produce adequate levels of vitamin D.People who live in regions with less sunlight are also at a higher risk. These include countries in Northern Europe and Asia, Canada, the Northern United States, Southern Argentina and Chile.Children in developed countries, like the United States, tend to spend less time outside, and are more likely to wear sunblock when outside, which inhibits vitamin D synthesis.

, People with darker skin have higher levels of melanin, which can inhibit the skin's production of vitamin D. For example, in the United States the rate of vitamin D deficiency is higher among African Americans., Obese people tend to suffer from low vitamin D in greater numbers due to their body’s inability to convert the vitamin into a hormonally active form, no matter how much of it they take in from food or sun exposure., If you suffer from cystic fibrosis, kidney or liver disease, gastrointestinal conditions causing malabsorption such as IBS, Crohn's or celiac disease, you’re at a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is because, due to these conditions, your body might not be able to correctly absorb vitamin D from your food intake., People can get vitamin D through a limited amount of foods. Eating fatty fish such as salmon, sardines or tuna, eggs yolks, beef liver, some cheeses provides the body with natural sources of vitamin D3, one of its two forms. Vitamin D2 is instead found in grains and supplements.Consider vitamin D deficiency testing if you are a vegetarian or vegan, and make sure your diet includes fortified foods such as cereals and orange juice."

Try taking creatine monohydrate.,
Take a nitric oxide (NO) supplement.,
Determine how much you need of each supplement.,
Avoid supplements that combine more than one ingredient.",How to Stack Supplements1," Protein powders are some of the most used supplements because they contain amino acids that can help your muscles grow and stay strong. The most commonly used form of protein supplement is whey protein. Whey is the watery substance that forms when you make cheese out of milk. It can be digested easily, which means that it can quickly be absorbed into your muscles to nourish them. It is generally taken after you work out.


Casein protein is also a milk by-product, but it is absorbed a little more slowly than whey protein powder. However, what it lacks in speed, it makes up for in its ability to prevent your muscles from breaking down. It is generally taken before bed.
Egg protein is, as the name suggests, made from eggs. It is also packed with other nutrients, which can make it a good addition to your diet.
Soy protein is a plant-based protein powder, which is why some vegetarians choose it over other protein powders. It is also thought to boost your bone health and immune function.;
, Protein synthesis can also be called the muscle building process. Leucine helps your body move the protein you have consumed into the cells of your muscles. This can help to repair muscle damage that has occurred during your workouts.


Leucine can often be consumed as part of a post-workout beverage.

, Try to pick out a multivitamin that includes vitamins A, C, and E. It should also contain selenium, a vitamin B complex, calcium, and magnesium. The latter to help to keep your muscles, and bones, functioning properly.


Look on the container and make sure that the multivitamin is time-released. Generally, the multivitamin will be stacked so that you take it once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

, This is another supplement that works well when taken after your workout. The supplement is intended to boost your energy levels by replacing glycogen that you need to stay energized.


Pair dextrose with protein and leucine to create a stack that is designed to promote muscle growth, as well as quickened muscle repair.

, While this might not sound like something you want as part of your daily routine, fish oil is packed with healthy fats, like Omega-3 fatty acids, that can reduce the inflammation caused by your workouts.


Fish oil comes in both liquid and capsule form so if the taste of the fish oil gets to you, begin taking the capsules instead (they have a bit less of that pungent flavor).

, Glutamine is a type of amino acid that is meant to help promote muscle repair and growth. Because of this, it is generally taken after your workout to prevent soreness and promote protein synthesis.


Consider taking two to three servings a day, and split them between your post workout routine and your bedtime routine., Creatine can be made by your body, but taking a supplement can help to build up your lean muscle. It is also thought to boost your energy levels and make you stronger.


The conversion of creatine can lead to the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is important for resistance training exercises.

, NO helps to widen your blood vessels, which can help your muscles to grow. However, people with high blood pressure should not use NO, as it can exacerbate your symptoms.


Generally, you want to try taking nitric oxide supplements on an empty stomach. For this reason, you may consider taking your supplement before breakfast.

, The labels on your supplement containers should have a table or listing of how much of each supplement you should take, given your weight. It may also have suggestions for different goals, such as bulking up or losing weight while staying toned.


For example, if you a man who weighs 175 pounds, you need a total protein intake of 157.5 grams of protein each day.Keep in mind that you can get that protein from the food you eat. If, however, you think you are not getting enough protein each day, you would look at the protein powder you have chosen and see how many grams of protein are in one serving of the powder (generally around 20 grams). You would then add the powder to your diet accordingly.
When in doubt, talk to your doctor about how much of each supplement you need.

, Instead, you should get a supplement for each ingredient. This is because each supplement has an individual time that it works best at. For instance, some supplements should be taken on an empty stomach, while others should be taken with food.


For example, do not get something like a protein powder with a fat burning element (which would be made up of CLA and L-carnitine). Instead, get a protein powder, a CLA supplement, and an L-carnitine supplement. L-carnitine is best taken on an empty stomach. When you combine it with other ingredients, you limit its fat burning potential.

Be aware that you, like many adults, in the United States at least, may be chronically vitamin D deficient.,
Get all the vitamin D from sunlight you can.,
Supplement vitamin D in several ways.,
Use a good ""whole food"" vitamin as probably the best way to supplement anything dietary.,
Take such a supplement--and depending upon your overall health beginning this regimen--use at least twice a day or more for the first container, then a minimum of once a day is recommended.,
Supplement your diet with cod liver oil.,
Directly supplement, at least D3 (the most bio~active form).",How to Supplement Your Vitamin D (for Adults)," This is due to poor uptake or lack of dietary vitamin D (it is oil soluble, not water soluble, and requires oil in the intestine to be absorbed).


The US, RDA of vitamin D recently took a big jump, and many dietitians feel it is still 200-400% too low for optimum health. Recognize that any RDA was initially established based on what people could afford (that's right), and not what was required for their optimal health. There is an obvious lesson here, somewhere.
Vitamin D levels in your blood (""serum"" levels) also affect cholesterol metabolism. Serum levels, or ""what the doctor can measure"", are a poor indicator of overall vitamin D saturation, however, as who isn't tempted to pop a vitamin D cap on the way to their test?;
, Made on the surface of your skin, it is, strangely enough, not bio-available to your body until it undergoes two chemical conversions -- conversions which a chronically poor diet will easily interrupt.


It is difficult or impossible to get sufficient vitamin D solely from sunlight, especially in the winter. This is especially true at higher latitudes, where your major source of vitamin D will be dietary, at least for a considerable part of the year.
The rise of sunscreen use, and the thinning of the ozone layer, are factors that should be taken into account when considering relying on this source of vitamin D.

, Primary, of course, should be natural uptake via grass~fed proteins. There seems to be an ongoing debate as to where vitamin D from sunlight should fall in here; but recognize that vitamin D is sunlight, in a sense -- sunlight grows the grass that proteins eat, then you eat the proteins.

, While they exist in pill form, the best are powdered compounds of multiple plants~just concentrated food nutrients. While they aren't cheap, they will save you buying 20 different supplements (or more) -- the best ones contain over 70 ingredients, and, standing in line to buy your second $40 container, people (in a health food store) are going to be asking you what you are taking. Makes the taste worth it.


This container lasts one to two weeks, and the taste of the highest quality ones is reminiscent of...dead cat, and low tide? Yup; just ignore the directions, immediately cut the dosage in half (to 1 scoop), mix with 1 oz. of water, and shoot it.

, At this point, your body should be telling you how much it wants -- try running out, after using it for a week, and you'll begin to understand why, for many, this container is the first, most important grocery shopping they do all week~there is no substitute, and virtually every other thing you put in your mouth will become secondary.

, Vitamin D occurs in high levels from cod liver oil (but not fish oil) and in high quality proteins (grass fed); does anybody get enough of those?

, Consider that it is humans who decided that you only need D3, and seek a complete supplement; consider a ""whole food"" supplement, as adults don't get vitamin D deficient in a vacuum -- you surely have other deficiencies, as well.


Vitamin D deficiency alone will cause a cascade of deficiencies or poor metabolization; cholesterol metabolism is affected, calcium uptake is affected, mood is hugely affected. If you are currently deficient, and there is an overwhelming chance that you are, taking supplemental vitamin D is going to basically feel like a B12 shot.

Spot signs of weakness.,
Check whether you have osteoporosis or bones that break easily.,
Look for bowed legs and arms in children.,
Notice if you experience chronic pain in your bones or difficulty walking.,
Take note of excessive sweating.,
Pay attention to any swing in your mood.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency2," Vitamin D deficiency affects your muscle strength. Feeling weak, especially for no particular reason, can be a sign that your vitamin D levels are low., Because vitamin D is necessary for a healthy bone structure, its deficiency can cause malformations in children and a decreased bone density in adults., Children who do not get enough vitamin D may show bone deformities and develop rickets. Rickets is the term for the softening of bones that occurs when bone mineralization is defective due to vitamin D, calcium or phosphate deficiencies.


If left untreated rickets can lead to a curved spine, skeletal deformities, dental problems, and seizures.You should talk to your pediatrician if your child is not growing at a consistent rate, and check if this might be due to vitamin D deficiency.

, These could be a sign of osteomalacia, a defective bone mineralization in adults linked to low levels of vitamin D.Low levels of vitamin D can also be the reason behind pain or a slow recovery after a work out session.

, This could also be a sign of low vitamin D levels, especially if you sweat in conditions in which your normally wouldn’t, such as mild temperatures or during a period of inactivity.


Although this might be too vague a symptom for adults, a sweaty forehead in newborns is one of the most evident symptoms of vitamin D deficiency., Low levels of vitamin D can also impact the hormones affecting our mood, such as serotonin. For this reason, some cases of vitamin D deficiency can be misdiagnosed as depression."
"
Consult your doctor.,
Ask your doctor for a vitamin D test.,
Order a vitamin D test online.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency3," After you’ve checked your symptoms and risk factors, ask your doctor whether these issues might be linked to a vitamin D deficiency. Remember to mention any part of your lifestyle that might be linked to lower levels, such as limited sun exposure or dietary habits.

, This is just a regular blood test in which your blood levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D is checked. This test, also known as 25(OH)D, is the only way for you to know whether your symptoms are linked to a vitamin D deficiency.Healthy individuals usually have a level between 20 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. A level below 12 ng/mL is a sign of vitamin D deficiency., In the United States, it is possible to take the test without consulting your doctor. Some labs allow you to order a 25(OH)D test online and take it either at home (by piercing your finger and getting a blood sample) or at their closest facilities."

Determine the time at which each supplement will work most effectively.,
Do not combine supplements that are strong stimulants.,
Create a stack that will help you lose weight.,
Make a stack to help you build muscle.,
Stick to one stack for a couple of months to monitor its effects on your body.,
Understand that supplements recommended by a friend might not work well for you.,
Talk to a nutritionist or trainer if you are having hard time figuring out what supplements might be right for you.",How to Stack Supplements2," Different supplements will be absorbed best at different times of the day, when your body is in different states. For example, nitric oxide works well when you take it when your stomach is empty. However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone’s body is different, so you need to figure out what times work best for you.


Creatine and glutamine may compete in your body, so it you are taking both of these supplements, consider splitting them up so that they work as effectively as possible. Try taking creatine a half hour before your workout, and then again immediately after your workout. Then, before you go to bed, take your glutamine supplement.
The time that you take protein will depend on your preferences. The four times that protein will generally be most effective include when you wake up, a half hour before your workout, after your workout, and before bed.

, Many supplements designed to be taken before your workout contain synthetic stimulants. Weight-loss and fat burning supplements also contain a lot of stimulants. If you use both types of supplements, do not take them at the same time, as combining these stimulants could cause overstimulation. In extreme circumstances, this could lead to a heart attack.


If you are using both a pre-workout stimulant, like a caffeine supplement, and a fat burning supplement, separate them by at least half a day.

, Keep in mind that taking these supplements are only part of the weight loss process. Losing weight is really about eating healthy and exercising often. Once you have created a healthy diet for yourself, you can then supplement your diet and exercises with this stack:


Protein, multivitamin, and a thermogenic supplement like guarana or green tea. The protein helps you to keep your muscle mass high while still losing weight. The multivitamin can ensure that you get the nutrients you need when you cut back on the food you eat. The natural caffeine supplement can speed up your body’s metabolism. It may also help to suppress your appetite a little.
This stack promotes an increased metabolism that can help you to burn your way through the calories you consume.

, Muscle building stacks are designed to speed up your muscles’ recovery after an intense workout, while also promoting muscle growth and weight maintenance. An example stack would be:


Protein to help you build up your muscle mass. As mentioned above, you can take protein in the morning, at night, before your workout, or after your workout..
Nitric oxide to boost your strength and muscle size. You split up your daily intake of nitric oxide so that you take it three times a day before meals (your stomach should be relatively empty). You can combine this supplement with creatine and a caffeine supplement for an energy boost before your workout.
A creatine supplement taken at least 30 minutes before you take your protein supplement.
A glutamine supplement taken after your workout to help your muscles recover and repair themselves. You can also add glutamine to your pre-workout drink.
A multivitamin to make sure you are getting your daily nutrients.

, Like any lifestyle change you make, it may take a couple of weeks or months before you see the effects. Some people recommend that you only take certain supplement for a maximum of eight weeks, then take a break for four to six weeks.


The supplements that you can take continuously include a multivitamin, your protein powder, and fish oil (or omega-3 supplements).

, Each person has different needs. Because of this, you should do your research regarding what supplements achieve the effects that you are looking for, given your medical history, body type, and gender.


The stack that your gym buddy says works well for him or her, may not have the same effect on your body.

, When in doubt, it is always a good idea to talk to a professional who can help you to create a healthy stack.


Talk to a health trainer at your gym. It is helpful if you have worked with the trainer before because the trainer will then have an idea of your routine, which can help him or her to figure out when you should take your supplements.

Make sure you are eating a healthy diet.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Stack Supplements3," Supplements are meant to enhance your diet, not replace them. You will not lose weight if you take supplements but do not change your diet.


In general, you will want to stick to a moderate amount of complex carbs, rather than simple carbs, eat healthy levels of protein, and eat healthy fats, rather than bad fats.

, This may go without saying, but you will not build up muscle if you do not practice some resistance training, no matter how many supplements you take. Work with a trainer to come up with an exercise routine that will work well for you and your goals.

, Many supplements can cause you to become dehydrated, so it is important that you stay hydrated by drinking lots of liquids. Of course, the amount of water you need differs from person to person. However, general guidelines are:


Adult men generally need at least 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day.Adult women generally need at least 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day."

Swallow a pill up to three times a day.,
Consume dried leaves as a substitute.,
Continue with your other medication.",How to Take Artichoke Leaf Extract1," The typical dose for a standardized pill is 300 – 640 mg. It is recommended that you take this dose three times a day. You may need to take it for up to six weeks to see effects.The typical daily dosage of artichoke extract is between 1,240 and 1,800 mg for most people. Ask your doctor what might be the best dosage for you.
Take the pill with water if you have difficulty swallowing pills dry.
To help you remember to take it three times a day, you might want to take it when you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Artichoke leaf extract does not need to be taken with food, although it can be if you want.;
, It can be difficult to find a standardized artichoke leaf extract pill. If you cannot take a pill, you can weigh between 1 and 4 grams of dried artichoke leaves.You can powder the leaves using a mortar and pestle.Consume each dose up to three times a day.


If eating the leaves does not appeal to you, you can brew them as a tea. Place the leaves in a tea strainer, and pour hot water over them. Let them steep for a few minutes.You can buy dried leaves online or at an herbal supply store. You can also dry your own by placing them in an oven or dehydrator for between one and four hours. Set the temperature to between 95 °F (35 °C) and 115 °F (46 °C)., Artichoke leaf extract is a complementary medicine. This means that it has modest health benefits on its own, but it is not a good substitute for medication. If you have a medical condition that you can think can be treated with artichoke leaf extract, talk to your doctor. Make sure that it will not interfere with your normal medication. Continue taking your medication as directed.

This can include redness, warm, itchy or irritated skin, as well as a tingly feeling under the skin. These symptoms can be enhanced if alcoholic or hot beverages are taken shortly after the niacin., Niacin is processed by the liver, and as a result, an overdose can cause the development of jaundice like symptoms. This includes yellowing of the skin and eyes., A niacin overdose can cause symptoms associated with nausea and an upset stomach. For example, you may experience vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea."

Talk to your doctor.,
Research your condition.,
Get a cholesterol test.,
Avoid artichoke leaf extract if you have an allergy or bile duct condition.",How to Take Artichoke Leaf Extract2," Before starting any supplement or complementary medicine, always speak to your doctor first. Explain to them why you want to take artichoke leaf extract, and ask them if they think it will interfere with any of your current medications.


While there are few known side effects of artichoke leaf extract, it can worsen bile duct problems, increase bleeding, or cause a rash., Artichoke leaf extract can help reduce the symptoms of certain medical conditions and diseases. If you are suffering from a particular condition, you may find that artichoke leaf extract provides relief when taken with your normal medication. These conditions include:


Irritable Bowel SyndromeHigh cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia)HyperlipidemiaHyperlipoproteinemiaChronic gastrointestinal distress, Artichoke leaf extract is most often used to lower cholesterol levels. If you have high cholesterol or if you have a cholesterol-related condition, such as hyperlipoproteinemia, an artichoke leaf extract can help you manage it.If you’re not sure about your cholesterol levels, ask your doctor to do a cholesterol test.


You may not be able to eat for twelve hours before your test. This is a type of blood test, which means that your blood will be drawn.If your mean cholesterol levels are 5.17 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), you may have hypercholesterolemia. Artichoke leaf extract may be able to help manage your levels slightly as a complementary medicine, but you should still take the medication prescribed to you by your doctor., While most people will not have an adverse reaction to artichoke leaf extract, you should avoid it if you have an allergy to artichoke or to any plants related to the artichoke (such as daisies). Furthermore, those who have bile duct obstructions, such as gallstones, may find that it worsens their condition.Allergies to artichoke often manifest as skin rashes (dermatitis).
Its safety for use during pregnancy has never been tested. If you are pregnant or lactating, you may want to avoid artichoke leaf extract just in case."

Trust verified brands.,
Look for seals of verification.,
Read the ingredients.,
Avoid foreign products.,
Find the right dosage.",How to Take Artichoke Leaf Extract3," There are many brands on the internet offering artichoke leaf extract, but you should exercise caution when ordering from the internet. Look for brands that you recognize and trust. Order from their official website. These brands may be manufactured in registered facilities, such as an FDA registered facility. Some good brands include:


GNC Herbal Plus Artichoke Extract
Good n Natural Artichoke Extract Capsules
Superior Labs Artichoke Leaf Extract

, Supplements are not subject to the same FDA regulations as medications, meaning they are not tested for safety and efficacy. This means it is possible that supplements do not contain the advertised dose or even the advertised ingredients. Some companies choose to have their products verified by independent organizations, who will test for dangerous contaminants and make sure the product contains the amounts as advertised.Look for seals from the following organizations:


U.S. Pharmacopeia (""USP Verified"")
NSF International
ConsumerLab.com
UL

, The FDA requires that all ingredients on an herbal supplement are listed on the label (though, keep in mind, it has been shown that not all companies comply with this).When taking artichoke leaf extract, you may not want other ingredients interfering with the dosage. Some extract companies may try to dilute the extracts with other ingredients. Make sure you always read the label before purchasing.


The artichoke may be listed under one of its scientific names. These include Cynara scolymus L. and C. cardunculus L.If you are shopping online and the store does not offer an ingredients list, do not buy the extract.

, Products manufactured and imported from abroad are not subject to FDA regulations, and therefore it is impossible to tell if you are actually receiving artichoke leaf extract or a cheaper substitute. Some foreign supplements may also contain toxic substances that are not included on the label. Always buy domestic products to make sure that you are receiving the highest quality supplement that you can., Your doctor can provide you guidance as to the proper amount you need a day. If you’re still uncertain about how much you need, look for pills that offer between 300 – 640 mg in each dose. This is the recommended amount for most healthy adults."

Monitor your heart rate.,
Look for signs of low blood pressure.,
Visit your doctor regularly.",How to Spot Signs of Niacin Overdose2," Niacin can be medically prescribed to help lower the risk of a heart attack among patients who have already suffered from at least one heart attack. As a result, niacin can impact your heart rate. In cases when a niacin overdose has taken place, you may experience a fast, pounding, uneven, or irregular heartbeat., Niacin is often medically prescribed to help lower blood pressure. If an overdose occurs your blood pressure may decrease to dangerous levels. Symptoms associated with severely low blood pressure include, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, and the feeling that you may pass out.You should never take niacin if you already have low blood pressure.

, While taking niacin supplements, you should have your blood tested regularly by your doctor. This way your doctor can monitor your overall health, particularly the functioning of your liver and kidneys. Kidney or liver failure can be severe and even deadly, if left untreated."
"
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Treat the symptoms that occur.,
Stop taking niacin.",How to Spot Signs of Niacin Overdose3," If you believe that you, or someone you know, has overdosed on niacin, you should seek medical attention immediately. Go to your nearest hospital emergency room or call the Poison Help Line at 1-800-222-1222. Some side effects of a niacin overdose are severe and can lead to other major medical issues including kidney, liver, or heart failure., A niacin overdose can impact your liver, blood pressure, and heart rate. It is likely that your physician will treat the symptoms that are presenting. For example, you may have your stomach pumped to remove the niacin from your system. Alternatively, you may be required to have your blood tested to see if your liver is functioning properly., Most of the side effects related to a niacin overdose will subside once you stop taking niacin. Your doctor will likely terminate your use of the drug. Niacin can then be re-prescribed at a lower daily dosage."

Eat fresh foods.,
Include raw food in your diet.,
Reduce surface exposure.,
Choose fruits ripened in the sun.,
Wash produce quickly.",How to Preserve Vitamins in Foods1," Nutrients are most plentiful in fruits and vegetables that have just been picked. The longer you wait to eat your food, the more nutrient loss will have occurred.Only buy as much as you will use in a few days. It is better to shop more often and have fresher food options.
Shop at markets that offer the freshest food. In season, you may be able to buy directly from farmers or at farmers’ markets.;
, Cooking vegetables can reduce the amount of vitamin C they contain, though it can also increase other valuable nutrients, such as lycopene. Broccoli, watercress, and garlic are all generally better raw than cooked.Moderation and balance are the keys.


Raw broccoli contains sulforaphane, a potentially protective compound, and raw carrots contain polyphenols, another protective group of chemicals. Cooking these vegetables destroys these compounds, but replaces them with other beneficial substances including indole and carotenoid., Air, water and heat all attack vitamins starting at the surface of the produce.Vegetables cut into large pieces will retain more nutrients in cooking than small pieces. If you need smaller, bite-size pieces, you can always cut them smaller prior to serving.

, Avoid fruits that were picked green. Tomatoes ripened outdoor on the vine can have twice as much vitamin C as greenhouse tomatoes, for example., If you soak produce, you may leach out water-soluble vitamins and minerals."
"
Know which foods are most nutritious when cooked and how to cook them.,
Choose cooking pots wisely.,
Don’t overcook.,
Steam where possible.If you boil vegetables or cook them in large quantities of fat (for instance, through deep-frying), you may end up leaching out valuable vitamins.,
Add some oil to your vegetables.,
Reuse or conserve cooking water.",How to Preserve Vitamins in Foods2," If a food contains a lot of nutrients and vitamins but your body cannot absorb or process them, then the nutrients are essentially wasted. Cooking can often increase the absorption of certain nutrients. For instance, the absorption of beta-carotene was found to be 6.5 times greater when carrots were stir fried versus when eaten raw. Tomatoes sautéed in olive oil may be linked to an increased absorption of lycopene, an antioxidant.Spinach, asparagus, and mushrooms are other foods that may benefit from heating, as this can increase the bioavailability of certain nutrients, allowing your body to better absorb them.
Try cooking foods whole an unpeeled to preserve their vitamins while cooking.
It may surprise you to learn that microwaving is a good way to heat food while preserving many nutrients, particularly in mushrooms and garlic. This is due to the short cooking times., Iron pots may destroy vitamin C but add iron, especially in acidic food, while unlined copper will destroy vitamin C, vitamin E, and folacin., Roasting meat for a long time destroys thiamin., Water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin B and vitamin C will be leached out during boiling, while fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A will leach out into cooking oil. Instead, steam vegetables using a small amount of water on the stovetop or in a microwave. You can also sauté them in a small amount of fat that will be including in the dish itself.As long as you use microwave-safe vessels, microwaving does not affect nutrient content more than any other cooking method.Keep the lid on. By keeping the lid on your pot while cooking vegetables, steam is created that helps cook the vegetables faster.

, Drizzling some olive oil on your salad or lightly frying your greens in oil can help you absorb the fat-soluble vitamins contained in vegetables., Any water that is used while cooking catches the vitamins that leach out of the food, as well as some of its flavor. Choose cooking methods that allow you to retain this water. For example, cook vegetables in a soup. Or, use the leftover water from steaming as the basis for the broth for your next batch of soup."

Store fruits and vegetables in a cool place.,
Keep milk cool and out of strong light.,
Freeze foods.,
Dehydrate foods.,
Eat canned foods sparingly.",How to Preserve Vitamins in Foods3," The enzymatic processes that destroy vitamins will be slowed by keeping vegetables and fruits near freezing temperatures., Riboflavin, vitamin A, and vitamin D can be destroyed by direct light., Freezing retains nutrients better than other methods of preservation such as drying, pickling, or canning.Blanch vegetables first by submersing them briefly in boiling water to stop the enzymatic changes that destroy vitamins and also to kill micro-organisms living on the surface.Add ascorbic acid to fruits to control enzymes that cause deterioration of vitamins as well as colors.If vegetables or fruits were frozen immediately after harvest, they may have more vitamins than older fresh produce at a grocery store., While drying foods in the sun or ovens causes more vitamin loss than freezing, it is less damaging than the canning process. Freeze-drying, which is a method often used for herbs and soups, preserves even more nutritional value., Canning removes many water-soluble vitamins. However, it allows for the storage of vegetables and meats at room temperature with minimal chemical preservatives. In addition, some canned foods retain vitamins. Canned fish, for example, has high levels of calcium, and canned oily fish retains its levels of omega-3 fatty acids."

Understand the role of folic acid in the body.",How to Learn and Understand the Functions of Vitamins in the Body," Vitamins are organic compounds which are important for the normal metabolism inside our body. They function there as co-enzymes. Vitamins are divided according to their solubility in water and lipids. There are water soluble vitamins and fat soluble vitamins.;
, Fat soluble vitamins are designated vitamins A, D, E, and K. Water soluble vitamins are the B vitamins and vitamin C. Vitamins B include: thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinamide, pyridoxine and folic acid and vitamin B12.

, It is absorbed in the intestine and is transported to the liver for storage. The clinical manifestation of vitamin A deficiency includes night vision loss which is called medically nyctalopia. In complete deficiency of vitamin A vision during the day is also lost. Vitamin A is lipid soluble.

, It facilitates the absorption of calcium ions in the intestine. It has two sources. One is from the diet and the other is from exposure of the skin to UV radiation from the sun.


One of the disorders of vitamin D deficiency is called rickets. It is common in children.

Osteomalacia is a similar disease which occurs in the elderly people.


Vitamin D overdose can lead to hypercalcemia with its consequences of deposition of calcium salts in different body tissues such as the kidney and the blood vessels. This can form stones in these tissues.
Vitamin K is another lipid soluble vitamin. It is important for the proper function of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of clotting factors for the blood. Deficiency of this vitamin can occur due to malabsorption or due to administration of antibiotics.







, Killing these bacteria by the administration of antibiotics can lead to shortage of vitamin K and subsequently to hemorrhage symptoms. The presence of vitamin K antagonists such as those poisons used to kill rats can lead to vitamin K deficiency.

, It functions as an antioxidant in the cells. Thus it can protect the cell from the effect of free radicals that can be generated from ionizing radiation such as UV radiation.

, It has also an antioxidant effect on the cells. It is necessary for the proper synthesis of collagen of the connective tissue. Its deficiency can cause scurvy.

, Thiamine or vitamin B1 is another water soluble vitamin. It is important as a coenzyme for the energy making process in the cell which is called glycolysis. It is important for the decarboxylation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate in this process. This step is an important one in the glycolytic pathway. A medical condition that is caused by a deficiency of thiamine is called beriberi.

, Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is another water soluble vitamin. It is an important part of the protein flavoprotein which participates in electron transport in the cellular respiratory chain. Clinical manifestation of riboflavin deficiency includes inflammation of the lips, a condition that is called medically cheilosis.

, Niacin is another water soluble vitamin. Niacin is an important part of the NAD molecule which is a coenzyme for oxidation / reduction reactions in the body. Niacin deficiency can cause a medical condition that is called pellagra. Pellagra is characterized clinically by a dermatitis and diarrhea and dementia.

, Pyridoxine is another water soluble vitamin. It is changed in the body to pyridoxal 5-phosphate which is an important coenzyme that is involved in enzymatic processes in the cell. Clinical manifestations of the deficiency of this vitamin include: seborrheic dermatitis and blepharitis and cheilosis.

, Folic acid and vitamin B12 are the last water soluble vitamins that I discuss here. Folic acid is involved in DNA bases synthesis. Vitamin B12 is also important for the blood cells. Its deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia.

Eat foods high in iron and vitamin C. The human body typically absorbs iron from dietary sources.,
Eat meat and seafood to get dietary iron.,
Eat legumes for iron.Soybeans, white beans, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, peanuts (and peanut butter) and other legumes can offer a very healthy source of iron.1 cup of white beans provides 44% (8mg) of the daily recommended iron intake for most adults.

,
Eat fortified grain products.,
Eat leafy greens.,
Eat nuts and seeds.,
Eat tropical fruits with iron-rich vegetables.Guava, kiwi, papaya, pineapple, and mango are all rich in vitamin C and can help you absorb iron from foods, especially from leafy greens, legumes, or grain products.,
Combine iron-rich plant foods with citrus.,
Eat more vegetables.",How to Increase Iron Absorption1," In order to absorb the iron, you must consume it through food or supplements. Vegetarians, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with certain chronic illnesses may be at increased risk for poor iron absorption or inadequate iron levels.Certain foods are naturally high in iron and can be regularly incorporated into the diet to increase the amount of iron you absorb.


Even vegetarians who eat high quantities of fortified grains and iron-rich vegetables can still suffer from iron deficiencies. The form of iron found in plants is more difficult for the body to absorb, but combining them with foods or drinks that contain vitamin C can increase absorption levels.The daily value (DV) for iron is 18mg for most adults and children over age 4. Pregnant women need more iron (27mg daily).;
, Most animal proteins provide iron, and red meat is a particularly good source of dietary iron.Even small portions of animal proteins on a regular basis can help many individuals obtain healthy levels of iron in the blood.
Eat oysters and other shellfish. One serving of oysters provides 44% (8mg) of the recommended daily iron intake for most adults.
Eat organ meats. Organ meats such as beef liver can also be very rich in iron. 3 ounces of beef liver provides 28% (5mg) of your daily iron intake.,, Many breakfast cereals are fortified with iron. In some cases, a single bowl of fortified cereal can provide sufficient daily iron intake, but not all cereals are fortified to the same degree.Check cereals, breads, pastas, and other grain products for iron content to get an accurate estimate of how many milligrams you consume each day from products you already eat regularly.

, Spinach and other dark leafy greens often contain several milligrams of iron – a 1/2 cup of cooked spinach can provide 17% (3mg) of the recommended daily intake for most children and men.Spirulina seaweed is another very rich source of iron., In addition to heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, many nuts provide a healthy dose of iron.Try cashew nuts, pistachios, almonds, or pine nuts (actually a type of seed).


Sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds also provide iron.

,, Oranges and grapefruits are excellent sources of vitamin C. Whole or as freshly squeezed juice, they are helpful for increased iron absorption., Bell peppers, broccoli, kohlrabi, cabbage, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, and kale offer vitamin C and are easy to incorporate with other vegetables that are iron-rich."

Speak with a health professional about iron supplements.,
Get tested for iron deficiency.,
Review over-the-counter iron supplement options.",How to Increase Iron Absorption2," Iron needs vary during different stages of life and for men and women. Young children, adolescents experiencing growth spurts, menstruating women, and pregnant women often have elevated iron needs. Many infants are given iron supplements or fed iron-fortified formula to achieve adequate iron levels. Anemic individuals or people taking antacids also may require iron supplements to ensure adequate intake. Your doctor can help you decide whether you need additional iron supplements.In most cases, adequate iron intake can be achieved through the diet or through a standard multi-vitamin.
Pregnant women taking prenatal vitamins may already be receiving iron supplementation.

, In many cases, a simple blood test can give immediate feedback on your current iron levels and alert you to a potential deficiency.To confirm an actual deficiency or anemia, additional blood tests must be conducted. These can help determine whether the deficiency is caused by inadequate intake or another medical condition.
The people most at risk of iron deficiency are pregnant women, infants and young children, women with heavy menstrual bleeding, frequent blood donors, and people with cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, or heart failure. People who live in developing countries are also at higher risk.

, Many iron supplements are available for purchase without a prescription.Depending on your needs, a single low-dose supplement each day may help you achieve adequate intake. Remember that supplements are only necessary to make up the difference between your dietary intake and your iron needs.
Infant iron supplement drops and other specialty supplements often require a prescription from a physician or nurse practitioner.
Young children typically need 7-11 mg/day, adult men and senior women need approximately 8 mg/day, women of childbearing age need 15-18 mg/day, pregnant women need 27 mg/day, and lactating women need 9 mg/day. The Daily Value (DV) is 18 mg/day for adults and children over the age of 4. Discuss your individual iron needs with a health professional prior to supplementation.

, It will take 2 to 3 minutes for the gelatin to dissolve into the orange juice.Once it turns thick and lumpy, give the mixture a stir with a whisk., This will take about 5 to 6 minutes.Do not let the mixture come to a boil.

The gelatin must dissolve all the way. If you rub the mixture between you thumb and finger, and if it feels grainy, it's not ready yet., This is very important, as too much heat may destroy the beneficial properties of the honey and vitamin C powder., Depending on how sweet you like your gummies, you will need 2 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 90 grams) of honey. The more honey you add, the sweeter the gummies will be. You can also add in some vanilla extract and/or orange extract for extra flavor., You can use a small sauce ladle, a dropper, squeeze bottle, or syringe to do this.

Review published clinical research.,
Evaluate the group size and length of each study.,
Consider personal reviews and testimonials.,
View sales pitches with skepticism.,
Read labels carefully.",How to Know if Weight Loss Supplements Really Work1," You typically can find articles about published research online that has tested the weight loss claims of specific weight-loss supplements. Keep in mind that researchers define ""clinically meaningful weight loss"" as at least 5 percent of total body weight over the course of a year.Unfortunately, it may be difficult to find significant studies on the supplements in which you're interested. When you do find studies, look critically at who conducted the research and for what purpose.
For example, you want to give more weight to an independent study conducted by a government agency or a university than you would to a study done by a company that also sells the supplement being tested.;
, Weight-loss supplement manufacturers rarely complete extensive studies on the safety and effectiveness of their products before introducing them into the marketplace.Many studies involve small numbers of people, and only last a few months or even a few weeks. These studies aren't broad enough for you to get an accurate picture of whether the supplement has long-term effectiveness.
Avoid taking a weight-loss supplement for a longer period of time than researchers have spent testing its safety and effectiveness. This means that if a study only tested the safety of the supplement over the space of a month, you should not take it longer than a month. Supplements can have cumulative effects, and these may not be known if no one has ever studied people who took the supplement over a long period of time.

, Keep in mind that testimonials are unreliable, anecdotal evidence that won't really prove whether a weight-loss supplement really works. However, they can provide you with some information regarding the experience of other individuals.Often, weight loss in a clinical setting will differ from the weight loss experienced by individuals not involved in a scientific trial. For this reason, personal reviews and testimonials can give you a better understanding of how the supplement works in ""real life.""
Focus on testimonials by people similar to you to get a better idea of whether that particular weight-loss supplement will really work for you. Look for people that had similar goals to yours and are the same gender as you. Ideally, they also should be the same age, general height and weight, and have a similar lifestyle.
It may be difficult to get enough information about someone and how they used the weight-loss supplement through the person's review for that review to really be valuable to you. Be careful about putting too much weight on personal reviews and testimonials for this reason.

, The ultimate goal of any marketing, advertisement, or promotional material is to sell product and turn a profit. Particularly when you're dealing with individuals involved in multi-level marketing programs to sell dietary supplements, they may not have your best interests at heart.If someone's trying to sell you something, they will try to appeal to your needs and desires, and may make promises that they have no intention of keeping.
Sales pitches will highlight individual results that are not typical of the experiences most people taking that particular weight-loss supplement have. Sometimes, the person to whom you're speaking may personally be one of those individuals who has experienced ""miraculous"" results after taking the supplement.
While the salesperson may be a real believer in the effectiveness of the supplement, that still doesn't mean the weight-loss supplement really works, or that it will be beneficial for you.

, Before you take a particular weight-loss supplement, make sure you understand how it's meant to be taken and under what circumstances. Typically, supplement claims rely on taking the supplement in combination with a healthy diet and regular exercise.Even if the product isn't regulated or controlled by a government agency, you should never exceed the dosage listed on the bottle. Doing so could result in significant uncomfortable or unpleasant side effects, such as stomach problems, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, and dizziness.Follow the dosage instructions listed on the label. For example, if the label states that you should always take the supplement with food, make sure you never take it on an empty stomach.
If you switch to a different brand of the same supplement, you still need to evaluate the label carefully. Don't assume that you can take a new brand the same way you took the previous one, even if both have the same ingredients.

Research possible side effects.,
Read reviews and testimonials.,
Understand that the FDA does not regulate supplements.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Know if Weight Loss Supplements Really Work2," Before you consider taking a supplement, you need to have a good idea of what might possibly happen to you as a result. With some supplements, you may decide the side effects are too much to risk, even if the product does really work.Government health or medical agencies often are a good source of information about the side effects of weight-loss supplements. In some cases, the side effects may be so severe that the supplement has been banned in various countries. If you're looking at a supplement that any country is banned, find out why.
The website of the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicines, based in the United States, is a good source for general information about many different weight-loss supplements.
Look at reputable medical websites online to get detailed information about the supplement so you'll know what to expect. Consider the types of side effects, as well as how common they are, before you make the decision to add a particular supplement to your weight-loss regimen.
Keep in mind that even ""natural"" supplements may have unpleasant or dangerous side effects., While reviews and testimonials may not give you a clear indication of whether a particular weight-loss supplement really works, they often give you a better idea of the side effects of taking a particular supplement.Keep in mind that just because one person experienced unpleasant or uncomfortable side effects as a result of taking a weight-loss supplement, that doesn't mean you'll have the same experience.
However, if through your research you find that a majority of the people who've tried the supplement have had similar side effects, you probably want to avoid that particular supplement just to be on the safe side. The modest benefit you receive from the supplement likely isn't worth the risk of unpleasant side effects.

, In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate weight loss supplements. While some prescription weight loss drugs have FDA approval, over-the-counter supplements have not been tested by the government for safety or effectiveness. Understand that you are taking that risk when purchasing weight loss supplements.Keep in mind that just because a product is sold in stores doesn't necessarily mean it's been approved as a weight-loss aid or proven safe for that use. In the U.S., check the FDA's website to see if a weight-loss supplement you're interested in has raised any concerns with government researchers.

, You should always have your doctor actively involved in any weight-loss plan you start. If you're interested in adding a weight-loss supplement, ask your doctor whether they recommend it, and what results you can expect.Typically you can expect your doctor to be skeptical of many weight-loss supplements, particularly over-the-counter weight-loss supplements that are unregulated by any governmental authority.
If your doctor approves of a particular supplement, they may be able to offer suggestions on dosage or even recommend particular brands.
Depending on your weight loss goals, your doctor may be willing to prescribe you a weight-loss supplement. Prescription weight-loss supplements have a higher success rate than over-the-counter supplements, and have been the subject of more research.
If you want to lose weight in a healthy and effective manner, ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian.

Have realistic expectations.,
Start a calorie-restricted diet.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Avoid excessive use of stimulants.,
Give any supplement a full trial.,
Use any supplement in addition to a nutritious diet.",How to Know if Weight Loss Supplements Really Work3," Regardless of the bold-letter claims of weight-loss supplements, no pill is going to cause excess weight to start falling off like magic. Lifestyle changes are the best way to lose weight and keep it off.Any pills that do significantly enhance weight loss may have side effects that make them dangerous if taken long-term. And once you stop taking the supplement, you can expect the weight you lost to return – especially if you didn't make any major changes to your diet or lifestyle.
Weight loss in a research setting may be greater than in a real-life setting because other aspects of the participants' lives are monitored more closely. Typically, diet and exercise is strictly controlled so the researchers can measure the effect of the weight-loss supplement.

, A weight-loss supplement won't work if you do nothing to limit and control what you're eating. While a supplement may help you lose more weight than you would lose without it, to begin the process you must consume fewer calories.Build a diet centered around protein, healthy fats, and slow-digesting carbs. You also should include lots of fruit and vegetables. Research the right diet for you, or talk to your doctor or to a dietitian about the best diet strategy for you.
Keep in mind what the weight-loss supplement is designed to do. Many of them will claim to give you more energy, which might remedy the problem of feeling tired or lethargic when you start consuming fewer calories. Others are appetite suppressants, which may make it easier for you to stick to your diet. However, the diet has to come first.

, The food you eat is fuel for your body. The more active you are, the more calories you'll burn. If you burn more calories than you eat, you'll gradually lose weight.Start slow, especially if you haven't been in the habit of exercising before. Aim to do something active for at least 15 minutes a day, whether it's going out for a walk or just dancing around your house.
Exercise will become habitual if you try to do something at the same time every day, and include it as a necessary part of your routine.

, Many weight-loss supplements contain caffeine or other stimulants. If you're also a regular coffee drinker on top of that, you run the risk of overdosing on caffeine, which can cause you to fatigue faster and have difficulty recovering after exercise.Pay attention to the amount of caffeine or other stimulants that are included in your weight-loss supplement. This is especially important if you're taking a weight-loss supplement that claims it can give you more energy.
Keep in mind that you may have to alter your habits to decrease your intake of stimulants when you start taking a weight-loss supplement. Monitor your coffee or tea consumption, especially if you typically consume several cups a day.

, If you decide to start a weight-loss supplement, monitor and assess your progress over the course of several weeks to evaluate its effectiveness. If you don't have noticeable results, you may want to stop taking it.Don't expect to see instant results. Take photos of yourself or measure yourself so that you have an objective means of comparison so you can evaluate your progress. Typically it's better to evaluate the effectiveness of a supplement if you start your diet and exercise program first, do it for about a month, and then add a weight-loss supplement.
Make your first evaluations after you've taken the supplement regularly for at least two weeks. If you don't see any significant difference after a month of taking the supplement, stop taking the supplement.

, You shouldn't view any weight-loss or dietary supplement as a requirement if you want to meet your weight loss goals. As the name suggests, any weight-loss supplement should be taken in addition to a healthy lifestyle.Most weight-loss supplements are designed to help you overcome various hurdles you may encounter as you try to transform your lifestyle into something more healthy. Whatever help they provide, they are not designed to replace a healthy diet and exercise.
This can be difficult because many commercials for weight-loss supplements imply – or even outright state – that you can eat whatever you want and make no changes to your lifestyle and still lose weight. These sorts of claims are never accurate.

Change your diet if you plateau.",How to Safely Gain 10 Pounds in a Month1," Get a small journal, or maintain a log on your computer, in which you list everything that you drink and eat throughout the day. Try to write down both the portions and a description of the item itself. Then, on a daily basis, go through and track how many calories that you are consuming.If you are unsure about the nutritional profile of a particular food, you can go online and look for a free calorie or nutrition calculator. There are a number of food diary apps available for download as well, such as Rise Up and Calorific.Keeping a log can encourage you to eat healthy foods as well. It can also help you to identify if you have a tendency to eat poorly at certain periods of the day.;
, Gaining weight requires that you consume additional calories. To gain steadily over a month, you should aim for a 5 to 10% increase from a standard calorie intake, determined by your age and weight. To stay healthy, you’ll want to eat additional portions of good foods, instead of going for high-fat junk foods.A few examples of healthy, filling foods are: bananas, almond butter, sweet potatoes, and lean meats. If, for example, you are trying to bulk up and normally eat one banana a day, you may want to boost it up to three per day., A good rule to follow is to make sure that you eat a full meal or snack at least every four hours. This will keep your energy level balanced and will allow you to consume more calories over the day. If you skip meals, you are forcing your body to break down tissues in order to continue functioning, which does not promote healthy weight gain.If you are trying to gain weight, it may be a good idea to eat a filling meal right before bed. This will give your body the nutrients that it needs to repair itself overnight. A whole-grain pasta dish is always a good option.

, To gain weight in a healthy way, you’ll need enough protein to fuel your muscles, along with some excess. A good rule of thumb is to consume 0.8 grams of protein per pound (1.6 grams per kg) of body weight each day. However, be aware that eating a significant amount of protein can also make you feel fuller longer, so it is important to keep eating throughout the day.Examples of high-protein foods include nut butters, lean meats, certain dairy products, and eggs., Carry snacks with you throughout the day, such as bags of carrots with hummus. As often as possible, eat snacks that include three or more food types. For example, a piece of toast with peanut butter on it, topped with banana slices. This will guarantee that you stay full and get enough nutrients., Liquids are a good option as a snack or meal supplement, not a replacement, when you are trying to gain weight. Supplement drinks or smoothies are a great way to mix in plenty of calories. Try out various combinations in your blender until you find one that is both filling and appetizing. You can also drink 100% fruit juice or dairy products.For example, a filling smoothie recipe might include almond milk, protein powder, shaved dark chocolate, nut butter, and coconut milk.If you are adding supplement drinks to your routine, drink one or two a day in addition to meals to encourage weight gain.
Make sure to also drink plenty of water. Aim for at least eight glasses per day., It is quite possible that you will stop gaining weight at some point in the month. If this happens, you’ll want to take another look at your diet and make adjustments to your protein and calorie intake. Make sure to continue to make healthy food choices, perhaps including additional high-calorie days."

Talk to your doctor about boosting immunity with zinc supplementation.,
Purchase zinc supplements to address a zinc deficiency.,
Take a zinc lozenge at the first sign of a cold.",How to Increase Your Immunity with Zinc2," Ask your doctor about whether you should take a zinc supplement to improve your immunity. There is a range of research on the role of zinc in the immune system. Although much of this research is ongoing, there are some studies showing that zinc lozenges can reduce the length of a cold.Your doctor should be able to weigh the evidence and suggest an appropriate plan of action.


Dietary intake of zinc depends on diet, age and disease status.Your doctor will need to take these things into consideration when deciding whether you should be taking zinc.
The research on zinc supplementation is currently inconclusive with regards to whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks. One of the risks is a decreased sense of smell and the benefits are not yet clear in terms of how well it can reduce the severity of a cold.If you do not have insurance, try visiting a doctor at a community health care clinic to find out about boosting your immune system with zinc.

, If you have trouble getting enough zinc in your diet, you may need to purchase a zinc supplement. Prior to purchasing a supplement, you should make sure you are actually deficient in zinc because excessive zinc is also bad for your health.Some research suggests that taking zinc supplements for at least five months can help to prevent colds.Zinc is commonly contained in multivitamin supplements.
Zinc supplements are available in a variety of dosages depending on your needs.Zinc supplements may use a variety of zinc forms such as zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate and zinc acetate; however, none of these forms has been determined as superior to others.Taking zinc for more than six weeks can lead to copper deficiency., Research has shown that taking zinc lozenges or syrup within 24 hours of a common cold will reduce its duration and severity.When you begin to feel an itchy throat or a runny nose, go to a drugstore or health food store and buy a package of zinc lozenges. Take the lozenges for the first few days of your cold.


Avoid taking zinc lozenges for more than five days during a cold. Some side effects from taking zinc lozenges include upset stomach, an irritated mouth and a lingering metallic taste.Avoid zinc nasal sprays. Animals appear to lose their sense of smell when using zinc nasal sprays, and there have been reports of humans also loosing smell from nasal sprays. The FDA has warned people to avoid using nasal sprays containing zinc."

Check to see if you have any symptoms of zinc deficiency.",How to Increase Your Immunity with Zinc3," The amount of zinc that you should consume from both your diet and any dietary supplements is different depending on your sex and age.You can figure out your recommended daily zinc intake by reviewing the following age and sex-based recommendations:


Women nineteen years or older should get 8 mg of zinc per day.
Pregnant women between fourteen and eighteen years of age should get 13 mg of zinc per day.Pregnant women, nineteen years and older should get 11 mg of zinc per day.Breastfeeding women between fourteen and eighteen years of age should get 13 mg of zinc per day.Breastfeeding women who are nineteen years or older should get 12 mg of zinc per day.Men fourteen years and older should get 11 mg of zinc a day., Your children require a different daily recommended allowance of zinc, so you should check to see that they are getting enough zinc in their diet. Review the recommended daily allowances below:


Children between seven months and three years of age should get 3 mg per day.Children between four and eight years old should get 5 mg of zinc per day.Children between nine and thirteen years of age should get 8 mg of zinc per day.Teenage girls between fourteen and eighteen years old should get 9 mg of zinc per day., Too much zinc can lead to anemia and weakened bones.By following the recommended daily allowance for zinc based on your age and sex, you should be able to avoid taking too much zinc. Remember that the recommended daily allowance includes both zinc from food and supplements.Check for symptoms of acute zinc toxicity. Symptoms of excessive zinc include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. You may also experience headache, irritability, anemia and dizziness.Look to see if you are at risk of zinc toxicity. If you have an acute kidney injury, you may be at risk of accumulating too much zinc in your body. If you have haemochromatosis, you may also be absorbing too much zinc. Finally, if you are exposed to a lot of pesticides, paints, rubber, or dyes in your life or work, you may be at risk of zinc excess., Two billion people around the world are deficient in zinc.However, most people in the western world get enough of this trace element. To determine if you are at risk, review the following at risk demographics:


Vegetarians may need to consume fifty percent more zinc than listed in the recommended daily allowance because the body absorbs less zinc from plant based sources.People who have digestive disorders like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis are at an increased risk of deficiency.Alcoholics are more susceptible to zinc deficiency because alcohol reduces the amount of zinc that the body can absorb.
People with sickle cell disease are more susceptible to zinc deficiency because they need more zinc.
Zinc deficiency is relatively uncommon in the United States because it is commonly contained in the average diet., Symptoms of zinc deficiency include hair loss, diarrhea, impotence, eye and skin problems, appetite loss and various growth problems. You can review your symptoms with your doctor and they may even do a test to determine whether or not you are deficient. They can measure your levels of zinc in your blood cells or your hair.


Symptoms also include weight loss, delayed wound healing, taste changes and slow mental faculties.
Ask your doctor to order a micronutrient blood test, which determines the levels of multiple vitamins and minerals in your body including zinc.

Create a plan of action when stress starts to spike.,
Engage in regular physical activity.",How to Prevent Weight Gain Due to Chronic Stress2," Drop and do 10 pushups, go on a 10 minute walk or do an extended yoga pose. Simple and intense exercise can help your body to process extra adrenaline caused by stress, so it does not stick around and cause weight gain.

, Doctors suggest that the average person should have at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity per day, but this is even more important for those who are stressed. Plan time to walk, run, jog, swim, or do an exercise video and your body will process hormones, like cortisol, that are secreted through your adrenal glands, making them less likely to send signals to store fat.


Studies have also shown that high levels of cortisol can block other hormones, like testosterone, that increase your metabolic rate. You can raise your metabolism through regular exercise.

Aim to get 8 hours of sleep each night.,
Seek therapeutic help if you have problems coping with stress.",How to Prevent Weight Gain Due to Chronic Stress3," These differ greatly from person to person, but they can include anxiety, insomnia, muscle soreness or tension and irritability.

, For some people distraction and friendship are the best way to beat stress because they battle the negative emotions that cause ""emotional eating."" Schedule time with your closest friends and family, in person or on the phone.

, Most people respond well to massage, yoga, journaling, stretching, meditation, hobbies or baths. Try each of these until you find the 1 that works and repeat it every day or 3 to 4 times a week.

, Stress can interrupt sleep, causing more stress and sending signals to your body to store fat. Plan your relaxation routine and get to bed earlier than usual.

, A counselor can help you develop problem-solving skills, or a psychologist may be able to help you deal with the negative feelings and reduce emotional eating.

Train hard.,
Limit your cardio.,
Follow a weight lifting plan.,
Let your body rest and recover.",How to Safely Gain 10 Pounds in a Month2," A training program can help turn those extra calories into muscle, instead of just fat. You'll want to combine both weight and cardio training. Be prepared to work out at least five days a week to see maximum benefits., You’ll need to cut down your long distance cardio program if you are trying to gain weight. Long runs, for example, can burn up many of your stored calories. Instead, go for short, 15-minute cardio interval programs or incorporate sprints into a weight routine., Talk with a personal trainer and develop a specific weight workout plan that suits your goals. You’ll likely need to alternate very heavy lift days with lighter ones. Expect to spend at least 45 minutes at each session. It is quite possible that your trainer will also instruct you to train in intervals, performing a number of exercises in sets.You can get your diet and exercise program to work together by making good use of your “workout window.” Make sure to eat protein and carbs immediately before and after working out., You may be tempted to continually push yourself without a break for the full month. This can backfire and result in illness or injury. Instead, make sure to incorporate exercise rest days, diet cheat days, and just general relaxation periods. Getting at least eight hours of sleep a night is also important."

Start off slowly.,
Know why you want to make a change.,
Watch out for negative triggers.,
Build in periodic rewards.,
Get your family and friends involved.,
Work with a strength and nutrition coach.",How to Safely Gain 10 Pounds in a Month3," Especially if you are new to exercising and food management, expect to ease slowly into these lifestyle changes. You might experiment with what foods seem to get a good response from your body and which exercises have the most impact. It is also a good idea to be conservative when estimating calorie intake, as you can always boost it up later., To keep going when you hit plateaus or difficult points, it is important to know what is motivating you. Think about why you need to gain the weight and whether it is critical that you succeed. Remind yourself that your change must be healthy and involve you gaining muscle, not just fat.If you get discouraged, remind yourself of your goals by stating, “I need to do this. I can do this.” Repeat until you feel ready to go again.

, Try to think about your daily habits to predict any personal challenges before they might occur. If you are fond of eating a very light breakfast, then that is one area that you might need to target for extra calories. If you have certain friends who do not support your plan, then you may need to get some distance from them.Think about ways that you can also incorporate new habits into your lifestyle that fit your weight gain goals. For example, find a workout buddy who has similar objectives.

, Give yourself a tasty treat before or after a workout. Take a day off every once in a while and do not exercise or follow your diet plan. Use your exercise sessions as a time to listen to some great music. Intermix what you enjoy with your goals, when possible.Don’t let your cheat days get out of control. This can lead to too much fat gain., Tell people who you trust about your weight gain plans. Ask for their advice and support in the upcoming days. They might be able to suggest recipes or even act as a workout partner., You can find a local coach through your gym or doctor. A personal trainer can adjust your workout program to fit your goals. A dietitian will make sure that you are eating enough fuel to stay healthy and on track."

Eat foods you like.",How to Increase Calorie Intake," Instead of eating two or three meals a day, try to eat five or six smaller meals throughout the day. This can help you increase your caloric intake and prevent you from overeating at a single meal. You should also snack on high-calorie foods in between the meals. Good snack options include:Nuts
Nut butters on toast or crackers
Spreads like hummus or guacamole on crackers or toast
Cheese
Avocado
Fresh and dried fruit;
, If you're too busy to snack or sit down to another small meal, consider drinking high-calorie drinks like protein shakes or smoothies. These should be healthy beverages that offer some nutritional benefit, not just caffeine and sugar.Try using coconut milk to make your drinks. Coconut milk has healthy fat with high calories. If you'd like fewer calories, you could use almond or hemp milk.
For extra calories and protein, make super-strength milk. Mix 1 quart of milk and 1 cup of instant non-fat dry milk powder. Stir this for about five minutes and store it in your refrigerator. Use it just as you would regular milk.

, Look for high-calorie foods that are also considered nutrient-dense. Many of these foods are good sources of protein, fiber, and healthy fat. Include these high-calorie foods in your diet:Whole grains: whole wheat or pumpernickel bread, bran cereals, granola, bran muffins, bagels, wheat germ and flaxseed
Fruit: Bananas, pineapple, raisins and other dried fruit, fruit juices, avocados
Vegetables: Peas, corn, potatoes, winter squash (acorn, spaghetti, butternut)
Dairy: Cheeses (especially hard cheeses like cheddar), ice cream, yogurt, and full-fat or ""whole"" milk and milk products, like cottage cheese, sour cream, cream cheese.
Meat/Plant proteins: Beef, pork, chicken, nut butters like peanut butter, beans, and seeds

, Make small changes to your normal meals. Avoid using low-fat or low-calorie products. Add healthy fats, like olive oil, to veggies and other low-calorie meals. For example, steam broccoli and add a drizzle of olive oil at the end., While many processed foods are high in calories, they're not very high in nutrients which makes them empty calories. This is especially true if the processed food is high in added sugar. This means the calories you consume should be nutritious (nutrient-dense) to help your body stay healthy and strong, instead of empty calories, which provide no nutritional benefits. For instance an avocado is high in both calories and nutrients (such as fiber, B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, and more),while a donut is high in calories but offers few nutrients other than refined carbohydrates and sugar.


You should also pay attention to empty calories when it comes to beverages. Sodas, alcohol, and milkshakes are all high in calories, but offer little health benefit.
Instead of drinking soda or even diet drinks, drink milk, juice, and sports drinks for added calories and nutrients., If you can, work with a registered dietitian to determine how many calories you should be getting every day. You can also use an online Body Mass Index (BMI) and Daily Needs Calculator. (Try this one: http://nutritiondata.self.com/tools/calories-burned). This will give you your BMI and tell you the minimum calories you need every day.


If you have a BMI of less than 18.5, you're considered to be underweight. You'll need to consume more calories than the minimum recommended if you want to get to a healthy weight. For example, you might want to increase caloric intake by 5 or 10%.

, You may have a medical condition that ruins your appetite, making it difficult to want to eat. For example, cachexia is a loss of appetite in cancer patients. Talk with your doctor if you're not feeling like eating. The doctor may be able to prescribe a medication (like progesterone) to improve your appetite., If you've been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, you may fear gaining weight and have taken steps to lose weight in the past. You'll need to talk with your doctor about how to safely gain weight. Most treatments are centered around both family-based and individual therapy to help gain weight.


Some studies suggest that antidepressants can help treat anorexia and promote weight gain, but more research is needed., If you or your child is on the autism spectrum, you may notice aversions to certain food. You may only want to eat limited amounts of specific foods or medication you take may suppress your appetite. Work with a dietitian to determine any nutritional deficiencies you or your child might have. You may want to try a gluten-free or casein-free diet.Pay attention to sensory issues at meal time.For example, if your child won't eat slippery vegetables, try offering crunchy or firm vegetables.
Don't force an autistic child to eat something they can't bear. To them, it may be as disgusting as eating raw meat or beetles.

, It can be difficult to get enough healthy calories if you're dealing with nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy. Unfortunately, not gaining enough weight can increase your risk of complications during pregnancy.To improve your appetite, eat small meals and avoid spicy, greasy foods. It may help to eat bland foods for a while, especially if you're sensitive to the smell of food. To fight morning sickness, snack on:Crackers or pretzels
Ginger tea, peppermint tea, or ginger ale
Bland foods like mashed potatoes, toast, or chicken broth

, Plan to eat at scheduled times during the day. This can help you determine how many calories to include at each meal and it will keep you from skipping meals. Play around with your schedule to decide whether you'd like to eat larger meals or several small ones.


Kids like following routines and knowing what to expect. Offer your small children snacks and meals at the same times every day. They'll also be more likely to eat if you let them make some decisions about the food.It will take repeated exposure (15 – 20 times) to new foods for the child to accept it. Offer the new food but don't force the child to eat it

, If you find yourself rushing throughout the day and forgetting to eat, it can be hard to eat healthy foods or get enough calories. Be sure to slow down, sit down, and enjoy your meal. Create a calm atmosphere where you can relax and look forward to eating.Avoid distractions like watching tv or talking on the phone while you eat.

, You may not feel like eating very much if you're stuck in a routine that you don't enjoy. Do things to make eating fun and you'll be more likely to look forward to eating. For example, go on a picnic and get a change of scene. You can even do this indoors for something different.You can also encourage your child to eat by giving verbal praise or rewards (like stickers) for good eating.

, It's hard to eat healthy foods if you don't like what you're eating. Try to include healthy foods and foods you like. This will make it more likely that you'll actually eat the food you're buying. For example, instead of buying a healthy meal of things you don't really enjoy and only eating a little of it, make one of your favorite meals and include something healthy on the side.


If your child is not interested in eating something, offer something you know your child enjoys eating. Never force your child to eat a food they don't like. Instead, offer another food that's also nutritious."

Learn about sugar's connection to inflammation.",How to Identify Healthy Sugars," Your body needs carbohydrates to give energy to your cells. Since carbohydrates break down into glucose (a natural sugar, and your body's preferred energy source) you'll need to consider where you're getting these very necessary carbohydrates from. Choose complex carbohydrates that take your body longer to break down, which can control your blood sugar.Get complex carbohydrates from:


Whole grains
Cereals
Vegetables
Fruit
Beans
Legumes;
, There's really no such thing as a healthy sugar,so you should eat it in moderation. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sugar intake to 6 teaspoons (25 g or 100 calories) a day if you're a woman, and 9 teaspoons (37.5 g or 150 calories) a day if you're a man.Try to avoid simple sugars like table sugar (sucrose) which can be quickly broken down by the body.


Try to reduce your intake of soda, sweetened beverages, candy, cakes, cookies, and pies.

, Instead of reaching for simple table syrup, replace it with another sweetener that has nutrients. Honey contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, including vitamins C and B6, folate, niacin, riboflavin, calcium, iron, and manganese.Since honey is made up of a combination of complex sugars, studies have shown that it's easier on your blood sugar. It also tastes sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), so you can use less., Molasses is another nutritional sweetener that breaks down into sucrose, although it takes longer for your body to break down. It also contains calcium and magnesium which are good for your bones. Studies have shown that molasses contains iron, potassium and antioxidants.Since molasses has a distinctive strong taste, you may prefer to substitute molasses for sugar when baking.

, Molasses and honey are just a few variations of sweeteners that break down into sucrose and glucose. But, because of the minor health benefits, they're seen as ""less bad"" for you than table sugar. Other natural sweeteners include:


Agave syrup
Maple syrup
Brown sugar (which has a bit of molasses included)
Coconut sugar (which contains some fiber)

, Stevioside and Rebaudioside are both marketed as stevia and come from the stevia rebaudiana shrub. Stevia is anywhere from 30 to 300 times sweeter than sugar on a gram for gram basis. It's a popular substitute because it has no calories and can be used in baking and cooking. Studies have shown that stevia might be useful in lowering cholesterol and blood sugar levels.Stevia has a slightly bitter taste, so it's often combined with other sweeteners to mask the flavor.

, Xylitol is the sweetest of the sugar alcohols, which are modified sugars. Dentists recommend using xylitol because it doesn't encourage tooth decay, unlike other sugars. It does contain calories, but xylitol doesn't raise blood sugar or insulin levels.The body has a hard time absorbing xylitol, so you may experience gas, bloating, and diarrhea, especially if you consume large amounts.Be aware that xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and cats. If your pet ingests xylitol or a product containing xylitol (such as gum), call your vet immediately or Pet Poison Helpline (800-213-6680)., Erythritol is another sugar alcohol which is often mixed with stevia to mask stevia's bitter taste. Erythritol is 60 to 70 times sweeter than table sugar, but it doesn't increase blood glucose levels or affect cholesterol. Like xylitol, erythritol doesn't cause tooth decay (because bacteria don't digest it).


The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends erythritol as a safe sugar alternative, although it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, or nausea in some people, after consuming large amounts., This syrup comes from the roots of the yacon plant. In addition to being a natural sweetener, it contains fructooligosaccharides (FOS) which can act as a prebiotic, supporting healthy gut bacteria.


Studies have also shown that eating yacon syrup every day may help with weight loss in people with insulin resistance., This sugar substitute contains fructose (sugar found in fruits and vegetables), sucrose, and lactose (milk sugar). It can be used very much like table sugar which means you can cook and bake with it (unlike artificial sweeteners).


Whey low is not completely absorbed by the body, so you get the sweetness without taking in many calories.Whey low contains 4 calories per teaspoon.

, Chemical sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin are often found in diet foods and sodas. These no-calorie sweeteners contain no other nutrients. Research shows that they don't help with blood sugar or weight management.Many independent studies have linked these artificial sweeteners with cancer, leukemia, and irritable bowel disease.Pregnant women, children, and people with phenylketonuria (an inherited genetic disorder) should never use aspartame.You should also limit the amount of sucralose you give to small children, since they can easily get more sucralose than the FDA recommends.

, Sugar has no nutritional value (no vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc). It does contain calories, but they're known as ""empty calories"" because there are no health benefits.


Sugar does provide some energy because it contains calories. Calories are a measurement of energy released by food.
Keep in mind that whole foods, like fruit, containing naturally occurring sugars have nutritional value.

, Some forms of sugar, like fructose, are only metabolized in the liver. If you eat a large amount of fructose, your liver can be overloaded, regardless of whether the fructose came from something healthy like apples or a processed food with high-fructose corn syrup.If your liver is already damaged, eating foods with added fructose can damage your liver even more.

, Insulin resistance (also known as prediabetes) can lead to diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Studies suggest that sugar intake is directly linked to insulin resistance and contributes to obesity.Sugar intake is connected to the development of these diabetes and metabolic syndrome complications:Heart disease
Nerve damage
Blindness
Kidney disease

, Studies have found that sugar is linked to chronic inflammation which is linked to diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, autoimmune disease, and cancer.Sugars (especially the high-fructose corn syrup-type) can raise cholesterol and fat levels like triglycerides in the blood. This can also increase the chances of becoming obese."

Eat about every 2 hours. Have small meals as well as snacks. Ask your doctor for a reasonable calorie count and try to break that down throughout your daily meals. Do not wait until you feel hungry as you might not notice hunger pains if you're feeling nauseous from treatment.Try to prepare meals and snacks ahead of time or have someone do so for you. It can be hard to make something to eat if you're not feeling well.;
, Whenever you have the chance, add more calories to a dish. There are many ways to add a few hundred more calories to an existing meal:


Use whole milk and cream over skim or fat free varieties.
Use milk instead of water for canned soup and packet sauces.
Add grated cheese to pasta, mashed potatoes, eggs, and other dishes.
Use extra filling in sandwiches.

While they tend to be low calorie, you can mix nutrient-dense foods with other high calorie options to help you gain weight and get necessary calories. Nutrient dense foods include:


Fruits and vegetables
Whole grains and whole wheats
Seafood and lean poultry, like meats, beans, eggs, and nuts., If you're struggling to keep your appetite strong, try to make yourself the kinds of foods you really enjoy. Eating your favorite meals more often can help entice you to eat even if your appetite is poor. Try to cook foods you really enjoy and eat them on a regular basis., Protein powder can be added to drinks. This increase their total calories while upping your protein, which can help you gain weight healthily if you have cancer.


Go for nutritionally based powders (scandishake, enshake, calshake) and protein-specific powders (maxipro, protifar) over energy powders.You can add a teaspoon of protein powder to virtually any drink, from milk to juice to a soft drink. Most protein powders are tasteless, so they won't cause the drink to taste any different. However, you may notice a slight change in texture., You can make nutritious, high calorie smoothies by mixing milk or yogurt with an array of fruits and vegetables in a blender. Experiment with portions and ingredients until you find something that tastes good to you. You can also buy ready made smoothies at many supermarkets., Try to have a drink that contains calories with meals instead of simple water. Go for something somewhat nutritious, however. Sugary beverages, like soft drinks, can be bad for cancer patients. Instead, go for whole milk, juice without added sugar, or a low sugar sports drink like Gatorade., If your appetite is low, consider replacing one meal with a liquid supplement. While it's best to eat solid foods, if that's not possible for you try a liquid supplement.


Some meal replacement smoothies are actually manufactured specifically for cancer patients. Your doctor can write you a prescription for liquid meals you can take on days you're too ill to eat.You can also buy over-the-counter meal replacement smoothies. However, you should still ask your doctor about what types would be best for you given your medical history.Smoothies can come in different flavors, like chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Many people dislike the taste but you can try adding a natural sweetener like honey., As nausea can be responsible for the low appetite that leads to weight loss in patients, managing nausea can help. Talk to your doctor about the best means to cope.


There are a variety of anti-nausea medication your doctor can prescribe. Your doctor will select a medication for you based on your medical history and what stage of treatment you're undergoing.Your doctor will probably also suggest a number of lifestyle changes. Drinking more fluids, avoiding unpleasant smells, using relaxation techniques, and getting comfortable can all help reduce nausea., Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian. A dietitian's job is to provide you with personal advice about your eating habits to help you gain weight. A sit down session with a dietitian can help you figure out ways to combat weight loss and gain weight while undergoing treatment., Cancer support groups are present in many hospitals, churches, and community centers. You can also find support groups online if one is not available in your area. You can talk to other cancer sufferers about their issues with weight gain and ask what worked for them in regards to putting weight back on."

Strip down to your underwear or a swimsuit.,
Measure your waist.,
Check for health hazards.",How to Measure Body Fat without a Caliper2," Ideally, you should measure over your bare skin, but you can wear a thin shirt if necessary. To maintain consistency, wear the same clothing every time you measure. , Wrap a flexible measuring tape around your waist, just above the crest of your hip bones. The measuring tape should feel snug and flat against your skin, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable.You may need a mirror to make sure the measuring tape is level and lies flat against your skin.
Measure in the same location every time, and try to use the same measuring tape.

, Waist circumference measurement doesn't tell you your exact percentage of body fat, but it does gives you useful relative measurements.Non-pregnant women whose waist circumference is >35 inches (89 cm), and men whose waist circumference is >40 inches (102 cm), are at increased risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as hypertension and adult-onset diabetes.
If you are not expecting to be pregnant nor gaining weight, and your waist circumference is growing, contact your doctor. You may be pregnant or experiencing a medical issue.

, Your BMI is a ratio of your body height and weight, your “mass.” Your body is made of fat, bones, blood, muscle, and many other tissues that contribute to your weight, and your BMI. Your BMI rating does not directly correlate to your percentage of body fat, but is a way to monitor your size.Below are listed ranges for medical weight classes for adults. A BMI value of


<18.5 is underweight.
18.5 – 24.9 is in the ""normal"" range.
25 – 29.9 is overweight.
>30 is considered obese.A number of extremely muscular, not fat, individuals fall in the overweight category because their muscle weighs so much. Talk to your doctor about what your BMI means for you.
If you are not exercising and growing muscle mass but are gaining weight, it is likely that weight is fat.
If you are exercising and eating healthily, while gaining weight, it is possible that weight is muscle and only partially fat.
If you are losing weight, you are probably losing both muscle and fat.

Eat and eat often.,
Eat the right kind of fats.,
Go high-protein.,
Layer on the carbs.,
Eat late at night.",How to Gain Weight Quickly1," While everyone should abide by this rule, it is especially true for those who are trying to gain weight. Eating often means eating five to six small meals a day and packing in those nutrients.


This doesn't mean eating junk food and sugars, it means lots of protein and carbs. You want to obtain a healthy weight, not build up your fat deposits. Unlike many of your peers, your snacks should be nutritious but calorie dense: think nuts, peanut butter, cheese, dried fruits and avocados.And that bedtime snack? Go for it!
Even though it's a good way to gain weight, it's unhealthy -- so pass on the sodas and coffee. Keep your liquids up with smoothies or shakes made with low-fat milk or juice for an energized calorie boost. And remember to drink 30 minutes before or after your meal; you don't want to be full before you even start eating.;
, You want a bigger, healthier looking body--not a thin frame with a bit of a paunch. Maximise the avocados, dairy products, nuts (including peanut butter), and meats; stay away from ice cream, fries and fatty junk foods.


Healthy fats can be obtained from foods like peanuts, cashews, and olive oil. Stay away from saturated fats (bad fats) gained from processed foods. If you're looking for a treat, good alternatives are bran muffins, yogurt, fruit pies and granola bars.

, Though it's a myth that protein builds muscle, it is an essential part of your diet.It's a building block of our entire body: muscles, bones, skin, hair, and blood. Go for high-protein foods to fill up.


Protein-rich foods include meat, cheese, milk, fish, and eggs. For vegetarians, protein can be found in soy products such as tofu as well as in combinations of foods, such as rice or corn with beans., Though they get a bad rap, carbs, too, help build muscle and facilitate all of your vital functions. Carbs are your body's main source of energy. Complex carbs are fine; it's the simple ones you want to avoid. They contain empty calories and will most likely be stored as fat because the sugars enter your bloodstream quickly and cause a spike in blood sugar levels.


Brown rice, pasta, potatoes and whole grains fall into the approved category. These sugars are released slowly into your bloodstream and provide a steady supply of energy over a long period of time without causing the insulin spike that leads to fat storage., Without even upping your food intake, changing your eating times can facilitate the weight gaining process. Have a big dinner late at night and after that? Pile on healthy snacks.


A recent study shows that people who snack after 8 p.m. have higher body mass indexes (BMIs) than people who don’t nosh at night, even though they don’t eat significantly more total daily calories.The researchers adjusted for many factors; timing seemed to be the one variable that correlated.

Include some aerobic activities.",How to Gain Weight to Be an Average Size," This can be easily determined by calculating your BMI (Body Mass Index). You can either do it online or ask your family doctor. Knowing your BMI is the only way for you to realize if you’re really underweight or that’s just an impression.According to the World Health Organization, a BMI of 22 is the average for most healthy people.However, this can differ from person to person depending on their physical features. The BMI underweight category is anything less than 18.5, and normal is anything between 18.5 and 24.9.
Keep in mind that your ideal weight is not based on your subjective perceptions. It’s scientifically determined based on your sex, age, height and body structure.;
, Being underweight might signal something is wrong with your body, especially if you’ve lost weight very quickly. If your weight is affected by an existing problem, fixing it is the only way for you to reach your regular size. Possible conditions include:


Hyperthyroidism.
Type-1 or type-2 diabetes.
Celiac disease.
Intestinal parasites.
Eating disorders.
Body dysmorphic disorder., Just like your ideal weight, an ideal diet can also differ from person to person due to several factors. An expert will help you determine what is best for you and whether your current diet is meeting your body’s requirements. Perhaps, all you need to do is find out what nutrient is missing and reintegrate it in your daily intake.


Keeping a diary of your daily meals will make you more aware of your dietary habits and help you realize if some nutrient is missing from it.
If you suffer from any allergies or intolerances, make sure you mention that. Your registered dietitian will help you reintegrate a missing nutrient in other ways.

, If you can’t reach your ideal weight, chances are your metabolism is working too much and needs even more food than what you’re having. Increasing your daily intake is the only way to help your body get the right amount of nutrients it needs.


Eating smaller doses more often will help you increase your food intake. If you get full very quickly, try having slices rather than the whole thing.For example, you can have a sliced apple instead of a whole apple. Another example would be eating half of a sandwich instead of the whole sandwich, but then eating the other half an hour later.
Drink beverages half an hour before or after the meal, rather than during the meal. Drinking while eating might make you too full too fast.Choose higher calorie options or look for ways to add calories to meals, such as by having a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter with an apple or choosing a cream-based soup over a broth-based soup.
You might also include a nutritional supplement in your diet, such as Ensure or Boost, if your doctor or registered dietitian thinks this is a good idea. This is usually only recommended if you are under medical supervision for weight gain and/or you are over 65.

, You shouldn’t stuff yourself with junk food. Sticking to food that is rich in good nutrients will help you stay healthy and avoid gaining fat instead of weight. While you increase the quantity of your daily intake, make sure the quality is always at its highest. This could include:


High-protein meats.
Carbohydrates like brown rice and whole grains.
Unsaturated or monounsaturated fats (olive oil, almonds and walnuts)., Eating at irregular intervals or not frequently enough doesn’t help your body process food correctly. Following a healthy diet also means sticking to a fixed schedule. You should have an average of five to six meals a day: some might be smaller, some bigger.


If you’ve lost your appetite or you generally tend to avoid large meals, eat smaller meals throughout the day. You don’t have to stuff yourself, as long as you eat regularly.If you’re not usually hungry or forget to eat, set an alarm to remind yourself that it’s meal time.

, Snacks and desserts are a good way to reward ourselves or enjoy a little meal. These should be healthy rather than pre-packaged snacks: watch out for excessive sugar or saturated fat.These can include:


Dried fruits.
Nuts.
Yogurt.
Trail mix.
Bread with hummus or peanut butter., Fruit variation will ensure a higher calorie intake. However, make sure you do so away from meals, otherwise you’ll get full too quickly. Some examples are:


Apple and berry.
Peach, orange and banana., Whether you go to a gym or exercise at home, it’s always best to ask for advice before starting a work-out plan. Only a trained person can tell you how to best reach your goal and design a personalized plan that suits your age and body type.


Consulting a trainer is especially important before using special machines or taking up weightlifting. If you don’t know how much exercise your body is able to take, it’s easier than you think to do yourself harm instead of good!, This is one of the best and safest ways to build up your muscles and turn your food intake into body mass. Make sure you stick to a regular schedule and stretch both before and after each session.Exercises can include:



Squats.

Push-ups.

Crunches.

Walking lunges.

Tricep dips.

, This will also help you build muscle while remaining healthy. Take it easy when you start: your strength will grow little by little if you exercise regularly.


Remember that good technique and not heavy lifting is your goal as a beginner. You should be able to feel resistance without strain or pain.It's always best to ask a trainer to design a customized plan for you.

, Although you may be surprised, these anaerobic sports can also help you build up your muscles. Check if your local gym offers any programs and enroll. Even in this case, you’ll need someone to guide you through each exercise when you start., You might think these exercises will make you lose weight rather than gain it, but cardiovascular activity is important for you even if you’re underweight: it is good for your heart, reduces stress and can increase your bone density.Plus, it can also whet your appetite! Just make sure you exercise in moderation. If taken to the extreme, cardio activity might make you burn too many calories and start losing weight. You can do any physical activity that increases your heart rate, like:


Running.
Biking.
Swimming.
Working out on cardio machines.

Talk to your registered dietitian.,
Increase your calories.,
Eat frequent, small meals.,
Eat more ""free"" foods.,
Choose foods that are high in calories.,
Use supplemental drinks, powders, and bars.,

Ask your dietitian about what amount of calories you should add in each day to help you gain weight. It's not ideal to gain large amounts of weight quickly.
Also, speak to your dietitian about the best ways to add calories to your diet. As a dialysis patient, your food choices will be limited.
You may even want to ask for a weight gain meal plan from your dietitian to give you a more specific idea about what to do.
Discuss supplemental options like protein shakes as well. Protein shakes, like Ensure or Boost, are often prescribed to help people get the nutrients that they need while increasing calories.;
, To gain weight, you'll need to increase your overall calorie intake. Slowly add calories each day and monitor your weight closely.


In general, you want to gain a little amount of weight each week. It's not ideal to gain weight rapidly or use high fat, unhealthy foods to help you gain weight.
Add in 250 to 500 calories daily. This will result in about ½ to 1 pound weight gain a week.Dialysis increases your daily calorie needs. You'll need to account for this in your calculations., If food seems unappealing to you, it might be easier for you to eat small snacks and meals throughout the day instead of sitting down for two to three large meals.


Many times, dialysis patients suffer a loss of appetite after regular dialysis treatments.The causes of appetite loss are many in dialysis, but should be noted and relayed to your dietitian and doctor.
If you're not interested in foods or eating, try having just a few bites of a snack or meal. It's better to get in a few calories, than to skip the whole meal.
You can choose to eat five to six small meals a day or do a combination of larger, more regular meals with smaller snacks.

, In reference to dialysis and kidney disease, ""free"" foods are foods that add calories to your diet without adding any extra sodium, potassium, or phosphorus to your blood.Free foods include: simple carbohydrates, like sugar, honey, jelly, syrup, and jam. They also include: vegetable fats like margarine and vegetable oils and non-dairy creamers.Sucking on hard candy throughout the day can help ease your nausea and boost your appetite, and the candy itself also provides you with extra calories.
Drizzle honey or sugar in beverages to sweeten them. Also drink beverages that contain sugar as a sweetener.
Put margarine or vegetable oils on all your meals and snacks to help increase calories.

, Consuming calorie dense foods helps you easily gain weight. Find ways to increase the overall calorie count of the foods you do eat.


High calorie foods that are generally safe for patients on dialysis include: cream cheese, half and half, sour cream, and cream.Try incorporating these higher fat foods in ways like: using heavy cream in coffee, cereal or to drink or add sour cream to scrambled eggs or as a topping to your meals or snacks.
Dessert is encouraged during dialysis, but you should stick with options that also help your nutritional needs. Puffed rice treats, plain wafer cookies, puddings made with non-dairy creamer, and cobblers or pies with allowed fruits are usually safe options., Protein drinks, protein bars, and protein powders can be mixed into other drinks or foods all provide you with additional protein and calories.Using these in addition to your meals may help you gain weight more easily.


For best results, look for nutritional supplements specifically designed for people on dialysis since these contain the right balance of protein and minerals for your specific needs.
Note that your doctor may prescribe some of these supplemental drinks and foods for you, especially if you have a low albumin level.
In general according to the 2005 European Best Practices Guidelines people who are undergoing dialysis should consume 1.2 to 1.3 g of protein a day. This will help combat protein loss through various mechanisms.

, Even if you're trying to gain weight, you still need to minimize your consumption of potassium and phosphorus from your diet.


Healthy kidneys can filter out some of the phosphorus and potassium in your blood, but when your kidneys are damaged or weakened, these minerals can build up and become toxic.Too much phosphorus can lead to heart damage and osteoporosis. Similarly, too much potassium is also very dangerous for your heart.
While phosphorus is in nearly everything you might eat, some foods contain higher concentrations of it and must be avoided.
Patients with End Stage Renal Disease are at risk for secondary hypoparathyroidism, which is when your body excretes very little PTH.This is usually due to the high levels of phosphorus, and an imbalance in PTH physiology. Some patients may require a parathyroidectomy to correct the problem., Being physically active is important to overall health. However, vigorous intensity or high quantities of physical activity might not be suitable for dialysis patients who are attempting to gain weight.


Fatigue and exhaustion are common side effects of dialysis. However, most health professionals recommended small amounts of activity. For example, you can go for a 15 minute walk twice per day.
Make sure to talk to your doctor prior to starting any exercise program. Go slowly and stop immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort.
Refrain from high intensity exercise or working out for long periods of time as this may counteract your weight gain goal.
Being active, even if only for short periods of time, can help dialysis patients feel better and improve their overall quality of life., Another side effect of dialysis is muscle wasting or loss of lean muscle mass. Strength training can help minimize this effect.Include light strength training exercises like: using resistance bands, doing yoga or modified weight lifting. Seek the help of a personal trainer or exercise specialist for more specifics.
Dialysis patients who included regular light resistance training saw improvements in muscle mass, strength and quality of life., It's normal and common to feel stress, anger and even depression if you're receiving dialysis. Decreased appetite may result from some or all of these emotions.Receiving dialysis is a big lifestyle change that requires you to make a variety of dietary and lifestyle changes. Managing these changes the best you can may help minimize any appetite suppression related to them.
Use your resources available at your dialysis center (like the social worker) to help you manage your personal life, medications, treatment, and emotional health.
Consider seeking the help of a behavioral therapist, life coach or psychologist for additional guidance.

, You need to work with your dialysis team regularly. Those health professionals will be able to help you manage your health, diet and weight gain.


Typically, dialysis teams are made up of a qualified nephrologist, dietician, and social worker.
Regarding matters of weight gain and diet, your dietitian is the most important person to consult. He or she has been educated about renal failure and can teach you more about the best foods to eat for your new dietary needs.
Your nephrologist is the doctor who specializes in your kidney health. You will need to work closely with him or her throughout your treatment and consult him or her on every aspect of your disease and recovery, including your diet.
A social worker who works at the dialysis center might be able to provide you with dialysis cookbooks and recipes. He or she can also get in touch with agencies that will help you get the food you need if finances are an issue for you.

, Dialysis can sometimes cause severe nausea. Many times this is a big reason behind your weight loss and difficulty reaching or maintaining a healthy weight.


Consult your nephrologist and ask for a prescription anti-nausea medication. Taking these regularly may help you eat more regular meals and feel more motivated to eat.
If you're feeling nauseous make sure to tell your dialysis team. Also try to keep something in your stomach. Items like saltine crackers can help calm your stomach.
Over-the-counter medications can be risky if you do not clear them with your doctor first.
Metoclopramide and ondansetron are two different types of anti-emetic medications that may help with your nausea. Talk to your doctor about these medications.

, To help address your nutritional needs, your nephrologist might recommend the use of a special multivitamin for improved renal health. This will be especially helpful if you're not eating well or have little appetite.Renal vitamins are designed for patients with CKD, ESRD and/or are on dialysis. They are a safe form that will not cause any harm to your kidneys and other organ systems.Note that you should not rely on renal multivitamins alone. Your body absorbs most nutrients better when taken from food rather than an artificial substance.
Multivitamins can help prevent malnutrition and ensure you're meeting the daily recommended values of most essential nutrients. They are not be enough to help you gain significant amounts of weight.
Do not take any over the counter vitamins, minerals or herbal supplements without clearing them with your doctor first. They can cause significant harm or damage if they are not appropriate for you.

Weight train.,
Increase your workout.,
Other than weight training, stay immobile.",How to Gain Weight Quickly2," While cardio will develop some of your muscles, weight training alone is more likely to cause you to gain weight, since muscle weighs more than fat.


This does not mean you have to join a gym (though that certainly would work!). Do push-ups, crunches, lunges, and squats in the comfort of your own home while watching TV.
Exercising also builds up your appetite. After a workout, slam a protein bar or shake to give your muscles what they're craving.

, As you progress, what you've been doing will not be enough. Your muscles will get used to the work you're putting them through--as your workouts get easier, change them up to make them more difficult.


Invest in weights for your home. That way, when you only have 15 minutes before you have to get ready for work, you can squeeze in a quick muscle-building session to stay on the right track.

, The simple ""more calories out than in"" motto is true. So apart from bulking up, burn as few calories as possible. Grab the remote, your smoothie, and hanker down on the couch.


If you do become more sedentary overall, it's important to keep weight training. Even if you can't see the fat on your body, visceral fat (the kind stored around your abdominal cavity, liver, pancreas, and intestines) can still show up. And visceral fat loves inactivity. So before you sit down to watch that movie, pump some iron. Then have a marathon--a movie marathon--with some snacks.

Implement an early curfew.,
Allow your child unlimited screen time, and try allowing a TV in his or her room.",How to Help Your Child Gain Weight Even if They Don't Want To," Pay them compliments regularly and never make disparaging comments about their appearance - and especially not about their weight! Buy them clothes that they like and think they look good in.
, Remember to never use words like 'obese', 'overweight', or 'normal weight', or even say things like 'chubby', 'thick', or 'plump' around them. Do things like remark casually about how attractive and healthy heavier people you know seem to be. This will subtly help them realise that weight itself doesn't mean anything - one doesn't need to be skinny to be healthy., This can set a good example, assuming that your own weight isn't such that gaining more will negatively impact your health. Your kids will be much more comfortable becoming heavier if you lead by example! This may happen naturally if your follow step 2 anyway, so be prepared., In Disney films for example, the protagonist is always unhealthily slim, and any fat people are always the villains! This is exactly the kind of thing that will make your child unwilling to gain weight. Try things like Lilo and Stitch, Winnie the Pooh, and Steven Universe to show that any body shape is fine.

Show them pictures of heavy Olympic athletes, such as Holley Mangold, or just about any shot-putter or weightlifter.

, Remind your friends and family members to always stay fat-positive around your child.

Bear in mind that your child may witness bullying or discrimination no matter how you try to prevent it. Explain that this happens sometimes, and it's wrong.

, Their messages will greatly help your child open up their mind to other lifestyles and perspectives., Diversifying their social circle to include kids who aren't so focused on their looks or weight will help expose them to the idea that healthy lifestyles can come in all shapes and sizes. This will help remove the fear of weight gain for them., This can show your kids that beauty is a social construct and that in many places big is beautiful. Good destinations include places like Mauritania, South Africa, Jamaica, or Nauru., If your attempts at removing their fear of weight gain still haven't seen any success after a few months, it may be necessary to make changes to their diet. Calculate their daily calorie needs using an online calorie calculator. Then increase that value by around half - this is your child's new daily calorie goal.

For example, if your child is a moderately active 10 year old girl, her daily calorie need is about 1800 calories. Increase this by half to get a 2700 calorie daily goal. Don't tell them their goal of course, this is just to guide you in how you feed them; if they manage to achieve or exceed this goal consistently, they should gain weight very quickly. All those extra calories they are consuming are not being burned, and will thus be stored as fat deposits on your child's body, increasing their weight.

, Cookies, cereal bars and potato chips are all excellent snack foods for promoting weight gain. Leave them in easy reach on tables and surfaces, and your children with be snacking in no time. This is probably the easiest way to radically increase your child's food intake., Buy some larger plates - this will make big portions looks normal compared to the plate itself, encouraging bigger meals. This is much more subtle than pushing your child to have a second helping - though by all means, try that as well if you think you can get away with it. If your child never seems to have seconds, increasing their first portion and insisting on a clean plates policy can compensate., Some medical professionals have doubts about this strategy in the long run, partly because of how it can impact a child's emotional relationship with food.However, if your child is actually underweight, rewards can offer an additional way to add calories into their diet in the short term. If they do something well, award them with a snack of some candy, or with something else they enjoy that's high in sugar. Try to build a system where they are regularly rewarded with food, and come to expect it. Rewarding a daily chore like washing dishes after a meal with a muffin, for example, is adding 350 calories to your child's diet daily., Easy, cheap recipes can be found online or in any cookery book. Aim especially to cook meals that don't seem to be particularly fattening, but actually are. Salads, for example, are notorious for being healthy, but when loaded up with a fatty meat, plenty of cheese and a full-fat salad dressing, they can easily exceed a child's recommended daily fat value., For example, slip large amounts of butter and cheese into meals they already like, and fry things in animal fat instead of oil. This will help radically increase the amount of fat in their diet with very little observable difference., A big dollop of ice cream and some full-fat milk, blended in with some Oreos or Nutella, and you have a delicious, extremely high-fat drink that will be adored by any child with a sweet tooth., It is much higher in fat and calories than semi-skimmed milk, and recent research has shown it contains more beneficial nutrients as well. With only advantages, buying whole milk is the obvious choice., Two or three cans of soft drinks a day is an easy way to massively boost your child's sugar consumption, and are even a good source of extra calories. Similarly, fruit juice is just as sugary - but as it's seen as a healthy drink your child may be more willing to drink large amounts., In most cases, exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Exercising can help a child build muscle mass, which will mean that they gain weight. However, in extreme or unusual circumstances, your child may need to cut back. If you suspect this is the case, consult your doctor to get an idea of how much exercise is healthy for your child at their age and stage., It may not seem like much, but that half hour walk is a hundred calories burned. Add that up twice a day, five times a week, and you're looking at a thousand calories you have to make up elsewhere during the week!, The resulting tummy ache will sabotage their enjoyment and put them off that exercise in the future! Similarly, give them a high-calorie snack immediately after any activity, to offset the calories burned before their body starts breaking down fat., If they do a sport after school or as part of a club, push them to do enter things like the chess club, cooking club, or debating - essentially anything sedentary. Once their schedule is cluttered, they will be more willing to give up their sports clubs to get some free time., Then, ensure that their scruffy sports clothes begin to 'disappear'. Before long you'll have an ironclad excuse for disbarring them from activities - that it would ruin their nice clothes!, This will be very dependent on the age of your child, but keeping them inside and sedentary in the evenings - with access to snacks - will help them gain weight easily., If you can get them interested in television shows, movies and video games, they will easily spend much of their day completely sedentary. Consider swotting up on the shows they like so you can have discussions about them with your child, or getting good at a cooperative video game so you can play together. Combined with regular snack breaks, this will help your child gain in no time."

Choose lean proteins for healthy weight gain.,
Choose higher calorie fruits and vegetables.,
Eat dense breads and cereals.,
Cook with oil.,
Use coconut milk.,
Snack on nuts.,
Incorporate hummus into your diet.,
Indulge in some avocado.,
Drizzle some honey on your food.",How to Gain Weight if You Have Lactose Intolerance1," It may be tempting to start eating high fat meats to gain weight, but eating high-fat protein may lead to other problems, such as high cholesterol. Lean proteins are the best choice for healthy weight gain, so opt for lean proteins instead. Good sources of lean protein include:Skinless turkey or chicken breast
Lean beef
Pork loin
Light tuna (packed in water)
Tofu or tempeh
Beans;
, Some fruits and vegetables are higher in fat and calories than others. By choosing higher calorie options, you will have a better chance of gaining weight. When it comes to fruits and vegetables, go for bananas, pineapples, raisins, other dried fruits, peas, corn, potatoes, and squashes., Carbohydrates are a great source of calories, but some choices have higher calories than others. Steer clear of “light” breads and cereals to avoid low-calorie choices. When choosing bread, look for healthy higher calorie breads like 100% whole wheat bread. Other good options include:Whole grain cereals
Granola
Bran muffins
Whole wheat bagels
Whole wheat pasta
Brown rice

, When you're grilling vegetables, meats, or other foods, use a healthy cooking oil to add some fat and calories. Opt for olive, grapeseed, or canola oils over vegetable oil. Olive, grapeseed, and canola oils are higher in calories and also contain more nutrients your body needs to put on weight in a healthy fashion.Try drizzling olive oil over a salad, use canola oil to grease a pan, or replace butter with canola oil in cookie recipes.

, Coconut milk is a great source of lactose-free fat and calories, so incorporating it into your diet may help you to gain some weight as well. Coconut milk is a good source of healthy fat as well as other nutrients and it is quite versatile, so you can use it in a variety of recipes.Try making a coconut milk based curry, replace dairy milk with coconut milk in a soup recipe, or add a spoonful of coconut milk to your morning coffee.
Coconut milk in it's looser, liquid form is a direct substitute for cow's milk. Coconut milk in it's more solid form (such as, in a can) is a perfect substitute for whipped cream or creamer.

, Nuts are a great, nutrient-dense snack that are also high in calories. Macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, brazil nuts, and walnuts have the highest calorie count while chestnuts, cashews, and peanuts are on the lower end of the spectrum.Try munching on a handful of nuts as a snack or incorporate nuts into other recipes. For example, you could throw some cashews into a stir-fry, blend walnuts into a pesto sauce, or add chopped almonds to a batch of chocolate chip cookies.
Spread nut butter on bread or try some with fruit. Adding nut butters, like peanut butter and cashew butter, to a slice of whole wheat toast can be a great way to increase calories while getting in a healthy snack.Try spreading a tablespoon of almond butter on toast or dip apple slices in some peanut butter.

, Hummus is a highly recommended spread for healthy weight gain as it contains chickpeas, which are high in calories, as well as healthy fats, and nutrients. Hummus is a great source of fiber as well.Try spread some hummus on a slice of bread, using it as a dip for veggies, or adding a scoop of hummus to a salad.

, Avocados are high in fat and rich in nutrients, so eating avocado is a great way to add some calories into your diet if you are lactose intolerant. Avocados are best known as the main ingredient in guacamole, but they have a mild flavor, so you can use them in lots of different ways.Try spreading guacamole on a sandwich, toss some avocado slices into your salad, or throw ¼ of an avocado into a fruit smoothie to add some fat and calories without changing the flavor.

, You should avoid using added sugar to gain weight as too much sugar can increase your risk for a variety of medical issues. However, adding honey to snacks and drinks may help you gain weight safely. Some research shows honey helps with malnutrition and it also has strong antibacterial properties.


If you have diabetes you may want to avoid honey. While honey does not have the same effect on blood sugar as table sugar, some studies indicate it can affect blood sugar levels."

Eat protein to gain muscle.,
Add calorie-dense foods to your meals.,
Use milk powder.,
Eat healthy oils and fats.,
Include treats.",How to Gain Weight Naturally1," If your goal is to put on muscle mass, then you need to be eating protein-rich foods on a regular basis. It's especially good to eat protein after a workout. Lean meats (such as chicken, lean pork, and fish), eggs, beans, and lentils are all great sources of protein, as well as yogurt and nuts.Even something as simple as chocolate milk is a good way to get in your protein, although be mindful that most chocolate milks contain a lot of sugar, which isn't good for you in large quantities.Also try to eat protein right before going to bed. Drink some milk or eat some yogurt to fuel you through the night. This may also help you recover if you work out frequently.Stir in protein powder to your yogurt, oatmeal, and other foods to add a protein and calorie boost.;
, Try adding full-fat cheese to the top of your meals. Stir some peanut butter and honey into your oatmeal. These foods are high in calories and can help you increase your overall caloric intake.Another calorie-dense food is dried fruit, such as dried apricots, figs, or raisins.Eat complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, bulgur, barley, whole grains, and quinoa. Avoid simple carbs like white flour, sugar and white rice.

, Instant milk powder is a simple way to beef up dishes, from casseroles to soup. Simply stir in the powder while you're cooking. Wait for it to dissolve before you serve the dish.Milk powder can make your dish creamier, though a tablespoon or 2 won't make much difference.

, Healthy oils, such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts (which have healthy fats in them), are rich in nutrients as well as high in calories. Adding a dash of oil to a salad or topping your meal with some sliced avocado is an easy way to increase calories.For instance, if you're enjoying some mashed potatoes, stir in some olive oil to make them creamier. For a quick mid-afternoon snack, a handful of almonds or peanuts is a good option.
Seeds such as sunflower and pumpkin seeds have a high level of calories and also contain ""good"" fats that raise your good cholesterol levels.Use coconut oil sparingly. Although it does boost your ""good"" cholesterol levels, it is 90% saturated fat and too much of it could cause health issues. Other oils, such as olive oil and soybean oil, provide more health benefits., Though you want to keep your foods nutritionally dense, it's fine to include treats every now and then to help increase your calories. Have a brownie after dinner if you're craving chocolate. Just don't make sugar the bulk of your food."

Drink dairy-free smoothies and shakes.,
Drink calorie-heavy beverages.,
Ask a nutritionist about incorporating a dairy-free protein powder into your diet.",How to Gain Weight if You Have Lactose Intolerance2," To gain weight in a healthy fashion, you need to add 200 to 500 extra calories into your daily meals. This can be difficult to do and many people feel full to the point they cannot keep eating. Having a variety of healthy, dairy free shake recipes can allow you to gain the extra calories without having to eat another meal.


Shakes and smoothies are very popular in the health foods movement as they add nutrients to your diet in a fun, easy-to-consume manner. A simple google search for dairy-free smoothie recipes will yield a variety of results.
Most smoothies use some kind of liquid, usually fruit juice without added sugar or almond or soy milk, as well as a variety of fruits and veggies. Ingredients are blended in a food processor until mixed to your desired texture.Many smoothies use additives like vanilla extract, cinnamon, or honey to give the smoothie added sweetness and flavor. You can experiment with mixing and matching different additives until the smoothie tastes good to you.If you find a smoothie recipe that sounds good but uses a dairy product like milk or yogurt, you could try substituting it for a dairy- free alternative. Use soy or almond yogurt or milk instead, for example., Dieters are generally recommended to avoid the calories that come from beverages. However, if you're trying to gain weight, supplementing your diet with some calorie heavy beverages may be helpful.

Skip empty calories.,
Exercise and lift weights.",How to Gain Weight Naturally2," Every day, make sure you get in at least three meals. Introduce larger portions at your meals to help increase your calories. You may have a tendency to skip breakfast, only eating 2 main meals, but making sure you actually eat three meals can help you gain weight.If you can't eat huge meals because it upsets your stomach, eat smaller meals throughout the day. Don't skip meals.

, Eating often throughout your day can provide you a steady flow of calories. Try to eat at least every 4 hours, whether it is one of your meals or a small snack. If you're not up to a meal, have a snack that includes protein and three different types of food. If you prefer, you can create 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day, rather than adding snacks between larger meals.For instance, try a piece of whole grain bread with banana and peanut butter or some celery with hummus and feta cheese., Prepare snacks ahead of time that are easy to grab and eat. If you have them on hand, you're more likely to eat when you should.For instance, you can mix dried fruit, chocolate chips (dark is best), rolled oats, and a nut butter. Make them into golf-ball size portions, and store them wrapped individually in parchment paper or wax paper.For quick snacks, keep trail mixes on hand, as the mix of nuts and dried fruit is calorie-dense., Sometimes, eating all day long can fill you up, and you don't get enough calories to gain weight.

Start off slowly if you aren't used to doing this kind of training. Increase weight and decrease reps as you go alongIn addition, exercise increases your appetite, making you want to eat more.A simple exercise to start with is bicep curls. Hold a weight in each hand. Your arms should be bent at the elbows so the weights are out in front of you. Lift the arms together to your shoulders, then slowly bring them back down. Repeat 6 to 8 times. Rest, and do it again.You can also try exercises such as swimming, biking, or doing push-ups.

Get vitamin B12 as a vegetarian or vegan.",How to Get Vitamin B12 Naturally1," Vitamin B12 is found in its highest, natural forms in animal products.It is generally not found in high levels in plant foods. The highest food sources of vitamin B12 include:


Seafood, such as clams, crab, and mussels
Beef liver
Whole grain cereals
Fish, such as trout, salmon, tuna, and haddock
Beef
Dairy products, such as yogurts and cheese, especially brie
Eggs;
, To maximize your intake of vitamin B12, you need to eat the right portions of each food. Meats and fish should be eaten in 3 ounce servings. You can drink eight ounces of milk and eat one egg to get a quality amount.


Some foods have more vitamin B12 than others. For example, clams have 84.1 mcg, mussels have 20.4 mcg, lean beef has 6.9 mcgs, and milk have 0.9 mcgs per serving.
Make sure you have a few servings of each a day to get the right amount of vitamin B12 a day., To ensure the most benefits from vitamin B12, you need to get the right amount each day. The recommended amounts you should get of vitamin B12 per day are:


0 to 6 months, 0.4 mcg
7 to 12 months, 0.5 mcg
1 to 3 years, 0.9 mcg
4-8 years, 1.2 mcg
9 to 13 years, 1.8 mcg
Over 14 years, 2.4 mcg, During pregnancy, vitamin B12 can be critically important for the development of a healthy baby. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need 2.8 mcg per day. If you do not get enough vitamin B12 while pregnant, your child might suffer from developmental delays, failure to thrive, neural tube defects, megaloblastic anemia, and movement disorders. Pregnant women often get additional vitamin B12 through prenatal vitamins, which include other important vitamins as well., Since vitamin B12 comes primarily from animal products, vegetarians and vegans who are strict on their diets need to find another source of the vitamin. The most common way that vegetarians and vegans get vitamin B12 is through foods that are fortified with it. These foods include:


Cheeses, such as Swiss, mozzarella, Tilsit, and feta
Eggs
Whey powder
Cereals
Breads
Yeast spreads (Marmite)Strict vegans don't eat cheese and egg products, so they have to rely strictly on fortified foods, especially yeast products and whey protein."

Join a community.",How to Get Rid of High Potassium in the Body Naturally," Dehydration is one of the main sources of hyperkalemia. 10 – 12 glasses a day will help keep your potassium levels stable., Two servings daily should be your limit (or no more than 1 cup). Rice milk is generally an acceptable substitute.


Coffee and tea are fine to consume, but you should consider switching to using a non-dairy creamer.

, Many fruit and vegetable juices — especially orange juice and carrot juice — are high in potassium. Some juices are also blends of different fruits so while some fruits — like grapes and cranberries — are fine for a low-potassium diet, you should make sure the juice does not include any high-potassium juices.Watch out for smoothies; many of them contain large amounts of bananas, which are very high in potassium.

, Some of the foods you should avoid include bananas, tomato sauce, beet greens, clams, prunes, avocado, oranges, as well as cooked broccoli and cooked spinach.Soak fresh fruit in water for a few hours before eating to help lower the potassium level in the fruit.

, Avoid brown rice and pasta as well as other whole grains (like bran). Instead, substitute white rice and bread as these are lower in potassium. You can also incorporate fruits like berries and grapes; for vegetables, you can enjoy kale, cauliflower, and corn.

, Lean proteins are compatible with a low potassium diet as long you eat them in smaller portions. If you prepare chicken, turkey, and pork, keep your consumption limited to fist-sized helpings., Many packaged foods will add potassium chloride as a substitute for salt. This is an especially dangerous ingredient to consume if you are trying to lower your potassium levels. If you buy frozen dinners or canned tomato sauces, make sure you check the ingredient list to ensure it is not included.

, Leaching is not effective at completely removing potassium from high potassium foods and it should only be used occasionally. However, if you are craving a food that is particularly high in potassium, you can use this method to help reduce your total intake of potassium. You can apply this method for potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and winter squash.Peel and place the vegetable in cold water so they won’t darken.
Slice vegetables so they are 1/8 inch thick.
Then rinse in warm water for a few seconds.
Soak vegetables for a minimum of two hours in warm water. The amount of water used for soaking should be ten times greater than the amount of vegetables. If soaking longer, change the water every four hours.
Rinse vegetables under warm water again for a few seconds.
Cook vegetable with five times the amount of water to the amount of vegetables., Your kidneys are primarily responsible for filtering out excessive levels of potassium from the bloodstream. If you have acute or chronic renal failure or adrenal gland dysfunction, then monitor your potassium levels to make sure they stay within a safe range.


Cancer treatments which destroy cells (or cell lysis) can also lead to increased levels of potassium., High potassium can have dangerous effects on the body, such as muscle weakness, constipation, fatigue, and paralysis. An abnormal heart rate can also be caused by too much potassium.Be aware that you may not show any symptoms. The best way to confirm that your potassium level is normal is to check it regularly. Your doctor can conduct this test through a simple blood sample., If you have symptoms of high potassium, then seek medical treatment immediately as this is dangerous., If you struggle with high levels of potassium, you should look into finding more information at the National Kidney Foundation and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Eat plenty of green leafy vegetables.,
Try calcium-fortified foods.,
Get plenty of Vitamin D. All the calcium in the world won't do you any good if you don't have Vitamin D alongside.,
If you don't feel that you're getting enough calcium from your diet, consider supplements.

,
Get two servings of dairy.",How to Get the Recommended Amount of Calcium," These also contain calcium, although it is far less than the amount found in dairy. You would need to eat 5 cups of broccoli to get as much calcium as you can get in one glass of milk. However, these vegetables are low in calories and full of vitamins so if you enjoy them, you can eat just about as much as you want.;
, This means that they do not naturally contain calcium, but calcium is added in a manufacturing plant. You will find this on the labels of many brands of orange juice, soy products, cereal... just about anything.

, Fortunately Vitamin D is very easy to get. Almost all commercially available foods that are rich in calcium are also fortified with vitamin D. Your skin will also make this vitamin inside your body when exposed to the sun. If you are concerned about getting vitamin D, many fish, such as salmon and mackerel are rich in it.

,, A serving of the dairy group is one glass of milk, a slice of cheese, or a cup of yogurt. Ice cream does contain milk, but it also contains lots of fat and calories, so this would not be the wisest choice.


The cheapest available are antacids, such as Tums. For most people, these are generally sufficient. There are also calcium chews available that taste like chocolate or caramel. Both of these forms must be chewed very thoroughly and taken with water.
There are also big calcium pills that you can take. You should take these with plenty of water. It is also important to note that your body will only absorb about 500mg in a sitting. So if you choose to take supplements, take one in the morning and one in the evening. Do not take two doses at the same time.
If you take a multivitamin, check the label. Most popular multivitamins do not contain a lot of calcium.

Eat shellfish.,
Incorporate meat.,
Add nuts to your recipes.,
Eat dairy.,
Add grains.,
Snack on seeds.,
Eat legumes and beans.,
Include zinc supplements.",How to Get More Zinc in Your Diet1," One of the best ways to get zinc is to eat shellfish. Shellfish contains significant levels of zinc. Oysters have the highest amount of zinc. For 3 ounces of oysters, you will get five times the daily value (DV) of zinc. You’ll get 74 mg and 493% of your daily value.3 ounces of crab contains 6.5 mg of zinc (43% DV). 3 ounces of lobster contains 3.4 mg of zinc (23% DV).
Include a meal of oysters at least once a month. If you don’t like oysters, include crab or lobster once or twice a month instead.
Some fish also contain zinc. One serving of flounder contains less than 10% of your daily amount of zinc.;
, Meat products contain significant amounts of zinc. You can get a lot of zinc from healthy sources of red meat, pork, and poultry. 3 ounces of beef contains 7 mg of zinc (47% DV). Pork contains 2.9 mg of zinc (19% DV) for 3 ounces.When eating poultry, make sure to eat the dark meat. 3 ounces of chicken contains 2.4 mg of zinc (16% DV). Turkey contains 3.0 mg of zinc (21% DV).
4 oz of lamb has 35% of your daily value of zinc., Nuts provide a small amount of your daily recommended amount of zinc. You can eat cashews, almonds, or peanuts for some zinc. A 1-ounce serving of cashews contains 1.6 mg of zinc (11% DV).


1 ounce of almonds contain 6% of your daily amount of zinc.
You can also include nuts as a snack every day. Most nuts contain zinc, though not at very high levels.

, Dairy sources contain zinc. You can include a few sources of dairy into your diet each day to increase your intake of zinc. Yogurt contains the most zinc out of all dairy products. 8 ounces contains 1.7 mg of zinc (11% DV).1 ounce of Swiss cheese has 8% of your daily value of zinc, and 1 ounce of cheddar or mozzarella has 6%.
1 cup of low-fat or skim milk has 7% of your daily value.

, Certain grains have enough zinc in them to add a significant amount to your daily value. One packet of instant oatmeal has 7%. Some cereals are fortified with up to 25% of your daily zinc for one serving.Quinoa has 18% of your daily value for 3/4 cup.
Check the labels on any fortified foods that may include zinc.

, Seeds have significant amounts of zinc. You can include seeds into your main dishes, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, salads, or even snack on them. 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and pumpkins seeds both contain 25% of your daily value., Legumes and beans are a good source of zinc. This source includes tofu, tempeh, soybeans, kidney beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, and peanuts.Half a cup of chickpeas contains 9% of your daily value, and kidney beans include 6%.Soak your beans and legumes before you cook them. They contain phytates, which block absorption of minerals, and soaking will remove the phytates.

, If you are struggling getting enough zinc through your diet, you can take a zinc supplement. You can buy a supplement in tablet form to take daily. Most supplements come in a 30 mg form, which is 200% of your DV.See your doctor to determine if your zinc levels are deficient enough to take a supplement.

Look at your child's diet.,
Talk to your child's pediatrician.,
Consider individual supplements instead.,
Choose a multivitamin for kids.,
Read the label.,
Consider a kid-friendly form.,
Follow the directions carefully.,
Never call them candy.,
Keep the vitamins out of reach.,
Check for interactions.,
Watch for signs of an overdose.,
Focus on nutrition in the diet.,
Make a routine for healthy consistency.",How to Give Multivitamins to Kids," Many times, a multivitamin isn't needed as long as your child is eating a healthy diet. Even if your child is picky, it's likely they are getting what they need from their diet, even if they aren't eating as many vegetables and fruits as you'd like.For instance, many foods are fortified with vitamins, such as milk and cereals.
However, if your child has a very strict diet, a multivitamin may be appropriate. A diagnosis of anorexia, failure to thrive, or simply following a vegan diet are all good reasons for your child to take a multivitamin.""Failure to thrive"" is a specific, potentially quite serious diagnosis that means a child isn't growing and gaining weight as expected, which can be caused by sickness or food problems.;
, Your child's doctor is the best person to make the decision about whether your child needs a multivitamin. Plus, the doctor can evaluate whether the multivitamin will do more harm than good. Ask your child's doctor if a multivitamin is a good idea for your child.You could say things like, ""I'm concerned about my child's nutrition. She doesn't seem to be eating enough vegetables. Do you think a multivitamin would be a good idea? Would it cause any harm? Would it interact with any medications she's on?""

, Your kid is likely getting plenty of vitamins from diet, but they may be missing out on a key few. The vitamins most children are at highest risk of deficiency in are: vitamin D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids.A fiber supplement may also be a good idea for some kids.
Discuss the appropriate dose with your doctor, as each kid is different. For instance, by some recommendations, kids 1 to 4 years of age should be receiving a supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D, but that might not be the case for your kid., These vitamins are specially formulated to give your kids what they need in the right amounts. Adult multivitamins would provide too high a percentage of the individual vitamins for your child, and your child can take too much of some vitamins.Vitamins are divided into two types: water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored by the body in fat, making them easier to overdose on., The label will list what vitamins are in the multivitamin, along with the percentage of daily value. No individual vitamin should be listed as more than 100 percent of the daily value, as your child does not need more than the recommended daily dose., Kids are generally not big on taking medications, so picking a form that's more kid friendly may encourage them to take them. For instance, you can find gummy or sprinkle forms of kids multivitamins, which your kid may be more willing to take than liquids.

, When dosing your child, make sure you are careful with your dosages. Never give your child more than is recommended for their age, as they can overdose on vitamins. Also, make sure that you measure precisely instead of “eyeballing” doses.

, If your child thinks the vitamin is ""candy,"" they're more likely to down a few when you're not looking. Don't refer to them as candy. In fact, it's best to make it a point to tell them that they are NOT candy., Kids may think the vitamins are candy, or just really enjoy the sweet taste, and they may be tempted to down a few when you're not looking. Kids can actually overdose on some vitamins, so make sure to keep the vitamins where your kids can't easily get to them., Look at any medications your child is on. Check them for interactions with vitamins that are in multivitamins. You may find an interaction that means your child shouldn't take the multivitamin. Your doctor or pharmacist can also help you figure this part out., If you suspect your child has eaten too many vitamins, you should be on the lookout for symptoms of overdosing. The most likely vitamins to lead to an overdose are iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B3, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin D, and vitamin A.


The symptoms you should look for include bleeding issues (vitamin K and E), flushed skin (vitamin B3), difficulty walking and numbness (vitamin B6), trouble seeing and klutziness (vitamin A), and stomach issues like nausea, cramps, and vomiting (iron).
Seek medical care if you notice any of these symptoms in your child. Call your child's pediatrician or poison control., Of course, many kids are picky eaters, but the majority of your child's vitamins should be coming from their diet. Try to encourage them to eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as dairy and lean proteins.It takes a much smaller amount than you probably think for your child to get their daily vitamins.

, If you are having trouble getting your child to take the multivitamin or if you frequently forget to provide it for your child, consider creating a regular routine. For instance, every night right after dinner or first thing in the morning before brushing their teeth, each child gets one multivitamin. Make it a routine and you’ll be more likely to stick with it and your kid(s) will get consistent, proper doses."

Determine the correct amount of daily zinc.,
Incorporate more zinc if you are vegetarian.,
Know the importance of zinc.,
Know which nutrients zinc interferes with.",How to Get More Zinc in Your Diet2," The amount of zinc a person should have differs based on factors, such as age and gender. You should determine how much zinc you require each day because getting too much zinc can be harmful.Children seven months to three years old need 3 mg each day. Children younger than seven months need 2 mg.
Children four to eight years old need 5 mg.
Children nine to 13 years old need 8 mg. Both can get up to 23 mg safely each day.
Male teens 14 to 18 years old need 11 mg. Females need 9 mg. Both can get up to 34 mg safely each day.
Males over 18 need 11 mg, while females need 8 mg. Both can get up to 40 mg safely each day.
Zinc needs increase when pregnant and/or breastfeeding — 11 mg and 12 mg respectively. These numbers will be even higher if you are a teenager.

, Vegetarians need to be particularly careful to get enough zinc from non-animal sources. You can get zinc from beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, oats, and wheat germsVegetarians and vegans may have a zinc deficiency because many of the main sources of zinc are not acceptable to vegetarians. The other reason is that grains and legumes, main foods for vegetarians, contain high levels of phytic acid. This component may reduce zinc absorption.

, Zinc is important for many bodily functions. It is important for your immune system. Zinc also plays a critical role in over 300 enzyme reactions in the body. Zinc also plays a structural role for proteins and cell membranes.In proteins, zinc provides a sort of scaffolding to keep proteins folded correctly. This scaffold is called the “zinc finger motif.” Proteins containing a zinc finger motif are important in regulating how genes, coded for in the DNA, are expressed. These proteins act as transcription factors, controlling gene expression.
Zinc is also important in how cells communicate with each other and is important in control of hormone levels and in the transmission of nerve signals
Zinc plays a role in a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This is particularly important to control cancer cells and in ridding the body of non-functional cells.

, While it is important to get enough zinc in your diet, it is also important to recognize that zinc can interfere with the absorption of other minerals, such as copper, iron, and calcium. If you need to increase any of these nutrients, space out your foods with zinc and copper, iron, and calcium. Put two to three hours between eating these foods.


Though zinc blocks absorption of some minerals, it is needed for better absorption of others. Zinc is required for the absorption of folate (a B vitamin) and the function of Vitamin A.

Identify the risk factors of a zinc deficiency.,
Recognize the dangers of a severe zinc deficiency.,
Understand the dangers of too much zinc.",How to Get More Zinc in Your Diet3," Marginal zinc deficiency is relatively common, with about 2 billion people worldwide affected.Marginal deficiency results in poor growth, poor physical and mental development, and increased risk of infections. There are a number of risk factors for marginal zinc deficiency including:Premature and low-birth-weight infants or older breast-fed infants and toddlers who do not get enough zinc-rich foods
Children and adolescents
Pregnant and breastfeeding women, especially younger women
Patients receiving a form of intravenous feedings known as total parenteral nutrition
Malnourished or undernourished children and adults
People with severe or chronic diarrhea
Individuals with malabsorption syndromes or digestive and liver disorders
People with Celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
Alcoholics with alcoholic liver disease
Individuals with chronic renal disease and sickle cell anemia
Older adults (over 65 years)
Individuals on specific medications that interfere with the absorption or function of zinc
Strict vegetarians

, Severe zinc deficiency is relatively rare. It is usually the result of a rare genetic disease called acrodermatitis enteropathica. In these cases, symptoms include slow growth and development, delayed sexual maturation, skin rashes, severe diarrhea, deficiencies of the immune system, poor wound healing, poor taste sensation and poor appetite and clouding of the cornea.If you believe you have this disease, go see your doctor for tests.

, Though zinc is important for your body’s overall health, you want to make sure you get the right amount. It is difficult to overdose with food alone — usually an overdose occurs from taking too many supplements and/or taking supplements in addition to a high-zinc diet. Excess zinc can cause significant health problems including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, cramps, diarrhea and headaches.High levels of zinc can interfere with copper and iron levels and this can cause copper and iron deficiency anemias.
Always talk to your doctor and be aware the some multivitamins may include zinc.

, Since sunlight stimulates vitamin D production, you need to spend time in the sun without protection. You need to let your exposed skin get access to the sun a few times a week. It is recommended that amount of time you should spend in the sun is half the amount of time it takes for your skin to turn pink.Most children and young adults need to spend 20 to 30 minutes outside, two to three times a week with bare arms, legs, and face to synthesize enough Vitamin D to prevent deficiency.Although sun is important, using a tanning bed as a substitute for sun is not recommended. Tanning beds increase the risk of skin cancer.In one study, exposure to afternoon sun long enough to get mildly pink skin (for light-skinned people) was enough to produce 10,000 to 25,000 IU of Vitamin D.Individuals with darker skin need more sun exposure, and need to spend three to six times longer in the afternoon sun to get the same amount of Vitamin D. The reason for this is that darker skin contains higher amounts of melanin, a skin pigment whose function is to protect skin cells from UVB radiation. Older adults need to spend more time in the sun to get the same effects as well.

, There are many factors that should be taken into consideration when getting the right sun. Your location and the season of the year can make a significant difference. In addition to season, skin color, and presence of sunscreen, the amount you get also relies on the amount of cloud cover and pollution in the area.For example, 15 minutes of sun exposure on your hands, arms, and face at around noon in Miami, Florida throughout the year is roughly equivalent to 1000 IU.
In other areas north and south of 40 degrees latitude (which in the United States is around Boston), there isn’t enough UVB radiation to stimulate vitamin D production from November to March. In Canada, this extends from October to mid March. This time period is known as the Vitamin D Winter., Sunscreens, which block UVB radiation, significantly decrease vitamin D production.This means that you need to be in the sun without sunscreen, but only for this limited amount of time. If you think you are going to spend more than 20 to 30 minutes in the sun, then you should wear sunscreen.

Eat leafy greens.,
Get vitamin K from herbs.,
Eat scallions.",How to Get Vitamin K1," Leafy greens are an excellent source of vitamin K. Some greens that contain large amounts of vitamin K are kale, mustard greens, collard greens, and spinach.You don’t need to eat very much of these greens to get your vitamin K. An average serving of green vegetables has about 600% of your recommended daily intake.
For most leafy greens, 1 cup raw greens (1/2 cup cooked) is considered a serving.
You can get vitamin K from greens whether they’re cooked or raw; however, some nutritionists believe that raw greens deliver the most nutrients.;
, You can get vitamin K from fresh or dried herbs. You’ll need to eat more than you might usually if you’re trying to get a lot of vitamin K in your diet. Some of the best sources are basil, thyme, sage and parsley.For most herbs, you’ll need to eat between 1 and 2 tablespoons of the dried herb to get your recommended daily intake.
You can make recipes that use lots of a specific herb to up your intake. For example, you can make pesto with basil or tabouleh with parsley.

, Scallions, also known as spring onions, are another great source of vitamin K. They can be eaten raw or cooked and are great in a variety of dishes.Scallions are inexpensive and can be found in your local grocery store.
You can eat both the green and the white parts of scallions.

Know why vitamin D is important.,
Learn who is at risk for deficiency.,
Know how much vitamin D you need.,
Understand where else to get vitamin D. Vitamin D can be taken as a supplement, as either D2 or D3.",How to Get Vitamin D from Food2," Vitamin D is an important nutrient for the body. Vitamin D is involved in the proper functioning of the immune system, cell growth, and cell regulation. It also aids the body in numerous ways, such as encouraging calcium absorption, promoting bone growth, and aiding in bone remodeling. Vitamin D prevents rickets, osteomalacia (softening of the bone), and osteoporosis (brittle bones). It has also been associated with cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment in older people, asthma in children, and even cancer.Low levels of Vitamin D also contribute to the risk of colon and pancreatic cancer. Vitamin D deficiencies can increase the risk of high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes., Some people are more at risk than others for vitamin D deficiency. If you are in one of the at risk categories, make sure to eat as much vitamin D as possible. However, even if you don't fall under the typical category of someone who might be deficient, you could still be at risk. Have your blood tested to find out whether or not you are deficient, especially if you fall into one of the following groups:Elderly adults
Infants who are breastfed
Those with darker skin
Individuals who do not get enough sun exposure
Individuals who are obese, overweight, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery
People with fat malabsorption conditions
Those allergic to milk
Anyone who eats a vegan diet

, For people ages one through 70, they need 600 IU (15 mcg) of vitamin D a day. Under one year only needs 400 IU (10 mcg), and over 70 needs 800 IU (20 mcg)., You can also get vitamin D from the sun. Spend 10 to 20 minutes in the afternoon sun two to three times a week without sunscreen. Make sure you expose you face, arms, and legs to the sun.


Using a tanning bed is not the same as spending time in the sun. Make sure to consult a physician before taking any supplements, especially if you are on other medications.

Get the right amounts of vitamin D. The recommended daily amounts for vitamin D vary according to age but are the same for men or women.,
Find the right source.,
Ingest vitamin D. Given the variety of foods that have vitamin D, there are many ways to get the right amount each day.",How to Get Vitamin D Naturally2," The breakdown of recommended daily amounts are:


Birth until 12 months old need 400 IU (10 mcg)
One year old until 70 years old need 600 IU (15 mcg)
Over 70 years of age need 800 IU (20 mcg)
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need 600 IU (15 mcg), There are not that many foods that contain vitamin D. There are some additional foods that have been supplemented with vitamin D at varying levels. The foods highest in natural vitamin D include:


Cod liver oil, which has 1360 IU per 1 tablespoon
Wild-caught swordfish, which has 566 IU per three ounces
Wild-caught salmon, which has 447 IU per three ounces
Wild-caught tuna fish, which has 154 IU per three ounces
Fortified milk, which has around 120 IU per two cups
Yogurt, which has 80 IU per six ounces
Sardines, which has 46 IU per two sardines
Beef liver, which has 42 IU per three ounces
Eggs, which has 41 IU per one large egg
Swiss cheese, which has 6 IU per one ounce, The simplest way is to have one tablespoon of cod liver oil daily. This oil tastes terrible, but you can mix it into a vegetable smoothie or divide it up into smaller doses. Incorporate one or two servings of any of these listed foods into a recipe or during your meals every day.


You can also eat fewer servings each day and spend some time in the sun, to make up the difference.

Learn the benefits.,
Know risk factors.,
Get healthy levels.",How to Get Vitamin D Naturally3," One of vitamin D's primary functions is to help calcium absorption in your system. This is important because calcium is necessary for bone growth and bone remodeling, which are constant processes in the body. Vitamin D is also needed to prevent rickets in children as well as osteomalacia (softening of the bone) and osteoporosis (brittle bones) in adults.


Vitamin D also contributes to the proper functioning of the immune system as well as cell growth and cell regulation.
Low levels of vitamin D also can increase the risk of pancreatic and colon cancer, autoimmune disease, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance (pre-diabetes), and multiple sclerosis., There are some people who are more at risk for vitamin D deficiencies. This means if you are one of these individuals, you need to pay more attention to how much vitamin D you get everyday. The people more at risk include:Breastfed infants
Older adults
Anyone with limited exposure to the sun
Individuals with darker skin
Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or any other condition with fat malabsorption
Overweight people, obese people, or those who have had gastric bypass surgery

, In general, 50 nmol/L of vitamin D in your blood is considered to be at healthy levels. Values lower than this are considered low, which means you need to up your dose. A doctor will generally suggest food and sun with additional supplementation if needed, though supplementation is recommended after. Keep in mind that vitamin D, like other fat-soluble vitamins, can be toxic at high levels. This means you can have too much, which is not good for you.


Excess vitamin D can cause anorexia, weight loss, and heart problems."

Take a multivitamin.,
Take a vitamin K supplement.,
Get a vitamin K shot if needed.",How to Get Vitamin K2," Multivitamins are great because they give you your recommended daily dose of many nutrients. Ask your doctor if taking a daily multivitamin would be good for you.Some multivitamins might not contain vitamin K, so check the label before you buy.
There are multivitamins available for specific groups, such as children, pregnant women, and senior citizens.

, You can also find vitamin K on its own. Look for vitamin K supplements at your local natural food store, health center, or pharmacy. Always talk to your doctor before taking a new supplement.If you don’t see vitamin K at your local store, you can order the supplements online.

, For people with a severe vitamin k deficiency, doctors may prescribe a vitamin K shot. This is a way to get plenty of vitamin K without having to rely on the digestive system to process it.If you’re concerned that you won’t be able to get vitamin K any other way, a shot may be your best bet.

"
"
Determine how much vitamin K you need.,
Limit vitamin K-rich foods if necessary.,
Let the body produce vitamin K. The reason vitamin K deficiency is rare is that the bacteria in your intestines will make it for you.",How to Get Vitamin K3," Most people’s bodies actually manufacture plenty of vitamin K. If you regularly eat a balanced diet and you don’t have any gastrointestinal ailments, you’re probably getting enough vitamin K. Some signs that you have a deficiency can be:Easy bruising
Gastrointestinal bleeding
Excessive menstrual bleeding for women
Blood in the urine
Osteoporosis
People most at risk for vitamin K deficiency are people with chronic malnutrition, alcohol dependency, and people whose bodies have a problem with the regular absorption of vitamins.

, Some people actually need to limit the amount of vitamin K they consume. If you are taking prescription anticoagulants, which are meant to interfere with the role of vitamin K, you’ll need to keep your dietary intake of vitamin K purposefully low and consistent day to day.If you’re on prescription anticoagulants, don't take vitamin K supplements.

, Sometimes taking antibiotics when you’re sick or have an infection will kill these bacteria, which can lead to a mild or temporary deficiency. However, even this is most common in people whose levels of vitamin K were already low.Eating fermented foods such as yogurt, kombucha, and miso or taking oral probiotic supplements can help boost the bacteria in your gut if they’ve been depleted by antibiotics.

Understand what DHA is.,
Eat the right type of fish.,
Eat eggs.,
Add algae to your diet.,
Eat fortified foods.",How to Get Dha1," Our bodies make very small amounts of DHA naturally; however, the amount is not enough to support healthy growth and development.


In general, it's recommended to consume about 300-500 mg daily for adults.Adequate levels of DHA support fetal brain development and their ability to learn. In adults, it supports normal brain function and also has been shown to decrease the risk of heart disease and Alzheimer's Disease.;
, Fatty, cold-water fish is one of the best sources of naturally occurring DHA. Adding these types of fish and shellfish to your diet can help increase your intake of DHA.


Fatty fish to try include: salmon, anchovies, sardines, mackerel, trout, tuna, halibut, herring, caviar, shellfish, and whitefish.Try to include two to three servings of fatty, cold-water fish every week. Each serving should be about 4-6 ounces. This results in about 1,250 mg of DHA a week.Both wild and farmed version of fish contain high levels of DHA. Either option is appropriate and will help increase your overall DHA consumption.Children and pregnant women should avoid consuming fish that have high levels of mercury. The types of fish that are most likely to include contaminants, in general, whether wild or farmed, include mackerel, swordfish, tilefish, and shark., Eggs are another source of naturally occurring DHA. In an egg that has not been fortified, you consume about 70 mg of DHA per egg. However, eggs that are fortified with DHA contain about 160-200 mg of DHA per egg.It's now considered safe and healthy to consume eggs on a regular or daily basis. Studies have shown that eating eggs does not increase your cholesterol.Although non-fortified eggs generally contain some DHA, they are not a consistent source. This is due to the differing diets that hens have prior to laying eggs. However, choosing fortified eggs gives you an more accurate amount of DHA., Algae is another great source of naturally occurring DHA. The algae are also what makes fish high in DHA — small fish consume the DHA-rich algae and the bigger fish consume the smaller fish. Through the food chain, large fish contain adequate quantities of DHA.Types of algae that you can include in your diet are seaweed (nori) or kelp (wakame, kombu, or dulse). 1/4-1/2 ounce of any of these types of algae counts as a serving.The amount of DHA will vary depending on the type of algae you consume.
Spirulina, which is a powdered algae, can be added to smoothies, yogurt or even oatmeal. It might turn your foods a slightly turquoise color, but it'll be filled with DHA.
Try adding chopped nori sheets or dulse flakes to salads or sandwiches.
Also, many grocery stores sell ""seaweed chips"" which are nori sheets sprinkled with a little bit of salt and are a low-calorie snack.
It can also be found in powder or pill form.

, Increasing DHA consumption has become more well known and popular. Many food companies have been finding ways to incorporate DHA and other heart healthy fats into other foods. You might find added DHA in items such as milk, eggs, orange juice, or even peanut butter.


Look for fortified milk and milk alternatives. Some commercial brands of milk or soy milk add fish oil or algae oil during processing, thereby enhancing the drink with DHA. You'll get roughly 30 to 50 mg of combined DHA and EPA for every 1 cup (250 ml) of fortified milk.To know whether or not foods are fortified with DHA, you must make sure that the products you purchase are labeled as ""fortified"" or ""enriched"" with DHA. The label should include additional information, including whether or not DHA is included among the added nutrients.Drink fortified orange juice. One cup of fortified OJ has about 50 mg of added DHA.Switch to fortified peanut butter. Consuming 2 Tbsp of fortified peanut butter will provide approximately 32 mg of combined DHA and EPA.Choose ""all natural"" peanut butter that has no added trans-fats and sugars.
Natural sources of DHA (like fish or algae) will contain higher levels of DHA and typically contain other substances that help your body absorb the fatty acid. Your primary source of DHA should still come from natural options instead of fortified ones."

Talk to your doctor.,
Take fish oil supplements.,
Take an algae supplement.,
Avoid supplements that supply only ALA.",How to Get Dha2," The ideal way to get DHA into your system is through natural means, but if you are unable to consume enough DHA naturally, a dietary supplement can help. Your physician knows your personal medical history, so he or she will be able to make a more precise recommendation concerning supplement type and dosage.


This is especially true if you are at risk for a medical condition that DHA and other omega-3 fatty acids can help treat. This may include heart disease, high triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, asthma, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia.Some medical conditions may make omega-3 supplements unsafe. For instance, if you have a bleeding condition or take a medication that may increase bleeding (blood thinners and some NSAIDs), omega-3 fats can further increase bleeding., Many fish oil supplements contain both DHA and EPA. They make a suitable alternative if you do not eat fish, are vegetarian or have an allergy to seafood. For most healthy adults, taking 3000 to 4000 mg of fish oil per day is safe and appropriate.Always check the label for exact dosage instructions.
The exact amount of DHA and EPA in each capsule will vary by brand, so check the label to determine how much DHA is included. This information should be listed on the nutrition fact panel on the container.
Fish oil supplements are not recommended for infants and small children due to the EPA they contain. This EPA can negatively impact the balance between DHA and EPA during early developmental stages., Algae-based supplements only contain DHA and do not contain EPA or ALA (alpha linoleic acid). These types of supplements are appropriate for those following a vegan or vegetarian diet or have seafood allergies.


For most healthy adults, taking about 200 mg of algae oil daily is safe and appropriate.The amount of DHA is almost exactly the same as the total dosage for most algae supplements.

, Although your body can convert some ALA (alpha linoleic acid) into DHA, it's not a very efficient process.It's not likely that you can consume enough ALA to meet the minimum recommendations for EPA or DHA.


If trying to increase the amount of DHA you consume, avoid purchasing or consuming ALA based supplements or relying on foods high in ALA to meet your daily DHA needs.
Foods high in ALA include: walnuts, flaxseeds, canola oil and chia seeds.ALA supplements include walnut or flaxseed oil and do not contain DHA.

Check the fish oil supplement brand to ensure that it’s natural.,
Examine the supplements for omega 3 fatty acid levels.,
Refrigerate fish oil supplements and oil in a well-sealed container.,
Take the recommended dosage for your age.",How to Get Health Benefits from Fish Oil," Fish oil supplements are made from fish, which can live in mercury and heavy metal infested environments. By ingesting poorly fabricated supplements you could bring more harm to your body than good.


Supplements certified to be free of mercury and toxins. Check to see if the supplements were either approved or certified by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) or the State of California's limit under Proposition 65, which has the strictest standards.






Choose supplements manufactured from areas with low pollution levels. Areas such as New Zealand and the southern ocean typically produce fish that have the lowest levels of heavy metals and toxins versus those harvested in the northern oceans.





;
, You want to take a supplement that contains the highest level of omega 3’s.


Check the EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) level. The EPA level is the most effective component to fish oil and has the highest impact regarding inflammation and heart disease.






DHA amounts. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is another important component to making fish oil effective, especially for enhanced brain function.







, Pay close attention to expiration date to obtain the most benefits.

, Children can also benefit from taking fish oil supplements, however it’s important to adhere to dosing recommendations as prescribed by a pediatrician, to not only ensure the maximum benefits but as a safety precaution.


Children under age 18. Studies have shown that fish oil supplements can be helpful with numerous childhood conditions including ADHD, skin disorders, asthma and even depression. However, never administer fish oil supplements to a child under age 18 without the instruction of a physician. Omega 3’s may have side effects that can have an adverse impact on children.
Adults may benefit from taking fish oil according to their ailment. Adults who have normal blood pressure and cholesterol readings should not take more than 3 grams of omega 3 fatty acids per day (high doses can promote bleeding). However, those who are taking the supplements for heart disease should take 1 gram daily of a supplement containing both DHA and EPA. Adults with high cholesterol levels should take between 2 to 4 grams daily and those with high blood pressure can ingest between 3 to 4 grams daily.

Eat your greens.,
Include plenty of seeds in your diet.,
Add seaweed to your diet.,
Eat more canned fish.,
Sweeten with blackstrap molasses.,
Snack on dried figs.,
Eat more white beans.,
Avoid excess salt.,
Use non-dairy milk alternatives.",How to Get Calcium Without Milk1," Dark, leafy greens such as collards, turnip greens, spinach and kale are rich in calcium. In fact, collards are one of the best sources of calcium in all foods, with a whopping 268 milligrams (27% of your daily needs) of calcium in one cup of cooked greens.Collards are also low in oxalates, which can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb calcium.
Leafy greens are also rich in other nutrients, including vitamin A, potassium, iron, and vitamin C.;
, Chia seeds are a powerful source of calcium, packing 177 milligrams (18% of your daily needs) of calcium into two tablespoons of seeds. Simply adding a tablespoon or two of chia seeds into your morning smoothie will ensure that you’re receiving your daily intake of calcium.Sesame seeds are also full of calcium, which contain 88 milligrams (9 percent of your daily needs) per tablespoon.
If you’re not used to including seeds in your diet, start by sprinkling them on vegetables, or adding them to smoothies.
Tahini, or sesame seed paste, is another terrific source of calcium.

, Seaweed is a good source of calcium, fiber and iodine. The most calcium-dense variety of seaweed is hijiki, which contains nearly one and a half times the recommended daily allowance of calcium in a ¼ cup serving.In general, dried seaweed contains 4-7% calcium by weight, so in order to get the US Recommended Daily Allowance of approximately 1,000mg, you would require only about a tablespoon or two.
Fresh seaweed contains more water, and consequently less calcium by weight, but can still be a good source of your daily calcium.

, Canned fish is precooked, so requires little preparation. Canned fish is an excellent source of calcium in your diet because of the soft fish bones that are found in canned fish. For example, pink salmon and sardines are rich in calcium, Omega 3s, and vitamin D.Canned mackerel is another fish that’s less familiar to most people, but contains just as much calcium as canned salmon.
You can include canned fish in tasty casseroles, sandwich fillings, soups and salads.

, Two tablespoons of blackstrap molasses contain 400 milligrams of calcium. It’s also rich in other minerals, such as iron, magnesium, manganese and potassium.


You should be aware that regular molasses, including sorghum molasses, doesn’t contain calcium.
Replace sugar with 1-2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses to increase your calcium intake. For example, try using molasses in your coffee or baked goods.

, Figs are an excellent source of calcium, and dried figs are available year-round. Eight to 10 dried figs contain as much calcium as one glass of milk. They’re also an excellent source of iron, fiber and potassium.You can enjoy dried figs on salads, in smoothies, or softened in your morning bowl of oatmeal.
Figs are also a good source of antioxidants.

, White beans, such as navy beans, chickpeas, or other white legumes, contain a healthy supply of calcium. A one-cup serving of baked beans, for example, contains 102 milligrams of calcium.These foods also contain magnesium, which works together with calcium to build bone in your body.
Because it's made from soy beans, white tofu is another good source of calcium.

, The calcium in bones will slowly dissolve into the bloodstream, before passing through the kidneys into the urine. Sodium (or salt) in the foods you eat will increase calcium loss.By reducing your sodium intake to under two grams per day, you’ll retain your intake of calcium better.
Avoid salty snack foods and canned goods with added sodium. Rinse your canned vegetables well, as they’re stored in a salty brine.
Do not use salt before, during, or after cooking.

, Soy milk, rice milk, hemp seed and almond milk all have a high level of calcium. Check their labels to compare the calcium levels in each.Make sure you shake the carton well, as the calcium tends to settle at the bottom.
Many juices contain added calcium. Look for the labels that advertise calcium.

Don’t smoke.,
Get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D supports your body’s efficient use of calcium.,
Maintain a regular exercise routine.,
Don't drink too much.",How to Get Calcium Without Milk2," Along with many other health risks, smoking is associated with osteoporosis caused in part by the body’s inefficient processing of calcium. Smoking prevents your bones from absorbing calcium. Vitamin D helps your body process calcium, but smoking interferes with this process of absorption. Less calcium is then available to help build bones, and your bones will start to become brittle.


Smoking after the age of 30 will speed up your naturally-occurring loss of bone mass.
People who are exposed to secondhand smoke in childhood are at an increased risk of developing low bone mass., Current recommendations include receiving 15 minutes per day of direct sunlight without sunscreen to naturally produce enough vitamin D.If you get little sun exposure or are at high risk for skin cancers, you can get vitamin D from most multivitamins and fortified foods. While doctors aren’t yet sure of the optimal dose of vitamin D, teens and adults may safely take up to 4,000 IU per day.Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.
Many people are deficient in vitamin D without knowing it. Consider getting your vitamin D levels checked at your next doctor’s appointment.

, Active people tend to keep calcium in their bones, while sedentary people lose calcium as they age. Combine strength training with weight-bearing exercises, such as walking or jogging, for maximum benefits to your bones. Weight-bearing exercises strengthen your lower body - your legs, hips, and lower spine - while strength training helps build the bones in your arms and upper spine.By keeping your bones healthy, you’ll be increasing your body’s ability to process the calcium it takes in.
Swimming, cycling, and exercising on machines provide great aerobic workouts, but are less effective for strengthening bones.

, Research suggests that excessive drinking of alcohol can interfere with the body's use of calcium, particularly in adults younger than age 35. Moderate drinking (one drink per day) doesn't appear to have any negative consequences.


Chronic alcoholism weakens the body's bones, preventing them from proper absorption of calcium.
People who drink alcohol are more than 75% more likely to smoke than nondrinkers. However, research is still inconclusive on whether or not the combination of lifestyle factors is more detrimental than just one or the other."

, It's important to talk to your doctor about any supplements before you begin taking them. Different supplements have different recommended dosages, and those recommendations can even vary from one country to another.In the United States, the proper dosing depends on your age.


Adult and teenage males should take between 270 and 400 mg daily.
Adult and teenage females should take between 280 and 300 mg daily.
Pregnant females should take 320 mg daily.
Breast-feeding females should take between 340 and 355 mg daily.

, For instance, children aged one to three years can receive 65 mg of magnesium, children four to eight years of age can receive 110 mg of magnesium, and children over eight years of age can receive 350 mg of magnesium daily.Talk to your pediatrician before administering any nutritional supplements to children under 12 months old.

, Magnesium supplements are generally not harmful by themselves (if taken properly); however, if you are on other medications, magnesium supplements could cause problems. If you are planning on taking over-the-counter supplements (without a prescription), it's best to just avoid the supplements and increase your dietary magnesium. Sometimes these interactions are unavoidable if both the magnesium and the secondary medication are both prescribed by your doctor. If your doctor has prescribed both, they will probably change the dose or the frequency of dosage to reduce the chances of an interaction. Avoid taking over-the-counter magnesium supplements with the following prescriptions:Dabrafenib
Digoxin
Eltrombopag
Elvitegravir
Gefitinib
Ketoconazole
Ledipasvir
Levomethadyl
Licorice
Mycophenolate Mofetil
Mycophenolic Acid
Pazopanib
Phenytoin
Quinine
Raltegravir
Rilpivirine
Vismodegib

, Your doctor may already know what prescription drugs you take (though you may want to remind them just to be safe). It's important not to forget your over-the-counter (OTC) medications or supplements. Many OTC medications contain magnesium, some as a primary ingredient. For this reason, it is important that you let your doctor know about any other over-the-counter medications you take, including the dosage size and frequency, to prevent an accidental overdose of magnesium.Many laxatives (including milk of magnesia) use magnesium as a primary ingredient.
Certain heartburn and acid indigestion medications, like Rolaids and Tums, also include magnesium.
Make sure your over-the-counter medications do not put you over the recommended daily limit of supplemental magnesium.
Keep a list of your medications and take them into your appointments with your doctor and go over them at every visit so that the doctor is aware of what you are taking.

, If you are in good health, then magnesium supplements should be safe for you, provided that you follow the recommended dosage; however, certain health conditions can be affected by magnesium supplements. Avoid taking supplements if you have either or both of the following conditions:Heart disease — Magnesium supplements can worsen this condition.
Kidney problems — Too much magnesium in your blood could make it difficult for your kidneys to adequately perform their job.

, A magnesium deficiency can lead to a number of other medical complications ranging from mild to severe. Your doctor will run laboratory tests to confirm a magnesium deficiency, but you may notice certain signs and symptoms at home. Common symptoms of a magnesium deficiency include:Agitation/irritability
Anxiety
Sleep disorders (including insomnia)
Nausea and/or vomiting
Abnormal heart rate
Low blood pressure
Poor nail growth
Confusion
Restless leg syndrome
Muscle spasms and weakness
Hyperventilation
Seizures

, Magnesium is present in many foods, and if you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you should be getting adequate magnesium; however, some people are susceptible to magnesium deficiencies due to complications from certain medical conditions. The following conditions can cause you to have a magnesium deficiency:Gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis
Diabetes
Pancreatitis
Hyperthyroidism
Kidney disease
Heavy menstruation
Excessive sweating
Prolonged stress
Anything that requires you to take diuretics on a regular basis<

, In addition to medical conditions, a magnesium deficiency can also be caused by dietary factors. Talk to your doctor about your dietary intake if you've been diagnosed with a magnesium deficiency.


You may have lower magnesium levels if you drink too much coffee, soda, or alcohol on a regular basis.
Eating too much sodium (salt) can also cause you to have lower levels of magnesium., If you suffer from chronic health conditions, you may not realize that magnesium can increase the effectiveness of some medications/treatments.Talk to your doctor to find out if increasing your magnesium intake might improve your health conditions. Common conditions improved by magnesium intake include:Altitude sickness
Anxiety
Asthma
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Diabetes
Fibromyalgia
Hearing loss
Kidney stones
Lyme disease
Migraines/headaches
Osteoporosis
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
Urinary incontinence

Use cooking oils rich in vitamin E. Many oils, such as nut oils, seed oils, and vegetable oils, contain high amounts of vitamin E. Some that you may want to try, in order of vitamin E content, are wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, corn oil, and soybean oil.When deciding what oil to cook with, be sure to consider the other nutrition information, as well as the smoking point, to see which oil is best for your specific needs.,
Choose the right leafy greens.,
Add lots of vegetables.,
Eat eggs.,
Add herbs and spices.",How to Eat More Vitamin E1,"
Try using extra virgin olive oil instead of salad dressing. Olive oil is a rich source of vitamin E, in addition to having many other health benefits. You can mix a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar with your olive oil to make a more flavorful dressing.;
, Vitamin E can be found in leafy greens such as swiss chard, mustard greens, spinach, turnip greens, and kale. Try replacing traditional lettuce or cabbage in your salad for one of these greens.


Try combining a couple of these, such as kale and mustard greens, in a salad.
When using robust greens like kale, mustard greens, or swiss chard, massage the leaves with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the juice from half of a lemon. This will soften the leaves and make them much easier to eat!Spinach is known to be an ultimate health food, so consider adding spinach to a meal whenever you can. A half cup of cooked spinach contains 16% of your daily value of vitamin E., Red bell peppers, asparagus, broccoli, collard greens, and butternut squash are all loaded with vitamins and nutrients, including vitamin E. Try integrating them into your meals, or cooking them as a snack between meals.All bell peppers contain similar nutrients, but red bell peppers contain the highest vitamin E content.Try adding red bell peppers to a salad, and preparing the other veggies as a side dish for your main course.

, Start your day with 1-3 eggs, cooked to your preference. Eggs contain a moderate amount of vitamin E, and when combined with vegetables that are high in vitamin E, they can increase the amount of vitamin E that is absorbed by your body.Experiment with adding spinach, avocado, tomatoes, or bell peppers to an omelet or scrambling them with your eggs.

, Spices like paprika and chili powder, as well as dried herbs such as basil, oregano, and parsley, are good sources of vitamin E. Try adding chili powder to soups, eggs, and poultry. Paprika can go well with many savory foods, and can be used in meat rubs and marinades."

Eat lean red meat.,
Select iron-rich seafood.,
Mix in pork and poultry.,
Go for more grains.,
Choose vegetarian options.,
Pair fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C with your iron.,
Cut back on absorption inhibitors.,
Cook in iron pots and pans.,
Use iron supplements if needed.,
Don’t overdo it.,
Be aware of its function in your body.,
Know how much iron you need.,
Understand iron deficiency.,
Track your iron intake and get tested if concerned.",How to Eat More Iron," Red meat is the largest known food source of easily-absorbed iron content. Organ meats in particular, such as liver, are especially high in iron. Don’t worry, vegetarians, you have many options, which will be discussed later.


Iron in meat is known as heme iron, which comes from the hemoglobin in the animal tissue. It is more easily absorbed when eaten than plant-derived sources of iron, at about a 30% rate of absorption.There is no iron in fat, so you should have no qualms about choosing extra lean ground beef or trimming the excess fat off your roasts and steaks.
Iron content examples: beef chuck roast, 3.2 mg per 3 oz.; ground beef, 2.2 mg per 3 oz. For these examples, keep in mind that a male over age 18 should consume 8 mg or iron per day; a non-pregnant female age 19 to 70 should consume 18 mg per day.;
, Generally speaking, seafood is not as substantial a source of iron as red meat. However, particular items like canned clams and cooked oysters are among the most-iron rich foods of any type.Shrimp and sardines are also good sources of iron; salmon and tuna have somewhat less, but also offer valuable nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids.
Iron content examples: canned clams, 23.8 mg per 3 oz.; sardines, 2.5 mg per 3 oz., These white meats provide solid amounts of heme iron, although not as much as red meat or higher-iron seafood options.


Turkey is a good choice, providing more iron than chicken or ham.If you enjoy liver or other organ meats (like turkey or chicken giblets), you’re in luck - these can provide substantial amounts of iron.
Iron content examples: liver / giblets, 5.2 - 9.9 mg per 3 oz.; duck, 2.3 mg per 1/2 cup., As non-heme iron sources (not contained in hemoglobin), the iron content in grains (as well as beans, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and so on) is not as well-absorbed when consumed -- usually less than 10% absorption, compared to 30% for heme iron.It still counts toward your overall intake, but it should not make up the entirety of your iron consumption.


Practically all breads, cereals, and anything else made from grains offers iron content. However, iron-fortified breads and breakfast cereals are the best choice if added iron consumption is your goal
Iron content examples: fortified dry cereals, 1.8 - 21.1 mg per 1 oz; fortified instant hot cereal, 4.9 - 8.1 mg per packet., Even if you do consume meat, picking up iron from non-meat sources like beans, nuts, and vegetables can only help, and will offer a host of other healthy vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.


Proteins like soybeans, lentils, kidney beans and chickpeas are solid sources of non-heme iron.So go ahead and pick the tofu burger if you aren’t a meat-eater.
Dark, leafy greens like spinach and kale, dried fruits like apricots, prunes, and figs, nuts and seeds such as peanuts and pumpkin seeds, potatoes and rice, and brewer’s yeast and molasses are among the many sources or iron available to vegetarians and omnivores alike.Iron content examples: cooked lentils, 3.3 mg per 1/2 cup; cooked spinach, 3.2 mg per 1/2 c.; roasted pumpkin seeds, 4.2 mg per 1 oz., Vitamin C boosts the body’s absorption rate of iron, so consuming meals with high amounts of both maximizes the benefits.


We think of oranges when we think of vitamin C, and citrus fruits are an excellent choice. So too are other tropical fruits like mangoes and guava, and vegetables like peppers, broccoli, and sweet potatoes. The CDC website offers a substantial list of vitamin C-rich foods in its article on iron consumption.Especially for vegetarians who are consuming non-heme iron, pairing iron with vitamin C is important. Consider combinations like cereal with strawberries or lentil soup with a tomato salad.

, While foods rich in vitamin C can help your body take in iron, others can do the opposite.


Dairy products contain iron, but the calcium in them can lessen the amount your body absorbs. Those taking iron supplements are often told not to consume dairy products when taking the pill, and you may want to consider avoiding dairy at a meal with iron-rich foods for the same reason.The polyphenols in coffee and tea, when consumed in significant amounts, can also hinder absorption, so try to not to drink these beverages in excess.Egg proteins are another absorption inhibitor to keep in mind, as are foods high in minerals like zinc and phosphorous, which, like calcium, can “compete” for absorption with iron., Especially when cooking with high heat, a trace amount of iron content may be transferred to your food. This is especially true when cooking acidic foods, such as a tomato sauce., Talk with your healthcare professional about whether iron supplements are right for you. Pregnant women, because of the increased demands on their body and the need for iron by the fetus, are particularly likely to be put on an iron supplement. It may be included in your prenatal vitamin or be a separate supplement.

, Generally speaking, you should be far more concerned about not getting enough iron than getting too much. That said, having too much iron collect in the body is a problem.


Iron overload is called hemochromatosis, and the symptoms are similar to an iron deficiency.While it is possible to take in too much iron by over-consuming iron supplements, hemochromatosis is usually a genetic condition.Be aware that many iron supplements are higher than the recommended daily allowance (RDA). If you are taking an iron supplement in addition to a multivitamin that contains iron, you risk over-consumption.
You are very unlikely to take in too much iron through food alone. So don’t try to get out of eating the liver and onions your mother-in-law prepared by saying you think you’re eating too much iron!

, Iron is a mineral that is present in every single cell in our bodies, and thus is essential to body function and good health.


As part of the protein hemoglobin, iron helps carry oxygen throughout our bodies. It is also a key component of enzymes that facilitate digestion and numerous other body functions.Basically, iron is everywhere -- and is needed everywhere -- in your body.

, The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of iron varies by gender and age. Follow this link for the full chart. Some highlights:


Children between ages 7 months and 8 years need between 7 to 11 milligrams of iron daily, based on age.
Teens between ages 9 and 18 need between 8 to 15 mg / day, based on age and gender.
Males age 19 and above need 8 mg daily.
Females age 19-50 need 18 mg / day, and 8 mg / day after that. Pregnant women need 27 mg / day.

, Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and in the U.S. and the primary cause of anemia, which affects organs throughout the body.Iron deficiency can cause fatigue and mental impairment in adults, premature birth in fetuses, and motor/mental function development impairment in infants, among other problems.
Iron deficiency is most common during periods of rapid body growth (infancy or pregnancy, for example) or due to blood loss (such as menstruation or an internal bleeding condition).

, Use the nutritional information on the foods you eat to keep track of the iron you are consuming, and look up the amount you should consume daily based on age and gender as per your RDA.


If you suspect your iron intake is low, or have symptoms like tiredness or apathy, simple blood tests can determine whether you have an iron deficiency or anemia, a shortage of red blood cells that can be caused by iron deficiency.Regular blood testing for iron levels can tell you if your iron supplement is working and help you adjust the dosage to know when you are getting enough.

Snack on fruits throughout the day.,
Go for nuts and seeds.,
Eat peanut butter and almond butter.,
Munch on fortified cereals.",How to Eat More Vitamin E2," Mango, papaya, avocado, tomatoes, kiwi, and apricots are all fruits that provide you with a great dose of vitamin E. Cut up some fresh juicy tomatoes and a half or whole avocado to add to crackers, a salad, or to eat by themselves. Avocado is also wonderful for your skin, in addition to being a source of vitamin B, K, and C. Tomatoes will provide your body with vitamins E, A, C, as well as fiber and lycopene (which is thought to prevent cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer).You can eat mango and papaya sliced up in a bowl, or in a delicious smoothie, blended with ice, kale, and any other fruits you enjoy.Dried apricots are also a great snack for on the go.

Keep in mind that nuts are high in calories. Be mindful of your portion size. You should limit your nut intake to about 4 servings of unsalted nuts per week. A serving size is usually 1.5 ounces, or a small handful. To get more specific serving size information, check the back of your package of nuts., Both of these delicious spreads (as well as raw peanuts and almonds) are shown to be high in vitamin E. Try them on toast, in sandwiches, on apples, or just on a spoon!, Many cereals are fortified with vitamin E. Check the back of your cereal box to see if vitamin E is listed. It may also be written as dl-alpha-tocopherol, which indicates synthetic vitamin E."

Exercise.",How to Gain Weight if You Have Diabetes2," Not everyone will have the same healthy weight goals, as each person's body will vary. Many people do not understand what a healthy weight is, and for that reason, strive to hit the wrong goals. Being under or overweight can affect your health, so strive for the optimum level of body weight.The most common measurement to determine ideal body weight is known as BMI, or body mass index.
Many calculators are available online to help you determine your BMI.
The formula used for imperial calculation of BMI is weight (lb) / 2 x 703The formula used for metric calculation of BMI is weight (kg) / 2 Generally, a range of 18.5 to 24.9 using the BMI, is considered normal body weight.

, At its core, weight gain results from increased caloric consumption. By eating more, you will gain more weight. However, you should still learn to estimate how many calories you need daily to gain weight.Count how many calories you are currently eating in a day.
Add 500 calories a day, for one week. Check for weight gain.
If no weight was gained, add another 500 calories a day next week.

Eat your greens.,
Eat your beans.",How to Get Enough Calcium if You’re Intolerant to Lactose2," Green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, bok choy, and collard greens are excellent sources of calcium. Broccoli is also packed with calcium.


Keep in mind that your body doesn't absorb all this calcium the same way, though. It is much harder to get calcium from spinach because of the oxalic acid that interferes with the absorption of calcium ions. However, arugula has good amount of calcium and pretty good absorption.

, Beans of all kinds offer calcium as well as essential fiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients essential to a balanced diet.

Increase your daily calories.,
Write up a meal plan.,
Eat balanced meals.,
Add more calories to your meals.,
Use higher fat condiments and sauces.,
Add in an extra snack.,
Increase the calories of your beverages.,
Continue with aerobic exercise.,
Include regular strength training.,
Increase your baseline activities.,
Set reasonable goals.,
Start a food journal.,
Track your weight.",How to Gain Weight in Two Months," If you have a 2-month time period to gain weight, you'll need to increase your calories by about 250 or 500 calories daily.Small caloric increases result in healthy and gradual weight gain. In general, you should aim to gain about a half a pound to one pound per week.
Increasing your total daily intake by more than that can cause rapid weight gain, which isn't healthy.
Use a food journaling app or online diary to find out how many calories you currently eat. Add 250-500 calories to that number to figure out what daily caloric intake you should aim for.For example, if you currently eat 1600 calories daily, shoot for 1850-2100 calories daily to gain weight.;
, Whenever you're trying a new diet plan, it may be helpful to write up a meal plan for your new eating pattern.


Meal plans are somewhat like a blueprint of all your meals and snacks for an entire week. This can give you the plans to stay on track with the right types and amounts of foods for the week.Write up a list of all the meals, snacks and beverages you'll be eating over the course of the week.
It may also be helpful to write up the corresponding grocery list as well. This may make grocery shopping easier too., Regardless of whether or not you're trying to lose or gain weight, it's essential to eat balanced meals. A balanced diet means eating a wide variety of foods from each food group most days and over the course of a week.Eat the following food groups:


Protein foods. These include eggs, dairy, red meat, seafood, poultry and legumes. Include a 3-4 oz serving of protein based foods at each meal and snack.Fruits and vegetables. Aim to have 1-2 servings of fruit daily (about 1 small piece or 1/2 cup chopped)and 4-6 servings of vegetables daily (1 cup or 2 cups salad greens).Grains. Try to go for whole grains when you can (like quinoa, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread). Servings are about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of cooked grains., You can increase the total calories at your meal by about 100-200 calories per meal to result in an extra 300-500 calories daily.


Also choose higher calorie foods. Some foods are naturally higher in calories and healthy fats and are a nutritious way to bulk up the calories in your day.Using both lean and moderate fat protein will help add more calories to each meal. Choose foods like whole eggs, full fat dairy products, dark meat poultry or beef that's moderately high in fat.
If you're a fan of avocado, stock up on this higher calorie and nutritious food. Add it to salads, scrambled eggs or make a guacamole with them.
Also choose fatty fish and seafood like salmon, tuna, sardines or mackerel. They're higher in calories and heart healthy fats.For example, instead of turkey meatloaf with lean meat, use the dark ground turkey meat or use real, whole eggs instead of egg substitutes. Switch to full fat yogurt, cheese and 2% milk instead of the low-fat or fat-free options.
If you can, eating slightly larger portions can also help you get in extra calories. However, if this is difficult or uncomfortable, continue with choosing higher-calorie foods.

, Changing what you cook your foods in or what you use as condiments is another way to add in extra calories.


Cook foods in butter or olive oil instead of no-calorie cooking sprays. You can also drizzle extra olive oil over vegetables, grains or proteins that you cook.
Top your foods with higher calorie condiments like full fat sour cream or full fat shredded cheese.
If you're making casseroles or mixed dishes, use full fat items as well. For example, use regular whole milk or cream in mashed potatoes instead of skim milk.

, Including an extra snack or small meal is another way to get in an extra 250-500 calories each day.Try to include a source of protein, fruit or vegetable. This helps make the snack balanced and nutritious.
Examples of snacks that are 250 calories or more include: a small apple with 2-3 tbsp of peanut butter, 1/2 cup of trail mix or 1 individual full fat greek yogurt with 2 tbsp of nuts.
If you do not currently snack between meals, adding in 1-2 snacks daily may be all you need to do to gain weight gradually.
If you already snack during the day, try to make your snacks more planned and find the time for an additional snack in between or after meals.
Adding a snack before bed may help you gain weight., An easy way to get in extra calories each day is with higher calorie beverages.


Drinking higher calories fluids may be an easy way to get more calories in overall as liquids do not fill you up as much as larger portions or heavier, higher calorie foods.Choose items like: 2% or whole milk, 100% juice or use full fat creamer in your coffee.
You may also want to make smoothies to increase liquid calories. You can add milk, full fat yogurt, fruit or nut butters to make a higher calorie, yet nutritious smoothie.
Although the occasionally sweetened or sugary beverage is OK, do not make these the main source of your extra liquid calories. Items like regular soda, fruit juice cocktails, alcohol, or sports drinks are high in sugar and provide little to no nutritional benefit.

, Although aerobic exercise burns calories and can cause weight loss, it's still an important part of a healthy lifestyle.


Aerobic exercise has many health benefits including improved sleep, improved moods and better control of high blood pressure or diabetes.It's typically recommended to do about 2.5 hours of cardio activities each week.Stick to low to moderate intensity activities to help support your weight gain.
Try: walking or a slow jog, a leisurely bike ride, hiking or swimming.

, When you're gaining weight, strength training can help you gain muscle mass instead of all fat mass.


Regular resistance training or strength training can help build lean muscle mass. This is typical more ideal than gaining all fat mass.
Do about 2-3 days of light weight strength training. You may want to try yoga, pilates or use light free weights., If you're having difficulty gaining or maintaining your weight, focus on increasing your baseline activities instead of cardio and strength training.


Baseline or lifestyle activities are the exercises that you already do in your normal daily routine.For example: walking to and from your car or doing household chores.
These types of activities do not typically burn many calories or cause weight loss, but do show to have some health benefits.
Increase your baseline activity by taking more steps in your day or walking more frequently, taking the stairs rather than the elevator or parking farther away.

, With weight loss or weight gain, it's helpful to set reasonable and realistic goals.


With weight gain, you'll want to aim for a gain of about a half to one pound each week. That means in a two month time span you could gain anywhere from 5-10 pounds.
You may also want to set smaller, more frequent goals along the way to let you know how well you're progress is going. For example if you want to gain a 1 pound per week, but you're only gaining a 1/2 pound per week, you can readjust your meal plan and calorie goal to help you increase your weight gain.
If you need to gain more weight than that you'll most likely need to readjust your goal timeline to allow for further weight gain.

, Food journals will be very helpful when you're trying to gain weight. They will serve as a guide when planning your goals and if you need to make any changes.Track all the foods you eat each day. Include all meals, snacks and beverages in one day.
Try to be as accurate as you can. You may need to use a food scale or measuring cups to help keep you on track.
Also keep track of your total caloric intake each day. This will help you if you need to make changes to your calorie level.

, Keeping track of how much weight you've gained will be incredibly important. If you don't keep track it'll be difficult to tell how much you've gained and if you've met your goal.


Get on the scale about 1-2 times per week. Weight gain happens more slowly than weight loss, so more frequent weighing will not be useful.
For the most accurate weight, try to get on the scale the same day of the week and at the same time.
Keep track of your weight and progress in your food journal.

Aim for overall wellness.",How to Gain Weight if You Are Underweight," Being underweight means you will have lower energy requirements and a smaller stomach, so you will become full faster. Planning on eating five or six slightly smaller—but complete—meals throughout the day can help you to get the nutrients you need more regularly, and to struggle less with finishing large portions at the beginning. And, as with any seemingly insurmountable task, breaking it into smaller parts can help to make it feel achievable.


”Hara hachi bu” is a Confucian saying which means to eat only until you are eighty percent full. While usually thought of as a mantra for those trying to avoid overeating, it can be helpful for keeping the big picture in check: the point of this is to be healthy and well, not to keep eating to the point of being uncomfortable. You might already know that eating more frequently is also a tip given to those wanting to lose weight as well, to maintain the body's metabolism. So which is right? Both, actually! It just depends on what those frequent meals you're eating consist of. Slowing your metabolism can be attempted to gain weight, but it's not a healthy method that's generally advised.;
, This is a good baseline to maintain when you’re trying to pack on pounds. Searching online for a calorie calculator will yield multiple results, any of which you can use to determine how many calories are necessary to maintain your current weight. Then, add 250-500 to that number.

, Meats, cheeses, and nutritious whole grain carbohydrates are excellent choices. While simply eating a lot of nearly anything will make you gain weight, care must be taken to also answer the nutritional deficiencies that are part of being underweight.Example breakfast dishes: scrambled eggs with cheese, yogurt with fruit and granola, and breakfast burritos.
Example lunch dishes: chicken breast sandwich with avocado, tuna salad, and whole wheat bagels with cream cheese.
Example dinner dishes: steak with cooked vegetables, baked potatoes with butter and sour cream, and grilled salmon with rice.

, Full-fat options should be taken over fat-free alternatives whenever possible. Light or fat-free versions of food often lead to your body being just as full, but with fewer nutrients to put to work.


This rule doesn't apply as you might think to cuts of meat. Fattier meats aren't an overall bad choice--and are more affordable than leaner cuts--but meat with less fat just means more protein, which is good for our goal here.

, Regular carbohydrate intake is necessary to gaining and keeping weight. Carbs are regularly broken down into glucose (sugar) for energy. In their absence, your body will turn to and break down those other sources of energy you've been working so hard to tack on: fat and protein. , Fiber is critical to digestion, something you’ll want all the help you can get on once you start eating more than you’re used to. It’s found in beans, oats, bran, fruits, and vegetables. , Sneak in bites of peanut butter before bed, or a handful of nuts as you go grab the mail. Small snacks eaten throughout the day will add up.


It’s certainly okay to occasionally splurge on your favorite sugary, salty, junky treats too, as long as it’s not all you snack on.
Try eating a large snack or even a small meal before you go to bed. The calories from this nighttime snack are more likely to be stored in your body as you sleep instead of burned for energy. This may help you gain weight.

, Caffeine suppresses a person’s appetite, and when striving for weight gains you’ll want all the appetite you can get. They aren’t actively keeping your weight down, but you should be aware of the overall effect they have on your diet. These include: Coffee
Tea
Sodas
Energy drinks, e.g., Monster Energy, Red Bull

, Drinking too much before meals can mean you’re not leaving room for the nutrient-dense food you need to be eating. Don’t abstain from drinking, but don’t let beverages fill up the valuable real estate in your belly you should be using on your meals.


If drinking with a meal isn’t working well, try waiting to drink until a half hour or so after you’re done eating.
Don’t dehydrate yourself! The exact needs of every person are different, but a healthy diet does requires you to remain hydrated. Be sure to drink several glasses of water throughout the day.

, Strength training is an important avenue for gaining weight and staying healthy. Increasing your food intake and building muscle at the gym is an effective two-pronged approach.


If you want to put on weight, opt for fewer repetitions with more weight instead of the opposite. Each exercise is different, but 10-12 reps is considered a normal amount for a majority: shoot for 6-8 in these instances instead.
While lifting weights is focused on building muscle, it isn’t only for bodybuilders. Nothing about lifting weights says you will necessarily become “bulky,” if you fear your body becoming too big after gaining weight.

, Cardio is important for overall health and strengthening the circulatory system, but aerobic exercise will burn weight you probably don’t want it to. Take it easy on the treadmill, or increase your caloric intake to accommodate for the losses there.


3500 calories equals about one pound of fat when it comes to weight loss and gain. Keep this in mind when considering how many calories you'll have to make up after a workout. Many machines display an estimate of the calories you've burned.

, Exercising will burn energy as you’re putting it into your body, but it can also stimulate your appetite. This will help you to establish and solidify better, more regular eating habits as you respond to the energy needs of your body.


Particular care should be taken to make sure you’re getting the requisite protein for rebuilding your muscle after a day at the gym. Meats, eggs, and cheese are effective here, as are nutritional supplements and shakes made especially for post-workout intake.

, Activity is integral to a healthy lifestyle and to gaining weight in a responsible way, but don’t go overboard. Especially if you have a job or hobby which requires you to be on your feet all day, constant movement can burn the excess calories you’re taking in before you even start to see the gains you’re looking for.

, Prescription medicines or treatment regimens can have side effects which lead to weight loss. Nausea is also common, which is certainly a problem for anyone attempting to muster up the appetite for five or six meals a day.

, Sickness will stop your weight gain plan in its tracks, so it’s important to still eat a healthy diet (even if you’re eating a lot more of that diet) and to get plenty of rest and exercise. Being underweight can lead to a weaker immune system, so this will require particular diligence on your part.


Anemia, caused by iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiencies, can occur among the underweight. Supplement your diet with these nutrients if you feel dizzy, fatigued, or headache-y. Sudden or substantial weight loss can also be indicative of disease. The issue could be digestive, thyroid-related, diabetes, or even cancer. Only a medical professional can determine this, so schedule a consultation if experiencing any unusual weight loss.

, Stress, anxiety, and depression can have unwelcome effects on appetite, cause difficulty in achieving eating goals, and be all-around disruptive of a person’s other attempts at self-care. If you feel this is applicable to you, consult your doctor for help in how to best manage your mental well-being.


Body dysmorphia and eating disorders are serious issues relating to self-perception and weight, both of which should be diagnosed and treated by a medical professional. Up to 30 million people of all ages suffer from eating disorders in U.S., and eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental health issues. "

Evaluate your diet

Increasing your daily intake of dairy products is an obvious source of more calcium, but you can also add green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, kale and Swiss chard, which are also great calcium-rich foods.,
Choose the fortified option


Many foods such as fruit juices and cereals are being offered in calcium fortified varieties.,
Step up the exercise


Exercise, especially weight-bearing exercise such as walking, is shown to help the body retain more calcium, because the body is being forced to hold itself up.,
Increase your vitamin D intake


Vitamin D goes hand-in-hand with calcium absorption.,
Add a calcium supplement


If your diet alone isn't providing you with approximately 1,000 milligrams, you will need to add a calcium dietary supplement to make up for the deficiency.,
Stay within a reasonable daily calcium intake


While too little calcium can lead to bone loss and weak teeth, too much calcium can lead to a different set of health problems.",How to Eat More Calcium," These green veggies are also high in vitamin C, which helps your body to absorb the added calcium.



 


Beans are another great source of calcium and are also high in protein, which helps with calcium absorption.






Get creative if calcium packed foods aren't high on your list of favorites. Consider adding broccoli to your stir-fry or roasting Brussels sprouts with some flavorful seasonings. You can add beans to chili, soups, Mexican foods and egg dishes, as well as many other everyday foods to intake more calcium. Revamping dishes you already enjoy will help make the transition to a higher calcium diet much easier.





;
, Choosing these instead of the regular variety will allow you to add calcium by way of foods that you would have consumed anyway.

, Make the most of your increased calcium intake and use exercise to hold on to as much of it as possible.

, Without vitamin D your body will only absorb 15-to-20 percent of the calcium you consume. Limited sun exposure, approximately 15 minutes, will provide your body with ample vitamin D. The amount of time you expose yourself to the sun is important as burning your skin doesn't allow you to get the proper benefit from the sun. Wear sunscreen to help you avoid burning.

, The body only efficiently absorbs about 500 milligrams of calcium at a time, though, which would require you to take two 500-milligram supplements twice a day.

, This is mostly an issue when the overabundance of calcium leads to the malabsorption of other essential minerals.

Check for references to United States Pharmacopeia standards and testing.,
Check for information on type of supplement.",How to Determine the Disintegration Rate of Supplements1," Over the counter supplements are not regulated as drugs but many companies still use the same methods of testing for disintegration rate. If the company has used the USP standards and testing, they will usually label it so consumers will know.;
, Supplements come in many different forms. It is important to know which form you are taking to determine disintegration rate.


Standard form usually dissolves within 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion. A standard form would be a tablet that is not coated with gelatin or a gel pill. They can usually be crushed into a dry powder.
Enteric coated dissolves once the supplement has reached the intestine.
Gel coated usually dissolves within 30 minutes after ingestion.
Time release supplements will have the amount of time it takes for the supplement to fully absorb into the body on the label. These will vary based on supplement.
Chewable tablets must be chewed or crushed in order to disintegrate fully.

It's important to get your doctor's perspective on how much weight-gain is appropriate for you. In addition, she may be able to refer you to a registered dietitian for additional one-on-one counseling.


Talk to your doctor about why you want to gain weight, how much weight you want to gain, and how you think it will improve your health.
Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange ""Find an Expert"" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.;
, Before starting a new diet to help you gain weight, find out how much weight you want or need to gain. This information will help determine your eating pattern and give you a timeline to track your progress.


One way to determine how much weight you should gain is to calculate your BMI. You can use a a formula like this one or use an online calculator. If your BMI is less than 18, this signifies that you are underweight and may need to gain weight.Then calculate how much you would need to weigh to have your BMI fall between 19-24.9 (healthy/normal range).The difference between these two values can give you some insight into an appropriate amount of weight gain.
You can also calculate your body fat percentage or have your doctor, dietitian, or even a trainer at your local gym calculate this for you. For an average woman, body fat percentage should fall between 25%–31%.For an average man, body fat percentage should fall between 18%–25%.If you exercise regularly or you are an athlete, your body fat percentage might be lower. In general, women's body fat percentage should never fall below 14% and men's shouldn't fall below 6%.If you're body fat percentage is low (especially if you're not an athlete), this may also indicate the need for weight gain.
Ask your doctor what is an appropriate weight range for your gender, age, and height.
When aiming to gain weight, your focus should be gaining lean muscle mass and minimize gains in body fat. Large increases in body fat is not recommended., Monitoring and counting calories is not just for weight loss. To gain weight you'll need to know how much you're currently eating and how many calories you need to add to your diet each day to result in weight gain. It is important that your weight gain comes from healthy food sources, rather than junk food, so make sure your weight gain isn't coming from just donuts and ice cream.


Safe weight gain is about 0.5–1 pound per week.This equates to consuming about 500 additional calories daily.
Also count the calories that you may burn while exercising. For example, if you burned 350 calories going for a jog, you'll need to consume those 350 calories with your meals and snacks. Not eating those may cause weight loss or inability to gain weight.Monitoring calories and how many you've added to result in weight gain is also important when you're tracking your progress. If you haven't gained enough or have gained too much, you'll need to know how many calories have caused that particular result.

, Food journals are very helpful for those who are interested in gaining weight.You can track your current diet, where you can add additional calories or meals, and how that has affected your weight over time.


Prior to starting a weight gain eating plan, track a few days of eating. Review your notes and see if there are any obvious improvements you can make. For example, do you skip meals? Do you typically eat only low-fat low-calorie foods?

, Many people eat 3 meals a day plus a snack or two. If you're trying to gain weight, it is important to eat more food, more frequently. Aim for 5–6 meals daily or 3–4 meals with 2 snacks.Each meal doesn't need to be large. With more frequent meals you may feel more full throughout the day. Snack-sized meals are appropriate (like a small pack of peanut butter crackers or two hard boiled eggs).
You may need to rethink or plan out your day so you have enough time to consume 5–6 meals daily. For example, you may need to eat right when you wake up so you're not too full before your next meal.

, When you're trying to gain weight it's important to maximize the amount of calories you can consume with each meal and snack. Calorie-dense foods are items that are high in calories per serving.Consume these foods with each meal and snack.


Calorie dense foods to incorporate into your diet include: nuts and nut butters, avocados, full-fat dairy products (cheese, yogurt and milk), butter and oil, and eggs. Also use full-fat condiments like regular mayonnaise, full-fat cream cheese or full-fat salad dressings.
Not all high-fat foods are healthy or appropriate to eat more frequently or in larger quantities. Minimize these foods: fast food, deep fried foods, candy, and high-fat processed meats (bologna or hot dogs).
If you're eating multiple times throughout the day, you may feel more full. This may lead to smaller meals instead of several large meals. Even when meals/snacks are small, if they are calorie dense, they can help induce weight gain.

, In addition to eating more calorie dense foods, you can also increase calories in your favorite meals and recipes. Adding extra foods or using higher calorie ingredients in your recipes is an easy way to bulk up your total calories.The more of a caloric punch you can add to meals, the more calories you'll consume over a given day and week.


In recipes, use full-fat dairy products or dried milk in soups, stews or casseroles calling for water.
Drizzle extra olive oil or add an extra pat of butter to salads, steamed vegetables, soups and casseroles.
Top lower calorie foods with high-calorie toppings. For example, top whole milk yogurt with nuts and granola or top your salad with full-fat shredded cheese and sunflower seeds.

, Drinking extra calories is another great way to slowly gain weight. Many times fluids are not as filling as a meal, allowing you to consume more calories overall.


Smoothies are great as a meal or quick snack. They're a great vehicle for adding a lot of nutritious foods and high calorie foods.You can also sip on your smoothie as you eat a meal or snack to increase calories. Try making smoothies with: whole milk/yogurt, nut butters, avocados, chia or flax seeds, and frozen fruit.
Drinking 100% juice is another moderately healthy way to increase calories. 100% juice contains vitamins and minerals along with a higher calorie level.
Meal replacements are drinks that have vitamins, minerals, protein and contain anywhere from 100 calories to more than 350 calories.Don't choose a low-calorie drink. If choosing a powdered drink mix, add to whole milk for a higher calorie beverage.
Do not use sodas, milkshakes, high sugar coffee drinks, or sweetened teas as a source of liquid calories. These beverages, although high in calories, are low in nutrients and high in refined sugar., It may be hard to gain weight, especially if you don't have an appetite or are recovering from an eating disorder.Choosing higher calorie favorite foods might help tempt your appetite.


If you're not interested in eating, think about one of your favorite meals. Maybe you love mac and cheese or spicy Mexican food. Choose those items when foods are not appealing.
Also try eating and preparing foods with more seasonings, like herbs and spices. More flavorful foods help stimulate your appetite.Go for a quick walk prior to a meal time. Even moderate amounts of exercise can help stimulate your appetite., When you're trying to gain weight it might be tempting to think unhealthy high fat foods are an appropriate addition to your diet. However, many high fat foods are also highly processed and contain large amounts of saturated or even trans fats. These foods are not healthy and can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease.Foods high in unhealthy fats that should be minimized in your diet include: processed meats (bologna, hotdogs or sausage), pastries, candy, cakes/pies, fast foods or fried foods.
As with any diet, it's appropriate to eat these foods occasionally in moderation. They do not need to be avoided, but shouldn't be a staple in your weight-gain plan.

, Even when you're trying to gain weight, including regular aerobic activity is healthy and beneficial to your lifestyle. Cardiovascular exercises strengthen your heart, improve or manage some chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, and give you more stamina throughout the day.Cardio exercises can include: jogging or walking, biking, swimming or hiking.
Always monitor approximately how many calories you're burning through exercise. You'll need to calculate this into your total goal.
If you're performing aerobic exercises and are having trouble maintaining your weight or you're continuing to lose weight, you may need to decrease the intensity, frequency, or duration of your aerobic exercises.

, Strength training can aid in your weight gain. As you build lean muscle mass, you may notice your weight increases. This is highly important when attempting to gain weight. Many people do not realize that exercise is crucial to weight gain, just as it is to weight loss.


Strength training activities include: weight lifting, isometric exercises (push-ups or crunches) and Pilates.
Strength training does burn calories, just not as many as aerobic activities. However, it's still important to be aware of how the calories burned during these exercises affects your weight.

, Seeing a personal trainer may help you find the appropriate workout schedule for you. A personal trainer will be able to guide you through specific exercises or routines that can help keep you fit and maintain or add weight.


Check at a local gym for a trainer. Many times you can see a trainer there and they may even offer a discounted consult for your first visit.
Talk to your trainer about your weight and goals. Make sure they understand you're interested in healthy weight gain.

, Weighing yourself regularly is important when you're trying to gain weight. Note your starting weight and how much you're gaining per week. This information can help see how much progress you've made or signal that you need to reevaluate your plan.


Weigh yourself at the same time of day, in the same clothes or no clothes each week. This will help cut down on any inaccuracies (like clothing or food you've consumed throughout the day)., Each month, check in with your weight and food journal. Assess how well you're doing and if you'll be able to or have reached your weight goal.


If you've been gaining weight steadily, you'll most likely reach your weight goal. Or if you've reached your weight goal, monitor how well your current calorie level helps you maintain your weight.
If you've stopped gaining weight or hit a plateau, it's time to reevaluate your diet and lifestyle. Count your total calories again and review your food journal. If you've been consistent with your diet, you may need to increase your calories. Make the required changes and check back in another month to reassess your progress.

, A support group is helpful for any change or goal you have. But when you're trying to gain weight (especially after an illness), a support group can help keep you motivated and encourage you as you progress towards your goal.Talk to your family and friends about your situation and your goal. Share with them what you're doing, why and how they can help keep you on track.

Buy wheatgrass shots.,
Blend your own wheatgrass juice.,
Mix up wheatgrass powder.,
Take wheatgrass tablets.,
Use wheatgrass in salads.,
Bake with wheatgrass.",How to Gain the Health Benefits of Wheatgrass1," You can buy wheatgrass shots at most juice bars or coffee shops. These are small, concentrated amounts of fresh wheatgrass. Since they're usually only around 2 to 4 ounces, you can easily add them to smoothies or just drink them straight.Wheatgrass juice is pretty bitter, which is why it's often added to sweeter fruit drinks.;
, If you're planning on drinking wheatgrass every day, consider making your own fresh wheatgrass juice. You can buy the tender wheatgrass shoots or grow it. You'll need to blend it in a blender designed just for wheatgrass, so the shoots don't clog the blender. Strain the wheatgrass through a mesh strainer and refrigerate it until you're ready to drink it.Try mixing the wheatgrass with carrot juice, pineapple juice, apple juice, or mint.
To make wheatgrass juice, you will need two ounces of fresh wheatgrass, two stalks of celery, two cucumbers, and half a cup parsley. Cut all of the vegetables into small chunks. Put wheatgrass into the juicer first, and add the vegetables in after it. Add water as needed.

, Purchase wheatgrass powder from a natural food store. Look for a powder that's made with wheatgrass juice instead of dried and ground wheatgrass. Your body will absorb the wheatgrass better if it's been processed already. Put the powder into a blender along with your liquids and sweeteners of choice. Blend the mixture until it's smooth. For a sweet wheatgrass drink, blend together:1/2 scoop of wheat grass powder
2 cups (450 g) of fresh or frozen pineapple
1 frozen banana
1 to 2 cups (240 to 480 ml) of coconut water
1 teaspoon of spirulina (optional)

, If you don't have the time to mix up wheatgrass or you don't like drinking it, you can buy wheatgrass supplements. These usually come in tablet form and should just contain wheatgrass powder.

Keep in mind that while it's rich in nutrients, it's similar in nutrition to other green vegetables (like broccoli and spinach).Be wary of wheatgrass products that claim extreme health benefits without any studies to back up the claim. Check out the company before purchasing the product.

, It's easy to add wheatgrass to other vegetables and increase your vitamin intake. Wheatgrass contains vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and iron. Keep in mind that wheatgrass doesn't count as one of your recommended daily vegetables.Wheatgrass also contains calcium and magnesium, which are great for building bone health.

Be aware that supplements aren’t miracle cures.,
Talk to your pharmacist.",How to Determine if You Should Use Dietary Supplements1," In general, multivitamins and minerals supplements can benefit most people; however, there are some conditions that can make it dangerous for you to take supplements. These conditions include kidney or liver disease, which may interfere with the processing of these vitamins and minerals.Talk to your doctor about what supplements are good for you.


Some supplements interact with medications, so ask your doctor or pharmacist about possible interactions with any medications you already take, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs. For example, vitamin K can reduce the effectiveness of blood thinners.;
, There are some supplements that might contribute to certain health problems. This means that taking certain supplements may cause you to develop some health issues. Your doctor will be able to tell you if you are at risk for some of these side effects, based on your personal history.


For example, beta carotene has been shown raise the risk of lung cancer in smokers.Taking vitamin E may also cause an increased risk of prostate cancer., When you talk to your doctor, have your blood tested. This will help you determine any deficiencies you may have. From this, you and your doctor may decide if supplements are right for you. Your doctor may also suggest other alternatives to fix your deficiencies, such as a balanced diet or a change in diet to help replace those nutrients.


You will have to ask for this blood test, and it is usually not covered by your insurance.
Your doctor may suggest certain supplements for your deficiencies.For example, your doctor may tell you to take vitamin D supplements every day if you have a vitamin D deficiency.

, You should also talk to your doctor about your medical history. There are certain supplements that can help you fight against genetic dispositions towards specific diseases. Your doctor will be able to help you decide.For example, if you have a family history of cancer, your doctor might suggest supplements that provide antioxidant or probiotic support, which have been shown to help prevent cancer.

, There are certain people that may need to take supplements based on deficiencies in their food consumption or those with special dietary needs. For example, vegans and vegetarians may miss out on some nutrients because of the foods that they do not eat. If you are a vegan or vegetarian, supplements can be used to help fill these gaps in your diet. You may need more vitamin B12, calcium, omega 3s, protein, and iron.Pregnant women also have special dietary needs. Women who may become pregnant should get folic acid supplement, and women who are pregnant should take an iron supplement.
Those who have other dietary restrictions, such as lactose intolerance, will likely also need supplementation.
If you do not eat the recommended two to three servings of fish a week, you should consider adding a fish oil supplement to provide essential omega 3 fatty acids.Adults over 65, should take a Vitamin D supplement to help keep their bones healthy and reduce the risk of falls.

, Dietary supplements are meant to help improve your health and well being. Even when a supplement claims that it will help something, it doesn’t meant it will cure that issue. Supplements do not have to back their claims with testing (they are outside the jurisdiction of the FDA), so always check with your doctor if you are unsure if a supplement will help.


Instead of expecting the supplements to cure your ailments, use them to help improve your health. That is what they are meant to do., If you are taking some medication, you may want to ask you pharmacist if there are any interactions with your current medications. Pharmacists often have the most up to date information about drug and supplement interactions.


You can also take your supplements to your pharmacist so they can see exactly what ingredients they have in them that might cause an interaction.

This may not seem like a lot, but consuming too many additional calories per day could be bad for your body.If you begin exercising more, you will need to consume more than 500 extra calories. In addition to the extra 500 calories you consume, add the amount of extra calories you are burning off through exercise to determine how many more calories you need to consume daily.
Talk with your doctor or a nutritionist to determine your ideal weight. You can also calculate your ideal weight with a BMI calculator.
Stick with nutritious foods. Even though you need to consume more calories, you should consume those extra calories from foods that are both high in calories and nutritious. If you eat too much junk food, you risk putting on weight in an unhealthy manner and causing additional health problems.;
, Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and enjoy a snack after each meal.


As a general rule, do not let more than four waking hours pass without eating.
Your three main meals should be fairly substantial. Do not decrease your portion size during these meals.
Three or more of your meals and snacks should contain a protein, starch, vegetable, and fat.
As long as you do not decrease the amount you eat during your main meals, adding snacks in between meals is a good way to pack more calories into your day.

, Another school of thought is to skip the snacking and simply increase your portion sizes at each meal. This can be done by adding another course to each meal or by going back for seconds even after you feel satisfied with the amount of food you have already eaten.


The idea here is that, by skipping out on snacks, you will build more of an appetite. As a result, you will be more inclined to scarf down more calories in the form of more food.
Both practices are valid ways to add calories and gain weight quickly. You may need to play around with both techniques to determine which is more effective for you.

, When you eat slow, you give your body the chance to digest your food as you eat, which results in feeling fuller faster. If you eat quickly, you can eat more food before your body has the chance to feel full, making it easier to consume more.

, When you are trying to gain weight, though, the opposite is true. Eating a late dinner or having a snack immediately before you go to bed is a good way to give your body calories that it will not have the opportunity to readily burn off.


Additionally, the body builds more muscle and lean tissue during sleep. Eating a snack before bed supplies your body with the nutrients it needs to build more lean tissue as you sleep.

, If you have a hard time feeling hungry, there are a few things you can do to increase your appetite before mealtime rolls around.


Take a walk before dinner. Exercise can make you feel hungry, so taking a 30 to 60 minute walk before a major meal can encourage you to consume more food naturally. You could also replace the walking with just about any exercise.
If you have a hard time encouraging yourself to eat more at first, prepare more of your favorite comfort foods to get your body used to eating more.
Enhance the flavor of food. Most people are more inclined to eat sweet foods than bland foods, but you could also add spices and herbs to create a more savory taste. Just avoid herbs that are conventionally considered to be appetite suppressants, like mint.
Consume liquids separately from food. Liquids can fill you up fast but do not keep you feeling full for long. Drinking them separately will cause you to feel less full during a meal.

, Within every food group, there are certain foods that are nutritionally healthy yet high in calories. Opt for these options rather than low-calorie foods from the same food group.In the grains group, eat heavy breads like whole wheat and pumpernickel and dense cereals with granola. Bran muffins, bagels, and wheat germ are also good choices.
In the fruit group, consider eating more bananas, pineapples, raisins, dried fruit, and avocados. In general, starchy fruits are preferable to water-rich fruits.
For vegetables, try peas, corn, potatoes, and winter squash. As with fruit, starchy vegetables are better than water-rich vegetables.
Within the dairy group, consider cheese, ice cream, frozen yogurt, and whole milk.
For proteins, consider eating nut butters, nuts, seeds, and hummus.

, Liquids can fill you up, but they are still less filling than solid foods. A good way to gain weight fast is to put on calories by drinking high-calorie drinks in between meals.


Smoothies and milkshakes are ideal, especially those made with 100% fruit juice and low-fat milk.
Juice and milk are also good options, as well as protein shakes.
You can enjoy soda, coffee, and sweet tea on a limited basis, but even though these options will allow you to pack away the calories, the calories are largely empty, making them less than ideal.

, You can stir high-calorie, nutritious foods into your favorite foods to add extra calories without making you feel much fuller.


Stir powdered milk into beverages, soups, stews, and sauces.
Sprinkle nuts over your salad or cereal.
Stir ground flaxseed into salads, cereals, and smoothies.
Sprinkle cheese over your casseroles, soups, scrambled eggs, salads, and sandwiches.

, Protein helps your body build muscle mass. Muscle mass is lean weight, so building more muscle will allow you to gain weight without gaining much fat. Protein is especially important if you plan to use weight/strength training to gain more muscle.


Good sources of protein-rich foods include lean meats, fish, grains, nuts and seeds, eggs, and peanut butter.

, Cooking foods in oil and butter will increase a dish's total number of calories. Note that some fats are healthier than others, and you should still gravitate toward fats that are better for you rather than those that contain almost no nutritional benefit, like lard.


Good fats to cook with include:

Olive oil, which contains 119 calories per 1 Tbsp (15 ml).
Canola oil, which contains 120 calories per 1 Tbsp (15 ml).
Butter, which contains 102 calories per 1 Tbsp (15 ml).



, Aside from other health problems caused by smoking, smoking is bad for you if you need to gain weight because it suppresses your appetite.


If you cannot quit smoking or quit it ""cold turkey,"" you should at least avoid smoking several hours before you eat a major meal.

, As with losing weight, the healthiest ways to gain weight take a little time. You can gain 1 or 2 lbs (450 to 900 g) of weight each week safely, and using the tactics mentioned in this article will allow you to do so, but trying to gain weight any faster than this could pose a health risk.


Look at weight maintenance as a long-term commitment. Once you reach your ideal weight, you should continue with your efforts in order to maintain it.

, More accurately, you should keep a “weight gain” journal. Each day, log how many calories you consumed and how many you burned. Read through your journal entries at the end of each week to determine which tactics have proved most effective for you.


You should also mark down your weight every day or every week, depending on how quickly you want to gain weight. This will provide you with a more accurate picture of how things are working. Make sure to take your weight at the same time of day each day for the sake of consistency.

, Exercise in general is good because it stimulates the appetite. Strength training, in particular, is especially good because it allows you to gain weight by building your muscles.Note that this tactic is, admittedly, not especially ""fast"" unless you are already used to exercising before you begin the process of gaining weight. If you are unaccustomed to exercise, you will need to ease yourself into exercising more, so it may take time to see results. If you already exercise, shift your emphasis to strength training, and you will see results quicker as a result.
Exercise each major muscle group: chest, back, abdominals, biceps, triceps shoulders, quadriceps, and hamstrings. If possible, increase the amount to two or three exercises per group once your body becomes used to the activity.
Eating extra protein is especially important if you plan to build muscle mass through exercise.
Good strength training exercises include squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, bench presses, barbell rows, dips, chin-ups, crunches, bicep curls, leg presses, and leg curls.

, Get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, especially if you plan to eat more protein and do more strength training.Your body builds muscle and lean tissue as you sleep. Getting a full night's sleep will provide your body with enough rest to build sufficient muscle mass.

Don’t ignore signs you’re gaining too fast or training too hard.",How to Gain Weight Fast (for Men)," If you naturally have a really fast metabolism, eating three meals a day, no matter what’s in them, isn’t going to help you bulk up.Your body burns calories fast, so you need to feed it more than it can use up right away. That means eating not just when you’re hungry, but throughout the day. Aim to eat five meals a day to gain weight.


Don’t wait until your stomach starts to growl to eat. Plan out five meals so you never have time to get hungry.
Eating this much can take a lot of effort, since you need to stock up on enough food to feed yourself more often. Pack calorie-rich snacks you can eat on the go, like bananas and peanut butter or dense granola bars.;
, Eating five small, low-calorie meals isn’t going to cut it; they’ve got to be big and rich in calories. Load up on a restaurant-sized meal each time, with big portions of meat, vegetables, and a carbohydrate. Eating this much might not exactly feel comfortable, but it’s the best way to gain weight fast.A large enough breakfast might consist of a three-egg omelet, two slices of bacon or sausage, a cup of roasted breakfast potatoes and a glass of orange juice.
For lunch, try a fully dressed turkey club on whole wheat bread, two bananas, and a salad.
Dinner could be a grilled steak, loaded baked potato and a few cups of grilled veggies.

, To gain healthy weight, eat food that’s nutrient rich and nourishing.While you could easily gain weight by drinking sugary sodas and eating large pizzas every day, this can wreck your metabolism and cause you to gain fat instead of muscle. When you’re choosing food to eat, try the following:


Look for foods that are relatively unprocessed. For example, choose old-fashioned oatmeal instead of instant, and go for fresh chicken as opposed to processed lunch meat.
Cook as many meals from scratch as you can. Avoid getting frozen dinners, fast food and snack foods, which contain a lot of salt, sugar and other fillers that aren’t nutritious.

, These are the three macronutrients that will help you gain weight, and you need plenty of each of them to stay healthy. Focus on incorporating protein, fats and carbohydrates into every meal you eat so your diet stays balanced. Here are some examples of good choices in each category:


Proteins: eggs, salmon, tuna, and other fish; pork roast, pork chops, and ham; chicken breasts and thighs; lean beef burgers and steaks; and bison.
Fats: olive oil, safflower oil, canola oil, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil; avocados, walnuts, almonds, flaxseeds.
Carbohydrates: fruits and vegetables; beans, lentils, peas; brown rice, whole grain bread, whole grain pasta and other whole grain products; and honey.

, Water will help your body process the extra protein and calories you’re taking in. Drink several glasses with every meal to avoid getting dehydrated. Since you’ll be exercising more to gain mass, aim to drink 10 glasses of water every day.


You can also drink unsweetened tea, 4 to 8 ounces of fruit juice, flavored water, and other healthy beverages.
Avoid drinking Gatorade and other sports drinks in excessive amounts, since they contain a lot of sugar.

, Body builders know that the way to get bigger is through weight training. It’s a form of exercise designed to make muscles larger and stronger.You can practice weight training at a gym or get the equipment you need to do it at home. Since this is an integral part of gaining weight, make plans to do it several times a week.


If you don’t want to pay to join a gym, see if you can obtain a barbell and a set of weights so you can work out at home.
You can also try resistance exercises, which work your muscles without using weights. Push-ups are an easy way to get started right away. You can also install a pull up bar in a doorway so you can work out your arms and chest.

, There may be one part of your body you want to bulk up, but you’ll benefit from working all of your muscle groups instead of just one area. Spend equal time working out your arms, back, chest, abdomen, and legs.Rather than working out all of the muscle groups on the same day, rotate between them so each group gets a chance to rest in between sessions.


Plan out your week so you’re able to target each muscle group evenly. For example, you might want to work out your arms and chest one day, focus on your legs and abs the next day, then do your back and chest the third day.
Work with a personal trainer to come up with a schedule and exercise plan that meets your needs.

, Muscle mass is built when you put stress on the fibers in your muscle tissue by pushing them past their everyday limit. This is done by lifting enough weight and doing enough repetitions to make your muscles feel tired and sore, but not so painful that you injure yourself. Find the right weight for any given exercise by figuring out how much you can lift for eight to 10 reps before you have to stop. If you can easily do more than 10 reps, add more weight. If you have to stop after 5, subtract some weight.


Compound exercises are your friend. Concentrate on complex, compound exercises that recruit as many muscles as possible: bench presses, dumbbell presses, squats, deadlifts, pull ups, chin ups, and dips.
It doesn’t matter if you can only bench press 10 lb dumbbells right now. Wherever you’re starting out, concentrate on being stronger each and every time you exercise. Push yourself, get stronger, lift more, and before you know it you’ll be ripped.
When exercising, keep your rest between sets to a minute or less, and don’t do more than 12 reps in a set.

, According to a study carried out at the University of Birmingham, energy shakes will help you improve your endurance while exercising. Have a banana, a handful of dried fruit or a sports energy shake immediately after you work out.You can include shakes at other times during the day as well. For example, you could have a Boost or Ensure meal replacement shake along with your breakfast. Or, you can make yourself a protein smoothie with some whole milk, a banana, and a scoop of protein powder.
Fortifying meals in other ways may also help you to gain weight. For example, you can include high fat, high calorie, or high protein add-ins in your diet, like cheese, whole milk, full-fat sour cream, and avocado.

, Let your muscles rest between exercise sessions. This is an important way to help your muscles get bigger and stronger. Your muscles rebuild during your days off, so never exercise the same muscle before it’s ready, and never exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. Wait at least 48 hours before working the same muscle again.


In addition, it’s important to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night for maximum gains. If you are only getting six hours or less, you’re not going to get all the benefits of your exercising and diet.

, Your body has the ability to adapt quickly, so if you don’t alter your exercise routine occasionally, you will hit a plateau. Once a week, change up your routine. You can increase or decrease the number of reps or sets, or simply change the order in which you normally do your routines.

, When you run, bike, swim, and do other cardio exercises, you’re using up energy that could be instead funneled toward muscle growth.Limit your cardio to 20 to 30 minutes daily when you’re trying to gain weight. You can also choose lower-intensity exercises like walking, hiking or short bike rides in flat areas.

, There’s another method for gaining weight fast: eating whatever you want and moving as little as possible. However, gaining weight this way isn’t likely to give you the appearance you want, and it will make your body weaker instead of stronger. Putting in the hard work to gain weight by building muscle will result in improved healthy and a built appearance.

, In your eagerness to gain weight as soon as possible, you might be putting a lot of stress on your body. You shouldn’t feel exhausted and sore all the time. In fact, your improved diet and workout routine should help you feel more virile than ever before. If your body seems to be telling you that something’s wrong, listen to it.


Consider hiring a personal trainer. Within a few sessions, you'll have a great idea of scheduling, form, intensity, and duration of workouts and excellent insight into tweaking your diet.
Ask your physician before taking any supplements, and see a doctor right away if you experience an injury during a workout.

Buy natural supplements.,
Consider the different forms of the same supplement.,
Determine how much of the supplement you are getting.,
Pick the right form.,
Buy from reputable manufacturers.",How to Determine if You Should Use Dietary Supplements2," When at all possible, you should buy the natural or non-synthetic versions of supplements. There are some synthetic version of supplements, but, unless your doctor specifically tells you otherwise, buy the natural versions. This is because the natural versions are closer to what your body expects from the supplements.


For example, there are some vitamins derived from whole foods, which may have greater benefit for you.
These can often be a little more expensive, which may make these harder for you to buy., There are some supplements that may take different forms. While they are all the same mineral or supplement, they have different concentrations and some will be absorbed better than others. This means that you will have to take more of one than the other.


For example, magnesium comes as magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide. Magnesium citrate is more expensive, but it also has better absorption. This means you have to take fewer doses. On the other hand, magnesium oxide is less expensive, but you have to take more of it to get the same effect.

, Nutrition labels can be hard to understand, especially because of the small print. On the supplement label, you can determine how much of the supplement you are getting. Look for labels that tell you if the supplement is elemental or part of a composite pill. When the label says elemental, this is the exact amount of the supplement you are getting.For example, if the label reads ""10 mg of elemental Magnesium,"" this means you are getting 10 mg of the magnesium. If it reads ""10mg of Magnesium citrate,"" you will actually be getting less than that because the citrate in the dose takes away from the amount of magnesium.

, Supplements are produced as powders, tablets, capsules, or liquids. There are some that are better absorbed as a specific form. Ask your doctor which form is best for the supplements you are taking. There are no right or wrong forms of the supplements, so it will depend on your situation.

For example, B vitamins are often better absorbed in liquid form; however, the most common forms of B vitamins are tablets and capsules.
You may also make your decision based on what is easiest for you to swallow. If you have a hard time swallowing pills, you may want to take the liquid form.

, Your should make sure you buy your supplements from reputable manufacturers. One good way to know a reputable supplement is if they offer them up for testing. Reputable manufacturers also buy and use the best raw materials and invest in having their products tested for quality and purity. Organic supplements are typically high quality as well.Look on the label for seals of approval from reliable labs, such as Consumer Labs, Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).
Just because they haven’t been tested, it doesn’t mean that the supplements are bad. You can always ask your doctor if you are unsure of certain manufacturers.
Be wary of online ads for miracle minerals or supplements. These types of supplements are likely not regulated by the FDA, which means their ingredients are not regulated. As mentioned, supplements do not cure anything, so these claims are unfounded.
You can also check out the manufacturer’s websites and call them to find out about their quality controls. The better companies should have consumer information freely available."
"
Take the right doses.,
Follow the recommended dietary allowances (RDA).,
Recognize any side effects.",How to Determine if You Should Use Dietary Supplements3," The specific doses you need to take will vary depending on which supplement you take. Always read the label to know exactly how much of each supplement you should take each day. Although supplements are good for you, you can actually overdose on them.You can also ask your doctor how much of each to take if you are unsure.

, Just like medications, supplements have recommended dietary allowances (RDA). The RDA of supplements will vary based on your age, gender, and particular situation. These will be different based on each supplement as well.


Know that many daily values (DV) will exceed the RDA. Your RDA is the minimum required for you to take each day to get the benefits of the supplement.

, Some supplements can cause toxicity if you take too many of them. Water-soluble vitamins, such as the B vitamins, generally do not cause problems because they are flushed out when you urinate. There are others that can cause problems. These include:


Iron, which can cause constipation and rarely, more serious conditions such as hemochromatosis
Fat-soluble vitamins, such as Vitamins D, E and A, which can cause toxicity over time because they are stored in body fat and are released over time."

If you have a preexisting condition like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, your doctor may advise against gaining weight. Always take your doctor's advice seriously before making this kind of change.


Certain medical conditions will require you to keep your weight up. Thyroid problems, digestive health issues, diabetes, and cancers may all lead to severe weight loss that may endanger your health. Being underweight can lead to health risks like a weakened immune system, anemia, hair loss, and decreased bone density.Very high physical activity can also cause you to be underweight. If you're an athlete, gaining some fat may be good for you because it can increase your energy levels and allow you to workout for longer periods.;
, You'll need a clear plan as you proceed with your weight-gain plan. How much do you want to gain? By when? By figuring this out and drawing up a schedule, you'll be able to gain weight more effectively.


Start by figuring out how much weight you want to gain. This can either be a personal goal, or one you've worked out with your doctor or dietitian. Either way, you need a concrete number in mind to start your progress.
Remember, the basic way the body gains weight is when you take in more calories than you burn. So when drawing up your plan, you should figure out how much you need to eat every day to offset the amount of calories you burn. There are various ways to calculate this.Try this link for a tool to estimate your daily calorie burn: http://www.caloriecount.com/tools/calories-burned

Read Set Meaningful Goals for more advice on how to set and stick to a goal.

, Flooding your body with hundreds of more calories than it's used to is dangerous for your heart, blood pressure, digestion, and other body systems. Work your way up gradually to acclimate your body to the increased caloric intake. Start off with 300 extra calories a day for a week or so, then increase to 600, and so on. This will help you avoid an initial shock when you start your weight-gain regimen.Break your weight-gain down into stages. Determine how much you would like to gain per week or month. That way, you can ease your body into the weight increase instead of starting off too quickly.
Just like with losing weight, gaining weight should come gradually. Gaining about 1/2 to 1 pound per week is a healthy way to go (done by adding 250 to 500 more calories to your daily intake)., You'll have to eat much more in order to gain weight. Focus on nutrient and calorie dense foods instead of junk food. There are plenty of foods that will help you gain weight and also contain all of the nutrients you need to stay healthy.


Plan on eating more than three meals a day. Increase your meals to five or more per day, which may include snacks throughout the day.Make sure all your meals have a good balance. Each meal should contain carbohydrates, protein, and unsaturated fats. These three nutrients will help most with your weight gain.Eating more often and including healthy foods in your diet will get expensive. It would also be helpful if you drew up a new budget to go along with your new diet.

, In addition to gaining fat, gaining muscle may also lead to a weight increase. Starting a strength-training regimen will put all of those nutrients you've been eating to good use. Gaining muscle will help make sure you keep up your strength and overall health while you gain fat., Of course you'll need fat to increase your body weight, but not all fats are the same. Saturated and trans fats will help you gain weight, but they'll also increase your cholesterol and your risk of heart disease. Unsaturated fats, however, help reduce your risk of heart disease and boost your immune system. Make sure every meal you have includes some fat.When gaining weight, you'll want to focus on these ""good fats"" to help beef up your body fat while still getting necessary nutrients that your body needs.Nuts, peanut butter, fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, and avocados are all high in unsaturated fats and calories and will still provide you with essential nutrients. Include these in your meals or snack on them throughout the day.

, Carbohydrates act as energy sources for the body. If you don't burn off the energy, it will be stored as fat and help you gain weight. After fat, carbs are important contributors to weight gain, so you'll need plenty of these in your diet.You should focus on whole wheat products for your carbs instead of white products. White products are bleached and processed, which removes most essential nutrients. Whole wheat products will give you the carbs, plus fiber, vitamins, and essential minerals.Replace white products with whole wheat bread, pasta, and brown rice. Include carbs in all your meals to help in your weight gain.

, Dairy is important for your diet because it contains calcium and vitamins. Most dairy products come in reduced-fat varieties, but you'll want the full-fat versions to increase your calorie and fat intake. Drink whole milk and eat cheese and yogurts made from whole milk.


Replace sugary sodas (which have no vitamins or nutritional value) with a glass of whole milk to increase your fat intake while nourishing your body.Keep in mind that these types are higher in saturated fats. There is, however, some evidence that full-fat dairy products actually decrease the risk of heart disease., The protein and fats you get from meats are important for gaining weight. Be cautious with red meat, however. Studies conclude that excessive intake of red meat can lead to cardiovascular disease and several kinds of cancer.Stick to about three to five servings a week to stay healthy.The rest of the time, eat poultry for proteins and unsaturated fats.

, You can continue eating many of the foods you normally do, but make them help your weight gain by adding a few ingredients. Some healthy and effective options include:Add hard boiled eggs to salads.
Add cheese to sandwiches, eggs, and salads.
Add sauces and gravies to meats.

, Just because you're trying to gain fat doesn't mean you should binge on junk food all day. You need to focus on high-calorie, high-fat foods that provide vitamins and nutrients. Processed sugar contains no nutritional value and can lead to diabetes, heart disease, rotten teeth, hormone issues, and other health problems.Cut out as much sugary food as you can. Candy, cake, cookies, and any other dessert foods are packed with sugar.
Cut down on or avoid soft drinks altogether. A can of soda contains more sugar than your average dessert.

, When you sleep, your body requires less calories. Food you eat before sleeping is more likely to be stored as fat. Take advantage of this by eating a heavy snack before bed,if combined with strength training exercises or take an afternoon nap after lunch., Fluids fill the stomach and can make you feel full prematurely. To avoid this outcome, avoid drinking anything for a half hour before your meals. This will ensure that your stomach is empty and you'll be able to eat the entire meal., Just because you're trying to gain weight doesn't mean you can't still exercise. In fact, it's very unhealthy to stop moving altogether and become sedentary.Lifting weights can hurt your fat gain if done improperly. Resistance training boosts your metabolism, which will burn more calories. Flood your body with calories after a workout to cancel out the burn and keep your weight gain up.Also stretch regularly. Lack of activity will make your muscles tense up and you risk losing mobility. Make sure to stretch your legs, arms, hips, and back daily to keep your body in good working order.

, In addition to eating more, you can also increase your body mass with protein shakes and powder. A variety of products will provide a protein boost that will help increase your weight and muscle mass if combined with strength training exercises. Remember to use all products as directed.Whey protein powder is a popular supplement that you can add to several types of drinks. You can blend up a smoothie using fruit, yogurt, and a few scoops of protein powder.
There are also a variety of protein drinks and bars you can purchase. Snack on these throughout the day to give yourself extra calories.
Read all labels when buying these products. Many are packed with added sugar, which can be harmful. Opt for products low in added sugar.

Try cheese and crackers, or dried fruit and full fat yogurt. Hummus is great on bread or vegetables, and with plenty of tahini and olive oil it can help you up your calories. Olives and cheese are great when you want something really savory.Keep spreads such as guacamole, tapenade, pesto, and hummus in your fridge for easy snacking.
Carry nut-bars to fill your cravings when you're out and about.;
, Drinking water is good for you, but it can blunt your appetite. If you find yourself filling up on liquids during meals, try to make those liquids count. Drink milk, smoothies, and shakes.Go for full fat milk rather than skim.Put peanut butter or protein powder in your smoothies and shakes.
Plant-based milks like coconut milk and peanut milk are fattening and delicious.
Try traditional nutritious drinks from around the world. Kefir, horchata, chia fresca, lassi, misugaru, and telba are all high in calories and proteins.
Drink water and low-calorie beverages after you have eaten.

, Protein is essential for weight gain. Red meat can help you gain weight, especially if you are working on building muscle. Salmon is high in calories and healthy fats. Yogurt is high in protein.Other oily fish can also help you gain weight. Keep canned sardines and tuna in your pantry.
Beans are a great source of proteins and of starch.
If you are struggling to include enough protein, you can use a supplement such as whey protein.

, Instead of filling up on celery and other watery vegetables, eat vegetables with some calories. Avocados have healthy fat and are a versatile ingredient. Starchy vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, and corn can help you gain weight as well. Fruits like bananas, blueberries, grapes, and mangoes can give you calories and fiber.

, Whole grain breads, pastas, and crackers have more nutrients and more calories than processed grains. Enjoy your bread with butter, olive oil, peanut butter, avocado, or a drizzle of tahini and honey., While you shouldn't rely on sugary food, the occasional sweet snack is fine. Don't worry about occasionally indulging in cake or ice cream. If you crave dessert every night, try for small portions and healthier options: dark chocolate, whole fat yogurt with fruit and granola, trail mix, granola bars, or whole grain pastries., When you are preparing food, think of a way to bump up the calorie count. Could your sandwich use a slice of cheese? How about poaching an egg in your reheated soup? Drizzle olive oil on your vegetables, or sprinkle seeds, nuts, or cheese on your salad., If you are underweight, you may fill up quickly. To remedy this, eat more meals. Try to fit 5-6 smaller meals into your day, rather than relying on three. Eat snacks in between.Eat one meal or snack right before bed. Eating before sleeping can help you gain weight.

, Muscle weighs more than fat, so you'll gain weight as you build muscle. Get some strength training exercise at least twice a week. You can strength train at home by doing crunches, lunges, and squats. Lift weights, exercise with kettle bells and medicine balls, or use tubes.If you belong to a gym, you can train on the weight machines.
Sign up for a Pilates class.
Take a class or watch an exercise video before embarking on a new form of exercise.
Remember, stop if you are in pain. If something hurts, you are at risk of injury.

, Regular aerobic activity won't pack on the muscle as quickly as strength-training, but it will help you balance your workout routine. Cardiovascular exercises strengthen your heart, improve or manage some chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, and give you more stamina throughout the day.Cardio exercises can include: jogging or walking, biking, swimming or hiking.
If you're performing aerobic exercises and are having trouble maintaining your weight, you may need to decrease the intensity, frequency, or duration of your aerobic exercises.

, Carbohydrates will help your stamina before you work out, while carbohydrates and protein together will help your muscles heal after you work out.Get a small meal or a snack in at least an hour before exercising.
If you have eaten a large meal, wait three to four hours before you exercise.
Good post-exercise snacks might include peanut butter sandwiches, yogurt and fruit, chocolate milk and crackers, or a smoothie with milk, yogurt, or whey protein.

, If you're having trouble finding a workout routine that works for you, a personal trainer can get you on track. They'll be able to guide you through specific exercises or routines that can help you add weight.


Check at a local gym for a trainer. Many times you can see a trainer there and they may even offer a discounted consult for your first visit.
Talk to your trainer about your weight and goals. Tell them you're interested in healthy weight gain.

, Quick weight gain is neither healthy nor practical. If you are eating so much you feel uncomfortable, you might be doing other harm to your body. Avoid binging: stop eating when you feel full. If you're worried you didn't eat enough, make it up with a small snack later.Set your weight gain goal in cooperation with your physician, dietitian, or personal trainer.
You can realistically gain 1 to 2 pounds of muscle weight per month if you are committed to your weight gain and work out regimen. You may gain more per month, but it will be a mix of muscle and fat. Healthy weight gain is about 1 to 2 pounds per week.
If you’re not a weight lifter, you can gain about 2-4 pounds of both muscle and fat weight a month., While increasing your calorie intake would be a lot easier if you just ate fast food every meal, your health would suffer in every other way. Instead, focus on preparing your own food if you have the time. If you hate cooking or are too busy, find healthy ways to eat out. Stores that list all the ingredients of your meal, like sandwich shops and smoothie shops, are a good bet.


If you would like to make your own food but are always busy during the week, try to make a lot of food over the weekend. You can freeze half of what you make if you're worried about it going bad.
As a rule, avoid fried food, sugary snacks, soda, and candy.

, If you are having unintended weight loss, talk to your doctor. It's possible that there's an underlying problem causing you to lose weight. Your doctor can check your thyroid and see if you have a hormonal imbalance. If your doctor can't help you, visit a dietitian for advice."

Grains are especially good if you're an athlete and need a good amount of fast-acting energy; grains, along with other carbohydrates like fruits, should make up half your diet.When choosing grains, stick with healthy whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, quinoa, barley, corn, bulgur, millet, buckwheat, brown rice, and wild rice.You can also eat cereals that are especially grainy and calorie-dense, such as granola or raisin bran.;
, Protein is also an important part of increasing your weight. However, you should still choose lean proteins even if you're trying to gain weight, as the saturated fat in fattier cuts of meat (think steak) can be unhealthy, particularly if you're eating them in high quantities.Enjoy lean proteins like skim milk, egg whites, fish, poultry, nuts, beans, and tofu. Of course, you can splurge on fattier cuts of meat at times, but try not to eat them as often.
If you're trying to gain weight for medical reasons rather than for athletic reasons, you may opt for fattier cuts more often as they are much higher in calories. You could also eat whole eggs and whole milk instead of the lower-fat versions.

, Fats are an easy way to increase your caloric intake, as they are more nutrient dense than protein or carbohydrates. However, it's best to stick with healthier fats, such as unsaturated fats. For instance, add more olive oil, nuts, seeds, nut butters, and avocado to your diet.Try cooking with healthy oils, adding them to salad dressings, or even adding them to random dishes you won't notice, such as mashed potatoes.
Other fats, like butter, lard, animal fat, and whole-fat dairy are high in calories, and they can help you gain weight. However, they can cause damage to your health when you eat too many. Unsaturated fats are equally high in calories, and less likely to cause damage to your health. Keep saturated fats to no more than 10% of your total calories (200 calories per day for a 2,000 calorie diet)., While vegetables aren't as nutrient-dense as other foods, including fruits, you still need to make them a part of your diet. They provide important vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber to your diet.You definitely need a wide variety of vegetables, including leafy greens. However, for weight gain, you can also focus in on more nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits, such as potatoes, corn, carrots, peas, butternut squash, acorn squash, avocado, bananas, pineapples, mangoes, and almost any dried fruit., Another way to get more healthy calories in is to drink them instead of eating them. That doesn't mean you should simply reach for soda or juice, though you might if you are just looking to add calories to your diet. Rather, try making green smoothies that are dense in fruits, vegetables, nut butters, and yogurt. Low-fat milk such as skim or 1% milk are good drink options. To add extra calories to smoothies, use 2% or whole milk.The basic proportions for a green smoothie are 1 cup of dark leafy greens (spinach, kale, romaine, collard greens, etc.), 1 cup of liquid (milk, almond milk, water, coconut milk, etc.), and 1 1/2 cups of fruit (pretty much any combination you want).
For extra calories, add nut butters, flax seed, chia seeds, or yogurt. You can also add protein powder or powdered milk.You can also try adding an Ensure or Boost to your daily diet to help add some calories and nutrition.

, It's always best to discuss your options with a dietitian, as everyone's dietary needs differ. A dietitian can help you decide what the best plan is for you when you're trying to gain weight. Sometimes, dietitians are covered by your insurance plan if you need to gain weight for a medical reason.

, Every time you can, try adding additions to your meal to make them heavier in calories. For instance, try topping foods with eggs, cheese, sour cream, or avocado. You can also use dried milk to bulk up foods like yogurt or soup.Things like flaxseed and wheat germ are also weighty additions. Both of these additives are healthy and high in calories. Add them to yogurt, cereal, or really any kind of food you want.Nuts are also a good option to sprinkle on top of foods like cereals and yogurts., When snacking, pick things that are high in (healthy) calories, such as peanut butter, nuts, or cheese.You can also try trail mix, particularly ones that have granola, nuts, and lots of dried fruit.Hummus can also make a healthy, delicious snack.


For instance, try hummus with tortilla chips or an apple with peanut butter and a glass of milk. You can also add a slice of cheese to either snack.

, Another way to increase calories is to replace skim or even whole milk in recipes with something more calorie-dense. For instance, you could substitute half and half, heavy cream, or even cream cheese in some cases, though it depends on the recipe. You can add calories without even noticing.


This option works really well in foods like creamy soups, casseroles, and mashed potatoes. However, be aware that both cream and half and half can thicken up a recipe quite a bit. Try using 1/2 of what the recipe calls for and 1/2 of a heavier product.

, If you're trying to bulk up, you need to skip foods that fill you up on fewer calories, as you need more calories for weight gain. That means not eating things like air-popped popcorn, broth-based soup for dinner, and even large amounts of less-nutrient dense vegetables, like raw spinach.However, you can blend spinach into smoothies or saute it down to make it more compact.

, Another way to add more calories is to include some treats. Of course, you don't want to only eat chocolate cake and ice cream, but adding in some treats helps add some calories. For instance, try zucchini, pumpkin, or banana bread. Frozen yogurt is also a good option. You can even throw in some oatmeal raisin cookies.One way to make these healthier options is to bake the breads with whole wheat flour and cut back a bit on the sugar.
Another dessert you could try is a milkshake with peanut butter, as it's high in protein.

, If you drink water or even eat a brothy soup before your meal, it can fill you up, leaving less room for the calories you're trying to consume. Wait to drink water until you start eating. You can even drink your water after your meal to help cut down on this problem., Of course, this step may be easier said than done, but just increasing how much you eat every time you sit down to eat can help you gain weight.You may have trouble with feeling too full at first, but your stomach will stretch over time, allowing you to eat more.


One way to help increase your portion sizes is to purchase bigger plates. You'll have a tendency to put more on them without even thinking about it., You may have a hard time eating more at each meal, but another option is to simply to eat more often than you normally do. Eat six meals a day to increase your caloric intake overall for the day. Just be sure you're actually taking in more food, not just eating the same amount spread out over the day., If you like to workout, make sure you are eating something afterwards every single time. Your body needs the calories to help with the recovery process, and it will start sucking them from other places in your body if you don't give it food. Any healthy snack will do, just be sure to include some protein."

Incorporating the stair master as a form of cardio can help increase the size of your hips.Studies have shown that the stair master recruits about 24% of your glutes and hip muscles.
Use the stair master 1-2 times a week for at least 30 minutes per session.
To make this exercise more challenging and target your hips and butt, lean forward when stepping and do not hold onto the side rails. This forces your body to use your butt muscles more significantly.
Also take large steps - almost as if you were taking two at a time. This actives a large portion of those muscles.;
, Another cardio machine that can help tone your butt, hips and increase the size of your hips is the elliptical. It gives you the opportunity to really work those muscles.


The elliptical machine recruits about 36% of your butt and hip muscles. This is slightly more than the stair master.
Use the elliptical for at least 30 minutes. However, to get a well rounded workout, try doing 15 minutes of the stair master plus 15 minutes on the elliptical.
To help target your hip and butt muscles, really focus on pressing down your foot, heel first. Also ease your hips backwards a bit, so that your butt is popping out a bit. This position helps specifically target those muscles.

, Running is a great cardio exercise. In general, it's a great way to target your butt and hips. However, using a treadmill allows you to use the incline function making this machine a great way to increase your hip size.Walking or jogging on the treadmill recruits the highest amount of your hip and butt muscles - almost 50%.
Walk or jog on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes. Again, doing a combination of multiple cardio exercises can help work your butt and hips in different ways giving a better overall workout.
To really target those hips, increase the incline on your treadmill. This places more stress on your glutes and hips and also give your bottom half more definition.
Another option is to walk sideways on a treadmill. Set the treadmill on an incline and start at a slow pace. Cross your legs over one another to walk sideways. This will give your hips the tension they need to induce muscle growth.

, If you want to burn a lot of calories while toning your hips, consider taking a spin class. It's a great exercise to help strengthen and tone your hips, butt and thighs.Spin classes recruit many of the muscles around your hip and butt. The up and down positioning and varying resistances help make this a great exercise to increase your hip size.
To help really target those hips, sit farther back on the bike seat and really focus on pushing down hard on those pedals. You may even want to increase the resistance.
If you're in a standing position on your bike, really stick your butt out far behind you. This position is another one that will require you to stabilize your body with your butt and hip muscles.

, Your exercise plan should include at least one day of rest per week, to prevent plateaus and give your body time to recover. Mix up your workouts and their intensity to keep yourself motivated.

, There are a variety of strength training exercises that can help build mass and define both your butt and hips. The bridge exercise or butt lift is a great exercise to include that will recruit both your butt and hip muscles.Lay down on your back to start this exercise. Keep arms flat on the floor beside you and bend your knees into a 90 degree angle. Your feet should be flat on the floor.
With your knees bent, press your pelvis up in the air pushing upwards with your glutes. Stop when your back is in a straight line.
Hold this position for as long as you can. Slowly lower your butt back down to the ground and repeat this exercise a few more times.

, Squats are a classic exercise that can help tone your entire lower body. However, squats specifically recruit your glutes and hip muscles. Plus, with a few variations, you can really hone in on your hips.Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and toes facing out at a 45 degree angle from your body.
Squat deeply with your knees, keeping your back straight. Dip down until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor. Your butt should be pushed back out behind you.
Hold your squat here for a few seconds and then push yourself back up to the standing position. Try to push using your glute muscles.
To make squats more challenging, hold two dumbbells (one in each hand) or hold a barbell over your shoulders.
To target your hips even more, add a side leg raise. When you come back up to your standing position, extend one leg straight out to the side. Alternate sides with each squat.

, Like squats, lunges are a classic move that target your butt and hips. The need to help you balance and be stable really requires strength from your hips.Stand up straight with your feet about hip width apart. While holding weights, step forward with your right leg about 3-4 feet.
Dip down so that your right knee bends forward and your left leg knee drops to the floor. Lower down until your right thigh is parallel to the floor.
Push back up to the starting position. Make sure to push back up with your right leg - not your left leg. Repeat on the other side and do about 8 lunges per side.
A variation of lunges that can help target the hips in a different way are side lunges. Instead of stepping forward, step outwards to the side. Alternate between both legs.

, One particular exercise that really targets your hip muscles are side leg raises. Incorporate this exercise in addition to lunges, squats and bridges.Lay down on the floor your right side. Place your right arm so that your hand cradles your head and your upper arm is flat on the ground. Your left hand can rest on your hip or the ground in front of you.
While tightening your abdominal muscles, slowly lift your left leg up into the air. Keep your leg perfectly straight and your toes flexed.
Lift your leg as high as you can comfortably. Hold your leg in this position for a few seconds and then slowly lower back down.
Repeat this move 8-10 times on the right leg. Then, roll over and repeat the same exercise on the right side.

, In order to gain an inch on your hips, you will need to eat a little more. You need extra calories to help give your body the fuel it needs to increase the size of your hips.


Just like with weight loss, you cannot spot treat with weight gain. You will need to gain weight safely and slowly over your whole body to see your hips increase in size.You can do this by adding about 250-500 calories to your typical daily intake.For example, if you currently eat 1,800 calories per day, try increasing your daily caloric intake to 2,050 - 2,300.
Try using a food journal or journaling app on your smart phone to calculate your current calorie intake. That way, you'll know what level to aim to gain weight.

, In order to increase your total calorie intake, you'll need to increase how much you're eating. You can increase your portion size or eat more frequently throughout the day.


One of the easiest and more simple ways to gain weight, is by eating more frequently throughout the day.Try adding in a 4th small meal or adding 1-2 snacks a day in addition to your typical 3 meals per day.
Eating more frequently can help prevent you from getting overly full from larger meals and keep you feeling energetic throughout the day.

, Another factor you'll need to focus on is the types of foods you eat. You need to add in foods that are higher in calorie so that those extra meals or snacks add up to be the needed 250-500 calories per day.Calorie-dense foods will help you meet a higher calorie target a little more easily. For example, adding in a small salad as a fourth meal will only add about 100 calories or less.
Instead, focus on foods like that are higher in calories. Foods that are higher in protein and healthy fats are a good place to start. Try: nuts, avocados, dairy products, eggs and fatty fish.
For example, you can add healthy calories with snacks like: peanut butter and an apple, 2 hard boiled eggs, trail mix, or full fat greek yogurt with nuts.
Avoid adding calories with unhealthy foods like sweets, fried foods, fast food and junk food.

, While increasing your calories, you should also focus on making sure your diet is protein-rich. This is essential as protein is an important nutrient for muscle synthesis and energy.To ensure you're getting in an adequate amount of protein everyday, include 1-2 servings of protein per meal.
Each serving should be measured for accuracy. Measure out about a 1/2 cup or a 3-4 oz portion per serving.Try foods like: poultry, beef, pork, dairy products, eggs, nuts, beans, tofu and seafood.
While eating a protein-rich diet is important, still eat a wide variety of other foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

Toning your arms is a great way to increase their size. There are many effective exercises that will target your arm muscles. Your triceps should be a main focus.Learn to do a triangle push-up. The triangle differs from a traditional push-up because your hands are directly under your chest, instead of spread out. Form a triangle with your two hands by touching the tips of your index fingers together. Extend your thumbs and touch the points of your thumbs together. Lower yourself almost to the ground and back-up.
As with traditional push-ups, utilize your core to stabilize your body. You'll get bonus ab work while you work your triceps. You can do these push-ups from your knees in the beginning and work up to a full plank.
If you are working from your knees, try to begin with 10 reps. Gradually build to 2-3 sets. If you are working from plank, start by trying to complete 5 reps. Gradually build to 2-3 sets.
Tricep kick-backs are also very effective. To perform kick-backs, hold your arm at a 90-degree angle at your side. Extend your arm back, straightening it. You can use light weights while performing this move.
Do 12 reps, then switch sides. By building muscles in your triceps, your arms will appear more toned and shapely.;
, In order to increase the size of your arms, you need to target several different muscles. Familiarize yourself with each of the different arm muscles. In addition to the triceps, which are the back of your arms, your biceps are very important--they are just above your inner elbow. Curls are one of the most effective ways to target your biceps. Simply curl your arms up towards your shoulders, then extend. Using heavier weights will build larger muscles. Light weights will tone and lengthen your arm muscles.
Begin with 12 reps on each side. Building bicep muscles will increase the overall size of your arms.
Make sure to avoid momentum. This means that you should not swing your arms while doing curls. Instead, go slowly and focus on resisting the motion on the way up and down., To effectively shape your arms, you will also need to target your shoulder muscles. Try doing presses. Hold your arms at 90-degree angles out from your shoulders, in front of you. Your feet should be shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.Then press one arm up, holding a weight. Alternate arms.Breathe out as you raise your arm, and inhale as you lower it, focusing on keeping your elbows in near your body.
Begin by doing 8-12 reps on each side. You can start out with light weights, such as 5 lbs., and work your way up. Creating larger shoulder muscles will up your arms appear larger and more defined.

, If it seems overwhelming to try to learn about how to target specific muscle groups, you should consider working with a personal trainer.

If you are not interested in one on one training, try a small group session. These are always a less expensive option.

, Whether you choose to work with a trainer or on your own, consistency is key to gaining weight in your arms. You should plan to do strength training 2 to 4 times a week. If you are lifting heavy weights, your sessions should be less frequent than if you are doing lighter lifting.Your muscles need time to rebuild, so try to take a rest day between strength training sessions.
The amount of weight you lift depends on your size and fitness level. It also depends on your goals and what results you are looking for. If you belong to a gym, ask one of the staff members to make some recommendations for your particular body type.

Don't use it as an excuse to fill up on calorie heavy items such as fried foods and sweets. You won't see the type of results that you want, and you'll risk health issues.Try to increase your calorie count by eating healthy foods. Eat starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas. These have higher calorie counts than other vegetables, but are still full of nutrients.
Add more fat to your diet. Fat contains nine calories per gram. You can add olive oil, butter, or coconut oil to your meals to add more fat to them. Olive oil in particular is a healthy fat. It contains about 120 calories per serving. Try stirring some into whatever you're eating--oatmeal, soup, salad dressing--to boost your calorie intake for that meal.
Read labels. Avoid items that are ""low fat"", ""light"", or ""diet"". For example, eat regular cottage cheese rather than the light version.

, When you're trying to gain weight, it can be difficult to get all of the calories that you need from just three daily meals. Try eating five mini-meals throughout the day. Depending on your food choices, you may end up consuming more calories.Add in healthy snacks. Look for foods that are high calorie, but low volume. Nuts are a great option, as they contain lots of fiber and protein. Try keeping a bag of almonds on hand.
Try adding snacks that also contain healthy fats and carbohydrates. Hummus and multi-grain crackers is a tasty one to try.

, Eating five meals a day, plus snacks, can add up to a lot of food. Smoothies are a good alternative for when you need a change. Make your smoothies with whole milk or yogurt and some fresh fruit. You can also add in some flax seed or protein powder to get extra nutrients.Try adding some spinach to your smoothies. It's a great way to sneak some more vegetables and nutrients into your diet.

Stay positive.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Reward yourself.",How to Gain Fat on the Arms3," When you are struggling to make healthy changes to your body, it can be frustrating if you don't see fast results. Try to keep a positive attitude and don't give up. Doctors say that there actually is power in positive thinking. Keep your head up and keep trying. You will eventually achieve the results you want.Research indicates that positive thinking leads to lower stress levels. Lower stress levels mean you'll have more energy to focus on your strength training.

, When you are trying to gain weight in your arms, it can be easy to let that be your entire focus. It's often easier to focus on what you don't like, instead of what you do like. Try taking a minute every day to compliment yourself. Choose one thing each day that you like about yourself and focus on that. If you recently delivered an excellent presentation at work, remind yourself that you are a hard worker.
Try taping a positive affirmation to your bathroom mirror. It can say something like, ""You have a great smile. Don't forget to use it.""

, When you are doing any sort of diet, whether it is to gain or lose weight, it can be useful to set mini-goals for yourself. For example, make it a point to add 200 calories to your diet each day. Once you've successfully done that, give yourself a reward.One idea is to award yourself an hour of guilt-free ""me"" time. Indulge in a bad TV show or trashy magazine. And don't feel bad about it for one minute.
Indulge yourself by getting a massage after you've stuck to your workout routine for a month. Your muscles have earned it!

, If you want to gain weight, you will need to consume more calories each day. Slow, gradual weight gain is the safest and healthiest method of increasing your body weight.


In general, health experts recommend consuming an extra 250-500 calories daily for safe weight gain. This results in about a 1/2 to 1 pound weight gain each week.
The exact number of calories you'll need to eat each day can vary depending on how underweight you are, your age, your gender, and your overall health. Work with a doctor or nutritionist to determine the exact number you should be striving for.
Look for calorie-dense foods, rather than trying to eat a lot of food that may not contain as many calories. For example, an ounce of nuts has between 160-190 calories, whereas an ounce of pretzels may have just 100 calories., Even though you need more calories to gain weight, you also need to make sure that the foods you eat contain nutrients that will keep the rest of your body functioning well.Higher calorie foods are good, but empty calories from foods low in nutrients are still not healthy when consumed in excess.Avoid eating multiple servings of or large quantities of foods like sweets or desserts, beverages with added sugars, fried foods, fast food or processed meats.
The occasional greasy or sugary food may help you gain weight and can usually be consumed as a treat, but you should not rely on these foods since they have little nutritional value.

, Fat has more calories per gram than either protein or carbohydrates. Increasing the amount of healthy fat in your day can increase your total calories and help you gain weight.


Healthy fats are a great option to add extra calories. Try healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, olive oil, and fatty fish.
In addition to helping increase your overall caloric intake, they've also been shown to support a healthy heart., Protein is an essential nutrient in any diet. However, if you need to gain weight or are struggling to keep weight on, ensuring you're consuming adequate protein is essential.


Protein helps support your metabolism and your lean muscle mass. When you're underweight or losing weight, you may be losing some lean muscle mass. Eating adequate protein can help minimize this.Try to consume at least 3-4 ounces of lean protein at each meal. This will help make sure you're meeting your recommended daily amount.Choose both lean protein and protein foods that have a moderate amount of fat. For example, choose full-fat dairy, eggs, fatty fish or dark meat of poultry items.
Do not consume fried or fatty cuts of meat or processed meats. These generally have more health risks associated with them and it's not worth the extra calories you'd be consuming from them.
Protein increases your feeling of satiety, or that satisfied ""full"" feeling.If your goal is to eat more food, rather than just increase your calories, be aware that increasing your protein intake may make you feel less hungry.

, Although grains do not contain a lot of calories, they're still essential to a healthy diet.


Try to choose whole grains. These grains contain the bran or hull, germ and endosperm parts of the grain.Whole grains can add calories while providing plenty of fiber and other health benefits.
Try whole grains like barley, quinoa, brown rice, oats and 100% wheat bread and pasta.
Add higher-calorie items to your whole grains to increase the calories. For example, top your brown rice with a drizzle of olive oil or put a dollop of peanut butter in your oatmeal.

, Both of these food groups do not offer you a lot of calories. However, they do contain a large variety of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are essential to your diet.


It's recommended to consume about 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. You may choose to eat fewer servings so you can focus on other higher calorie foods.One serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of salad greens.Aim for 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or 1 small piece for one serving of fruit.Again, try to increase the calories of these foods by adding higher calories foods to them. For example, drizzle olive oil over steamed vegetables or add a full fat dressing to salads.

, Another good way to eat more and gain weight is to eat more snacks and frequent meals. Eating frequently may actually make you feel hungrier.


This is especially helpful if you have little to no appetite, since it may be easier for you to consume smaller portions of food than larger ones.
Schedule anywhere from 2-3 snack throughout the day, in addition to your three major meals.
Three to six of your meals and snacks should contain a protein, starch, vegetable, and healthy fat to maximize your overall nutrition in the day.
Although it's popularly believed that eating more frequently ""boosts"" your metabolism, studies have not shown support for this idea., If you do not have the appetite to eat more, you can get more calories into your system by consuming high-calorie drinks.As with high-calorie food, drinks that are high in both calories and nutrients are better than those containing empty calories (like regular sodas or fruit juice cocktails).
A good drink option might be a smoothie containing fruits, full-fat yogurt, whole milk and peanut butter.
You can further enrich the smoothie by sprinkling in a little wheat germ, flax seed meal or chia seeds.

, Some types of foods produce more gas when they're eaten. This could impede your ability to eat more foods.Typical gas producing foods include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, prunes and beans.
When you eat these foods you may notice you feel more bloated and full. This could cause you to have a decrease in appetite or make you feel prematurely full.

, If you're having trouble stimulating your appetite or desire to eat, try going for a short walk prior to your meals.


A little physical activity may stimulate your appetite and help you feel hungrier for your meals.
Your walk doesn't need to be long or of a high intensity. A short 15-minute walk at a moderate pace may help.

, If you don't have an appetite it's recommended to not drink any fluids about 30 minutes prior to your meals and do not drink during your meal.When you drink fluids right before a meal, your stomach may be more full of liquid which can signal your brain you're not hungry resulting in a decrease appetite.
Drinking and eating at the same time can produce a similar effect. You might feel fuller sooner as you're sharing your stomach space with fluids.

, If you're not up for eating, try preparing or purchasing some of your favorite comfort foods.


Many times comfort foods are a bit higher in fat and calories (although not always). Indulge in some of these favorites to help get your daily calorie levels up.
You could also try new recipes. If you're not interested in your typical go-to meals and snacks try new recipes to get your appetite inspired.
Look up a recipe you've been wanting to make for awhile. Even if it's not the healthiest choice, it may help you increase your daily calories.

, Cardiovascular exercise helps you burn more calories, which may cause you to lose more weight.


You can perform light cardiovascular exercise to keep your heart healthy. Lower intensity activities still provide some cardiovascular benefits but do not burn as many calories.
Try activities like walking, bike riding, swimming or yoga.
You do not and should not cut exercise out of your routine altogether, but mild aerobics are better than vigorous ones.

, Many times stress is associated with unhealthy weight gain. However, some people lose their appetite when they're stressed.If you're the type of person who loses their appetite when they're stressed, try to manage chronic stress and practice some de-stressing techniques.
You can try to relax and unwind by: listening to music, taking a walk, talking to a friend or journaling.
If stress is having a significant affect on your appetite and weight, consider seeking the help of a behavioral specialist or therapist.

, If you don't have an appetite or are eating poorly, considering taking a daily multivitamin. Starting with a healthy base of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats is essential when trying to achieve a body composition goal.Although a multivitamin shouldn't be used in place of foods, it can be used to help you reach your daily minimum of a variety of nutrients.
Take a multivitamin that is appropriate to your age group. There are some designed for children, adolescents, adults and senior citizens.

Keep the vitamins in a convenient place.",How to Choose Vitamin Supplements," Vitamin supplements, as you may have guessed, are meant provide any vitamins and minerals that are lacking in your diet. Track what you eat to see if there are specific vitamins and minerals lacking in your diet, and look for supplements that include those nutrients.


If you are vegetarian or vegan, for instance, some key nutrients like vitamin B12 are mostly found in animal products. In this case, you will want to take vegan B12 supplements. It may be helpful to track what you eat for a week, then bring this information to a dietitian to assess what vitamins you might need to supplement.;
, If you have an existing medical condition, such as chronic muscle pain, acne, depression, high blood pressure, and so on, you may want to consider vitamins that have been known to help alleviate the symptoms of your condition.


While not a cure for depression, studies have shown that vitamin C can have mood-elevating effects. Vitamin D can be a useful supplement for those with muscle pain. Vitamin D and calcium can be used to help treat osteoporosis. , Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that we get from many foods as well as exposure to the sun. Being exposed to the sun for as little as 10 minutes is thought to prevent deficiency, but if you rarely or never get sun exposure, taking vitamin D supplements can help you maintain healthy levels of this important nutrient. , Ask your doctor if a vitamin supplement is right for you. Vitamins can be purchased online or in most pharmacies without a prescription, but your doctor will be able to help you decide which, if any, supplements best suit your health needs.


Never start a supplement without talking to your doctor first, especially if you are taking other medications.

, While standard multivitamins, taken as instructed, are considered to have health benefits, you may want to consider a whole food vitamin. Standard multivitamins contain several isolated and processed ingredients that are selected by the manufacturer. Whole food multivitamins, on the other hand, are derived naturally from whole foods, and are considered a healthier way to get vital nutrients if you aren’t getting these nutrients from your diet. Consider whole food multivitamins specialized for your gender or age.
Specialized formulas may include women’s formulas, men’s formulas, senior formulas, and prenatal formulas.

, Nutrients like Vitamin A and Calcium are most often found in animal products, such as meat, dairy, and fish oils. If you are vegan or vegetarian, many stores and websites sell supplements specifically targeted towards vegans and vegetarians.

, This is where multivitamins come in handy. If you find you need several nutrients, you will find it’s more convenient (and less expensive!) to take a whole food multivitamin rather than taking several individual vitamins.

, After you have determined what vitamins and nutrients you need, carefully read the label on the package to identify what nutrients are included and how much of those nutrients you get with each serving. Look at the Daily Value (DV) percentages on the label, and choose a supplement that has a 100% DV for most of the nutrients.


Avoid supplements that contain more than 100% DV, as some nutrients, taken in large doses, can be dangerous to your health over time. Avoid supplements that contain dangerous ingredients such as artificial coloring, hydrogenated oils, talc, or titanium dioxide. , Unfortunately, vitamins and supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so they don’t need FDA approval before being sold to consumers; however, supplements with a “USP Verified” label have been inspected by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention and ensures the supplement:Contains the ingredients listed on the label, in the declared strength and amounts
Is made according to FDA and USP Good Manufacturing Practices, using sanitary and well-controlled processes

, You can find most vitamins in a variety of forms. Some pills may be very large, so if you’re the type who doesn’t like to swallow pills, consider chewable or gummy vitamins. You can also consider taking vitamins in powder form — you just mix the powder with a drink.

, Pharmacies and reputable vitamin shops will have quality products and professionals available to help you with your decision. There are also hundreds of websites where you can purchase vitamins, but it can be very difficult to verify the quality of these products.

, Use common sense when checking out supplements that seem too good to be true. Supplements that make outrageous claims about weight loss or boosts in energy probably can’t support those claims. Remember, these claims do not have to be verified by the FDA. Be wary of supplements that offer a “quick fix” or money-back guarantee.

, Some vitamins are taken once a week, while others are taken multiple times per day. Read the labels on your vitamins to find out when you should take them.


You may want to set a reminder on your phone or computer to make sure you take the vitamins at correct time.

, Follow the dosage instructions on the vitamin’s label. It is important not to take more than recommended. Your vitamins will also have suggestions on how best to take them, whether as soon as you wake up, on a full stomach, or with a glass of water. Follow these instructions for best results.


Keep in mind it is possible to overdose on certain vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are stored in your body and excess is not eliminated when you urinate, as with water-soluble vitamins. This means it is possible to, over time, have dangerous levels of these vitamins in your body, leading to toxicity.

, If you take the vitamins every morning, consider keeping them on a nightstand or in the bathroom. If you take them during the day, you may want to keep them in your purse or bag.


Make taking your vitamins a habit. Try taking them before brushing your teeth at night or making coffee in the morning, so the task blends into these daily rituals.

Talk to your doctor about taking acidophilus.,
Choose the form of acidophilus that is right for you.,
Check the guarantee on the supplement.,
Read labels about enteric coating.,
Consider choosing glass bottles over plastic.",How to Choose Acidophilus," Your doctor will instruct you on how much of the supplement you need. Acidophilus is measured in CFUs (colony-forming units) and typically comes in 2 billion CFUs per gram. A typical recommendation for dosage is 1 to 2 billion CFUs daily. Children's dosages are based on weight and age of the child.;
, The supplement comes in capsules, tablets and powder form. Capsules are chewable, which is often preferred by children, whereas tablets keep well when refrigerated. Powder can be sprinkled on food or mixed in milk or juice.

, Most manufacturers label a guarantee of the CFU count on the product. The guarantee should indicate 1 to 2 billion CFUs of acidophilus with no other forms of bacteria. Consumers should avoid products without a guarantee.

, This is a coating applied to oral medications that helps to hold off the release of the medication prior to it reaching the small intestine. Many acidophilus products will suggest that supplements need to be coated for easier absorption. This isn't necessarily true, as your body already creates some level of acidophilus. However, enteric coating may be helpful if you have a sensitive stomach or other digestive issues.

, Acidophilus stored in plastic bottles can lose some of its potency due to the fact that plastic is porous. Choose glass bottles for maximum efficacy.

Avoid sleeping in and staying up late.,
Eat meals at regular times every day.,
Keep up with your exercise regimen.,
Get a part-time job or volunteer to stay busy.",How to Avoid Summer Weight Gain1," Do your best to stick to your normal sleeping habits, whether you have the entire summer or just a couple weeks off from school or work. Go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, and avoid sleeping too late. A change in routine can disrupt your workout and eating routines.If you sleep too late in the day, you’ll be less likely to be physically active and more likely to gain weight.
Getting the right amount of sleep will also help maintain your metabolism. Go for 7 to 9 hours if you’re an adult and at least 8 to 10 hours if you’re a teen or younger.;
, Eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same times every day will keep your metabolism in check. You’ll also be less likely to graze on unhealthy snacks throughout the day.If you do snack between meals, go for healthy options, like Greek yogurt with fresh blueberries or 10 to 15 raw nuts., Summer is a great time to get more physical activity in because the days are longer and the weather is warmer. For some people, the warm weather and a lack of routine can make it difficult to follow an exercise regimen. However, you should keep up with your workouts, or start exercising if you don't already. Whether you go on brisk walks, jog, or ride your bike, try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day.


Try out new activities to get more exercise during the summer. For example, you could go for a hike, go swimming, have a water balloon fight with friends, or run through sprinklers with your kids or pets.
Try using a physical activity diary to track your workouts and hold yourself accountable: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/physical_activity_diary_cdc.pdf.
Talk to your doctor before taking on a new exercise regimen, especially if you have an existing condition, like heart or joint issues.

, If you have extra time on your hands during the summer, committing to a new responsibility can help you resist the urge to lounge. A part-time job can keep you busy while offering extra cash. You could also volunteer for a cause dear to you, like at your local animal shelter or soup kitchen.Taking on a new responsibility will leave you with less time to sit around and snack.

Try taking zinc syrup or lozenges.,
Get plenty of vitamin C in your diet.,
Use echinacea throughout the year.,
Eat garlic to stimulate your immune system.,
Try astragalus to boost your immune system.",How to Choose Vitamins and Supplements to Prevent Flu1," Zinc has long been believed to have immune boosting properties. Research on the precise effectiveness of zinc has produced mixed results, but zinc may be able to reduce the likelihood of becoming sick. If it is safe for you to take zinc given your current health and any existing medications, taking zinc in the form of syrup or lozenges may reduce your risk of contracting the flu.It's best to take zinc in the form of lozenges and syrups. Too much zinc in the diet can cause health problems, such as anemia or a copper deficiency, so talk to your doctor about how much zinc you can safely consume each day.
Some zinc comes in the form of nasal sprays. Such sprays can cause major health problems, such as the permanent loss of smell, so avoid them. Go for safer lozenges and syrups instead.
Zinc can come with side effects, especially if it's taken in lozenge form. You may notice nausea or a bad taste in your mouth after taking the zinc.;
, While vitamin C does not necessarily prevent colds or flus, it may decrease their duration if your diet is high in vitamin C. Also, vitamin C may prevent the flu in very athletic people, like marathon runners or skiers. If you are very physically active, a diet rich in vitamin C could potentially help you prevent the cold or flu.Vitamin C is found in many fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits are a great source of vitamin C, as are kiwis, mangoes, papayas, strawberries, pineapples, cantaloupes, and watermelon. For vegetables, foods like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, spinach, cabbage, turnips, sweet potatoes, and green and red peppers contain vitamin C.
They do sell vitamin C supplements at most health food stores and drugstores. However, vitamin C can cause health problems if you have too much in your system, such as anemia, bleeding gums, and easy bruising. You should talk to your doctor before using a vitamin C supplement to make sure you're not getting too much vitamin C.

, Echinacea is the roots, seeds, and other parts of the echinacea plant. Echinacea is sold in a variety of forms, like oils and supplements, at drug stores. Evidence on the precise effectiveness of echinacea has been somewhat inconclusive. While there is no significant evidence showing echinacea can help prevent the flu, it has been effective for some in the past. It may be worth a try if you want to avoid the flu this season.Talk to your doctor about how to use echinacea. If you're taking supplements each day, it's especially important to talk to your doctor about a safe dose for you.
Echinacea is also sold in the form of a tea, so you cry drinking echinacea tea.
If you get echinacea oil to do something like aromatherapy, always dilute the oil prior to use.
Never use echinacea on children younger than 12. This can be dangerous.

, Garlic may help reduce your risk of certain infections, such as upper respiratory infections. You can add garlic to your meals, or add minced garlic to water or tea, throughout the year. This may boost your immune system and reduce your risk of coming down with the flu when flu season hits.If you are on blood thinners, talk to your doctor before you adopt a diet rich in garlic. Garlic can increase your risk of bleeding.
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do not take garlic supplements before discussing this with your doctor.
Garlic interacts with many different medications, including medications for ailments like HIV/AIDS. It's very important you check with a doctor or pharmacist before upping the amount of garlic in your diet if you are on prescription medication.

, Astragalus is a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Research does show astragalus has anti-viral and antibacterial properties. It may be able to boost your immune system if you use it regularly, reducing your risk of contracting the flu.The dried root of the astragalus plant is usually used medically. You can take it in the form of a capsule, tincture, or topically on your skin.
Talk to your physician about how to take astragalus. How you take astragalus depends on a variety of factors, including your age, weight, and current health. In most cases, you can safely take astragalus as a supplement, but only your doctor can determine a safe amount to consume.

Look out for symptoms of anemia.,
Get a blood test.,
Discuss with your doctor the possibility of taking iron supplements.,
Check how much iron you need.,
Familiarize with different forms of iron supplements.,
Choose a multivitamin supplement containing iron.,
Check the level of elemental iron in the supplement.,
Ask your physician whether you need iron injections.,
Consider following an iron-rich diet.,
Take the iron supplement.,
Increase your intake of vitamin C. Eating foods with a high vitamin C content, like citrus fruit, will help your body absorb more iron.,
Carefully time eating foods that will hinder iron absorption.,
Consider the side effects of taking iron supplements.,
Pay attention to symptoms of iron poisoning.,
Monitor your progress.",How to Choose an Iron Supplement," Anemia means a low level of red cells in your body and is a sign of iron deficiency. This can be quite common and due to several factors. Symptoms include:Tiredness
Paleness
Dizziness
Fast heartbeat
Chills
Headaches
Itchiness
Hair loss
Slow immune response to infections;
, The level of hemoglobin signals the amount of red cells in your blood and is used to determine whether you have an iron deficiency. If you're in one of these categories, you're more likely to have an iron deficiency and should consider getting tested:Pregnant women
Women with heavy menstrual bleeding
Infants and young children
Cancer patients
People with digestive issues
Blood donors, They will help you determine whether iron supplementation is advisable for you and in what quantity, based on your gender, age and existing conditions. Make sure you mention whether you have any of these conditions in your medical history:Alcohol abuse
Blood transfusions
Kidney or liver disease
Arthritis
Asthma
Allergies
Hemochromatosis
Hemosiderosis
Heart disease
Intestinal problems
Stomach ulcer
Other forms of anemia

, Dosage depends on age, gender, existing conditions and dietary intake. The daily needed amount is usually 8 mg for adult men and 18 mg for women.Pregnant women will need more iron (around 27 mg per day).
Women who are breastfeeding will need less than usual (9 to 10 mg per day).
Children will need different amounts depending on their age and sex. Check the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board to determine how much iron your children should get each day: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/

It is not recommended to take large amounts of iron for longer than six months, unless your doctor tells you otherwise., Iron can be taken in forms such as tablets, capsules or liquid. You may also choose a slow-release form of iron: these are taken once a day and provide a steady release of iron into the body. Most iron supplements are sold without a prescription, with the exception of infant drops or specialty supplements.


Your doctor will help you determine the daily dosage you need and recommend the best form of supplement for you.
Tablets are usually the best absorbed and less expensive option. Liquid forms are usually preferable for young children. Slow-release supplements lead to fewer side effects but are also absorbed in minor quantities.When choosing a supplement, consider other factors like personal preferences (you might have difficulty swallowing non-chewable tablets) and side effects. For example, liquid supplements tend to stain your teeth.
Other forms of iron supplements include powder, suspension, liquid-filled capsules, syrup and elixir.A way to prevent this is by mixing the supplement with water or juice or drinking it through a straw.

, Most children and adult multivitamins contain the recommended daily dosage of iron. If your deficiency is not severe, you might simply increase your daily intake in this form.


Read the label to check the amount of iron contained in the multivitamin supplement and see if it corresponds to the dosage recommended by your doctor.

, When reading the label, be aware that the iron content may appear under these three names: ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate. Regardless of the quantity of any of these contents, the exact amount of iron is signaled by the level of elemental iron.The amount of elemental iron is not necessarily linked to the amount of iron supplement. 300 mg of ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate might correspond to different levels of elemental iron.Out of the three, ferrous fumarate usually has the highest content of elemental iron (around 33 percent). Ferrous gluconate has the lowest (around 12 percent), while ferrous sulfate has slightly more (20 percent). When choosing which supplement to use, you might want to try gluconate if you're afraid fumarate might be too much for you, or fumarate if your aim is to get as much iron as possible out of supplementation., This is recommendable only if you can't take iron in any other form. Iron can be injected only by a doctor or nurse.Do not take other forms of supplements if you are getting injections., Your doctor might recommend you to simply change your diet to include more foods with a high iron content. If your anemia is simply due to eating iron in poor quantities, you should reconsider your diet before taking over-the-counter iron supplements.


Be aware that some foods will contain heme irons (easily absorbed by your blood), while others will provide nonheme iron (less easily absorbed).
Foods that are rich in iron include:Meat: liver, lean-ground beef, pork, turkey leg, lamb leg (large quantities of heme iron)
Eggs (heme iron)
Fish: sardines, oysters, tuna, shrimp (smaller quantities of heme iron)
Brown rice (nonheme iron)
Kidney beans, peas or lentils (nonheme iron)
Cereal: Iron-fortified cereal, whole wheat bread, oatmeal (nonheme iron)
Spinach (nonheme iron)
Tofu (nonheme iron)
Molasses (nonheme iron)
Peanut butter (nonheme iron)
Raisins (nonheme iron)



, It is best to take the iron supplement on an empty stomach to facilitate absorption, either with water or fruit juice. This means one or two hours before meals.


If taking iron on an empty stomach makes you sick, you should take it right after meals, although this will make it harder for your body to absorb it., Thus, this is recommended both if you're following an iron-rich diet or taking supplements. You can get more vitamin C through:Oranges and orange juice
Red and green peppers
Strawberries and blackcurrants
Broccoli and brussels sprouts
Potatoes

, Combining iron supplements with some foods will make it harder for your body to absorb it. The following foods or supplements should be consumed no more than two hours after taking an iron supplement if you want to maximize your iron intake:


Caffeinated drinks and food (coffee, black tea, chocolate)
Calcium and antacid supplementsCow's milk (for children and infants), Ask your physician about possible uncomfortable reactions you might have to an increased iron absorption. They might advise you to reduce your daily dosage if these symptoms become too much for you to take.These can include:Constipation
Upset stomach
Nausea
Muscle pain
Cramping
Fast heartbeat
Dizziness
Metallic taste
Stained teeth (if so, brush with baking soda or medicinal peroxide)

, Taking too much iron can cause many undesirable effects. If side effects become severe, you have one or more of these symptoms and you think they might be due to iron overdosage, contact your doctor and consider reducing your dosage or switching to other supplements.



Early symptoms include:Diarrhea (maybe with blood)
Fever
Nausea and sharp stomach pain
Severe vomiting (maybe with blood)



Late symptoms include:Blue lips, fingernails and palms of hands
Seizures
Clammy skin
Difficulties breathing
Tiredness or weakness
Fast heartbeat



, Your doctor will probably advise you to return after a few weeks to check how your body is responding to supplementation. Blood tests will monitor your hemoglobin levels and determine for how long you should continue the treatment.Checking your stools is an effective way to see whether your body is absorbing the iron supplements. These should be black."

Look for a supplement manufacturer that holds a good reputation.,
Remember you get what you pay for.,
Check their history for Product Recalls.,
Find out if they offer Product Liability Insurance.,
Check out trade shows.,
Take a tour of the manufacturing facility.,
Call up their customer service and see how long it takes for them to respond.,
Check how many years they have been in business.,
Check for Certifications.,
Evaluate whether the manufacturer is able to offer a proactive partnership?,
Make Sure They Keep Their Raw Materials On-hand.",How to Choose a Quality Nutraceutical Manufacturer," The reputation of your manufacturer plays a critical role in the success or failure of your business. The last thing you want to do is partner with a company that’s not well-respected in the industry or has a checkered history working with other supplement business owners. Visit their website to see if they’ve won any major industry awards for business ethics or manufacturing excellence. How do you go about making sure a company has a good reputation? According to Andrew Goldman of Nutricap Labs, ask manufacturers to provide you with references of previous clients whom you can contact to find out about their experience working with a particular manufacturer. You can also check the Better Business Bureau to see whether there are complaints against the company, how they have dealt with these complaints and the BBB’s rating of the company. You can also Google to find out what people are saying about this manufacturer on forums and other social media networks.;
, Have you ever heard the saying “You get what you pay for”? It never rings more true than in the supplement manufacturing industry. Cheaper quotes may mean the manufacturer plans on using inferior raw materials in your products. Keep in mind that sub-quality finished products will never pass the various and rigorous testing that is mandated by the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP’s). Unless you’re absolutely sure that you’re getting a high-quality supplement that can hold up to testing, a low price per bottle should be a red flag in your mind. And this leads us to …

, A product recall can do irreversible damage to your business – both from a financial and reputation standpoint. In the event that your product does end up being recalled though for some reason, make sure that your manufacturer has standard operating procedures (SOP’s) in place to ensure it is handled according to GMP guidelines.

, In addition to having your own insurance, it’s important that your supplement manufacturer can provide you with an insurance rider with your company name on it as initial insured. In the event something happens to your product (i.e. the product is damaged, destroyed, recalled, etc.), you need to ensure that you and your company are protected.

, Make sure your prospective manufacturer regularly attends and/or exhibits at industry trade shows like Natural Products Expo East and West and Supply Side East and West. This serves as a strong indication as to whether or not the manufacturer has a legitimate operation.

, This is not always possible, but you should check out the facility in-person or via a virtual tour to make sure they have the ability to provide you with all of the services they promote on their website, in their company literature, etc.

, The first inclination that something’s wrong with a company is when their customer service department fails to respond to your inquiry. This could indicate that a company is not legitimate or not properly structured from an operational standpoint. There’s nothing that instills more trust in prospective clients, like you, than when the frontline of a company is properly equipped to handle your calls, answer your questions and provide quotes in a timely manner.

, A nutraceutical manufacturer who has several years of experience producing high-quality supplements according to the GMP guidelines and has a strong reputation is one that you can feel good about partnering with.

, Make sure the company you are considering working with completes all of their manufacturing in a facility that is GMP Certified by a reputable third-party, such as the NSF. Ask to see a copy of their certificate to verify that they are indeed certified. Other industry-recognized certifications include TGA, the Natural Products Association and others. A manufacturer that holds these certifications and that actively seeks to renew them places a high priority on product quality –something that should be of the utmost importance to you as a supplement business owner.

, Contract manufacturers have come a long, long way from just offering inferior duplication of branded products. Your nutraceutical manufacturer should be able to keep up with the latest industry trends, innovations and technological updates. They should also be able to offer you helpful advice on how to plan for the future growth of your product line. As you grow, your supplement manufacturer must have the infrastructure to meet your growth projections. Scalability is critical to your business. A contract manufacturer needs to keep abreast of current rules and regulations and be able to comply to these changes promptly. During the transition to FDA GMPs (which took 3 years) many supplement manufacturers were not able to comply. You don’t want to be stuck with a supplement manufacturing partner who cannot meet regulatory challenges and keep up with the times. Remember, this is, hopefully, going to be a long partnership. You need to feel that a prospective manufacturer is being upfront and honest about his business. You need to feel a sense of comfort, too, so that if you need, you can call him up and pick his brain with business questions.

, You never want to be in a situation where your manufacturer cannot start production because they don’t have your raw materials in-house. Make sure they keep an adequate supply of raw materials on-hand so that your product gets manufactured in a timely manner.

Staying hydrated is also vital during the summer heat and helps offset salty summer staples, like hot dogs and chips.Drink unsweetened iced tea or water with lemon instead of high-calorie drinks.

, If you do go for alcoholic beverages, choose lower-calorie items, like dry wine, light beer, or cocktails made with no-calorie mixers, like a vodka with club soda and lime.

Drinking too early will make you more likely to laze around all day.

, When you attend summer barbecues, don’t hang out near the food table.

Do your best to find a seat facing away from the buffet and keep it out of sight as much as possible.Keep in mind that it is fine to load up on fresh fruits and grilled veggies. These are some of the healthier choices that you might find on a barbeque buffet.

, Burgers and hot dogs are barbecue standards, but they’re not lean and come with high calorie buns and condiments. Instead, look for grilled seafood, like shrimp or salmon. If no seafood is available, or if you don’t like it, look for leaner meats, like grilled chicken breast and turkey dogs.Try grilling seafood and other lean meats for a healthy barbeque option.

, Do your homework before eating out, whether you’re out of town or want to enjoy the patio of your favorite neighborhood eatery. Find their menu online, and look for choices that are consistent with your dietary goals. Knowing your healthy options ahead of time will help you avoid the temptation of a richer meal.Go for restaurants with menu sections that list healthy choices. Avoid fast food and all you can eat buffets.

, Designate a day or two every now and then to splurge. Sample local cuisine if you’re out of town or have an ice cream cone with sprinkles. Try not to completely abandon your dietary goals, but give yourself permission to let loose a bit.Giving yourself a limited opportunity to splurge can help you avoid overdoing it the rest of the time.

, Avoid giving supplements to children, especially children under 12, without a doctor's clearance. Supplements like echinacea are not safe for young children. As children are more prone to complications due to the flu, it's better to discuss prevention with a doctor. Evidence of the effectiveness of supplements is limited, so something like a flu shot may make more sense when it comes to protecting your child from the flu."

Be wary of enticing claims.,
Choose a supplement that does not exceed 100% of your daily values.,
Select a supplement that is in a form that will be easy for you to consume.,
Compare prices.,
Check the expiration date.,
Buy supplements from a physical store whenever possible.",How to Buy the Best Supplements2," Once you have determined whether or not supplementation is for you, the next step in buying the best supplement is to read the label carefully. Make sure that the label provides basic information such as the ingredients, dosage instructions, and the manufacturer’s contact information.If the supplement does not feature this basic information, then that should be a red flag that this supplement may not be of the best quality. Steer clear of any supplements that do not provide this basic information on the bottle.

, Supplements with a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) seal are ideal because the ingredients have been lab-tested and verified by a third party. That means that what you see listed on the bottle is what is actually in the bottle. Products with USP seals have been produced under sanitary, controlled conditions according to the FDA’s guidelines.It is crucial to seek out supplements that have a USP seal because not all supplements’ ingredient lists match up with what is in the bottle. Studies have shown that some herbal supplements do not contain the right herb, while others may also contain metals, pesticides, and prescription drugs., Supplements produced outside of the United States may not have been regulated, so it is best to avoid these. Check the label to determine whether or not the supplement was made in the United States. Avoid any supplements that were not produced in the United States., Any supplement that makes claims about the supplement’s ability to prevent, treat, or cure a disease should have you on your guard. Supplements are supposed to avoid making any misleading claims on the bottle, so be wary of any supplements that seem to have overlooked this requirement.Do not put too much stock in terms like “natural,” “certified,” “standardized,” or “verified” either. These terms are not necessarily indicative of the product’s safety or quality, especially without a USP seal.

, Unless you have been advised to do so by your doctor, do not take any supplements that exceed 100% of your daily requirement. Some vitamins may be harmful in high doses, so steering clear of supplements that provide more than 100% of your daily requirement can be dangerous.


Vitamins A, D, E, and K stay in your body and if the levels get too high, it can be toxic., Supplements come in a variety of different forms, including powders, liquids, capsules, and chewables. Choose the form that best meets your needs.For example, if you have a hard time swallowing pills, then a liquid or powder form would be easy to mix in with food.

, While price is not a major indicator of quality, it is a good idea to compare the prices of multiple supplements before you decide to buy. Consider other indicators of quality and compare different brands of supplements to determine which ones are the best value.


For example, a supplement that features a USP seal is likely to be higher quality than a more expensive supplement that does not have a USP seal.

, Supplements have expiration date because they lose potency over time. Make sure that you check the expiration date on any supplement that you plan to buy and avoid buying anything that has expired., Buying supplements in a drug store, pharmacy, or a large retailer offers you several advantages over buying online. You can inspect the bottle to make sure that it has a USP seal that has not been tampered with and you can also read the label to check it for all of the necessary information.


Be careful if you buy supplements online. They may be cheaper than what you would find in a store, but they may also be lower in quality or even dangerous.Buying online may also make it difficult to verify information such as where the supplements were produced and whether or not they have a USP seal.

Eat a meal containing fat with your vitamin.,
Avoid taking vitamin A supplements on an empty stomach.,
Eat avocado.,
Get enough zinc.",How to Best Absorb Vitamin A Supplements1," Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is best absorbed by your body when you eat it with foods containing fat. Good options are red meat, liver, cream or cheese, whole milk, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon. If your overall diet is very low in fat, you may not absorb vitamin A efficiently.Eating a diet high in saturated fat causes health problems like high cholesterol, weight gain, and heart issues. The important thing is to eat a balanced diet, with enough fat but not an unhealthy amount. Your doctor can help you with this. Ask, ""Can you help me come up with a healthy diet plan?"";
, Taking your supplement when you haven’t eaten anything, or even with very low-fat foods, may cause stomach upset, indigestion or heartburn. This also increases the chance that the vitamin could pass through your system without being fully absorbed by your body.

, Avocado contains a high amount of “good fats,” and studies have shown this food might help your body absorb vitamin A. Adding one whole avocado to your meal may even double the amount of vitamin A you can absorb., You need to have enough zinc in your diet in order to fully absorb vitamin A.Women need at least 8mg every day (up to 10 or 11mg if pregnant or breastfeeding), and adult men need 11mg daily.Foods high in zinc include beef, pork chops, chicken, crab, oysters, lobster, fortified cereals and oatmeal, cashews, almonds, swiss cheese, chickpeas, and kidney beans."
"
Treat digestive conditions medically.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Avoid weight-loss medications.,
Change your medicines that block vitamin A absorption.",How to Best Absorb Vitamin A Supplements2," Even if you have enough fat in your diet, you still won’t absorb vitamin A well if you have a medical condition that limits your body’s ability to absorb the fats you eat. Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, disease of the liver or gall bladder, cystic fibrosis, and problems with your pancreas can affect your fat absorption. These will require treatment or additional vitamin A supplementation to get your RDA of vitamin A.


How you absorb fat is also decreased if you have had part or all of your stomach removed, such as after certain kinds of weight-loss surgeries., Alcohol can interfere with your body’s ability to absorb vitamin A (and other needed nutrients).Stop drinking alcohol altogether, or limit your alcohol intake to, say, one glass daily to maintain good health and promote vitamin absorption.

, The prescription medication Orlistat is used to help people lose weight, but because of how it works it can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A.Olestra, a fat substitute sometimes added to food, can cause similar problems. Avoid these if you require a vitamin A supplement.

, If you are at risk for vitamin A deficiency, speak to your healthcare provider about any medications that you are taking. Some cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants, like cholestyramine and colestipol, can block vitamin A absorption; another kind of cholesterol medicine, called statins, can actually help vitamin A absorption. Omeprazole (Prilosec) is used for heartburn and reflux, and can cause absorption issues, as can the antibiotic Neomycin.Switching to different medicines with your doctor's advice can help.


Discuss your medicines and your vitamins with your doctor, to avoid any interactions. Say something like, “My dietician wants me to take a vitamin A supplement. Will that cause any problems with the medicines you prescribe to me?”

"
"
Get your recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A.,
Eat foods high in vitamin A.,
Take a daily multivitamin.",How to Best Absorb Vitamin A Supplements3," The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other government agencies make suggestions based on research about how much vitamin A you need each day. Typically, adult men need 900 micrograms (3,000 international units, or IU) and adult women need 700 micrograms (2,300 IU) daily.Make sure you’re getting the amount you need.


Pregnant women require slightly more: 770 micrograms (2,600 IU) daily. When lactating and breast feeding, the RDA increases to 1,300 micrograms of vitamin A daily (4,300 IU). These requirements are for women age 19 or older.
The RDAs for children have been set by the U.S. Institute of Medicine and the World Health Organization, and they vary depending on the child’s age.Ask your doctor if your child needs additional vitamin A, and how much they should receive.
The current RDA numbers have been in place since 2002, but some supplement packaging might still list the old dosage of 5,000 IU.

, Good natural sources of this vitamin are meat products such as beef kidney and liver, eggs, and dairy. This form of vitamin A is called retinol and it is in a form that the body can use. Be sure to also get vitamin A from fresh produce like carrots and other yellow or dark vegetables, also known as carotenoids, which are precursors of Vitamin A.Great sources are broccoli, kale, spinach, sweet potato, squash, cantaloupe, dried apricots, mango and sweet red peppers., Multivitamins often contain 100% of the RDA for vitamin A, and taking one daily multivitamin is an easy way to get all the supplements you need. Choose a vitamin that states on the label that its vitamin A is at least 20% beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A found in some foods and is safe even in large quantities. Multivitamins are available at your local drug store. You may want to ask your doctor, dietician, or pharmacist if they recommend a certain brand.


Choose a multivitamin that provides close to 100% of the daily need for all the vitamins and minerals it contains, rather than one that has a “megadose” of 500% of one and only, say, 15% of another.Do not take an additional vitamin A supplement unless you are directed by a doctor to do so. Vitamin A toxicity can occur if you consume very high levels. The amount found in a daily multi-vitamin combined with a healthy diet is enough for most people.

Try to avoid supplements with additives like sugar and dyes.,
Avoid “trendy” new supplements.",How to Buy Natural Supplements1," Your doctor can evaluate the condition of your health, as well as your diet, risk factors, and current medications to determine if buying supplements is a safe decision for your particular circumstances.


Discuss your medical conditions with your doctor before taking supplements, because some ingredients in supplements may interfere with specific health concerns.Many doctors and pharmacists are not trained about supplements and natural products.Ask your healthcare practitioner something like, “How familiar are you with these natural supplements?” If they do not have extensive knowledge, ask for a referral to a dietitian or other professional who does.;
, When buying natural supplements, know the difference between pills, capsules, powders, teas, and the variety of other forms supplements may come in. The form of a supplement affects its absorption, so you must take your specific circumstances into account when deciding what's right for you. If necessary, consult with a doctor or pharmacist.

, There are a number of places you can find herbal supplements for sale. Shop around for the best quality and value. Use the Dietary Supplement Label Database on the National Institute of Health’s website to compare the ingredients in similar products.An Internet search will return a wide array of natural supplement shops online. Some specialize in specific supplements, others sell bulk product at wholesale prices, and others offer organic brands.
You may be able to find a number of local natural supplement stores. This is a convenient option if you're not sure exactly what you are looking for, and if you'd prefer to speak with someone face-to-face about your particular needs.
Chain retail, fitness supplement, and drug stores carry a selection of supplements.

, Once you have found the herbal supplements that you want to buy, examine the labels for the following before you make a purchase:The manufacturer's name and address should be printed on the label. That way, if you do encounter any difficulties with taking your supplements, you can go directly to the source with your questions and complaints.
Go over the complete ingredients list and, if there is something you don't understand, ask a doctor or pharmacist about it before buying supplements.
Look for a seal from the US Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International. This means that the supplement manufacturer should adhere to quality guidelines created by these regulatory organizations.

, Supplements can be made with natural ingredients or they can be synthesized in a laboratory. Synthetic products may be more likely to contain harmful additives or by-products. Look for supplements labeled “natural” and avoid those called “synthetic” – contact the manufacturer for this information if it is not listed on the bottle.For instance, vitamin E may be listed as d-alpha-tocopherol if natural and dl-alpha-tocopherol if synthetic.

, Supplements contain many ingredients other than the herb or vitamin they intend to, and not all of them are bad. Try to generally avoid those with added sugar, which may be listed as an ingredient ending in “-ose.” You may also want to avoid added cornstarch, yeast, soy, and whey.Many dyes will be listed in the ingredients as a color then a number, such as “yellow no. 5.” Other ways they may be listed are simply as “FD&C,” or “E” then a number like “E102.”

, Every so often a new fad supplement appears on the market, or lists itself as a “cure all” remedy. These are likely just marketing ploys, and just because many people are taking a supplement doesn’t mean it’s right for you. In general, it’s better to wait awhile after a new supplement appears on the market so the FDA can begin to collect safety data on it.Anyone can put a supplement on the market with minimal scientific evidence of its safety and efficacy – the FDA removes the product from the market if it’s unsafe.Give a product some time on the market before using it.

Just like medicines, you might have to temporarily stop taking your supplements prior to a surgical procedure.Health claims about supplements generally apply to people between the ages of 18 and 65. If you’re younger or older, be especially careful with supplements because they may react differently in your body., How herbal medicines and supplements are categorized and regulated varies from one country to another. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates natural products through the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). These safety regulations have no bearings on the same product sold in other countries.The FDA regulates supplements, but by different, less strict, standards than food and medications.Go to the library or search the internet to find out what organization is in charge of supplement safety in your region.
Products made in the United States and Europe may be more closely regulated than other countries. Supplements made in China, India, and Mexico have been found to sometimes contain toxic material and prescription drugs.When possible, buy herbal supplements from the U.S. and Europe, even if that means shopping internationally.

, The claims that manufacturers make about their products are required to be based on evidence, but they do not have to get those claims evaluated by the FDA.

, Some list these percentages per single tablet while others calculate the percentage for the whole recommended daily dosage, which could be multiple tablets. Pay attention to how much a tablet contains and compare what you'll be taking daily.

, Check with your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before buying vitamins to make sure they're safe for you.

, The pharmacist can answer questions about interactions, dosages and the potential health benefits of a vitamin.

Make an appointment with your doctor if you think you may have a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.,
Be aware of certain medical conditions that may predispose you to needing more vitamin D. Being deficient in vitamin D is actually a pretty common occurrence.,
Try to supplement your vitamin D through food, if possible.,
Buy vitamin D fortified products.,
Make sure to spend time out in the sun to get adequate amount of vitamin D. Your body is able to absorb vitamin D when you spend time out in the sun, exposed to UV rays.,
Do not take too much vitamin D, as taking too much vitamin D can be toxic.,
Check that you are not at risk for kidney disease or hardening of the arteries.",How to Best Absorb Vitamin D Supplements1," The doctor will administer a 25 hydroxy-vitamin D blood test.


This test is a good idea for anyone who is homebound, has dark skin or is at risk for osteoporosis. Lighter skin produces more vitamin D after extended exposure to sunlight. Darker skinned people need 5 to 10 times more sunlight to produce healthy vitamin D levels.
For adults, the recommended daily value of vitamin D is 600 International Units (IU) or 15 micrograms (mcg). It is likely that a doctor will recommend between 400 and 1,000 IU per day to supplement your diet for a short period of time.;
, Generally, you just need to spend a bit more time in the sun or eat more vitamin D-rich foods. However, some medicals conditions can affect how your body absorbs vitamin D, which means that you might need to take supplements to keep your vitamin D levels normal. These conditions include:


Cystic fibrosis
Crohn’s disease
Kidney disease
Celiac disease

, It is important to keep in mind that supplements are just that—they supplement your diet if you cannot get enough of the nutrient by eating vitamin D-rich food. Before you begin taking vitamin D supplements, try altering your diet a little to increase your vitamin D intake naturally, rather than through supplementation.


A cup (237 ml) of fortified milk provides about 30 percent of your daily value.
3 oz. (85 g) of salmon or mackerel provides about 100 percent of the daily value.
3 oz. (85 g) of canned tuna provides about 40 percent.
Eggs, liver and fortified cereals can provide about 10 percent of your daily value.

, As mentioned in the previous step, it is advisable to try to alter your diet before you begin thinking about taking supplements. One of the more efficient ways to get the vitamin D you need is by consuming vitamin D fortified foods and beverages.


The most commonly fortified product is milk. Look at your carton of milk to make sure that it is enriched with vitamin D before you buy it.
Other foods that are commonly fortified with vitamin D include cereals, orange juice, and some yogurts.

, In fact, many people meet their vitamin D needs simply by living in places that are sunny.


However, it is important to keep in mind that UVB radiation cannot go through glass, so if you sit in the sun while inside, your body will not be absorbing any vitamin D. For this reason, try to spend at least 5 to 30 minutes outside in the sun without any sunscreen on. After this time, you should put sunscreen on to protect yourself from skin cancer.

, If you take too much vitamin D each day, you could actually cause the calcium levels in your blood to skyrocket. However, it is important to keep in mind that vitamin D overdoses are rarely caused by staying in the sun too long or eating too much vitamin D-rich foods; most overdoses come taking too many vitamin D supplements. Signs that you are taking too much vitamin D include:


Being very constipated.
Experiencing nausea.
Feeling confused.
Developing kidney stones.
Developing an abnormal heartbeat.

, Vitamin D supplement absorption can potentially also be dangerous for people with lymphoma, sarcoidosis or histoplasmosis.

Choose the correct vitamin D supplement.,
Take your vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day.,
Examine your medications before taking vitamin D supplements.,
Consider increasing your intake of other nutrients that are cofactors of vitamin D. Cofactors are nutrients that work together to help the body absorb as much of the nutrients as possible.,
Lose some weight.,
Work with your doctor to try to treat underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your body’s ability to absorb vitamin D. As mentioned in the previous section, there are some medical conditions that can affect how your body activates vitamin D. In particular, weak kidneys can limit your body’s ability to activate the vitamin D that you consume (either through sun, food, or supplement).",How to Best Absorb Vitamin D Supplements2," The most common kinds are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). D3 is recommended most often because it is the naturally occurring version of vitamin D in your body.


Other possible names for vitamin D supplements include: Alfacalcidol, Calcifediol, Calcipotriene, Calcipotriol, Calcitriol, Colecalciferol, Dihydrotachysterol, and Paricalcitol.

, Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient, which means that you need to have eaten a little bit of fat in order for the nutrient to be absorbed efficiently by your body. Fat-soluble nutrients (the other ones are A, E and K) take a long time to be absorbed and eliminated by your body because they are stored in your fatty tissues and liver.


Always take your vitamin D supplements with or right after you have eaten a meal. The food in your system will help your body to process this nutrient.
It doesn’t seem to matter what meal you take your supplement with. The time of day does not appear to affect your body’s ability to absorb vitamin D.

, Certain medications interact with the absorption of vitamin D supplements and prevent healthy absorption. These medications include:


Antacids, Lipitor, Dovonex, Lanoxin, Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac, Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) substrates, Verapamil and water pills.

, For example, magnesium is known to be a co-factor of vitamin D. This means that eating foods that are rich in magnesium, or taking magnesium supplements, may help your body to absorb vitamin D more efficiently. Other nutrients that are thought to help your body absorb vitamin D include:


Boron. Foods that are rich in boron include almonds, apples, hazelnuts, dates, and avocados.
Vitamin K. Foods that are rich in vitamin K include basil, kale, spinach, scallions, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus.
Zinc. Foods that are rich in zinc include oysters, crab, beef chuck, fortified breakfast cereal, lobsters and baked beans.
Vitamin A. Foods that are rich in vitamin A include sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, butternut squash, dried apricots, and romaine lettuce.

, People who are overweight tend to have low levels of vitamin D. This is because the fat cells in their body extract the vitamin D from their blood (vitamin D is fat-soluble after all) and thus vitamin D is kept from the circulation through their bodies. If you are obese, losing some weight may help you to better absorb vitamin D and increase your vitamin D levels. To lose weight:



Try to eat a healthy, balanced diet. The key to reaching a healthy weight is to make healthy choices when you eat.

Exercise regularly. In addition to eating healthy, you need to get your body moving in order to tone your muscles and burn off excess fat.

, Talk to your doctor about options for treatment.

, Vitamin C enhances the absorption of grapeseed extract.

, In addition to helping absorb grapeseed extract, Vitamin E's natural benefits are boosted by the double-dose of antioxidants.

, This is the recommended daily dose for adults. Take the dose regularly so your body can become accustomed to its consistent absorption.

, Experts recommend at least 8 8-ounce servings of water each day to stay properly hydrated. When your body is properly hydrated, it readily absorbs vitamins, minerals and helpful supplements.

, Get at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. With proper exercise, your body's metabolism ramps up and effectively absorbs and uses the vitamins and supplements you feed it each day.

, When your body gets appropriate servings of healthy food everyday, it absorbs supplements more effectively. When your body is forced to process unhealthy foods, supplements like grapeseed extract don't always digest properly.

This is also helpful in case you undergo any medical procedure. For example, some herbs may increase bleeding during surgery.
Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain herbal supplements before other procedures if they might cause issues or complications.Never take herbal supplements if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, if you are younger than 18, or if you are older than 65 without first talking to your doctor.;
, Although herbal supplements are derived from natural sources, they can interact with medications. This is true of over the counter and prescription medication. When you visit your doctor, be sure to mention any herbal supplement you are considering to make sure she can tell you of possible interactions. Also tell her about any additional medications that you were prescribed by other doctors or specialists.


Not all general doctors are experts in herbal supplements. Consider seeing a naturopath, physicians specifically trained in herbal medicine, if you are serious about taking herbal supplements. Do your research before, however, because naturopaths are not licensed in every state or country.
You can also ask a pharmacist, who is most likely aware of any possible drug-herb interactions., Just like any medication or vitamin, herbal supplements have daily dosage suggestions. Make sure you look on the label and follow the recommended dosage every day. Your doctor may also give you a different dosage if she believes you need more or less of a specific supplement.


Always follow your doctor's orders over the recommended dosage on the label., If you are taking many different herbal supplements, keep track of what you take, how much you take, and how often. This way, if you have a reaction to anything, you will able to more adequately explain what you are taking.


This will also help you figure out if the supplements you are taking are helping your conditions or not.
If you can't always remember exactly what you are taking, write it down and keep it somewhere safe., When you buy the supplements, you should check the color. Look to see if it is the color that the herb is supposed to be. This may be green, red, or yellow. If the colors are bright, such as bright green instead of brown or gray, the herbs are fresher and shows that they have not been exposed to excessive heat.


Inside the pill capsules, look for signs of mold or mildew. Mold and mildew may show up as dark or grayish/whitish or they may be dusty and powdery.
Keep checking the herbs as you take them. Once they start changing colors, it may be time to get a new bottle.

, Herbal supplements need to be kept in certain conditions. Generally, you should keep them in a cool, dry place. However, certain herbal supplements may have more specific instructions, so always check the label.


Once you buy supplements, keep up with the expiration date. Just like other medication, you should not take herbal supplements if they are out of date. Throw them away once they are expired and buy more that are in date., Before you can buy the right supplement, you need to find safe, quality manufacturers. Dietary supplements are not as highly regulated as prescription medications, which can lead to problems in quality. The best way to do quality analysis is to go to the store, find popular brands, then do online research to check the quality of the manufacturers. They should have website of their own, but you should also look on other websites that discuss the brands you are looking into.You can also use online supplement reviewers such as ConsumerLab. These companies are not affiliated with any manufacturer and do independent testing to assess quality., When you are trying to decide which herbal supplements, research different herbs and figure out which ones will help you. If you are unsure of what herbal supplements you should take, the University of Maryland Medical Center has an extensive database that has a long list of herbs and what they are used for.


You can also look up specific conditions that you suffer from and see what herbs may be helpful.
Also look for studies that give evidence to the claims of the herbal supplements you want to take. There have been numerous medical studies of herbal supplements that validate their usefulness.Be wary of supplements that claim magical healing properties. These are likely bloated statements that are trying to lure you into buying them under false pretenses.

, Before you buy any supplements, check the Federal Drug Administration's Safety Alerts and Advisories website about herbs. It lets you know if any supplements have been recalled, if there are any issues with certain herbs, and if there are manufacturers to avoid., When you are in the store buying supplements, make sure you know all the different names your herb may be packaged as. All herbs have formal botanical names but may have many also have different common names. Getting the right herbal supplements you need for certain conditions is important, because buying a similar named one may cause problems or reactions.For example, boswellia is also known as salai guggal and oregano is known as wild marjoram, Because you have already done research into the best brands of herbal supplements, you know which brands to buy. Pick the brands you found were the best quality.


Look on the label and see if they list that they follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are a set of rules set forth by the FDA., Where the herbal supplements you buy are made is important to their safety. There are many countries that make safe supplements, such as the United States and many European countries. However, there have been many problems with herbs manufactured in India, Mexico and China.


Look on the label of the supplements and avoid those made in these three countries., If you are looking for natural options, look for organic supplements. These herbal supplements will be made from organic herbs, which are grown under safer conditions and made with no genetically modified ingredients.Also see if you can find sustainably grown and pesticide free herbal supplements.

, If you are interested in using locally grown herbs in your supplements, look into a local herbalist. The herbalist should be able to tell you about where he buys (or grows) his herbs. Look online or check local directories to find an herbalist nearby.


If you have seen a naturopathic doctor, call them to find out if they know of a local herbalist.
You also may be able to talk to the people at a local organic grocery to see if they have locally grown herbs.

, If you aren't happy with the herbal supplement selection you can find in stores in your area, think about buying online. Make sure any herbs you buy online meet the same quality standards as others. You also need to make sure that the place you are buying the herbs from can be trusted.


You may be able to find companies online that sell organic products and that use sustainable growing practices.
If you aren't sure, try to call or e-mail the company to ask.

"
"
Ask for a sample.,
Opt for an organic product.,
Observe the color of the herbs.,
Smell the herbs.,
Make certain that you have a pure product.",How to Buy the Best Herbs1," Regardless of how you are buying herbs, it is a good idea get a small sample to help you evaluate them for quality. Buying from a local herbalist is ideal because you will be able to investigate the herbs in person. If you are buying from an online provider, then ask them to send you a sample so that you can decide if you want to purchase herbs from them.;
, Choose an herb provider that uses organic practices to grow their herbs. Herbs that are grown using conventional methods will be contaminated with pesticides and this may affect the potency and quality of the herbs.


If you are buying herbs online, look for products that are produced using organic, sustainable growing practices as well as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). GMPs are sets of rules and regulations set up by the FDA., Color may help you determine the quality of the herbs you are considering buying.Look at the herbs to see if they are green or brown. Greener herbs are fresher than brownish herbs. A green color also indicates that the herbs have not been exposed to excessive heat.


Check for signs of mold or mildew as well. Mold and mildew may be dark or greyish/whitish and may look dusty., Quality herbs should have a pleasant aroma.Smell your herbs to see if they smell how they are supposed to smell. If there is no smell, then the herbs may have been exposed to heat and this can make them less effective.


Steer clear of any herbs that do not how you expect them to smell. For example, if you buy some peppermint that does not smell minty, then it might be an inferior product or it might not be mint at all.

, Some herbs are expensive, so it is important to make sure that you are getting what you paid for. Inspect the herbs to make sure that they have not been filled with other herbs or with another part of the plant.


For example, if the herb is a flower, then only flowers should be in the bag. If the herb is a root, then you should be looking at a root.

Read the label.,
Check the bottle for a USP seal.,
Buy herbal supplements produced in the United States or Europe.,
Evaluate any claims on the package.",How to Buy the Best Herbs2," Herbal supplements are required to include certain information on the package. Before you purchase an herbal supplement, read the label and make sure that it includes:the name of the herbal supplement including the common and Latin name for the herbthe manufacturer’s or distributor’s name and address
the amount, serving size, and active ingredients
a full list of ingredients including inactive ingredients

, Herbal supplements with a United States Pharmacopeial (USP) seal are likely to be of higher quality than those without a USP seal. The USP seal means that the ingredients have been lab-tested and verified by a third party. It also means that what you see listed on the bottle is what is actually in the bottle. An herbal supplement with a USP seal has also been determined to be free of potentially harmful ingredients and has been produced under sanitary conditions that meet the FDA’s guidelines.Steer clear of herbal supplements that do not have a USP seal. Studies have shown that some herbal supplements do not contain the right herb, while others may also contain metals, pesticides, and even prescription drugs., Although herbal supplements from Europe are well regulated, many of the supplements from Mexico, China, and India are not well regulated. Make sure to check the label to determine where the supplement was produced. Avoid any supplements that were not produced in the United States or Europe., Any manufacturer claims the herb will prevent, treat, or cure a disease should have you on your guard. Herbal supplement manufacturers may include information about proven effects of the herb, but they do not have to submit this proof to the FDA. Therefore, some herbal supplement packages may contain information that is not verified.Be wary of any supplements that seem to be making incredible claims about what the supplement can do. For example, if the label claims that a product will prevent or cure a specific disease, then investigate these claims before you purchase and use the product.

"
"
Ask your doctor.,
Look for evidence that the herb is effective.,
Contact the manufacturer.,
Know when to avoid herbal supplements.",How to Buy the Best Herbs3," Before deciding to buy any herbs for supplemental use, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor.Your doctor can help you decide whether or not an herbal supplement is right for you. If you are suffering from a medical condition or turning to herbs as a way to prevent a disease, then your doctor will be able to help you make a plan.

, Manufacturers of herbal supplements are not required to provide proof that their products are effective. That is why it is a good idea to do your own research on an herb before you decide to take it. Look for scientific studies that back up the effectiveness of certain herbs.Try searching for information about herbs on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website: https://nccih.nih.gov/


, If a manufacturer has made claims about their product, but you cannot seem to find any evidence to confirm these claims, try contacting them for more information. Check out the manufacturer’s website or call their customer service number.If you call, try saying something like: “I am interested in your product, but I want to review the scientific studies on this product before I decide to try it. Can you please send me a copy of that information?”

, Certain people should not take herbal supplements because of the risks they may pose. Avoid taking supplements other than those prescribed by your doctor if you are:pregnant or breast feeding
taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications
having surgery in the near future
under the age of 18
over the age of 65

Don't assume that a product is safe because it's considered ""natural."" According to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, it is the company’s responsibility to make sure its products are safe and that any claims made about such products are true.Unfortunately, you cannot trust these companies to accurately report what is in their product or that they are safe. Taking a weight loss supplement without the guidance of your doctor is a major risk.

The FDA has found weight-loss products tainted with harmful ingredients, including sibutramine (an ingredient found in Meridia, which was removed from the market in 2010 because it caused heart problems and strokes); fluoxetine (he active ingredient found in Prozac); as well as hidden active ingredients found in ""prescription drugs, unsafe ingredients that were in drugs that have been removed from the market, or compounds that have not been adequately studied in humans.""Even ""natural"" dietary supplements, like bee pollen or Garcinia cambogia, have been found to contain hidden active ingredients contained in prescription drugs.
It is absolutely essential you speak with your doctor before taking any weight loss supplement.;
, Before taking any weight loss supplement, visit the Office of Dietary Supplements webpage at: https://ods.od.nih.gov/. This particular website lists every dietary supplement, vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement and their effects. This is a far more trustworthy source of information than the labels on the products themselves, as the labels cannot necessarily be trusted.


You can also check the website of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicines. The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (www.naturaldatabase.com/) allows you to read research regarding dietary supplements and herbal products.The database is only available through prescription, but you may be able to access it through a public library or your doctor.
You can also check the FDA's online list of tainted supplements here: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm234592.htm


, Dietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA, and while they are subject to abide by specific labeling laws (listing all active and inactive ingredients), but a 2007 study found that only 84% of the supplement labels examined included all active ingredients, and less than 50% contained all inactive ingredients.In addition, there are a lot of items that are not required to be listed on the supplement fact panel. Whether it's a naturally occurring compound or the contents of a proprietary blend, there is a lot of information that may be left out from the label. This makes taking a weight loss supplement risky for anyone.


Understanding how to read the labels may still be helpful. The first type of label is the actual supplement name or ""identity claim."" This is just revealing the name of the supplement and that it's being marketed as a dietary or weight loss supplement.The label must also include the supplement fact panel (similar to the nutrition fact panel). This must disclose the serving size of the supplement in addition to the names and quantities of the supplement.Make sure you're clear of how much you're supposed to take per serving.
Bring the supplement to your doctor before taking it so you can discuss whether or not it is safe for you to take.

, Many weight loss supplements contain a variety of ingredients in the pills, tablets or powders. Sticking to a supplement with only one ingredient can make it easier to decide whether or not that supplement is safe for you; however, this does not mean the product is safe.


Again, this is a risk, as you cannot trust that there is indeed only one ingredient contained in the supplement. Remember that these are not regulated by the FDA and there are hidden active ingredients and tainted supplements currently on the market.
Some weight loss supplements contain a blend of ingredients or multiple ingredients in their formulas. In addition, not all of these ingredients may be listed or be well known enough to have any research conducted on them.
Being made from a single ingredient doesn't mean a product is safe, either. Bitter orange, for instance, has similar adverse effects as the banned substance ephedra (which caused heart attacks)., Most dietary supplements, including weight loss supplements, will have some sort of claim on the packaging. This should provide you with information on whether or not it's a trustworthy item. If you see dietary claims that mention very quick weight loss, weight loss without changing diet or exercise, or ""promising"" weight loss (using works like guaranteed weight loss or everyone loses weight) this type of supplement generally is considered a fad and not effective.


For example some claims may be similar to: ""Lose 10 pounds in 10 days,"" or, ""Drop two pant sizes in a week,"" or, ""It's guaranteed to help with weight loss.""
These claims should give you a hint on whether or not these supplements are safe and effective. The more outrageous the claim, the more suspicious you should be.

, Depending on where you're getting your weight loss supplement, you may notice the packaging or website doesn't provide much information about the supplement. Avoid products that don't provide enough information for you to make an educated decision about the safety and efficacy of the product.


If the supplement company doesn't provide any information on the actual ingredients of the supplement, doesn't divulge what's in a ""proprietary blend"", or doesn't list side effects of medication interactions, this is a supplement you should avoid taking.
Also avoid supplements that only use ""testimonials"" from consumers as research for their product or as reasons to use the product. You only want unbiased research reviews about whether or not the product is safe or useful (you will find this information on the Office of Dietary Supplements website).
If any weight loss supplement seems too good to be true, it probably is. Weight loss only occurs with hard work and a lifestyle change., Like any medication, vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement, always talk to your doctor prior to taking or starting any weight loss supplements. Many do interact with prescription medications or could worsen a current health condition.If you feel like you'll need to lose weight, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss appropriate methods of weight loss for you. Talk to them about how much weight loss is appropriate and how you should go about losing weight.
If you're interested in a particular weight loss supplement, bring the supplement with you (or at least the packaging) or print off the nutrition/ingredient label so your doctor can thoroughly evaluate the ingredients or contents of the supplement you want to take.
Make sure you review every prescription medication you're taking and any health conditions you have with your doctor as well. That will help your doctor decide whether or not that supplement is safe for you.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight — with or without a weight loss supplement — it's important to set realistic expectations for yourself. You want to set yourself up for success and not be disappointed you couldn't reach an unrealistic goal.


It's typically only recommended to lose about 1 – 2 pounds per week. This includes more traditional diets, calorie counting and the with the use of a weight loss supplement.If you decide to use a weight loss supplement, you may not lose as much weight as you'd like. This is especially true if the supplement doesn't require you to make any changes to your diet, activity level or lifestyle.Decide how much weight you want to lose. If you want to lose a large amount of weight, for example over 20 pounds, using a weight loss pill or herbal supplement alone will most likely not be sufficient to cause these levels of weight loss.

, If you've purchased a weight loss supplement and are planning to start taking it in an effort to lose weight, make sure that you follow the instructions completely.


Some weight loss supplements will require you to only take one tablet or pill whereas others may require you to take multiple tablets daily or increase the dose over time.
Make sure you read the dosing instructions, serving size and day-to-day instructions so you're taking the supplement as recommended.
It is never recommended or considered safe to take more than the recommended dosage or take a supplement longer than recommended. This may lead to adverse or negative side effects.

, A journal is a great tool to help you lose weight. Start a journal when you begin a weight loss supplement to help you stay on track and stay accountable with your weight loss program.


You can use your journal for a variety of things. You can track your food, exercise and thoughts on how your diet is going.
Keeping track of your food and exercise has been shown to help people lose more weight and be able to keep off the weight long-term.It would also be beneficial to note what type of supplement you're taking, how much or dosage, the regimen and any side effects you're noticing from taking the supplement.

, If you are interested in a medication that might assist you with weight loss, consider prescription weight loss medications as an aid instead of supplements. These are regulated by the FDA, unlike supplements.


There are a variety of prescription weight loss medications available. They will only be prescribed through your primary care doctor or a weight loss doctor. In addition, you will need to visit that doctor on a regular basis and they have to clear you as a good candidate to use weight loss medications.There are several medications your physician can prescribe for you. Most help suppress your appetite which can make following a diet easier. Some also prevent your body from absorbing nutrients — like fat.These drugs do come with some side effects, which may be mild or severe.In addition, these drugs are generally only used on a short-term basis. You will need to maintain your diet and active lifestyle in order to maintain your weight loss., Even with a weight loss medication or supplement, it's important to be physically active. Exercise helps improve your health and also helps support weight loss and long-term weight maintenance.


It's recommended to include about 2 1/2 hours of aerobic or cardio exercises each week. You can do walking, jogging, cycling, swimming or hiking.It's also recommended to include two or three days of strength training each week. Work your muscles for at least 20 minutes with exercises like lifting weights, yoga or pilates.In addition to weight loss, regular physical activity can help decrease your cholesterol, decrease your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer and improve your mood., One mistake some people make is they don't change the unhealthy or high-calorie foods they eat while taking a weight loss supplement. Limit these foods so you can effectively lose weight using a weight loss supplement.


Junk foods, fried foods or treats generally are items that come with more calories, fat and sugar. They can increase your risk of weight gain but also of chronic diseases like diabetes.Limit foods like: chips, crackers, pretzels, candy, cakes/pies, cookies, ice cream, breakfast pastries and fried foods.
Also limit your intake of sweetened beverages. These liquid calories are equally unhealthy. Stay away from fruit juices, sweet tea, sweetened coffee drinks, sports or electrolyte drinks and sodas.

, Lean protein is an essential nutrient to your diet and plays an important role in weight loss. Make sure you eat adequate amounts of protein everyday to support your desire to lose weight.


Protein helps keep you feeling satisfied longer throughout the day. If you're not feeling as hungry, you may end up eating less overall.To meet your minimum daily needs for protein, make sure to have a serving or two of lean protein at every meal. Measure out 3 – 4 oz or about 1/2 cup per serving.Stick to lower calorie, lower fat protein sources like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes, tofu, lean beef, seafood or pork.

, In addition to protein, both fruits and vegetables are essential to a nutritious weight loss diet. Filling up on these foods can help speed up weight loss.


Both fruits and vegetables are naturally lower in calories and higher in fiber (plus a whole bunch of other vitamins and minerals). They can add bulk to your meals and keep you feeling more satisfied.Making half of your plate or your meals and snacks a fruit or a vegetable automatically makes your meals a little lower in calories. Aim to do this for most if not all of your meals.
Measure out the appropriate serving sizes of these items as well. One serving is 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad or 1/2 cup of fruit., The last food group that's essential to a well-balanced, nutritious diet are grains. Like fruits and vegetables, they're a great source of fiber and can help support your weight loss.The important thing when choosing and consuming grains is to aim to pick 100% whole grains. These grains are less processed and are higher in fiber and other essential nutrients compared to refined grains.Stick to 100% whole grains like: brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta or barley.
Also measure out the appropriate serving size of these foods. Go for about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving."

Eat the recommended daily value of vitamin B12.,
Eat foods rich in vitamin B-12.,
Monitor your vitamin B12 intake closely if pregnant or breastfeeding.,
Take a vitamin supplement.,
Avoid smoking, and drink only in moderation.",How to Avoid B12 Deficiency1," Daily values are assessed according to the approximate daily recommended amount of a specific nutrient for a healthy adult. For vitamin B12, the daily value is 6.0 mcg. If you consume meat daily, you’re likely already consuming this amount; however, absorption of vitamin B12 can be complicated by several factors. In any event, monitor your diet to ensure you’re getting enough vitamin B12.


See the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Nutrient Database website for more information. The website includes extremely specific lists of food organized by nutrient content.;
, There are several animal products and fortified foods that are sources of high amounts of vitamin B12. Fish and other seafood, meat, eggs, and dairy are especially good sources. If you’re a vegetarian, opt for cereals or nutritional yeasts that have been fortified with vitamin B12.Clams and beef liver each contain over 10 times the recommended daily value of vitamin B12 in a single 3-ounce serving.
Rainbow trout, sockeye salmon, and tuna are the next three natural sources of food with the highest content per serving.
If you’re vegetarian, eat a serving of a breakfast cereal that contains 100% of the daily value of vitamin B12 every day. Check to make sure the cereal includes this vitamin in particular, as some fortified cereals vary.

, Aside from lifestyle decisions such as not eating meat, there are other factors that increase your need to consume extra vitamin B12. For instance, if you had a poor diet as an infant, or you are currently pregnant or breastfeeding, you need to closely monitor your vitamin B12 intake.The recommended daily allowance of vitamin B12 for a pregnant woman is 2.6 mcg, and 2.8 mcg per day for a nursing woman. These should be considered minimum amounts to consume daily.
If you are thinking of getting pregnant, you should consider taking vitamin B12 one month before you plan to conceive. Choose a prenatal vitamin with 400 of folic acid. Show your doctor your prenatal vitamins to make sure it is right for you.
Recall that the recommended daily value for a healthy adult, which better reflects the relationship between food servings and access to the nutrients they provide, is 6.0 mcg.

, If you’re know you’re not meeting the recommended daily value of vitamin B12 or other vitamins, consider taking a multivitamin. While eating a healthy diet is a better way to get the vitamins your body needs, multivitamins are a good option if your diet is restricted.Talk to your doctor if you’re unsure about which types of vitamins to take, and whether this may be the best approach to ensuring you’re getting sufficient nutrients.
Know that your ability to absorb vitamin B12 from a dietary supplement is limited by your stomach's natural contents. For example, taking a 500 mcg supplement orally will only lead to the actual absorption of only about 10 mcg of the vitamin.
In addition to oral supplements, you can also get tablets or lozenges that will dissolve beneath your tongue, and even liquid supplements. While different mediums are said to provide greater ""bio-availability,"" there is not a considerable difference between your body's ability to absorb oral vs. sublingual forms of vitamin B12.

, Both smoking and drinking alcohol can interfere with the absorption of vitamins and contribute to various forms of deficiency-related anemia.If you smoke, begin the process of quitting by talking to your doctor about the options to help you do so. Drink one to two drinks a day, at most.

Watch for mild symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.,
Know the natural causes of vitamin B12 deficiency.,
Stay on the lookout for severe symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.,
Recognize the effects that certain surgeries and behaviors may have.",How to Avoid B12 Deficiency2," Symptoms that may indicate your body is lacking in vitamin B12 can include extensive discomfort. While this deficiency may lead to serious issues involving your cardiovascular health and cognitive function, it will also your daily energy levels and physical endurance.In terms of energy, you may feel fatigued, unable to concentrate, short of breath, and even light-headed when standing or following exercise.
You may lose your appetite, and your skin may become more pale than usual. Your tongue may swell and redden, and your gums may bleed more easily.
You may suffer from diarrhea or constipation.

, In addition to a dietary deficiency leading to an inadequate amount of vitamin B12, there are several health conditions that reduce your body’s ability to absorb the nutrient, and thus may also place you at greater risk. If any of these medical conditions apply to you, make sure you account for their potential effect on your nutritional absorption.There are five things that need to happen for the absorption of B12. These include dietary intake, acid-pepsin in the stomach to liberate B12 from proteins, pancreatic proteases to free B12, secretion of intrinsic factor by parietal cells, and an intact ileum that can absorb Intrinsic Factor-B12 Complex.
Be aware that any diseases that complicate digestion — including Crohn's or celiac disease — may diminish your body’s access to nutrients. Fortunately, if these diseases are properly treated, any vitamin B12 absorption issues may also be resolved.
Note that pernicious anemia, which affects your stomach’s supply of something called intrinsic factor, makes it extremely hard for your body to process vitamin B12. Your doctor will help plan a specific treatment regimen if you are found to be lacking in intrinsic factor.

, Low amounts of vitamin B12 for long periods of time can lead to very serious health issues, including nerve damage. Initial signs of nerve damage include depression and other changes in mental state, a diminished sense of balance, and a tingling numbness in your legs or hands in feet.These neurological symptoms may become apparent without the presence of anemia — which is a condition of the blood.
Watch out for neurological issues, as early intervention is vital to avoiding potentially irreversible damage., Namely, if you get any type of surgery that removes parts of your stomach or intestines — including the various forms of gastric bypass operations — speak to your doctor about how they this may affect you vitamin B12 absorption. Relatedly, know that the habitual use of antacids and/or heartburn medication may also lead to complications regarding vitamin absorption.One of the most integral aspects of recovering from a gastric bypass or other surgery that affects your gastrointestinal system is ensuring that your body is still able to absorb enough vitamin B12. Be sure that your dietary regimen accounts for this necessity following such a surgery, and know that you will likely also have to take supplements of vitamin B12.
If you have been taking antacids or heartburn medication for a long time, make sure your doctor knows about this when talking with them about a potential vitamin B12 deficiency.

See a doctor for a professional assessment.,
Choose a treatment option based on the cause of the deficiency.,
Get vitamin B12 injections.",How to Avoid B12 Deficiency3," If you are concerned about your nutritional intake or any recurring symptoms that may be related to vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, see a healthcare professional as soon as possible. One of the first exams you will receive is a physical examination to ensure that there are not issues with your reflexes.Other important tests you should talk about with your doctor are your complete blood count, your reticulocyte count, your LDH protein level, and your actual vitamin B12 level.
Causes of B12 deficiency include pernicious anemia, gastrectomy or gastritis, H. pylori infection, age, intestinal disorders, tapeworm infestation, medication, inadequate dietary intake, and HIV infection.

, If there are no health complications that make it harder for your body to process vitamin B12, you can likely simply add more of this nutrient to your diet. Follow any of your doctor’s recommendations regarding dietary changes, and consider taking vitamin supplements if you are unable to adjust your diet.The goal of any type of vitamin B12 deficiency treatment is to increase your levels of vitamin B12. This may only require dietary changes.
Treatment options that your doctor may recommend also include high-dose vitamin B12 tablets, or even vitamin B12 injections.

, If you have a medical or lifestyle complication that prevents your body’s absorption of the nutrient, injections are a viable route to ensure you’re still getting the vitamin B12 your body needs. Again, your body’s ability to absorb vitamin B12 is the primary factor in determining whether these injections are a necessary form of treatment, as taking vitamin B12 supplements by mouth is adequate treatment for most patients.If your doctor deems it necessary for you to receive injections, know that you may need several injections within the first few months of treatment.
After a few months of treatment, you will likely need one shot per month, potentially for the rest of your life.

Talk to your doctor before taking any supplement mixes.,
Do your homework.,
Don’t take supplements.,
Look for USP or other certification.,
Keep away from powdered drink supplements.",How to Avoid Risky Supplement Mixes1," You and your doctor can discuss how a specific supplement or supplement mix may impact your health based on your prior medical history and your current medication regimen. If your doctor approves your supplement use, be sure to find out the name, brand, and concentration of the supplement you can take.If you’re considering altering your supplement mix — for instance, by moving up from 500 mg capsules of fish oil to 700 mg capsules of fish oil — let your doctor know.
Only your doctor is qualified to help you find a supplement mix that works for you.;
, Lots of supplements don’t contain what they say they contain, or don’t contain it in the quantities that is supposed to be present. Other supplements contain harmful additives. Talk to your doctor for recommendations as to which supplement brands can be trusted.Always check for an expiration or “best by” date before buying.
The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t review herbal supplements.
Don’t believe the hype. Lots of supplements have only a minimal effect — if any — on the condition or symptom they are meant to cure. Even if your doctor approves the use of a certain supplement, don’t expect it to be a silver bullet.

, The best way to avoid risky supplement mixes is to avoid taking supplements at all. Instead of popping supplements to solve your health problems, adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating right and getting regular exercise.A diet based primarily on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is the best way to eat. About 20% of all calories should come from lean proteins like soy, poultry, nuts, and seeds. Avoid eating processed foods high in sugar, salt, and fat. Limit your intake of red meat and alcohol.
Stay active. Adults should get at least 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week. You can start out by walking, biking, or jogging at least ten minutes each day to improve your health. As your endurance improves, spend more time exercising. Invite a friend to double the fun!If you’re overweight, identify the weight you should be at, and reduce your caloric intake while at the same time increasing your physical activity levels. Talk to your doctor about what your ideal weight is.

, Certification ensures that the supplements you’re buying are safe and high-quality. Only trust valid certification and verification organizations when deciding what supplements to purchase.Don’t confuse vague certifications or appeals to authority with legitimate certification processes. For instance, some supplement mixes have phrases like “physician approved” or “physician tested.”
Trusted supplement verification organizations include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and ConsumerLab.com.

, Powdered drink mixes are especially risky for young people, who may experience liver damage after ingesting them. Hydroxycut, for instance, can cause your metabolism to go into overdrive and damage your body.These powdered drink mixes may be advertised as protein supplements, vitamin supplements, or energy supplements.
They might also be advertised as metabolism-controlling supplements.

Be careful with fish oil.,
Use caution with black cohosh.,
Use caution with Saint John’s wort.,
Use caution with gingko biloba.,
Look out for coenzyme Q10.,
Use garlic supplements with care.,
Use caution with erectile dysfunction supplements.",How to Avoid Risky Supplement Mixes2," One of the most widely-used supplements, fish oil is used to keep the heart healthy; however, fish oil supplements can lead to excessive bleeding if combined with heart medications like anticoagulants. One type of anticoagulant in particular, warfarin (commercially available under the names Coumadin or Jantoven), can make fish oil supplements risky., Black cohosh is an herbal supplement derived from the North American plant of the same name. You might use it to cope with menopausal disorders, vaginitis, uterine spasms, or painful menstruation. But when paired with atorvastatin (more commonly known by the brand name Lipitor) or other statins, black cohosh might lead to liver toxicity.Even if it isn’t mixed with another supplement or medication, there is some concern that black cohosh could be toxic to the liver.

, St. John’s wort is intended to treat mild depression. But if it’s mixed with other antidepressants — especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — you can develop serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a condition that can cause shivering and diarrhea. More serious symptoms include confusion, fever, seizures, and even death., Gingko biloba is a supplement designed to improve memory and mental function. But like fish oil, it can interfere with a warfarin prescription and cause internal bleeding., Coenzyme Q10 — also known as CoQ10 — is a naturally occurring enzyme used to heal the heart when it suffers damage, especially after cancer treatment. But one of its side effects is that it decreases the efficacy of Warfarin and similar blood thinners.


Your doctor might be able to adjust your warfarin dosage in order to allow you to take CoQ10. Talk to them about this possibility.

, Garlic supplements may interfere with a variety of medications, making them less effective. HIV/AIDS medications (like saquinavir) and tuberculosis-fighting medications (like isoniazid) are broken down faster in the presence of garlic supplements, meaning they will be less effective.But don’t worry about eating garlic. Garlic supplements contain far higher concentrations of garlic than a regular slice of garlic toast or other garlicky edible.

, Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition common in aging men in which they are unable to achieve or maintain an erection. There are a host of plant-based supplements thought to treat ED, including tribulus, yohimbine, and horny goat weed. If mixed with nitrates, these supplements could lead to low blood pressure.Many heart disease medications are nitrates, including isosorbide mononitrate and dinitrate, and multiple drugs whose generic names begin with nitroglycerin (such as nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, nitroglycerin lingual aerosol, and nitroglycerin pump spray).

Use caution with vitamin D. Vitamin D is used to strengthen bones and improve cognitive function.,
Be careful with potassium supplements.,
Keep an eye on your vitamin B supplement intake.",How to Avoid Risky Supplement Mixes3," It’s usually considered one of the most harmless supplements, but in combination with certain other supplements or drugs, it can be harmful.In combination with diuretics (water pills) used to treat hypertension and edema — common symptoms of heart disease — vitamin D can cause kidney stones, weak bones, and mental problems.
Common diuretics include chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide.

, One class of hypertension medications — ACE inhibitors — work by preventing one of the enzymes responsible for narrowing the blood vessels from doing its job. Potassium can also regulate blood pressure, but when combined with an ACE inhibitor medication, your body might end up retaining too much potassium, leading to muscle fatigue arrhythmia, and paralysis.Common ACE inhibitors include captopril, moexipril, benazepril, and fosinopril., Vitamin B3 — also known as niacin — can interact adversely with statins, a class of drugs used to regulate cholesterol, which in turn affects blood pressure. Taken together, niacin and statins can lead to fatigue or kidney failure."

Consume foods that are naturally high in vitamin D.There are very few foods that are naturally high in vitamin D. If you can find some that are and consume them on a regular basis, you will optimize your body's ability to naturally absorb vitamin D. Foods that are naturally high in vitamin D include

:

Salmon
Tuna
Mackerel
Sardines
Cod liver oil
Eggs, cheese, and beef liver contain small amounts of vitamin D;
,
Choose foods that have been fortified with vitamin D.Because foods that naturally contain vitamin D are hard to come by, there are regulations in many places in the world (including the United States and Canada) that certain foods be fortified with vitamin D prior to being sold at the grocery store.,
Ensure that you are consuming the daily recommended amount of vitamin D. The dietary recommended intake of vitamin D is 600 IU (international units) per day for most adults.Most food labels contain information about the nutrients contained in that food — you can generally find the percent of daily value per serving of food for each nutrient.",How to Absorb Vitamin D1,", Foods fortified with vitamin D compose the majority of vitamin D in most people's diets. These foods include:


Milk
Margarine
Some breakfast cereals
Some brands of orange juice
Some bread products
Some yogurt

, Look at your food labels to see what percentage of daily recommended vitamin D you are getting, and try to plan your diet so that you are consuming 100% of the daily recommended intake.


Note that the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 IU for infants less than one year old.
The daily recommended amount of vitamin D is 800 IU for adults over 70 years old.
These recommendations may also change if you have an illness that interferes with your body's natural ability to absorb vitamin D.

While it’s ok to add a multi-vitamin or supplements to your water, try and get as many of these as possible from foods.Consult with your doctor before taking vitamins and supplements to ensure they are safe for you.
Be aware of vitamin “megadoses,” which may be detrimental to your health.
Taking too many of them for a long time can have harmful effects. Effervescent Vitamin and mineral supplements have up to 1g of salt per tablet.;
, You can buy tablets to crush, a prepared powder, or liquid vitamin supplements, which will dissolve better than tablets. Deciding on the type of vitamin to take is an important step in knowing how to add vitamins to water.


Remember that Vitamins C and the B Complex are the only supplements you can mix with water to get their nutritional value. Other vitamins need fat to circulate through your system.
Buy single pills of vitamin C or B complex at your local pharmacy and crush them.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or health store specialist if there are powdered or liquid versions of the vitamins you can mix with water.

, If you decide to use vitamin pills in your water, you’ll need to pulverize them before you mix them into the water. Use a mortar and pestle or a pill crusher.Make sure the vitamins are ground into a fine powder so that they mix easily into the water.Be aware that not fully pulverizing the pills could make it difficult for your body to absorb them.Crush only the recommended daily dose of your vitamin.

, If you chose to use a powdered vitamin or liquid form, read the packaging label. This can help you know the amount to mix with water for optimal absorption.


Avoid taking more than the recommended value per day. This can help prevent serious health conditions from consuming too many vitamins.

, Once your supplement powder or liquid are ready, you’re ready to mix them with your water. Make sure to shake the mixture well in a clean bottle so that the vitamins are able to be easily absorbed in your system.


Use boiled or distilled water, not plain tap water.
Fill the water bottle ¾ full and then add the vitamins. Consider adding them to warm water for better dissolving and absorption by your body., If you prefer to avoid supplements, you can also add whole fruits or vegetables with Vitamins C and B Complex to your water. This may add vitamins to water without chemicals and may add a pleasant flavor as well.Add slices of lemon or orange or your water for a boost of vitamin C.Add raspberries to your water for a boost of B vitamins.You can also get B vitamins from papayas, cantaloupe, and oranges. These can help flavor your water.Try adding a little grapefruit juice. It is low in calories, rich in phytonutrients and anti-oxidants, as well as vitamin A and C.

, Although smoothies are often made with milk, you can add fruits and vegetables to water and blend them into a smoothie. This can help you can vitamins in your water.


Mix vegetables and fruits high in Vitamins C and B Complex to the water and some ice cubes. Consider choices like spinach, kale, strawberries, and blueberries.
Remember that getting vitamins through food is the best way to get them. Adding fruits and veggies high in water-soluble vitamins may be the optimal way to do this.

, There are many waters or beverages on the market that claim to be vitamin-enhanced. But many don’t contain that many vitamins and also have a considerable amount of sugar. In fact, one expert said that vitamin waters are essentially just soft drinks.Drink these beverages if you are in a pinch or want the flavor.

, There are two types of vitamins: water and fat soluble.Water soluble vitamins enter the bloodstream through water while fat soluble vitamins need dietary fat to dissolve.Learning which vitamins are water soluble can help you mix the right vitamins into your water and get optimal nutritional benefits from them.


Be aware that foods such as fruit, vegetables, potatoes, grains, and dairy foods are high in water-soluble vitamins.Exposing water-soluble vitamins to heat can cause them to lose their potency or destroy them altogether.Getting water-soluble vitamins is often easiest by steaming or grilling foods and pouring cooking water into soups or stews., A wide range of vitamins are water-soluble. Informing yourself which vitamins are water soluble can help figure out what supplements or foods to add to your water.The two most prominent water soluble vitamins are:


Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes tissue health and helps your body absorb iron. It may also help heal wounds.B vitamins, including niacin and B-12, help maintain the health of your circulatory system, brain health, cell metabolism and nerve function., You need Vitamin C and the B vitamins to maintain your overall health, and it most cases you’ll get through by eating nutritious whole foods. However, being aware of how much you need daily can help you figure out what supplements you need to add to your water.Women should get 75 mg vitamin C while men should aim for 90 mg.Eating citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, broccoli, spinach and drinking 100% fruit juices can help you reach your vitamin C goal every day.Get the recommended daily dose of the B-vitamins according to the specific vitamin. For example, adults need 2.4 mg of B-12 per day; 400 micrograms of B-9, which is also called folic acid; and 14 – 16 milligrams of B-3, or niacin, every day.Eating a range of foods such as whole and fortified or enriched grains, nuts, peas, meat, shellfish, poultry, eggs, dairy, peanut butter, and bananas can help you get all of the B vitamins you need."

Learn about the role of vitamin A. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions and processes: it helps maintain healthy skin, ensures better night vision, promotes strong teeth and bone formation, keeps tissue and mucous membranes working properly (to prevent infections), and is also needed for digestive health, respiratory functions, reproduction and breastfeeding.,
Recognize the symptoms of a vitamin A deficiency.,
Have your blood tested.,
Have your child tested.,
Take precautions if you're pregnant.,
Eat a variety of vegetables.,
Eat fruit.,
Add animal food sources to your diet.,
Add dairy to your diet.,
Consult with your doctor or a nutritionist.,
Know the recommended limits for children.,
Know the recommended limits for adults.,
Do not exceed the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Ingesting too much vitamin A can cause a host of health problems.",How to Get More Vitamin A,", The most common symptom of late-term vitamin A deficiency is night blindness, or xerophthalmia: difficulty or inability to see at night.Patients with vitamin A deficiencies may also experience ulcerations of the cornea and keratomalacia, the desiccation and ""clouding"" of the cornea.Ulcerations of the cornea are open sores that form in the outer layer of the tissue at the front of your eye.Clouding of the cornea is a loss of visibility through the front of the eye. This part of the eye is normally clear, and clouding can make objects in your sight of vision blurry or completely unobservable.Night blindness first manifests itself through oval- or triangle-shaped patches in the temporal portion of the eyes - that is, the region closest to the outsides of the human face. It is usually present in both eyes and may be accompanied by Bitot's spots (a ""foamy"" buildup of keratin).Night blindness may also manifest as ""starburst"" effects when you look at bright lights in a dark environment.Other symptoms of mild/early-onset deficiency may include chronically dry or ""un-wettable"" eyes, with rough or ""bubbled"" surface features on the eye, though these symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose a vitamin deficiency.
Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat an infection, but it is important to see a doctor to help you change your diet and add supplements as needed., If you're concerned about your vitamin A levels, you can ask your doctor to perform a simple retinol blood test to determine whether you have a vitamin A deficiency. The normal range of vitamin A in the blood for healthy individuals is between 50-200 micrograms per deciliter of blood.You will likely need to refrain from eating or drinking anything up to 24 hours before the test. Check with your doctor for the requirements.If you are found to be deficient, your doctor may advise you to take a vitamin A supplement (unless you are pregnant), or may refer you to a nutritionist who can help you make better dietary choices.

, Children are most likely to be affected by vitamin A deficiency, and may also show signs of slowed growth and increased susceptibility to infection.Children may develop deficiencies from not getting enough vitamin A through milk, or from losing excessive amounts of vitamin A through chronic diarrhea., Vitamin A deficiencies can happen to expecting mothers during the third trimester, as this portion of the pregnancy puts the highest demand on nutrients and vitamins in both mother and fetus.See warnings below––pregnant women should not take synthetic vitamin A supplements unless instructed by a doctor, as high doses of vitamin A can lead to fetal damage.

, Vegetables are an important source of vitamin A by providing you with carotenoids like beta-carotene. Most orange/yellow/red vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, squash, carrots, and pumpkin, contain vitamin A. Dark green veggies like kale, spinach, and lettuce are also wonderful sources of vitamin A., Some fruits, such as mangoes, apricots and cantaloupe, have high levels of vitamin A.One whole mango has about 672 micrograms per serving, or about 45% of the daily recommended intake.Dried apricots are an excellent source of vitamin A: one cup yields 764 micrograms of vitamin A. Canned apricots are slightly lower in vitamin A, measuring 338 micrograms per cup.Raw cantaloupe is another good source of vitamin A, with one cup of raw melon yielding 286 micrograms.Some medical experts recommend pregnant women should increase their plant-based vitamin A intake by 40% overall during pregnancy and by 90% overall during breastfeeding., Foods of animal origin provide the ""retinol"" form of vitamin A, which is what your body transforms carotenoids (plant-based vitamin A) into once you've digested them.Retinol-rich foods include liver, eggs, and fatty fish.Because it is absorbed quickly and excreted very slowly, retinol is the form of vitamin A that can be overdosed on, so sourcing vitamin A from such foods needs to be done with care. Look for nausea or vomiting, headaches, loss of appetite, dizziness, and excessive fatigue as signs of acute toxicity.Acute vitamin A toxicity is relatively rare. Chronic toxicity, which is accrued over time, is somewhat more common. Still, an average adult would need to ingest more than 7,500 micrograms (7.5 milligrams) every day for over six years to reach toxic levels, but there is a wide range of variability from person to person. It's best to be cautious and not overdo it on retinol.Retinol levels may also be affected if you use vitamin A skin products, such as creams or acne medications.

, Milk, yogurt, and cheese can also provide you with vitamin A.One cup of milk provides between 10-14% of the daily recommended value of vitamin A.One ounce of cheese typically provides between 1-6% of the recommended daily value of vitamin A., A trusted healthcare professional can guide you in determining what foods would fit best in your diet.


Your doctor may have a specific dietitian/nutritionist to recommend to you. If not, you can find one by contacting your local hospital or other general practitioner's medical offices and asking for recommendations, or searching online.If you live in the U.S., you can find a registered dietitian/nutritionist by searching at Eatright.org, the website of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics., Supplements come in different doses, and it's important to know the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for all supplements you take.


For infants up to 6 months old, the RDA for vitamin A is 400 micrograms (0.4 milligrams).
For infants 7-12 months old, the RDA for vitamin A is 500 micrograms (0.5 milligrams).
For children 1-3 years old, the RDA for vitamin A is 300 micrograms (0.3 milligrams).
For children 4-8 years old, the RDA for vitamin A is 400 micrograms (0.4 milligrams).
For children 9-13 years old, the RDA for vitamin A is 600 micrograms (0.6 milligrams).
For children 14-18 years old, the RDA 700 micrograms (0.7 milligrams) for girls and 900 micrograms (0.9 milligrams) for boys., Adults will need more vitamin A than children, and as with all supplements you take, it's important to know the recommended dietary allowance (RDA).


For men 19 years old and up, the RDA for vitamin A is 900 micrograms (0.9 milligrams).
For women 19 years old and up, the RDA for vitamin A is 700 micrograms (0.7 milligrams).
For pregnant women 18 years old or younger, the RDA for vitamin A is 750 micrograms (0.75 milligrams).
For pregnant women 19 years old and up, the RDA for vitamin A is 770 micrograms (0.77 milligrams).
For breastfeeding women 18 years old or younger, the RDA for vitamin A is 1,200 micrograms (1.2 milligrams).
For breastfeeding women 19 years old and up, the RDA for vitamin A is 1,300 micrograms (1.3 milligrams).,


Infants less than one year old should not exceed 600 micrograms (0.6 milligrams) of vitamin A.
Children 1-3 years old should not exceed 600 micrograms (0.6 milligrams) of vitamin A daily.
Children 4-8 years old should not exceed 900 micrograms (0.9 milligrams) of vitamin A daily.
Children 9-13 years old should not exceed 1,700 micrograms (1.7 milligrams) of vitamin A daily.
Children 14-18 years old should not exceed 2,800 micrograms (2.8 milligrams) of vitamin A daily.
Adults 19 years and up should not exceed 3,000 micrograms (3 milligrams) of vitamin A daily."

Understand the importance of magnesium.,
Understand magnesium absorption.,
Determine how much magnesium you should be consuming.,
Look for signs that you are not getting enough magnesium.,
Try getting your magnesium through food.,
Choose a magnesium supplement.,
Watch out for signs that you have taken too much magnesium.,
Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking.,
Consider taking vitamin D. Some studies suggest that increasing your vitamin D can help your body to absorb magnesium.You can eat vitamin D rich foods, like tuna, cheese, eggs, and fortified cereals.,
Keep your minerals in balance.,
Reduce alcohol consumption.,
Be extra vigilant of magnesium levels if you are diabetic.,
Take magnesium throughout the day.,
Watch what you eat.",How to Best Absorb Magnesium Supplements," Every organ in your body needs magnesium to work properly.It contributes to several important functions. These include:


Regulating the function of muscles and nerves
Maintaining proper blood pressure and blood sugar
Generating protein, bone, and DNA
Regulating calcium levelsAiding sleep and relaxation;
, As important as magnesium is, it can sometimes be difficult for our bodies to get enough. This is mainly because many people just don't take it in in their diets. But there are also other factors that can get in the way of absorption, such as:


Too much (or not enough) calciumMedical causes such as diabetes, Crohn's disease, or alcoholismMedical drugs that block absorptionAnother reason that many people, Americans especially, lack magnesium, is that our soil is virtually depleted of magnesium. This causes a significant decrease in our subsequent crops.

, This amount varies based on age, gender, and other factors. In general, adult males should not consume more than 420 mg a day and females should not go over 320 mg.


It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about how much magnesium you should consume, especially if you think you might be deficient.
Make sure to check your multivitamin for magnesium to ensure you are not over-consuming with a multi-vitamin along with a magnesium supplement. The same is true of calcium, as this is usually also found in magnesium supplements.
Make sure to mention any chronic medical conditions. Conditions such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy and Crohn's disease interfere with magnesium absorption.They may also cause magnesium loss through diarrhea.
Be aware of the effects of aging. The body's ability to absorb magnesium decreases as we age. The excretion of magnesium also increases.Studies have also found that as we get older, our diet tends to include less magnesium. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interact with magnesium.
Always talk to your doctor before giving magnesium supplements to children., If your lack of magnesium is only a short term condition, you most likely won’t see any symptoms.But, if you consistently do not get enough magnesium, you may begin to show symptoms. These include:Nausea
Vomiting
Loss of appetite
Fatigue
Muscle spasms and cramps
If your magnesium deficiency is severe, you may experience tingling or numbness. Seizures, a skipping heartbeat, and even personality changes can also occur.
If you are experiencing any of these problems on an ongoing basis, see a health professional.

, Unless you have a medical condition that makes it hard to absorb magnesium, you should be able to get enough by eating the right foods. You should consider managing your diet before you start taking supplements. Foods that are rich in magnesium include:Nuts like almonds and Brazil nuts
Seeds like pumpkin and sunflower seeds
Soy products like tofu
Fish like halibut and tuna
Dark, leafy greens like spinach, kale and Swiss chard
Bananas
Chocolate and cocoa powder
Many spices such as coriander, cumin, and sage

, If you decide to take a supplement, select one that contains a form of magnesium that is easily absorbed. Supplements to look for include those that contain any of these:Magnesium aspartate. This form of magnesium is chelated (attached) to aspartic acid. Aspartic acid is an amino acid that is common in protein-rich foods that makes the magnesium easier to absorb.Magnesium citrate. This comes from the magnesium salt of citric acid. The magnesium concentration is relatively low, but it is easily absorbed. It has a mild laxative effect.Magnesium lactate. This is a moderately concentrated form of magnesium commonly used for treating digestive issues. It should not be taken by anyone with kidney problems.Magnesium chloride. Another easily absorbed form of magnesium, this type also aids kidney function and metabolism.

, While it would be hard to eat too much magnesium, you could take too many magnesium supplements. Doing this would result in magnesium toxicity, which could cause symptoms like:Diarrhea
Nausea
Abdominal cramping
In extreme cases, irregular heartbeat and/or cardiac arrest

, Taking magnesium can affect some medications. Medications may also affect your body’s ability to absorb the magnesium supplements you take. These medications include:


Diuretics
Antibiotics
Bisphosphonates, such as those prescribed for osteoporosis
Medications used to treat acid reflux

,
You can also absorb vitamin D by spending time out in the sunshine.

, Some minerals will make it harder for your body to absorb magnesium. You should avoid taking mineral supplements at the same time that you take your magnesium supplement.In particular, either an excess or a shortage of calcium in your body can make it harder to absorb magnesium. While taking magnesium supplements, avoid excess calcium.At the same time, don't forgo calcium entirely, as this can hinder magnesium absorption.
Studies have also found that magnesium and potassium levels appear to be related. The nature of this relationship is not yet clearly understood.Even so, you should not dramatically increase or abstain from potassium while trying to increase your magnesium levels.

, Alcohol increases the amount of magnesium that we secrete in our urine. Studies have found that many alcoholics have low magnesium levels.Alcohol causes a prompt and substantial increase in the urinary excretion of magnesium and other electrolytes.This means that even moderate drinking can decrease your magnesium levels.
Magnesium levels fall the lowest among individuals going through alcohol withdrawal.

, If diabetes is not controlled well through diet, lifestyle and medication, a magnesium deficiency may occur.Diabetics pass too much magnesium out of the body through the urine. As a result, magnesium levels can drop off quickly if not closely monitored.

, Rather than taking your magnesium as one dose, take smaller amounts throughout the day, with your meals and a full glass of water. Your body will be better able to process it in this way.


Some suggest taking your magnesium supplement on an empty stomach if you are having problems with absorption. Sometimes the minerals in the food in your stomach can interfere with your body's ability to absorb magnesium. But, this sometimes causes an upset stomach.In fact, the Mayo Clinic suggests taking magnesium only with meals. Taking it on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea.Time-release preparations may also aid absorption., Like minerals, there are some foods that may keep your body from properly absorbing magnesium. Avoid eating these foods around the same time of day that you take your magnesium supplements:


Foods that are very high in fiber and phytic acid. These include bran products or whole grain items like brown rice, barley, or whole wheat bread.
Foods that are high in oxalic acid (oxalate). These include coffee, tea, chocolate, leafy greens, and nuts.Steaming or boiling foods high in oxalate may remove some of it. Consider cooked spinach instead of a spinach salad. Soaking beans and some grains before you cook them may also help.

Add cod liver oil to meals and snacks.",How to Take Cod Liver Oil for Health," Carefully review concentrations of vitamins and other ingredients in all supplements. Buy only supplements that abide by recognized manufacturing standards. Search for a supplement that uses purified sources and can provide full detail about concentrations of mercury, heavy metals, and other potential contaminants.Look for supplements that are endorsed or reviewed by the USP (US Pharmacopeial Convention) — this will be noted on the label. The USP ensures high quality standards for ingredients and manufacturing practices for supplement companies.Also, examine the levels of Vitamins A and D to make sure that you will not be consuming higher levels of them than is advisable. Most adults should not exceed 10000 IU of Vitamin A and 5000 IU of Vitamin D each day.Not all cod liver oil supplements are created equal. You may have to try several varieties before finding one that most appeals to you and meets quality standards;
, There is no nutritional difference between the two types of supplements. However, capsules can be slightly more expensive. Whether you take a capsule or a liquid version of cod liver oil is purely a decision of preference.


Liquid supplements often have a noticeable fishy taste, which can often be avoided by taking a supplement in capsule form. Belching a fishy smell or taste is a common side effect of both supplement forms.
Consider chilling your cod liver oil capsules or liquid if the taste is not pleasant.

, Dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, protein and herbal supplements) are not approved by the FDA prior to marketing and distribution to the public.It's important to be aware of how a supplement may make you feel.


Common side effects of cod liver oil supplements include: belching, bad breath, heart burn and nose bleeds.High or excessive doses may cause: increased chance of bleeding, disrupted blood clotting, nausea, loose stools, toxic levels of Vitamin A and D, and hypotension., Although many supplements are most likely harmless, you can never be too sure. Supplements may interact with medications or health conditions you have. Speaking to your doctor before taking any type of supplement is a wise decision. Be sure to review:


Why you want to take cod liver oil and how you think it may help or improve your health.
All of your other medications and any other supplements you are taking. Some medications, like blood thinners or medications for high blood pressure, are enhanced by fish oil supplements.Possible contraindications or instances where cod liver oil will be unsafe. Pregnant women or women who are nursing and those with certain bleeding conditions are typically not advised to take fish oil supplements, including cod liver oil., Speaking to a nutrition expert like a dietitian can help you to evaluate your diet and determine whether supplements are even necessary. Some people are able to get sufficient Vitamins A and D and healthy fatty acids from their diets.


Ask for advice on what foods to add to your diet or how to incorporate cod liver oil into your diet.

, Most supplements are sold in a variety of dosages. It's important to find a supplement and dosage that's appropriate for you.


In general, for lowering high blood pressure or triglycerides, consume 20 mL daily and to manage and lower high cholesterol, consume 30 mL daily.It's best to start with a low dosage and slowly increase to make sure you do not have any adverse side effects., If you're using the liquid version of this supplement, you'll need to find some creative ways to sneak it into your diet. Cod liver oil isn't the most pleasant tasting or smelling supplement.


If opting to buy the liquid form, there are a variety of tips and tricks to get the dosage down. You can pinch your nose and take it like a shot of cough syrup, mix it in a smoothie or other favorite beverages, drizzle it over salads, or mix with a teaspoon of honey.
Some cod liver oil supplements add a little flavoring like ginger or lemon to slightly mask the flavor and smell. These types of supplements might work well if you're sensitive to the taste.

Make an effort to get sun exposure, particularly if you live in certain climates.Some areas of the world are naturally easier to get exposure to sunlight (those areas that are geographically near the equator), as opposed to northern latitudes; however, regardless of where you find yourself on the globe, there are opportunities to take advantage of sunlight as a way to produce more vitamin D.


The optimum time to get sun exposure to produce vitamin D is between 10am – 3pm, as these tend to be the hours of peak sunlight.,
Expose your skin if you are wanting to maximize vitamin D production.Although we are culturally and socially trained to wear long clothing and sunscreen to protect ourselves from the sun's rays, if you are wanting to produce vitamin D (and particularly if you live in a northern climate or it is a less sunny time of the year, such as the winter), you will want to expose more skin in order to maximize your vitamin D production.

,
Ensure that you are getting sun exposure in a safe way.While sunlight is one of the best ways to increase your vitamin D, once you have gotten your dose of sunlight, you must continue to exercise caution in the sun, even if it is cloudy or overcast.",How to Absorb Vitamin D2," Five to thirty minutes of sun exposure a couple of times per week should be sufficient to meet most people's vitamin D requirements.
Note that people with naturally darker skin require more sunlight to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D in the skin. This is because people with darker skin have more UV protection from the increased amount of melatonin in their skin.
Also, people of older age need more sunlight to synthesize vitamin D, as the skin's ability to make vitamin D from sunlight decreases with age.
Note that you are not absorbing vitamin D from the sun; rather, sunlight is what causes your body to produce vitamin D.

,, This means wearing sunscreen and covering your skin. The sun's rays, in addition to being a source of vitamin D, can be cancer-causing if you have too much exposure, particularly at times of the day with peak sunlight.


Experts suggest that five to 30 minutes of sun exposure, without sunscreen at least twice a week should provide adequate vitamin D exposure. As long as your face, arms, legs, and/or back are exposed, you will be able to reap the positive benefit of the sun's rays.
Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so it is stored in the liver and fat, You don't have to get sun exposure every day to have enough Vitamin D
Do not use tanning beds as a source of vitamin D. Although they do indeed provide vitamin D, physicians say that the risks outweigh the benefits. It is better to opt for a combination of natural sunlight combined with dietary sources of vitamin D.

"
"
Determine if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.There are certain medical conditions that put you at a heightened risk of developing vitamin D deficiency.,
See your doctor for a blood test.The best way to have your vitamin D levels tested to see whether or not you are deficient is to have a blood test.,
Take vitamin D supplements if your levels are low.If your vitamin D levels fall below 50 nmol/L, you will likely be advised by your physician to begin oral vitamin D supplements.",How to Absorb Vitamin D3," These include:



Liver disease. Vitamin D that is absorbed through your diet or through sunlight is metabolically inert (i.e. non-functional in the body), until it has undergone two reactions, the first of which occurs in the liver. A damaged liver may be unable to perform these reactions and may result in vitamin D deficiency.

Kidney disease. The second key reaction to metabolize vitamin D and make it functional in your body occurs in the kidneys. Kidney disease may interfere with your body's ability to perform this reaction, which may cause a vitamin D deficiency.
Gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's (a form of inflammatory bowel disease), Celiac disease, and Cystic Fibrosis. All of these impair absorption of nutrients through the digestive tract, and thus may lead to inadequate vitamin D absorption.
Poor nutrition. Those with vegetarian or vegan diets, and/or milk or lactose allergies or intolerances are more susceptible to not getting adequate vitamin D in their diet.
Lack of exposure to sunlight. Those in northern climates with little sunlight are more prone to lacking vitamin D production through the skin.
If you fall into any of the above categories, or if you have had a recent unusual fracture (which may be a sign of vitamin D deficiency as it can lead to weakening of the bones), your doctor will likely recommend a blood test to assess your vitamin D levels.

, Here's how to interpret your blood test results:


A vitamin D level of less than 30 nmol/L indicates that there is a high probability you are deficient.
A vitamin D level of 30 – 50 nmol/L indicates that there is a possibility that you are deficient (there is no exact number that serves as the cutoff).
A vitamin D level of greater than 50 nmol/L indicates that you most likely have sufficient vitamin D.
A vitamin D level over 125 nmol/L indicates that you may have excess (too much) vitamin D.

, It is recommended to consume 400 – 1000 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily, depending upon your degree of deficiency.


1,000 – 1,200 mg of calcium daily is also recommended for those who have been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency.
You will also need to have any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your vitamin D deficiency treated.
Your doctor will advise a repeat blood test three months after beginning vitamin D supplementation to once again assess your levels.

Consider your lifestyle and workout regime.,
Determine how much total protein a day you need.,
Determine how much of your average daily protein intake comes from solid food.,
Decide what kind of protein you want your shake to consist of.,
Read the label.,
Consider when you workout.,
Drink a protein shake after a workout.,
Consider consuming additional protein shakes.,
Make sure to consume protein throughout the day in addition to shakes.",How to Use Protein Shakes," Protein shakes aren't for everyone, but there are some reasons why the average athlete, as opposed to professional athletes or Olympians, would want to use protein supplements. The type of exercise you do will impact whether you need additional protein.Determine whether any of the following apply to you:


Have you started a new exercise program or are you new to working out in general? If you're just hitting the gym for the first time and want to build muscle, your body will need more protein than you might otherwise.
Are you intensifying your workouts? This applies to both cardio and weight training workouts. For example, if you usually do 30 minutes on the elliptical machine three times a week, but are now training for a marathon or a weightlifting competition, you're going to need more protein to facilitate muscle growth and strength.
Are you recovering from an injury? People who've injured themselves generally need more protein to help their muscles and bodies heal and recover.
Too much protein can be hard on your kidneys in the long term, and it could cause dehydration.;
, Calculating how much protein you need is a key first step to deciding what, if any, additional protein your diet needs.A big myth is that you need a ton of protein to achieve any of the above goals. Protein already accounts for about 15% of the daily caloric intake of most Americans. To build a single pound of muscle, you need about 10-14 additional grams of protein daily, which really isn't that much. Some protein powders have 80 grams of protein in a single serving! The average person doesn't need that much; instead your body just breaks it down for energy. Moreover, too much protein can actually cause harm to your internal organs, including the kidneys and liver.To figure out how much you're getting and whether you need additional protein, you need to do some math.

Recreational athletes need about 0.5-0.75g of protein daily for every per pound of body weight.
Competitive athletes need 0.6-0.9.
Athletes building muscle mass need 0.7-0.9g.
The max amount should not exceed more than 0.9 per pound of body weight.For example, if you are an adult athlete looking to put on muscle and you weigh 175 pounds, you need about 122.5-157.5 g (175 pounds x .7= 122.5 g to 175 pounds x .9= 157.5) of protein per day.

, Consider what you eat in an average day. You can consult with a dietitian or use online nutritional calculators that will tell you how much you're getting once you input the type and amount of food you are consuming.


For example, a 4oz hamburger has 30g of protein, 6oz of tuna has 40g, and 1oz of cheese has 7g. This means that just with these three foods you've ingested 77g of protein, which is nearly half of what you'd need if you weighed about 175 pounds and were looking to build muscle. Most adults probably don't need as much protein coming from shakes as they think they do! However, if you're not meeting the protein requirement you calculated with solid food throughout the day, then you should supplement your diet with a protein shake, either one you make with powder or a pre-made shake.

, Protein shakes use different kinds of proteins and in different amounts. The most common sources of protein are whey, casein, egg, soy, rice, and milk.Whey and casein are good choices, but only if you can tolerate dairy since both are milk products.Whey protein tends to be the most popular for shakes and is the fastest digesting protein.If you prefer a plant-based protein, particularly if you are vegetarian or vegan, you may want to try soy protein.Soy is very rich in nutrients and has been shown to be as effective as most animal sources of protein., Knowing exactly what is in your shake, and especially the amount of protein, is important if buying pre-made shakes, rather than powders. Protein shakes vary in content after all.Make sure the product is more than 50% protein if your goal is to lose body fat.Make sure a single serving isn't way more protein than you actually need. Some powders have 80g of protein in them; if you only need to add an additional 40g to your daily protein intake, then that's not the best product for you.
Look for shakes that provide all 20 amino acids; these are usually the highest quality products.Don't buy proteins that include growth hormones or steroids.Remember that all supplements carry a risk of contamination.

, This should be the determinant factor of when you decide to have a protein shake, since it's meant to supplement and enhance the physical training you are doing.When you consume protein and what you eat should be planned around your workout. For example, if you work out at 5am, a protein shake after the gym at 7am might double as breakfast for you., Post-workout is one of the times that your body needs protein more than ever. This is the most effective time for drinking a protein shake in order to maximize its benefits for your body.


Right after a workout, your body starts to heal and rebuild the muscle. This is important because of the ""micro tears"" in the muscle tissue, those very small tears caused by intense contraction of the muscles during exercise, such as weightlifting. Giving your body protein as soon as possible will make sure it has the fuel it needs to help the muscles heal, rebuild and grow.Protein shakes after a workout are better than solid food because the latter takes longer to digest and break down the protein and send it to the muscles. Protein shakes, on the other hand, only take approximately 30 minutes to reach the muscles after consumption.Have your shake within 45 minutes following a workout. During that time, your muscles are still fired up and your body is better able to absorb the protein and start rebuilding more quickly. The sooner you can have the shake after you finish working out, the better!You can also try drinking other liquids that contain protein after a workout, such as regular or chocolate milk.

, Although having a protein shake after a workout is the optimal time to have one, you can also consume them at different times of the day. You can also have more than one a day but be sure to consider how much protein you are already getting in a day and how much you need. Only have additional shakes if you NEED them to meet your protein requirement for the day. Remember not to overdo it on protein, which can harm your kidneys and your liver.Drink a protein shake first thing in the morning. When you get up in the morning, your body has been inactive for 6-8 hours and is thus lacking nourishment, including protein. Without protein, the muscles in the body start to break down to create energy to keep your body going. Thus, having a protein shake as your breakfast can build muscle and energize the body, thus preventing muscle from breaking down.Drink a protein shake before a workout. Some people like to consume protein before exercise to promote muscle growth, strength, and keep muscles from breaking down over the course of the workout. A pre-workout shake is best consumed approximately 30 minutes before you begin your workout. This give the protein time to be digested and sent to the muscles.Drink a protein shake before bed. Consider having a protein shake about one hour before you plan to go to bed. A shake with casein protein is a good choice. Casein works through your body a bit more slowly than whey, which is good when sleeping because that is when the amount of protein in your body starts to deplete. Effectively, you'll be nourishing the muscle while your growth hormones are elevated., Protein shakes are especially good after workouts but to maximize their benefits, make sure that you are consistently consuming protein. Protein is key for achieving optimal progress in physique enhancement and performanceEven if you aren't bodybuilding or trying to enhance your physique, protein is a key component to good nutrition.


Try to get more protein through natural sources such as milk, eggs, meat and fish because they are unprocessed and have a higher nutritional value as a result. Shakes are a great way to get a large and immediate protein hit after working out, but they are also processed and don't have the same nutrients as protein-rich foods.After your post-workout shake, eat small meals containing high levels of protein at roughly 3-4 hour intervals. This will provide your muscles with a steady supply of protein and hasten the healing process.Eat a breakfast with protein. Breakfast in the morning is key since your body needs nourishment after 7-9 hours of rest."

Mix whey protein into your last meal of the day.,
Determine how much whey protein to incorporate into your diet.,
Supplement your diet with whey protein to encourage weight loss via whey protein shakes.,
Drink a whey protein shake or smoothie before a meal.",How to Use Whey Protein," Too much protein in your daily diet can lead to adverse side-effects, and is particularly hard on your kidneys, so a protein chart is an important tool when adding whey protein to your diet., It is recommended that both male and female adults (19–50) consume 8 grams (0.28 oz) of protein for every 20 pounds of bodyweight (0.8 g of protein per kg) per day. For example, a person weighing 155 pounds (70 kg) should get 56 g of protein per day.In general, speed and strength training athletes should get 1.2–1.7 g of protein per kg of body weight, while an endurance athlete may need more like 1.2–1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight.(To find your weight in kg, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2).
So an athlete weighing 175 lbs. (79 kg) would consume 94.8 g of protein daily to meet the minimum of 1.2 g/kg.

, With the help of a nutritional calculator, calculate how much protein you are getting with each meal and, if necessary, how much protein you consume each week. This will help you determine how much protein you need to supplement your diet with.


There are several online resources for determining the protein content of the foods you eat each day or week. A useful example can be found here.

, If the amount of protein you should have according to your protein requirement chart is more than you are getting from diet alone, you can make up the difference with whey protein. After figuring out your protein intake with a nutritional calculator, subtract the amount of protein you are getting in your diet from the required amount found on your protein requirement chart. The amount of protein left over is what you can get in supplement form from whey protein.


Additionally, if you are a male who exercises regularly, you may benefit from whey protein supplementation to help you recover from exercise more quickly.

, Combining the ingredients in a blender is the most convenient way to make a shake. Follow the instructions on the whey protein container to measure out the proper amount of whey protein powder and blend with the recommended portion of liquid and any other ingredients until smooth.


If you do not have a blender, you can use an electric mixer, blender bottle, or use a whisk or fork to mix the ingredients in a glass or bowl.

, You can buy whey protein in a variety of flavors, which will affect the taste of your smoothie. Flavors include vanilla, strawberry, blueberry, banana, chocolate, and more., Whey protein shakes can be made with fruits and other ingredients to change the flavor and nutritional content. Many recipes can be found in books and online for various preparations of whey protein shakes. To make it easier to blend or mix fruits into whey protein shakes, add liquids first.Depending on your preference, add between one to two cups of one or more of the following:Fruit juice
Banana
Peaches
Pears
Mango
Watery fruits, including oranges, pineapple and watermelon
Milk, soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk or other low-fat milks

, Blended ice cubes will thicken and cool your whey protein shake, giving it the consistency of a smoothie or shake. Alternatively, you can freeze bananas, raspberries and other fruits (or buy them frozen) and add them to the drink. You can even make ice cubes out of milk and use these instead., Whey protein shakes may benefit from the addition of ingredients that improve the flavor. Add these ingredients to your liking and you will improve your shake's flavor. Some ingredients to consider adding include:Honey
Vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon
Yogurt
Dried fruit, including raisins, apricots and dates
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry or other milkshake powders

, Add 1 scoop of whey protein powder to your breakfast cereal, preferably oatmeal. Mix thoroughly with a spoon and eat immediately. Adding whey protein to food in this way lets you increase protein intake without having to adjust your diet too much.


You can add 1 tbsp. (14.1 g) of peanut butter to this mixture for a little extra protein.

, Drink a whey protein shake 30 minutes before exercising. As you work out, your muscle fibers will be broken down, and your stored carbohydrates (glycogen) will become depleted. A pre-workout shake will help prevent muscle breakdown and provide more energy.

, You need to feed your muscles as soon as you are done exercising to help your body recover. There is evidence that consuming whey protein immediately after a workout increases protein synthesis and, as a result, strengthens muscles. , Sprinkle some whey protein powder on food that is part of your last meal of the day. This keeps amino acids in your body at an elevated level as you sleep, which can also assist with building muscle.


You can also drink whey protein before you go to bed to help prevent the protein breakdown that naturally occurs while you sleep, increasing overnight muscle protein synthesis., There are many diet plans available for those who want to use whey protein for this purpose, but in general it is recommended that you only supplement your diet with whey protein rather than replace meals with whey protein shakes. The benefit of supplementing your diet with whey protein is generally that it will help you feel more full, which may cause you to eat less, thereby encouraging weight loss.Include whey protein in a low-calorie diet. Whey protein will work best as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Be aware that high-protein, low-carb diets can have negative side-effects on your health. Always aim for a healthy balance.

, When encouraging weight loss, you will want to include fiber and avoid too much sugar. You can achieve the inclusion of fiber with low sugar by incorporating some fruits and vegetables into your shakes. The following suggestions should help:


Add blueberries or raspberries. Both fruits are high in fiber and low in sugar.
Alternatively, add spinach or cucumber. Both vegetables are high in fiber, and don't taste as strong as some other vegetables, so you can mix them into your shake without making it taste strange.Avoid using honey, maple syrup, or sugar. These contain high amounts of sugar and will be detrimental to a diet plan. The fruit you add to a smoothie will sweeten it naturally. , A protein shake can satisfy your hunger and give you energy, reducing your cravings for other foods. One study had people drinking protein shakes before a trip to a buffet, and the people who had whey protein shakes consumed less from the buffet than others.While it is not recommended, replacing your highest-calorie meal with a shake or smoothie should lead to the quickest weight-loss results. Replacing smaller meals with a whey protein drink will also encourage weight-loss, but at a slower pace. Drinking a shake can also reduce post-meal blood glucose and improve insulin levels. "

Know that there are 8 vitamins in the B group.,
Get more B1 (thiamine) to support a healthy immune system.,
Eat foods rich in B2 (riboflavin) for healthy skin and to avoid headaches.,
Take B3 (niacin) to boost your levels of HDL (good cholesterol), particularly if you drink regularly.Niacin also supports the immune system and the breakdown of food for energy.,
Use B5 (pantothenic acid) to promote healthy skin.,
Consume B6 (pyridoxine) to help you sleep and avoid depression.,
Eat foods with high B7 (biotin) content for healthier skin and less brittle hair and nails.Intestinal bacteria produce an adequate amount of biotin for most people.However, those on low carbohydrate diets should consider increasing their biotin consumption, as these diets require more biotin to process fat and protein, and thus may result in biotin deficiencies.Recommended daily amount: 30mcg/day (females and males).Foods richest in B7: red meat; halibut and salmon; liver; sunflower seeds; leafy greens like spinach or swiss chard; carrots; almonds; eggs; milk; whole wheat bread; strawberries and raspberries.,
Add extra B9 (folic acid) to your diet to prevent anemia and slow memory loss,or if you are pregnant.,
Consume B12 (cobalamin) to ensure a healthy nervous system.",How to Eat More Vitamin B1," Each vitamin plays a slightly different role in promoting good health. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to take more of a certain type of B vitamin. For instance, pregnant women will need to increase their intake of B9 (folic acid), while vegans will need to find a supplement for B12, which only comes from meat products.Also, patients who have undergone gastric bypass or similar surgeries tend to experience vitamin B12 deficiency related to malabsorption.;
, Thiamine also plays a prominent role in breaking down carbohydrates to release energy.If you are endurance training, consuming more B1 can help to reduce fatigue.Also, you may consider taking supplemental thiamine if carbo-loading, as increased carbohydrate uptake may require more thiamine for processing.Recommended daily amount: 1.1mg/day (females); 1.2mg/day (males).Foods richest in B1: Pork; macadamia nuts; sunflower seeds; whole wheat bread; fresh green peas; trout; edamame (soy beans); pink or black beans., Riboflavin is an antioxidant – a substance that helps to prevent cell damage, particularly in the skin.It also supports blood production, the immune system, and the breakdown of food for energy. Consuming 400mg of riboflavin daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of migraines.Recommended daily amount: 1.1mg/day (females); 1.3mg/day (males).Foods richest in B2: Almonds; red meat; mackerel, salmon, and trout; hard boiled eggs; pork; mushrooms; sesame seeds; squid, oysters, clams and mussels; goat cheese; spinach or beet greens., Deficiency, which can cause skin problems, fatigue, depression, and indigestion, is rare. It most frequently occurs among those who drink frequently, as alcohol interferes with the absorption of niacin.Recommended daily amount: 14mg/day (females); 16mg/day (males).Foods richest in B3: Tuna, mackerel, salmon, swordfish, halibut; chicken and turkey; pork, red meat, or liver; mushrooms; peanuts; sunflower seeds.WARNING: Taking high doses of nicotinic acid supplements (a source of niacin) can cause skin flushes in the short term, and liver damage in the long term., Taking daily B5 supplements has been shown to reduce acne,and may also help reduce thinning and graying of hair. It is easy to get enough pantothenic acid, as it is found in nearly all meat and vegetables.Recommended daily amount: 5mg (females and males).Foods richest in B5: Sunflower seeds; mushrooms; trout and salmon; avocados; eggs; pork, red meat, and veal; chicken and turkey; sweet potatoes., B6 is involved in the production of neurotransmitters that regulate sleep and mood, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and melatonin.In addition, pyridoxine is vital in the production of red blood cells, meaning that a shortage can cause anemia.People who are at risk of not getting enough B6 include those with kidney or autoimmune disorders, and people who drink alcohol frequently.Recommended daily amount: 1.6mg/day (females and males).Foods richest in B6: Sunflower seeds; pistachios; tuna, salmon, halibut, swordfish; turkey and chicken; pork and red meat; dried fruit; bananas; avocados; spinach.WARNING: Consuming over 200mg per day of vitamin B6 can lead to sometimes irreversible numbness in your arms and legs.,, The recommended daily intake of folic acid is 400 micrograms, but pregnant women should consume an extra 200 micrograms daily to prevent birth defects.Recommended daily amount: 400mcg/day (females and males); 600mcg/day (pregnant women).Foods richest in B9: beans; lentils; spinach and turnip greens; asparagus; romaine lettuce; broccoli; pomegranate; wheat bread., B12 keeps nerve and blood cells healthy and is involved in the creation of DNA.A lack of it can cause anemia and eventually nerve damage.Most people will get plenty of B12 from their diet, but a small percentage of the population has a hard time absorbing it, leading to deficiencies that result in anemia.In addition, vegans should be aware that B12 comes only from meat products, so they will need to take a supplement or eat foods fortified with B12.


Vitamin B-2 can also relieve symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in people who are eliminating caffeine from their diet.
Recommended daily amount: 2.4mcg/day (females and males.Foods richest in B12: Clams, oysters and mussels; liver, foie gras and paté; mackerel, salmon, tuna, herring, and trout; crab; red meat; milk; swiss cheese; eggs.Foods with B12 that vegans can eat: fortified silken tofu; fortified soy milk; fortified cereals.

Take vitamin D supplements.,
Opt for vitamin D2 supplements if you are vegan.,
Improve your access to sunshine, with care.,
Be aware of factors that might affect vitamin D production from sun exposure.Your proximity to the equator is also a factor; people who live closer to it will have stronger sun exposure than those who live closer to the northern and southern poles.,
Eat foods richer in vitamin D. While there’s not enough vitamin D in a normal diet to satisfy our needs, you should still try to get as much of it through food as possible.The best natural source of vitamin D is fish, including salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines.,
Look for fortified food products.,
Limit your caffeine intake.,
Use all of these suggestions together.",How to Get More Vitamin D1," Although vitamin D is important for your health, it’s not found in abundance in the foods we eat.As such, it’s not possible to get enough vitamin D through diet alone.Although you should look for food products for some of your vitamin D, supplements are an important part of your health regimen for this scarce nutrient source. Vitamin D supplements are found in two forms over-the-counter: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol ) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).


Vitamin D3 is the form that is found naturally in fish and produced by the body when it metabolizes sunlight.It’s also thought to be less toxic in large amounts than vitamin D2, though it’s the more powerful form and has more health benefits.
Most experts recommend vitamin D3 supplements over D2 ones.Ask your health care professional for dosage and brand quality recommendations.
Make sure you a magnesium supplement along with your vitamin D. Magnesium is necessary for the absorption of vitamin D, but is depleted by the process. Taking vitamin D without increasing magnesium intake can lead to a deficiency.;
, Vitamin D3 is more complete, but it is derived from animal products. Vegans and vegetarians may wish to avoid it, despite its health benefits. Vitamin D2 supplements, on the other hand, are produced synthetically using mold, and do not involve animal products at all., Although vitamin D is scarce in our food sources, it is abundant in sunlight. However, you have to strike a delicate balance between not enough and too much sunshine: you don’t want to burn or over-expose your skin. To find this balance, you can spend 10 to 20 minutes in the sun twice a week, with sunscreen on only your face. Alternately, you can spend 2-3 minutes in the sun several times a week, still with sunscreen on only your face. Either way, make sure not to bathe for an hour after sun exposure.


Be careful not to overexpose your skin to UV rays in sunlight. UV radiation causes skin cancer, resulting in an estimated 1.5 million cases in the US every year.Avoid sunburns at all cost — not because they hurt, but because they damage skin cells in a manner that can result in cancerous growth.
Continue to use sunscreen for all other instances of sun exposure. You will likely still take in some vitamin D while wearing sunscreen, but its ability to protect the skin from harmful UV radiation also decreases vitamin D production.
Your skin doesn’t even have to tan for you to get enough vitamin D through sun exposure.

, Your natural skin color can also affect vitamin D production, as pale skin produces it more readily than darker-toned skin because of lower melanin content.


While you may not be able to change those factors, you can choose what time of day to expose yourself to the sun. Choose the midday hours, rather than early morning or evening ones. In the middle of the day, the sun is stronger, and you’ll produce more vitamin D.
Expose as much skin as possible. During those few minutes that you’re purposely laying out in the sun, don’t cover up with long pants and sleeves! The more skin you expose, the more vitamin D you’ll produce. However, use your judgment. If you live in an area with very strong sunlight, such practices might result in burning.
Be aware that sun exposure is still high even in full cloud coverage.
Your body stores vitamin D, so systematic exposure in the spring and summer can keep you safe all year.

, If you can stomach it, cod liver oil is also a good source. Dairy products like egg yolks and cheese also have small amounts of vitamin D in them., As awareness of the benefits of vitamin D spreads, more and more companies are adding vitamin D to foods that otherwise would not be good sources. Read nutrition labels to see whether or not a product has been fortified with vitamin D. The most common products are milks and breakfast cereals.

, Studies have shown that caffeine may interfere with vitamin D receptors and inhibit its absorption.Because of its effect on vitamin D, caffeine can negatively affect calcium levels in the body, since vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium.Avoid overconsumption of caffeine-heavy products like coffee, tea, and caffeinated soft drinks.


Try to take Vitamin D later in the day, such as lunch time, and not with your morning coffee or tea.

, There’s no one thing you can do to guarantee adequate vitamin D levels. Research suggests that supplements aren’t as effective a source of nutrients as food, and yet our food sources don’t provide enough vitamin D for optimal health. The only abundant natural source of vitamin D — the sun — is also incredibly dangerous in large amounts, and can cause cancer. The best approach is to combine all three methods — supplements, sunlight, and diet — to increase your vitamin D levels.

Learn about vitamin C. Vitamin C is an important micronutrient in the human diet.It has a role in sustaining memory,helping prevent cell mutations and premature aging,preventing oxidation of fatty foods,and supporting the immune system.Some people believe that vitamin C cures or stops the common cold, but there is no strong scientific evidence proving that this is true.,
Understand the role between diet and vitamin C intake.,
Be aware of the relationship between vitamin C and stress.,
Notice the signs of possible vitamin C deficiency.,
Be aware that you need to ingest vitamin C daily.,
Get enough vitamin C in your diet.,
Eat fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. Raw pineapple has 16mg of vitamin C, asparagus has 31 mg, raw broccoli has 89 mg, sun-dried tomatoes in oil have 101 mg, and raw parsley has 133 mg.Apples contain so many phytonutrients that just one has an antioxidant equivalent of 1000 milligrams of vitamin C.,
Eat citrus.,
Be aware of recommended vitamin C intake.,
Be aware of the shelf life of your vitamin C sources.,
Know which sources of vitamin C are the best.,
Eat plenty of green, leafy vegetables.This includes broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and collard greens.,
Add potatoes to your diet.,
Take care when counting juice as part of your vitamin C intake.,
Consume fresh juice.,
Take vitamin C supplements in pill form.,
Use a topical supplement.,
Eat chewable vitamin C tablets.,
Eat vitamin C lozenges.",How to Eat More Vitamin C," What is more likely is that through its immune system-boosting power, vitamin C provides extra defense against cold-causing pathogens, so it may ease the cold and perhaps shorten its duration, but it's not likely to prevent it.;
, Most people should be able to get adequate vitamin C from a healthy, nutritionally optimized diet. If you're eating nothing but fast food, you probably aren't going to get a beneficial amount of vitamin C as part of your diet. However, simply changing your diet for the better can help you increase vitamin C intake.


Since vitamin C counteracts some of the inhibitors in foods, such as phytates in whole grains and tannins in teas and coffee,increasing your vitamin C intake can also help optimize your diet for a healthier lifestyle.

, Stress can be brought about due to a depletion of vitamin C, and ongoing stress uses up vitamin C rapidly,so eating foods high in vitamin C or taking a vitamin C supplement when you are feeling stressed can be a positive contribution to your diet and well-being. If you are aware of what you are consuming and the micronutrients that those foods contain, you can adjust your diet to ensure that you are getting enough natural vitamin C.

, While you should always raise health concerns with your doctor or health professional directly, the following signs can accompany a vitamin C deficiency: bleeding gums and nose, poor healing of cuts, fatigue, and lowered immunity to infection.These symptoms do not necessarily indicate a vitamin C deficiency, but you can speak with your doctor if you are concerned.


A severe deficiency of vitamin C, in fact, can result in a disease called scurvy, which is caused when your body cannot produce collagen or absorb iron due to a vitamin C deficiency.While fewer people in developed countries suffer from vitamin C deficiency to this extent, its onset can be very fast if vitamin C is not in the diet for about four weeks.Those susceptible to scurvy include the elderly, illicit drug users, alcoholics, the mentally ill, dependents given inadequate care, those suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, smokers (smokers need more vitamin C to deal with the added stress on the body), and fussy eaters., Vitamin C does not stay in the body; it needs to be constantly replenished. A big meal of oranges today will boost today's vitamin C, but tomorrow you'll need more.It is thought that adults need a minimum of around 45 mg of vitamin C per day,with the optimal amount being around 90 mg for men, 75 mg for women and teen males, and 65 mg per day for teen girls.Additionally, pregnant and nursing mothers need 75g – 120 mg per day.


Whatever vitamin C you consume in excess of your daily allowance is usually excreted, and high doses of vitamin C are not considered to be toxic, but they do increase iron absorption which can be a problem for for people suffering from hemachromatosis, an iron overload disease.Therefore, if you are already eating a balanced diet, it is unnecessary to take a vitamin C supplement.
Also, too much vitamin C can cause abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, fatigue, kidney stones, and diarrhea., Getting enough vitamin C in your diet is key to getting all its benefits. Vitamin C supplements are measured in micrograms—see part one for the required amounts of vitamin C for different people. Many foods contain vitamin C, and consuming these can help you increase your vitamin C intake.

,, Citrus is an especially good source of vitamin C. One cup of grapefruit, for instance, provides an entire day's worth of vitamin C, while a glass of orange juice is the equivalent of 165 percent of your daily vitamin C intake. Fresh squeezed orange juice or a physical orange is better for you than processed orange juice.


What's more, the vitamin C in citrus will help curb stress by lowering stress hormone levels and possibly by reducing blood pressure, boost your energy by helping you to absorb iron better, and provide other essential phytonutrients that work in tandem with vitamin C, some of which aid memory., Check out the nutritional chart produced by your government's health department with respect to recommended daily intake of vitamin C. You'll be surprised how easy it is to vary your diet to include plenty of vitamin C sources. In the United States, the National Institutes of health have some recommendations., Vitamin C does not last in storage, so it is steadily lost the longer it is stored.As such, be prepared to eat your food as fresh as possible rather than leaving it to linger in the refrigerator or pantry. For example, leaving your broccoli in the fridge and then boiling it will reduce the vitamin C content considerably, compared to freshly picking the broccoli and steaming it that same day.


It's good to grow your own vegetables if possible, even if you just grow broccoli on a balcony or potatoes in a bag or barrel.

Wash fresh fruits and vegetables and then allow them to dry. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and eat them within a few days.
Do not soak them or store them in water because the vitamin C dissolves out of the plant into the water. Vitamin C also leaches out in cooking water., Fresh food is the best source of vitamin C and most fruit and vegetables contain vitamin C. In particular, aim to eat food from the cabbage family, red and green peppers, potatoes, blackcurrants, strawberries, citrus fruit, and tomatoes., Eat the vegetables raw or steam them, using only a small amount of water to maximize the amount of vitamins the vegetables retain.


Have a salad with spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Spinach is a better source of vitamin C when eaten raw. Toss in green and red bell peppers and tomatoes for added vitamin C. Vegetables lose micronutrients when cooked.

, Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C. In spite of what you may have heard, the skin does not have the highest concentration of vitamin C, but its fiber is good for you. When having a baked potato, be sure to also eat the skin.

, Juice is calorie dense and you lack the roughage and other benefits of eating the fruit when consuming it as juice. However, you can enjoy juice as a means of increasing your vitamin C intake by doing the following:


Juice with pulp is better for you than juice without it because vitamin C is better absorbed if it is consumed in the presence of bioflavonoids, which are found mostly in fruit pulp., Make fresh squeezed orange juice or purchase frozen concentrate instead of premixed, ready-to-drink refrigerated cartons. Frozen concentrates have significantly more vitamin C in them because the pasteurization process destroys some of the vitamin C in premixed juices.


Make your own vitamin C booster by making rosehip syrup.As an added bonus, this syrup is one that children will like.

, There are lots of brands of vitamin C supplements in pill form available over-the-counter. These supplements come in various doses, and you should take the dose that best corresponds your needs.Speak with a pharmacist if you are unsure of the dosages, etc.

, Topical preparations of vitamin C can be good for the skin. Some studies have investigated whether topical supplements might even have a rejuvenating effect on aged or wrinkled skin., Some vitamin C supplements are available in pleasant-tasting chewable tablets. These supplements should be chewed thoroughly and swallowed., Vitamin C lozenges are also available for vitamin C supplementation. These lozenges usually taste quite good. Allow lozenges to dissolve on tongue completely. Other indications include not eating, drinking, or smoking while lozenges are dissolving.These lozenges can be great when you aren't feeling well because of vitamin C's positive effect on your energy and immune system.

Increase your magnesium intake.,
Take multiple smaller doses of calcium.,
Eat enough vitamin D, or take a supplement that adds it.,
Take calcium carbonate with food.,
Separate your iron and calcium supplements by at least 2 hours.,
Avoid eating foods high in phytic and oxalic acids with your supplement.,
Don't drink excessively.,
Calculate the amount of calcium in your diet.,
Know how much you need.,
Talk to your doctor about whether you need a supplement.,
Know your risk.",How to Best Absorb Calcium Supplements," Magnesium helps your body take in the calcium. In addition, it also contributes to building healthy bones. Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking.To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30. An ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium.;
, If your supplement needs are greater than 500 milligrams per day after accounting for the calcium consumed in your diet, split up your supplement. Your body is only able to process up to 500 milligram at a time.Taking more calcium than you need can be dangerous. It increases your chance of having kidney stones and may also contribute to problems with your heart., Vitamin D also contributes to absorbing calcium into your system. Because of this relationship, most milk has added vitamin D to help you take in the calcium.Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units. To get your recommended intake, 3 ounces of swordfish has 566 international units, while a cup of milk has 115 to 124 international units per serving., This type of calcium, which is readily available, is best taken with food. It needs stomach acid to be absorbed properly, and the food activates your stomach acid.Other types of calcium, such as calcium citrate, does not need to be taken with food. This type of calcium is usually more expensive than calcium carbonate. This type is especially good for people who have stomach issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome., The same is true of your multivitamin if your multivitamin contains iron.Your body processes iron and calcium in much the same way, so taking them at the same time interferes with the body's ability to absorb both.
The same rule applies to food and beverages consumed with both supplements. Calcium supplements should not be taken with foods high in iron, such as liver or spinach. Iron supplements should not be taken with calcium-rich products like a glass of milk.

, These acids can bind with calcium and keep it from being absorbed.Many foods high in magnesium are also high in these acids. Therefore, while it's important to eat these foods to get the magnesium you need, you should avoid taking your supplement along with these foods.


For instance, spinach, many nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, and collard greens are all high in phytic and oxalic acids. Whole grains and wheat are also high in these acids, but don't seem to affect calcium absorption as much as other foods in this category., Alcohol can decrease your body's absorption of calcium. Don't drink more than one a day on average., To calculate the amount of calcium in your diet, you need to keep track of your food using a food journal. Basically, you write down everything you eat in a day, including the serving size. Then you can calculate the amount of calcium in the foods you ate.For instance, a cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams of calcium. Therefore, if you ate a cup and a half over the course of a day, you consumed 622.5 milligrams of calcium just from yogurt., If you're not 50 yet, you need about 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily. If you're over 50, your need increases to 1,200 milligrams daily.Limit intake to under 2,500 milligrams. While it's acceptable to take more than your daily minimum, you shouldn't get more than 2,500 milligrams of calcium between your diet and your supplements., Your doctor can help you assess whether you need a supplement based on your diet. She can also recommend the right kind of calcium for you and can look at whether a calcium supplement will interact with any of your medications or cause adverse affects for you.

, Some people are more dependent on calcium. For instance, if you have osteoporosis or at high risk of developing it, you need to be more careful about getting the required amount of calcium every day, as it helps keep your bones healthy."

Talk to your doctor before starting chlorophyll supplements.,
Shop for chlorophyll supplements.,
Choose a supplement form.,
Recognize side effects of chlorophyll supplementation.,
Buy chlorophyll water.",How to Take Chlorophyll As a Supplement1," Your doctor should be able to offer advice on whether or not you require chlorophyll supplementation. In some cases, chlorophyll supplements should be avoided. For example, since there has been a lack of safety research on chlorophyll supplements, pregnant women should avoid commercial supplements.If your doctor advises against supplementation, you can still get your chlorophyll from natural sources such as kale, spinach or broccoli.In fact, eating green vegetables daily is a much better way to get chlorophyll into your diet along with fiber and other nutrients.
Keep in mind that chlorophyll supplements may not be recommended if you are taking other medications or if you are pregnant or nursing. Check with your doctor to be sure.;
, If you are unable to get enough chlorophyll from vegetables, you could use a supplement. Chlorophyll supplements can give you a boost of energy, as well as provide a number of potential health benefits. You can find chlorophyll supplements at most health food stories. Ask the health food clerk which brands are reputable. If there are no health food stores nearby, shop online.You can get chlorophyll supplements in a variety of combinations, including with papaya, spirulina and green mixes containing a variety of other vitamins and minerals.
Chlorophyll supplements cost between $15 and $70.
Also, keep in mind that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Check the label for other indicators of quality, such as a USP label.

, You can get chlorophyll supplements in a variety of forms, including tablets and liquids. If you choose the liquid form, you squirt a few drops in a glass of water. It will get very green and tastes slightly minty and a little bitter. If you choose the tablet form, you don’t have to worry about the strong taste. Follow the dosage recommendations on the label, or as directed by your naturopath or doctor., Taking the supplement orally may give you a green tongue or green feces. If you apply it topically to treat a wound, it may lead to a mild burning sensation or itching. If you take a lot of the supplement and in unusual situations, rare side effects include diarrhea and abdominal cramps.Seek a doctor if you experience rare side effects.

, Many juice stores sell chlorophyll water, which is water with some liquid chlorophyll. If you are on the run and forgot to take your chlorophyll supplement in the morning, you could pick up some chlorophyll water from a juice stand."

Pick the right foods to maximize your B vitamins.,
Eat more salmon and trout.,
Snack on sunflower seeds or add them to your salads.,
Add more meat to your diet.,
Add spinach to your salads, omelets, or other dishes.,
Try to eat more hard-boiled eggs.,
Make sure your bread is whole wheat.,
Drink alcohol in moderation.,
Go easy on the coffee, tea and soda.",How to Eat More Vitamin B2," If you want to focus on one vitamin, you can eat more of the foods listed above. Or, you can create a diet rich in all the B vitamins by eating a few foods that contain multiple B vitamins. A spinach salad that included hard-boiled eggs and sunflower seeds, for instance, would provide a high amount of every single B vitamin.

, These fish are a great low-fat source of protein, and they contain loads of B vitamins. A meal featuring salmon, in particular, provides high levels of 6 of the 8 B vitamins: B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, and B12. Trout has more B1, B2, B5, and B12 than almost any other food. Mackerel (B2, B3, and B12) and tuna (B3, B6, B12) are two more fish you can rotate into your diet., A quarter cup of sunflower seeds will give you 43% of your daily B1, 28% of your B6, 24% of your B5, 20% of your B9, 18% of your B3, and sunflower seeds are a good source of B7., Lean cuts of beef, pork, and lamb are very good sources of B vitamins. Red meat provides high levels of B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, and B12, while pork is rich in B1, B2, B3, B5, and B6. Chicken and turkey are less potent, but do contain large amounts of B3, B5, and B6., Spinach is rich in B2, B6, B7, and B9. Other leafy greens have smaller, but still significant amounts of B vitamins., Hard-boiled eggs are a great, portable snack, as well as a delicious salad topping. Try boiling several in advance and keeping them in the refrigerator for when you need them. They are rich in B2, B5, B7, and B12., Whole wheat bread is a great way to get more B1, B7, and B9. White breads tend to have very little B vitamins, though French bread is very rich in B9., It’s not just what you eat that determines your vitamin B levels. What you don’t consume matters, too. Drinking too much alcohol will interfere with your ability to absorb B3and B6., Caffeine interferes with the absorption of B1. In addition, it is a diuretic (it makes you pee more), which can lead to low levels of B vitamins because they are all water soluble."

Buy supplements to increase your daily B vitamin intake.,
Remember that it is always better to get your nutrition from food.,
Check with your doctor before taking any supplements.,
Make sure you are getting good vitamins.",How to Eat More Vitamin B3," You can buy a B-complex supplement that will provide the daily allowance or more of all the B vitamins, or supplements of particular vitamins, like folic acid (B9). In addition, multivitamins usually contain most or all of the B vitamins.

, In some cases, like pregnant women taking folic acid, a supplement is an easy and effective way to ensure adequate consumption of a particular vitamin. But supplements should be just that: supplements. Whole foods are superior in three ways:Foods contain a complex mix of nutrients, which often work together to provide benefits that exceed those of supplements.
Foods like vegetables, grains, fruits, and legumes contain fiber, which is important in preventing heart disease and type 2 diabetes, amongst other problems.
Food contains other helpful substances, like antioxidant and phytochemicals, which fight cell damage and protect against cancer and heart disease.

, Supplements can have side effects, or interact with other medications. You should be particularly cautious if you are pregnant, have a health condition, or are providing supplements to children., Lab analysis has shown that some supplements contain more or less of the vitamin than listed on the label, or contain other unlisted ingredients. To be sure you are getting what the label says, purchase vitamins with a seal of approval from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab or NSF International, three organizations that test vitamins."

Understand the health benefits of vitamin D. A wide variety of recent studies have shown vitamin D to be an effective preventative measure for a number of chronic diseases.In particular, it’s known to increase increases the body’s ability to absorb calcium, preventing bone health issues from rickets to osteomalacia (bone softening) and osteoporosis.,
Be aware of the dangers of vitamin D deficiency.,
Know if you're at risk of vitamin D deficiency.,
Get tested for vitamin D deficiency.,
Keep your vitamin D levels within the recommended range.",How to Get More Vitamin D2," Other studies suggest that raising your vitamin D levels can lower blood pressure, decrease the chances of having a heart attack or stroke, and reduce the risk of diabetes, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis., It’s important to make a concerted effort to bring up vitamin D levels in your body because deficiencies have been linked to a wide variety of chronic illness. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to type 1 diabetes, chronic muscle and bone pain, and several types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, esophageal, and lymphatic cancers.About 40-75% of people are vitamin D-deficient, largely because it’s not abundant in natural food sources and many people live in areas with insufficient sun exposure.Furthermore, more recent awareness of the link between UV rays and cancer has increased the use of sunscreen, which lowers the production of vitamin D.

, Though 40-75% of people don't have enough vitamin D in their systems, those who fall into certain categories are at an even higher risk of deficiency. It's important to be aware of your risk, so you can take steps to track and maintain your vitamin D levels. At risk categories include:


People who suffer from gallimau free, or sun sickness. These are people to whom sunlight is toxic.
People who rarely venture outdoors,
People who are sun-phobic
People with poor nutrition resulting in extreme light sensitivity
Babies who are exclusively breast-fed
Those who suffer from a fat malabsorption disease
Those who wear head-to-toe covering clothing daily
The elderly, for whom skin absorption is less effective
People who are indoors all day — for example, in a nursing home, etc.
Some people with strict dietary regimes.

, Check to see if you insurance covers the blood test for vitamin D deficiency, called the 25(OH)D test or calcidiol test.The doctor will take a blood sample from you, then send it off for lab analysis.


If insurance does not cover the calcidiol test, you can purchase at-home tests online.While they are not inexpensive (around $50), they may be more affordable than going through a doctor without insurance coverage.
Vitamin D deficiency can be difficult to recognize, as it tends to mimic many other symptoms. Therefore, getting your vitamin D levels checked regularly is absolutely crucial.

, When you get the results from your calcidiol test, you need to able to interpret them and adjust your lifestyle accordingly. The test’s results provide data in units of ng/mL in the U.S. (nanograms per milliliter) and in nmol/L (nanomoles per liter) in other parts of the world. What the test actually measures is the amount of calcidiol in your blood, which is a good indicator of vitamin D levels.According to the Endocrine Society, if your results come back lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), you are vitamin D-deficient. A reading of 21-29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) suggests you have insufficient, but not deficient amounts of vitamin D.If your results fall into deficient or insufficient ranges, adjust your diet, sun exposure, and supplement intake to boost your vitamin D levels.
Some people feel better with their vitamin D levels on the higher end of normal. Find the range that works best for you and keep your levels in check with supplementation and vitamin-D rich foods.

Get chlorophyll from food.,
Blanch your greens.,
Supplement your diet with wheat grass shots.,
Make green juices.",How to Take Chlorophyll As a Supplement2," Prior to choosing a chlorophyll supplement, you should make sure you are eating enough leafy greens and other sources of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in any green vegetable, so it is not difficult to find. If you want to get more chlorophyll in your diet, eat lots of leafy greens such as kale, Swiss chard, spinach and arugula., If you overcook your green vegetables, you may not be getting a desirable amount of chlorophyll, since cooking will reduce the amount of chlorophyll in the dish. Instead of cooking for a long time, blanch greens like kale or broccoli. Place a bowl of ice water in the sink. Then, bring a pot of water to a boil on the stove. Add a teaspoon of salt to the water. Throw your vegetables in the water for thirty seconds, scoop them out and cool them in the ice water. Add them to your recipe and enjoy.

, One of the best sources of chlorophyll is wheat grass.You can juice wheat grass with any regular fruit juicer. Wash the wheat grass. If you spot any mold, throw it out. Juice and enjoy a shot of wheat grass on its own, or add it to an orange or carrot juice to improve the flavor., Chlorophyll is found in any fresh green vegetable, so you should try to consume as many as possible. You can increase your chlorophyll consumption by juicing greens like kale, swiss chard and spinach. Use a standard juicer and experiment with different combinations, such as kale, carrot and ginger juice."

Recognize the benefits of chlorophyll.,
Apply chlorophyll for wound healing.,
Use chlorophyll to fight bad odor.",How to Take Chlorophyll As a Supplement3," Chlorophyll is a class of pigments that allows plants to absorb energy from the sun through photosynthesis. It is present in any plant that uses photosynthesis, such as algae, wheatgrass, broccoli, and many other vegetables.The health benefits of supplementing your diet with chlorophyll have been explored in relation to weight loss, cancer, wound healing and other conditions.Some of the health benefits of chlorophyll include:Chlorophyll may be useful for blocking effects of cancer. However, more research is needed in this area.
Chlorophyll from green vegetables may be useful for reducing the risk of liver cancer.Chlorophyll may also be used to increase energy, prevent altitude sickness and lose weight, although further research is needed on these purported benefits., One of the oldest uses of chlorophyll is to reduce inflammation and improve the healing of wounds and burns. Start by following the normal process for treating a wound. You should wash your hands, use a bandage to stop the bleeding, cover the area, apply antibiotic cream and then cover it up. Once it has healed up a bit, you can apply an ointment with chlorophyll in addition to the antibiotic cream.In this case, chlorophyll can help your body fight against infection and prevent scarring from burns, cuts, scrapes or other wounds.
For instance, you can find a variety of skin creams that contain chlorophyll at your local health food store. These creams can be used once the wound has closed up, in order to prevent too much scarring.

, Chlorophyll has long been used as a natural deodorant. It cleans you out from the inside. You can use wheatgrass shots, chlorophyll juice or a chlorophyll supplement. Ideally, follow the guidelines for the oral supplement you purchase and enjoy a glass of chlorophyll after your yoga session or workout."

Choose a liquid.,
Add a sweetener.,
Consider stronger flavors to mask the taste.If tea bases and sugar aren't doing enough to make the shakes palatable, you have other options.,
Thicken and sweeten with yogurt.,
Make an iced smoothie in the blender.,
Consider a vegetable shake for a savory taste.,
Invest in a good blender.,
Try out some classic favorites.Many people enjoy experimenting with their own ingredients and flavor combinations.",How to Make Protein Powder Taste Good1," Some people prefer thin, watery drinks that they can drink quickly. Others find that a thicker liquid does a better job at masking the taste. You may have to experiment with trial and error to find out which consistency you prefer. Most people use about eight oz. of liquid per scoop of powder, but try using more for thinner drinks or less for thicker ones. You can also switch up the actual liquid base you use for your shake:


Water is a good option for weight loss because it adds no calories, but it does nothing to mask the taste of the powder. Instead, try different berry teas. A cold raspberry or acai tea, for example, could make your shake tastier.
For a slightly thicker shake, try fat-free milk or milk substitutes like almond or soy milk. Many people find almond milk, in particular, to have a pleasant, slightly sweet flavor.
If you are trying to gain weight or if you prefer an extra-thick shake, try using whole milk. Be aware that the combination of whole milk and protein powder can be hard to digest. If your body can't adjust to it, step back to a thinner, fat-reduced milk.;
, Sugar has a powerful effect on the brain. Research shows that sugar releases dopamine, which controls the brain's reward and control response. A dopamine rush makes us recognize rewards more clearly, and can improve motivation in the short term.But beyond these workout benefits, sugar is just great at masking bad tastes. Try adding a couple teaspoons of sugar, honey, chocolate syrup, dextrose, or maltodextrin to your shake. If you're restricting your sugar intake, though, try healthier alternatives:


Peanut butter both sweetens and thickens shakes.
Chopped fresh fruit and fruit juice provide vitamins and fiber as well as sweetness. Banana is popular because of its strong flavor and thickness. Avoid citrus fruit if using a dairy-based protein powder, as it may cause curdling.
If you want sweetness without additional flavors or calories, try an artificial sweetener. Splenda and stevia are popular options that sweeten without adding calories.

, Try adding a couple spoonfuls of cocoa or vanilla powder to your shake. A half teaspoon of a full-flavored spice like cinnamon or nutmeg can go a long way as well. Sugar-free syrups intended for homemade sodas or coffee flavors are an easy way to add flavor to your shake that won't add a powdery texture.


Mixing flavors can better mask the taste of the protein powder as well. Try adding more than one type of fruit — strawberries and bananas, for example. Add a shot of espresso and some vanilla flavoring.
Explore with combinations that work for you.

, Some people love a yogurt-based shake, while others despise it. Try it out a couple times to see whether you think it's deliciously creamy or just plain hard to get down. Simply add a spoonful of yogurt to your shake, or frozen yogurt if you want a ""creamsicle"" shake.


Try Greek yogurt for an even stronger, tangy taste and the added benefit of extra protein., Some people find that they taste protein powder less when it's in a cold, icy drink. Making a blended ice smoothie with your protein shake will also thicken it a little bit, though not nearly as much as yogurt or peanut butter., A kale smoothie is the subject of nightmares for some, but you may love it if you're a regular juicer. Any green vegetable from spinach to spirulina powder to zucchini works well with protein powder. A tablespoon of nuts and seeds can add more savory flavor and help thicken the smoothie. For a little sweetness to balance out the flavor, you can add chopped fruits like bananas or strawberries or sweet vegetables like beets or carrots., The worst type of protein shake is one with dry, undissolved lumps of protein powder in it. Small, single-serve blenders are an affordable option if you do not use your blender for other purposes.Pour all the ingredients into the blender and blend on high until the texture is even and lump-free.
For shakes with many solid ingredients, use a ""grind"" option when available.
If you absolutely can't get access to a blender, put the shake ingredients into a sealed container and shake for a long time. Microwaving the liquid or heating it over the stove can also make it easier to mix together.
You may also consider buying a ""shaker cup"" specially designed to break up powder clumps for consistent texture. These products can dramatically improve your shakes at a fraction of the cost of a good blender.

, If you just want a tasty protein shake now, you can try out these classics:


Peanut butter honey shake: Blend one scoop of protein powder, one cup of ice, one cup of milk or milk substitute, 1/8 cup of peanut butter, and 1/8 cup of honey. Optional: add half a ripe banana, and/or a square of dark chocolate.
Fruit smoothie: Blend one scoop of protein powder, one cup of vanilla yogurt, three to four strawberries, one ripe banana, 1/2 cup milk or milk substitute, and a handful of ice cubes. #*Nuts and spice drink: Blend one scoop of protein powder, ½ cup of berries, ⅓ cup of chopped nuts, one tbsp cocoa powder, ¼ tsp ground cinnamon, and one to two cups of milk of milk substitute. Optional: add more flavor and texture with ½ cup of raw oats.

Add flavored protein powder to sweet treats.,
Whip up a protein icing for baked goods.,
Stir protein powder into thick foods.,
Make protein peanut butter cups.",How to Make Protein Powder Taste Good2," If you're working out hard on a regular basis, you deserve a reward from time to time. That doesn't mean you can't try to sneak some extra protein into your cookies, brownies, or pancakes.Replace cocoa powder in baked goods with chocolate-flavored protein powder. A scoop of protein powder is equal to about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. If you want a really rich chocolate taste, add about 1/2 of the recommended amount of cocoa powder as well as a scoop of chocolate-flavored protein mix.
If the recipe does not include cocoa powder, you can typically add a scoop of protein powder without affecting the taste. It may still be a good idea to use half a scoop on a small batch when trying it for the first time.
Try adding unflavored protein powder to your baked goods to maintain the flavors that you like while still getting your protein boost., Some people love protein icing, and some people hate it. It doesn't hurt to give it a try, though! Stir protein powder into yogurt or a very small amount of water or milk to create a thick ""icing.""When you spread it onto muffins or other baked goods, you get the benefit of the protein while masking its taste with your tasty treat!

, Thick foods like oatmeal, pudding, yogurt, or applesauce can mask the taste of protein powder well. They moisten and dissolve the powder on their own, so you don't have to pull out your blender.Just make sure to stir thoroughly to make sure the powder dissolves all the way., Blend one scoop of flavored protein powder, one scoop of vanilla ice cream, and one spoonful peanut butter in your blender. Pour the mixture into some type of mold — an ice cube tray will work fine if you don't have anything fancy on hand. Freeze the mixture for a few hours to allow it to set and harden.This works best with chocolate-flavored protein powder, but strong flavors like cinnamon can work as well.

Read online reviews for different brands and flavors.,
Test different protein powders in small amounts.,
Test out flavored protein powders.,
Look for powders with sugar or artificial sweetener.",How to Make Protein Powder Taste Good3," Protein powder can be extracted from a variety of foods, including dairy products, egg whites, and vegan alternatives. This is why different brands of protein powder can have such significantly different flavors. Before spending your money on a powder that might turn your stomach, spend some time surfing the web for information. Many health, exercise, and bodybuilding forums have threads where users discuss their favorite and least favorite protein powders.

, If you're on the hunt for a better tasting powder, don't invest in a giant tub of it. Buy the smallest container you can find. If you don't like it, you can either discard it or power through until you run out — hopefully quickly!

, The problem may be that you can't stand the taste of unflavored protein powder. Luckily, many brands sell products that are already flavored with chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon. You can even find wilder flavors like cookies and cream!If these flavors don't work for you on their own, try mixing them together. Half a scoop of cinnamon with half a scoop of chocolate may be your new favorite flavor.

, Protein powders are marketed to health-conscious people, so most of them don't have sugar or corn syrup in them. In fact, they often advertise that they have no added flavors or sweeteners. Sugar always helps mask the taste of the powder, though, no matter what you mix it with. Look for the few brands that do include some kind of sweetening agent.Keep in mind that added sugar should be limited throughout the day and will add extra calories to your protein powder.

Use hemp as pre-workout snack.,
Incorporate hemp protein powder into a post workout snack.,
Drink a protein shake before bedtime.,
Aim for adequate protein to support athletic performance.",How to Use Hemp Protein Powder2," A pre-workout snack can play an important role in your performance during your exercise routine.


Before a workout, you can use a pre-workout snack to give your body an extra boost of energy to fuel yourself through your workout. The best type of snack is a carbohydrate rich food.Although hemp protein powder is a great source of natural protein, many hemp protein powders are also fairly high in carbohydrates.
Mix your hemp protein powder with milk - another source of carbohydrates - to give your body a good energy boost for your workout.

, Like a pre-workout snack, hemp protein powder can also be an excellent post-workout snack as well. After a workout, you'll need to replace your muscle's glycogen stores (your body's stored form of energy) and the protein broken down during your exercise as well.The best combination for your post-workout snacks is a combination of both protein and carbohydrates. In addition, eat this snack within two hours of finishing your workout for the best recovery and regeneration.Use your hemp protein powder mixed with milk (a source of carbohydrates) for a quick and easy high protein snack. You can also make a hemp protein powder smoothie and add yogurt, fruit and ice cubes for a thick and creamy high protein and high carbohydrate snack as well.

, Another great time to load up on extra protein from your hemp protein powder is right as you go to bed. Studies have shown that your growth hormones are elevated when you're asleep. When you drink a high protein shake before bed this can help stimulate growth and repair of your muscles.If drinking a large protein shake right before bed is uncomfortable, drink it about an hour before hitting the sack. This can help you digest your protein a little more thoroughly before falling asleep.

, In addition to appropriately timed snacks, you may need to add hemp protein powder to your diet to help meet additional protein needs as an athlete.


Although you do not need very large quantities of protein daily, you do need to ensure you're eating enough to support whatever activity you do.
If you're a ""power athlete"" (participating in sports that require speeds or strength) you may need up to 1.7 g of protein per kg of body weight.If you're an endurance athlete (a long distance runner for example), you may need up to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight.Use your hemp protein powder as snacks or in addition to meals to help ensure you're consuming enough protein every day.

Make a nutrient-packed smoothie with hemp protein powder.,
Increase your calories with hemp protein powder.",How to Use Hemp Protein Powder3," Many people may be interested in using hemp protein outside the athlete or weight loss arena. It's a great supplement to also improve your protein intake.


Most people need about 0.8 to 1 g of protein per kg of body weight.Calculate how many grams of protein you need each day with this formula.
If you're a vegan or vegetarian or just a picky eater, using hemp protein powder can be a nutritious method to help meet your protein needs.
If you're having trouble meeting your protein needs, use hemp protein powder in shakes, smoothies or snacks to help you get in more protein throughout the day.
Add these types of hemp protein-based supplements to your current diet, not in place of meals. This will boost your protein intake throughout the day.

, In addition to helping you meet protein needs everyday, using hemp protein can also help you sneak in extra nutrition throughout the day.


Again, using hemp protein shakes, smoothies or other snacks is an excellent way to hide or add in extra nutrition to your day.
These ideas will be great for picky eaters, those who don't like many fruits or vegetables or those who just have difficulty staying on track with a nutritious diet.
Ideas to add in more nutrition include: making a protein shake blended with fruit, dark greens, nuts, seeds or even avocado. You can also make smoothies and use ice for a thicker and creamier consistency.
There are also recipes using hemp protein powder to make brownies that have avocado or even black beans incorporated.

, If you're not trying to lose weight, but actually trying to gain weight, hemp protein powder can be an easy way to get in some extra calories throughout the day.


If you need to gain weight, you might be tempted to overindulge in unhealthy, high calorie, high fat foods (like candies, fried foods or fast foods). However, this not a nutritious or healthy way to gain weight.Choose nutritious, calorie dense foods in addition to eating more meals or more snacks throughout the day to help add on extra pounds.
It's typically recommended to add 250 to 500 calories daily to help you gain weight.Adding more food and higher calorie food can help you achieve this increase in calories each day.
In addition to your typical three meals a day, use hemp protein powder to make high calorie shakes or smoothies to drink. This is an easy way to increase calories. Plus, smoothies may not fill you up as much as more solid foods or meals.
Mix hemp protein powder with low-fat or whole milk and add in a variety of items like: fruits, avocado, nuts, seeds, nut butters or full fat yogurts. You can even add in a little coconut oil for an extra hit of calories.

Unclear thinking or difficulty concentrating
Recurrent infections and slow healing
Sweet cravings
Loss of hair;
, Protein supplements usually come as a powder. You can mix these with water, juice, or in a smoothie. Protein supplements can come from either plant or animal sources. Dairy (whey and casein), beef, and egg white protein are examples of animal proteins. Vegetable sources include soy, rice, hemp, sprouted grains, peas, and lentils.


It is best to buy protein powders made from whole food sources of protein. The simpler the composition of your protein powder the better.
Whey protein is a popular option for people who are not vegetarians. It is derived from milk, economical, low fat, and low carbohydrate. Whey protein contains low levels of lactose.Milk or casein protein is also derived from milk. Casein is absorbed more slowly than whey protein, so it is often used for weight loss.If you are vegan or vegetarian, plant proteins can be used. Soy and hemp the best choices.

, When choosing a protein supplement, avoid ones that use additives or preservatives. Look for supplements that use natural flavorings and sweeteners.


Lecithin is a natural additive. It’s a natural healthy fat derived from egg yolks and is used to reduce clumping and to make the protein powder easier to mix with liquids.Avoid ingredients such as sorbitol, maltitol or xylitol. It is hard to find unsweetened protein powder options, but it is better to go with the powder that uses real sugar and whole foods ingredients over chemically modified ones.

, Since you can get protein from most foods, most people do not need a supplement; however, there are a few reasons why you might want to add a protein supplement. Make sure you research how much protein you need because the amount will change based on your specific case. Common reasons other than deficiency to take protein supplements include:


When you start a new workout program and are trying to build muscle
When you are significantly increasing your workouts
If you are a teenage athlete — you are not only expending a lot of energy in your workouts — you are also still growing, which requires a lot of protein
When you are recovering from an injury, such as a sports injury
If you have decided to begin a vegan lifestyle, There are better times than others to take a protein supplement. Incorporate the protein supplement as a snack or meal replacement throughout your day. You can mix the powder into a smoothie or into milk.


If you are using protein to help gain muscles while working out, don’t take the supplement right before, during, or after your workout. You need healthy carbohydrates instead. A good post-workout recovery drink would be lass of chocolate milk or fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt, not a protein shake.The best time to have a protein shake in your diet is throughout the day as a snack or to replace a meal.
When taking a protein supplement, remember to follow the instructions. Don’t take more than the recommended dose.

, Although most diets are high in protein, some are lacking complete proteins. These are proteins which contain all the required amino acids found in protein.Foods with complete proteins include:


A cup of quinoa or buckwheat
A tablespoon of hempseed
½ cup of tofu or tempeh
Meat, such as beef, buffalo, pork, poultry, and fish
Eggs and dairy products, The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends 46 grams per day of complete protein for women over 19 years of age. Men over 19 years of age need 56 grams per day of complete protein.Two to three servings each day of complete protein will provide enough protein for healthy people.


Another way to think about the amount of protein you need is to base it on your weight. Recreational athletes need 0.5 to 0.75 grams of protein per pound. Competitive athletes needs 0.6 to 0.9 grams per pound. If you are building muscle mass, you need 0.7 to 0.9 grams per pound., Before beginning any protein supplement, talk to a doctor. If you want to take supplements for athletic or training purposes, make sure to discuss it with a professional trainer. How to take a supplement varies depending on your goals, your fitness level, your age, and your overall health.


Taking too much protein can be a significant problem for people with kidney and liver problems, along with causing additional health problems, so always talk to your doctor if you have these conditions.

Rely on prescription supplements and medications.,
Eat more meat.,
Consume plant products that have iron.,
Avoid foods that make it hard for your body to absorb iron.",How to Increase Ferritin Levels," Before you take any action to increase your ferritin levels, you should consult your doctor. Your doctor will ask you about your personal and family medical history. Your doctor will ask also you about whether you are experiencing any symptoms that could be associated with low ferritin levels. Some symptoms include:Fatigue
Hair loss
Shortness of breath
Brittle fingernails;
, Since ferritin is iron that has been absorbed in your tissue, the first place your doctor will start is by checking how much iron is in your blood. This will give them a sense of whether you’re not consuming enough iron or may have a condition that inhibits absorption of iron into your blood., Your doctor will also test your ferratin levels. If you don’t have enough iron in your blood, your body may draw it out of your tissue, reducing your ferratin levels. As a result, ferratin level tests and iron level tests are often run together.Your target ferritin levels in your blood should be 30 to 40 ng/Ml. If your ferritin is lower than 10 ng/Ml, you should take steps to increase your ferritin.

, This test will measure the maximum amount of iron your blood can store. This will give your doctor an idea of whether your liver and other organs are functioning properly. If they’re not, then your low ferritin or low iron levels could be related to a larger problem., After talking with you and running blood tests, your doctor will determine when you have medical conditions that have either caused low ferritin levels or may affect your ability to raise them. Conditions that could impact your ferritin levels or treatment include:

Anemia
Cancer
Kidney disease
Hepatitis
Enzyme disorders, Purchase iron supplements at your local grocery store or pharmacy. Follow the directions on the product or your physician’s instructions. Typically, oral iron supplements will take several weeks to raise iron and ferritin levels. However, if you have a condition like anemia that affects your ability to absorb or process iron, pills may not work.

Iron supplements may have a variety of side effects such as backache, chills, dizziness, headache, and nausea., If you have a condition that makes it hard for your body to absorb iron, you doctor may suggest iron injections or infusions. In this case, iron will be injected directly into your blood stream, bypassing your digestive system. Injections or infusions will only be used if other attempts to supplement iron and ferritin levels have failed.Parental iron injections may have side effects similar to oral supplements.

, There are a variety of medications specifically geared increasing iron and ferritin levels in the human body. If you have an outstanding condition that inhibits your ability to absorb and store iron, your doctor may prescribe one. Some medications include:

Ferrous sulfate
Carbonyl iron
Iron dextran complex, Meat, specifically red meat, is perhaps the best source of iron you can eat. This is not only because meat is iron rich, but because your body can more easily absorb iron from meat. As a result, by increasing your consumption of meat, you’ll also increase your iron and ferritin levels. The best meat products to increase your iron levels include:

Beef
Lamb
Liver
Eggs, Next to meat, there are a variety of plant products that are rich in iron. Consuming these plant products will help you to increase the ferritin levels in your blood. Remember, though, on average, you’ll need to consume double the amount of plant products to get the same iron you could from meat. Iron rich plant products include:

Rice
Wheat
Oats
Nuts
Beans, Certain foods make it more difficult for your body to digest and absorb iron. As a result, you should limit your consumption of certain foods. These foods include:

Red wine
Coffee
Black and green tea
Non-fermented soy."

Make a new batch every week.",How to Make Pea Protein Powder," Making your own pea protein powder is easy, but you will need to gather some things before you get started. To make your own pea protein powder, you will need:Two cups of dried yellow peas
Plenty of water for soaking
Paper towels
A large glass bowl to soak the peas
A large baking sheet
A high-powered blender or food processor
A large mason jar with a lid;
, Put the yellow peas into a colander and rinse them under running water. Make sure that you sort through the peas as you rinse them to weed out any rocks or clumps of dirt. This is common with dried peas, beans, and lentils.

, Place the dried yellow peas into a large glass bowl and cover them with water. Make sure that the water covers all of the peas and that there is a few inches of water above the peas as well. The peas will expand as they soak. Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and allow the peas to soak overnight.Soak the peas for at least eight hours.
After eight hours, drain the peas by pouring them into the colander.
Then, rinse the peas one more time under running water.

, Line the glass bowl with a wet paper towel and then pour the peas over the paper towel. Next, lay another wet paper towel over the peas and then cover the bowl with some plastic wrap. Leave the peas in the bowl for 24 to 48 hours, or until they start to sprout.Keep the bowl at room temperature by setting it on a counter.

, Preheat your oven for 115°F (46°C). Next, remove the plastic wrap and paper towels from the peas and spread the sprouted peas out on a baking sheet. Leave the peas in the oven for about 12 hours.Remove the peas from the oven after 12 hours. To see if the peas are dry, bite into one. It should be crunchy.

, Once the peas are dry, you can pour them into the blender or food processor. Place the lid on the blender or food processor and blend the peas at a high speed until they reach a powder-like consistency.If you want to customize your pea protein powder, then you can add other ingredients to it.
If you just want a basic protein powder, then you can transfer the protein powder to a large mason jar and place a lid on it.

, You can increase the protein content and nutritional value of your pea powder by adding ¼ cup of seeds to your pea protein powder. Use whole seeds and blend them on high until they turn into a powder. Then mix the seeds into the pea protein powder. Some good choices include:Chia
Pumpkin
Flax
Sunflower
Hemp

, Adding almond flour or coconut flour to the recipe can change the flavor and add some more protein as well. Try adding in about ¼ cup of almond flour or coconut flour to the pea protein powder and combine the ingredients well., Cacao can add a nice chocolate flavor to your protein powder and it also contains about 10 grams of protein per ounce. Try adding about one ounce (two tablespoons) of cacao powder into your protein powder and stir the ingredients until they are well combined., Stevia is a natural, calorie free sweetener. You can use it to sweeten your protein powder if you prefer sweet smoothies in the morning. To sweeten your protein powder with stevia, add about one teaspoon of stevia to your protein powder and combine the ingredients well., Spices can add extra flavor to your protein powder. Think about what types of flavors will work best with your smoothie recipes. For pumpkin pie smoothies, try cinnamon and nutmeg. Or for a mango smoothie, try chili powder. Make sure that you only use a small amount to flavor your protein powder. Start with about 1/8 of a teaspoon and increase if desired. Some good spice choices include:Cinnamon
Ginger
Nutmeg
Chili
Cayenne
Curry powder

, After you are finished making your protein powder, you can place it into a large mason jar and place a lid on it. Store your protein powder in the refrigerator or in another cool, dry place.

, You can use a couple of tablespoons of protein powder in smoothies and other recipes to add some extra protein to your diet. Make sure that you stir well or blend the pea protein powder into your liquid to avoid any lumps in your smoothies or other recipes.


If you are making a smoothie, then blend the protein powder in with your other ingredients.
If you are making a soup, then use an immersion blender or a whisk to make sure that your ingredients are well combined.

, This protein powder will keep for about one week, so plan on making a new batch once per week.You can experiment with different add-ins and spices to make a different blend every week or stick with a favorite recipe if you like.


You may also try freezing your protein powder to ensure that it stays good longer.

Keep a food journal.,
Add up your daily totals.,
Don't eat too much protein.",How to Determine How Much Protein You Need," Your level of activity determines the number of calories you should consume in a day. Because protein makes up a portion of those calories, your activity level also determines how much protein you should eat.A sedentary lifestyle is one where you don't get any exercise besides going through your daily activities.Moderate activity includes your daily routine plus walking 1 1/2 to 3 miles a day at 3 to 4 miles an hour or an equivalent exercise routine.If you're active, you walk at least 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, or do an equivalent exercise.Athletes are training to compete in sports and get a significant amount of exercise.;
, The formula for figuring out how much protein you need is based partially on how much you weigh. Weigh yourself in pounds, and write down the number., Each activity level has a multiplier for how much protein you need. The answer is how much protein you need in grams.For a sedentary to moderate lifestyle, multiply by 0.4. So if you weigh 140 pounds, you need 56 grams of protein a day.For an active lifestyle, multiply by 0.4 to 0.6. So if you weigh 140 pounds, you need 56 grams to 84 grams of protein a day.For an athlete who's building muscle or for a young athlete, you need 0.6 to 0.9 grams per pound. If you weigh 140 pounds, you need 84 grams to 126 grams per day., Meat is one of the best sources of protein, as it is a complete protein, meaning it offers all the amino acids your body needs from one source.One ounce of meat has 7 grams of protein.Eat a variety of meats, so as to get different nutrients and flavors. Avoid boredom and vary your meals.


It's best to pick lean cuts of meat, such as chicken or fish, as too much fat in your diet is unhealthy. When eating chicken, take off the skin to reduce the fat., Eggs are also an excellent source of complete protein. For 7 grams of protein, eat a large egg.Remember that eggs can be used in sweet or savory dishes! They are quite versatile. Scramble eggs with veggies and reduced-fat cheddar cheese or whisk egg whites with steel cut oats and cinnamon for a quick protein pancake! The options are endless.


For an easy, protein-heavy snack, boil some eggs at the beginning of the week. Peel them, and keep them in the refrigerator to grab as needed.

, A cup of milk has about 8 grams of protein.It also provides you with carbohydrates, too, which is why some people drink it after working out as a recovery drink.To improve on this, add a scoop of whey protein powder (with less than 5g sugar) to your milk and really pack a protein-punch.


If you're not a big fan of milk, try adding yogurt to smoothies. It will thicken the smoothie and add richness, but you can cover up the flavor with fruits and vegetables.In fact, yogurt has more protein per cup than milk, about 11 grams., You can get protein from vegetarian sources. The main sources are lentils or beans. For instance, a cup of beans has about 16 grams of protein. You can also eat lentils or peas for about the same amount of protein.Try eating beans with rice, as they form a complete protein together.If that's not your cup of tea, be sure to eat a variety of grains, seeds, and beans throughout the day to get all the amino acids you need if you're a vegetarian., Nut butters, such as peanut butter, can also add protein to your diet. For instance, a tablespoon of peanut butter has 4.5 grams of protein.To incorporate peanut butter in your diet, spread some on a piece of whole-grain toast or add a tablespoon to a smoothie.

, The first step to tracking your protein is to make sure you understand servings. The easiest way to calculate your servings is to measure out your meals. You should weigh meat or measure out foods like beans and legumes with measuring cups.


Weigh meat in ounces, and multiply by the amount of protein in each ounce. For instance, 3 ounces of meat has 21 grams of protein because each ounce has 7 grams.Remember that when tracking protein, it is best to weigh protein raw and stick with that method.
Measure out beans in cups, and multiply the amount by the number of grams of protein per cup. For instance, 3/4 cup of beans has 12 grams of protein because 0.75 times 16 is 12.If you don't want to take the time to measure, you can learn to eyeball your measurements. For instance, 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards, and 3 ounces of fish is about checkbook-sized.. A 1/2 cup of beans is about the size of a light bulb, while 2 tablespoons of peanut butter is golf-ball size., Keeping a food journal helps you know what you are eating in a day. It makes you more aware of each bite that goes in your mouth. To keep a food journal, simply write down the food and the portion of everything you eat each day, including the amount of protein you've eaten.If overeating is a problem for you, you can also write down associated activities and feelings, such as ""was feeling sad and watching television."" That way, you can note trends of when you eat more., Once you've recorded each day's protein, add it all up. Compare it to how much protein you should be eating so that you can adjust your protein intake up or down.

, While it may be tempting to eat extra protein to help build bigger muscles, your body really doesn't need extra protein. In fact, if you consume more protein than your body needs, it generally turns it into fat.Even worse, it stresses the kidneys.

Make a hummus and vegetable jar.,
Prepare a yogurt and fruit parfait.,
Boil two eggs.,
Use lettuce and turkey to make a turkey wrap.",How to Prepare High Protein Snacks1," This healthy afternoon snack is easy to prepare, but does need to be stored in a refrigerator or cooler. All you have to do is get a small jar with a screw on lid. Scoop some hummus into the bottom of the jar. Slice some veggies of your choice lengthwise so that you can easily grab them from the jar. Gently poke the vegetables into the hummus so that they stand up. Screw on the lid tightly and you’re ready to go.Just about any vegetable can go well with hummus. For example, celery, bell peppers, cucumbers, carrots, etc.
If you want to use vegetables, such as broccoli or cauliflower, that can’t really be sliced into long thin chunks then opt for a shorter squat container. For example, a small plastic container that you use for storing leftovers would work well.;
, In a small jar or container, add a scoop of plain Greek yogurt, followed by a spoonful of fresh berries or other fruits. Repeat this until you have added about 1/2 a cup of yogurt, and 2 tablespoons berries. Place the lid on tightly.Store this high-protein food in a fridge or cooler.


Frozen fruit should also work.
Top the parfait with a small drizzle of honey to add some sweetness.
Throw in a handful of nuts to add even more protein.

, Place the eggs in a small pot and cover with water. Heat until the water reaches a full boil, then immediately remove the pot from the heat and cover it. Allow the eggs to sit in the water for 10-15 minutes if you want them hard boiled. You can leave the eggs in for as few as three minutes for soft boiled eggs, but these will be difficult to eat on the go.


Peeled or unpeeled, eggs should be stored in a fridge or eaten within 2 hours at room temperature (1 hour in temperatures above 90ºF / 32ºC). To give yourself a little more time, freeze a gel pack or juice box and pack it with the egg to bring to school or work., Wrap up a couple of slices of turkey in a big piece of lettuce to make a low-carb, high protein snack. Add a few slices of carrot, cucumber, avocado, or red pepper with a teaspoon of mustard for extra flavor.Alternatively, if you don’t mind the carbs, you could simply make a turkey sandwich for your snack or you could use a tortilla to wrap up your turkey.

Add a liquid.,
Add a sweetener.,
Add your protein.,
Add a protein booster.,
Add some fruits or vegetables for flavor.,
Blend your ingredients.",How to Prepare High Protein Snacks2," In order to make your smoothie into a drinkable smoothie, you’ll need to add a liquid. This part of the smoothie is extremely flexible. You can add just about any type of liquid you like. You can use any type of milk (e.g. dairy milk, soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk, etc.), water (coconut water works great, too), or even juice if you want to.


Using a type of milk will make the smoothie more creamy, and water will make it thinner.Start by adding 3/4 of a cup of the liquid of your choice to the smoothie. If you want the smoothie to be thinner, you can add a bit more liquid.

, If you want to add a little extra sweetness to your smoothie, you can 1 or 2 dried and pitted dates, a spoonful of agave nectar, a bit of honey, or even a dash of maple syrup.Simply add the sweetener of choice into the blender.


If you don’t need the extra sweetness or are trying to keep the sugar content as low as possible, you can always leave these out.

, Choose a protein and add 1/4 cup of the ingredient to the blender. Some examples of good protein sources include Greek yogurt, any type of nut butter (peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, etc.), raw cashews, powdered milk, or even silken tofu. Adding tofu may sound strange, but it won’t add a whole lot in terms of flavor (so your protein smoothie isn’t going to taste like tofu), and it is a great source of protein.If you want to use cashews, try soaking them overnight in water. This will make them softer and they will blend better.
You may be tempted to use a protein powder for this step, and you can do that if you want to; however, you should be aware that many protein powders contain potentially dangerous heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and/or cadmium. Additionally, protein powder often supplies more protein than you really need., Consider this an extra boost for your shake. They won’t add much in terms of flavor, but they will add extra protein and may make the shake more creamy. Examples of things you can include are: flax seeds, chia seeds, whole oats, or hemp hearts.For each protein booster you choose to add, add about 1 tablespoon.

, Now that you’ve got your sources of protein, you can add any fruits and vegetables you like. Try adding 2 cups (~500 mL) spinach to turn your smoothie into a healthy meal, or just a large handful for a small boost with less effect on flavor. Adding frozen fruit will help make your smoothie refreshing. Any fruit that you enjoy will work: raspberries, strawberries, mangoes, nectarines, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and so on.


If you like peanut butter and bananas, consider adding a frozen banana to your smoothie and use a nut butter as your protein. This will turn your smoothie into a creamy and tasty treat.
Adding half an avocado may sound strange, but it won’t change the flavor much. It will, however, make your smoothie extra creamy.
If you don’t have anything frozen to put in your smoothie, consider adding a handful of ice cubes before blending. If everything in your ingredients is at room temperature, your smoothie will be too.

, Now that you’ve got all the necessary ingredients to make your protein smoothie, all you have to do is blend it all together. Be sure to place the lid on securely. Blend until all the ingredients are blended smoothly together.


If your smoothie isn’t blending well and seems to be sort of stuck in the blender, try adding a bit more of your liquid of choice or water, then stir it with a spoon a bit before resuming blending.

Gather your ingredients.,
Roast the chickpeas.,
Sprinkle the chickpeas with the seasonings.",How to Prepare High Protein Snacks3," For this recipe, you’ll need 1 can of chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans), olive oil, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.This protein snack is suitable for vegans.
If you don’t like garlic powder and onion powder, or if you want to mix it up, you can also try other flavor combinations that seem interesting to you. Some examples include salt and vinegar, paprika, curry, chili powder (if you like it spicy), or even just a bit of salt and pepper.

, Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 C). Before you roast the chickpeas you should drain and rinse the chickpeas. Dump the chickpeas into a clean strainer and rinse them under clean, running water. Dry the chickpeas by spreading them out flat onto a paper or kitchen towel and blotting the excess liquid away using another paper or clean kitchen towel.Place the dry chickpeas onto a baking sheet and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle them lightly with 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
Place the chickpeas into the oven for 15 minutes.
Using an oven mitt, take the pan out of the oven and shake it around gently to roll the chickpeas onto their other side.
Place the chickpeas back in the oven for 15 minutes more. Rolling the chickpeas around will prevent them from getting burned on one side.

, Remove the roasted chickpeas from the oven and sprinkle 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of onion powder, and just a dash of cayenne pepper evenly over the chickpeas. Doing this while the chickpeas are still warm will help the seasonings stick to the chickpeas.Shake the pan gently around to help coat the chickpeas evenly in the seasoning.
If you don’t want your chickpeas to be spicy, you can leave the cayenne pepper out.
Allow the chickpeas to cool before enjoying your protein snack.

Increase your protein intake for breakfast.,
Between meals choose snacks with the higher protein amount by reading the label.,
Improve the quality of the protein you are presently eating.,
Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables if possible.,
Fruits have different amounts of protein, so choose your fruits accordingly.,
Make your diet plan with consideration of complex carbohydrates and their protein content.,
Also choose whole grains over processed for the increased protein and other nutrients.,
For some meals, use beans as a secondary starch.,
Finally, remember that our bodies run on fuel and not from mental willpower.",How to Decrease Fatigue by Increasing Protein Consumption,"


Many people consume the least amount of protein at breakfast.
Increase your breakfast calories and decrease your calories elsewhere. Even without making any other changes, increasing caloric consumption at breakfast and decreasing calories from the other meals will make the body more efficient in its energy use. Think of your body as a building being built and behind schedule. The work crew works around the clock, so it makes sense to have resources equally available. By increasing your breakfast calories through eating additional protein your body is more efficient. Protein can only be used at a set rate, the excess will be converted to fuel or fat.
Drinking a glass of low-fat or skim milk would increase protein intake nicely, but lactose intolerance increases with age. Try swishing the milk in your mouth before swallowing.
Eat dry cereal instead of wet cereal, because with wet cereal you will not put as much milk as dry cereal. Cereal with milk, unlike drinking milk, is more digestible because digestion begins in the mouth.
Overcome your fear, go to the biggest health food store, and buy granola in bulk. The store might have 10 or more types of granola: plain, with nuts, with fruits, with other grains besides oats (eating foods originating from exotic parts of the globe is like traveling). You might open a chute or use a scooper and choose the amount of granola you want. If the prices online are better, Amazon.com is good because they give excellent service. Whatever the case, compare prices. Usually, supermarkets do not have good prices for this item. note: heath food followers are the leaders in the healthy food movement: what they are following today is what the rest of the population might be following a decade or two in the future.
Instead of butter or margarine, use peanut butter or hummus. Hummus is prepared with olive oil (which is tasty and has health benefits).;
, The protein amount is listed in grams and experts recommend the average male to have 56 grams of protein every day (46 grams for females), but make adjustments for your level of activity, bodyweight and age. Do not assume anything, for example you would think that yogurt covered pretzels has more protein than peanut butter pretzels, however peanut butter pretzels has much more protein than the yogurt covered ones.

, Choose low fat meats instead of high fat (choose ham, more frequently, as a breakfast meat, instead of high fat meats like pork sausage or bacon) and you will decrease the fat and increase the protein. Decreasing saturated fat is also good for your health. Drink low-fat or skim milk instead of whole milk, by consuming the same amount of calories from milk, you will decrease your fat intake and increase your protein intake.

, An apple, for example, with the skin on has more protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber. The protein in an apple is low but every bit counts, just as important is the health benefits of leaving the skin on. Most of the nutrition in fruits and vegetables are close to the surface, so even if you peel the skin off of an apple (not advised), the areas close the skin has more nutrition than closer to the center. Fiber uses up the bile (that green substance in your intestines) and to make bile the body turns to cholesterol. This is a way that fiber decreases cholesterol. Learn about the other ways that fiber decreases fat and is beneficial.

, The following fruits are listed from the ones with the most protein to the ones with less protein: orange, plum, honeydew melon, banana, mango, pineapple, and dates.

, The following are, in decreasing order, the complex carbohydrates by the amount of protein they have per equal amount of calories: whole wheat bread, corn, regular oats, potatoes with the skin on, and brown rice. Whole wheat bread has more protein than the other items.

, For example, white bread has 5 grams of protein for 200 calories and whole wheat bread has 10.6 grams of protein for the same amount of calories. Eating whole grains are good for your health. Eating whole foods and eating a variety of foods are very important for your health and to have a quality protein intake.

, In western meals, beans and potatoes (also rice or bread) are a staple and is very high in protein content. Tofu is another item that can be eaten to increase your protein intake. When picking a vegetable, pick beans in a pod (green, snap, snow peas, long beans) because of their protein, although beans as a vegetable do not have the protein of beans per se (pinto, kidney, lima etc), they have more protein than other vegetables.

, Like a car, we fill up the gas then we go on our drive. You must eat a well balanced diet then start your day.

Keep nuts as a snack.,
Consider a protein supplement or powder.,
Determine how much protein you need based on your age.,
Look up the amount of protein in common foods.,
Calculate protein requirements as a portion or your daily diet.,
Determine whether you have special additional requirements.,
Evaluate your current diet.,
Start to read nutrition labels.,
Incorporate plant- or animal-based proteins at each meal.",How to Eat More Protein," Seafood and poultry are two excellent sources of protein.They’re also healthier options than other forms of meat protein because they’re generally lower in fat.


In addition to being a great source of protein, many seafood options, such as salmon, are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for the heart.Dark meat poultry is slightly higher in fat than white meat. You should also remove the skin from poultry before cooking because it’s loaded with saturated fat.Pork tenderloin is another protein-rich white meat.It is less lean than poultry but still leaner than red meat.;
, When you do have a dish that calls for beef, ensure that you use lean beef. Lean cuts are generally only 1g higher in saturated fat than skinless chicken, and they’re still a great source of protein.Some examples of lean cuts of beef include top round, sirloin, flank steak, and 93% ground beef. A 3.5 oz serving of lean beef has 10g or less of fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95mg of cholesterol.In addition to a source of protein, lean cuts of beef also contain zinc, iron, and vitamin B12.Look for the terms “loin” or “round” to help pick out lean cuts of beef.

, Milk, cheese, and yogurt are all good sources of dietary protein.Full-fat options can carry heavy calorie counts, though, so always opt for low-fat options (such as 1% or skim milk) to maximize the amount of protein while minimizing calories.Dairy products are also a great source of calcium and many are fortified with vitamin D.Try strained Greek or Icelandic yogurt for a higher protein snack. Each 6 oz serving has about 14g protein, compared to 10g in low-fat yogurt., If you’re looking to add more protein on a budget, eggs are one of the least expensive sources of protein you can find.The American Heart Association even says that healthy adults can safely add an egg to their diet every day.As with dairy products, you can also maximize protein while minimizing fat based on how you eat the eggs. Egg whites contain nearly 50% of the protein in the entire egg while containing almost no fat,so consider separating the egg white from the yolk when eating eggs. Purchasing a carton of egg whites can also be a good option. Be sure to read the label to make sure it is 100% egg whites, since some brands add salt., Beans are a great source of protein for any diet, and they’re also loaded with fiber and other nutrients that keep you feeling full, which makes them a perfect substitute for red meat in a number of dishes, including chili and tacos.1/2 cup of beans even contains as much protein as a full ounce of broiled steak., Soy is another great source of protein, and it’s lower in fat than many other sources, which makes it a heart-healthy option., Almonds, cashews, and pistachios are all relatively low-calorie nuts at approximately 160 calories per ounce.These options also contain between 5-6g of protein in the same serving size as well as beneficial fiber, making them a great protein-rich snack that’s much healthier for you than something sugary and processed.Avoid nuts coated in salts or packaged/roasted in oils. Raw or dry roasted nuts are the best options for maximizing protein while minimizing calories.

, If you are protein deficient or extremely physically active, consider a protein supplement. Many grocery stores sell affordable protein bars or protein powders that you can add to smoothies, shakes, cereal, and other foods.


Check the label on the product to ensure that it contains at least 6g of protein per serving and that it is low in both sugar and fat., Many people assume that the more protein they can pack into their diet, the better. However, there are establish daily recommendations for how much protein someone’s diet should include. The easiest breakdown for this is by age.Children ages 1–3: 13 grams
Children ages 4–8: 19g
Children ages 9–13: 34g
Girls ages 14–18: 46g
Boys ages 14–18: 52g
Women ages 19–70+: 46g (71g if pregnant or breastfeeding)
Men ages 19–70+: 56g

, When considering protein in this manner, it helps to know how much protein is in certain common foods.1 cup of milk has 8 grams of protein
A 3-ounce piece of meat has about 21 grams of protein
1 cup of cooked beans has about 16 grams of protein
An 8-ounce container of yogurt has about 11 grams of protein

, Seeing protein listed in grams can be hard to visualize. Another way to see it is that your daily amount of protein should constitute between 10-35% of your caloric intake., Athletes and the elderly may need more than the Recommended Dietary Allowance for individuals in their age groups to maintain muscle health and proper skeletal function. Ask a health professional or dietitian to help you calculate your daily needs if you are highly active, over the age of 65, or have a metabolic or kidney condition.Vegetarians and vegans are other groups of people who may be at risk of a protein deficiency. However, plant-based diets can still include enough supplemental protein sources. You can find more information about eating enough protein as a vegetarian at: How to Eat More Protein in Your Vegetarian Diet.

, Depending on your current diet, you may already consume adequate protein, even for an active lifestyle. Write down the type and quantity of foods you eat every day for a week (including snacks, drinks, and supplements). If they have an ingredient label, calculate the grams of protein in the serving you consume; otherwise, look up the probable amount of protein in a food through the USDA nutrient database or an online ingredient tool.

, Getting accustomed to the quantity of protein in common foods, such as milk, can help you plan your daily menu to ensure adequate protein intake. If you are concerned about sufficient protein intake, opt for foods fortified with protein, such as energy bars or specialty athletic drinks.

, Consuming a variety of foods can help you achieve your daily protein needs with little additional meal planning, particularly if you do eat animal products. Obtaining the recommended number of servings for dairy, grains, vegetables, and lean protein (such as fish or chicken) every day should provide more than sufficient protein for the average person’s needs.

Avoid added sugar if you have diabetes.,
Avoid protein powders if you have chronic kidney disease.,
Make sure your supplement does not interact with existing medication.",How to Choose a Protein Supplement," If you're looking for muscle-building protein, whey protein is generally your best option. Whey protein can come in the form of powder or pills and is commonly used when people are trying to build muscle via things like weight training programs.Look for a whey protein powder or supplement with a high biological value. This measures how well your body can absorb the protein. The higher the biological value, the better.
Powders are usually used in things like shakes and smoothies. If your diet consists of shakes and smoothies anyway, go for a powder. Otherwise, a pill or tablet may make more sense for you.
A great way to boost your protein intake and save some money is to add powdered milk (whey protein is derived from milk) to a glass of regular milk and doubling the amount of protein.;
, If you're striving for weight loss, protein shakes can be used as a meal or snack replacement. This can help you feel full longer and give your body strength for extra exercise during weight loss regimens. It's always best to talk to your doctor before attempting to lose weight, so ask your doctor for suggestions for protein shakes.Avoid shakes high in added sugars. These may sabotage weight loss efforts.
Avoid shakes with branched-chain amino acids. These are used for body building, which can lead to increased muscle and weight gain.

, If you are lactose intolerant or have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), products containing lactose must be avoided, as they will can cause serious discomfort and digestive issues. Avoid supplements and powders made with artificial sweeteners, lactose sugars, or dextrins/maltodextrins., Soy has been shown to help promote bone health for some. If you're upping your protein intake to improve bone health, try a soy powder or pill to add protein.Powders are usually used if smoothies and shakes are a part of your regular diet. Otherwise, a pill or tablet is the better option.
Some evidence indicates soy may have an effect on hormone levels, so you may want to talk to your doctor before using a soy supplement.

, Protein supplements are not FDA regulated and may not be necessary for healthy adults. Even very physically active adults may not benefit from protein supplements.It's a good idea to speak with your doctor before adding a supplement to your diet. Your doctor should be more familiar with safe supplements and can also recommend specific varieties based on your current health and fitness level.


Ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian. These highly trained professionals can help you choose a supplement that fits your needs and should be well-informed about reputable brands.

, Look for supplements that have been verified by a reputable third party, such as USP (US Pharmacopeia), NSF International, or ConsumerLab.com. While verification doesn't necessarily mean the product will work as advertised, it does mean that it contains the ingredients advertised on the label and that it doesn't contain toxic substances such as arsenic, bacteria, or lead., In general, cheap supplements are not the best idea. Low-cost proteins may use inexpensive blends that the body does not digest very well, contain sub-par ingredients, or may not even contain what they advertise on the label. You should splurge on higher priced protein supplements whenever possible as these may be better for your overall health., Dairy-based proteins are generally healthier when they come from grass-fed cows, goats, or other animals. You should also make sure the animals were raised hormone-free. This should all be indicated somewhere on a protein supplements label., Artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners can diminish the effect of protein powders. Read ingredients lists carefully and opt for the most natural supplements you can find in your price range.Sucralose is a common artificial sweetener used in protein powders. Avoid powders that contain sucralose.
You should also look out for things like artificial colorings and dyes.
Hydrogenated oils should also be avoided.

, Often, it's better to add protein to your diet naturally instead of relying on supplements. If you're concerned about your protein intake, seek out natural sources of protein. You can add things like peanut butter, yogurt, soy milk, oats, or hemp seed to shakes or smoothies. This may be healthier than adding a supplement.You can also eat more lean meats and beans, which are great sources of protein.


You can also talk to your doctor or dietitian about healthy sources of protein. If you're concerned about protein due to a new workout routine, your doctor should be able to advise how much protein to add and where to get it naturally.

, You want to make sure you're not getting too much protein. Supplements may have high levels of protein and, if you're getting protein from other places in your diet, you may end up overdoing it in regards to protein intake. Most adults need about 0.75 g of protein/kg body weight each day, but this may depend on your activity level.You can read How to Determine How Much Protein You Need for more information.

Track how much protein you get from food sources. If you're within healthy levels, you may want to opt out of taking supplements. If you need more protein, make sure the amount of protein in your supplements will not exceed your daily limit.
You can end up with health issues like dizziness, weakness, and bad breath if you consume too much protein.

, Some protein shakes and powders are high in added sugars. If you have diabetes, go for supplements without added sugar.You should also be tracking your carbohydrate intake if you have diabetes, so make sure you look for the total carbohydrate content and count it as part of your meal or snack.

, If you have chronic kidney disease, your body cannot tolerate high amounts of protein. You will need to be careful about how much protein you consume in your diet, and taking a supplement can put you at risk of serious complications., You should always ask a pharmacist whether a supplement is safe given your existing medication. Some supplements may affect prescription medications in a negative way. It's also a good idea to talk to your doctor before taking protein supplements."

Add protein powder for muscle gain.,
Add protein powder for weight loss.,
Add protein powder for overall health.,
Add protein powder as a dietary supplement.",How to Choose a Protein Powder1," Protein powders can be added to your daily diet to help you boost your muscle mass and help your muscles recover after an intense workout. Protein is made up of amino acids that are responsible for toning and maintaining your lean muscle.


Again, protein supplements designed to help you bulk up should be an addition to your diet, not a replacement of a meal or meals.;
, Protein increases the feeling of satiety and fullness, which may help curb overeating. It is also important for maintaining current muscle mass when doing exercise. When you reduce the number of calories you eat each day by going on a diet, your body may begin burning away your muscle mass. Taking a protein powder will help to curb the loss of your muscle mass.


When trying to lose weight, the most important thing is to create a healthy diet for yourself and get plenty of exercise each day. Once you have shaped your diet and created an exercise regimen, you can then add weight loss supplements if you want to.

, Some studies suggest that protein powders can help your body to move nutrients through the body and may help to lower your cholesterol.


Because of this, adding a protein powder to your healthy diet could help with lowering cholesterol, blood pressure or body mass quicker than just eating a healthy diet alone.

, Some medical conditions can lower your body’s ability to process protein or require that you get extra protein to keep certain symptoms at bay. These reasons may include:


Having gastric bypass. This can cause you to need extra protein because your gut does not absorb nutrients as effectively as it may have before the surgery.
Having certain diseases or conditions like Celiac disease or Crohn’s disease. These conditions may cause you to need extra protein in case of a flare up.

"
"
Make sure to get enough protein each day so that you can stay healthy and energized.,
Eat 0.8 g of protein for every 1 kg (2.2 lbs.),
Try to get 15% of your daily calories from protein.,
Increase your daily calories from protein by up to 40% (with fat at 30%, and carbs at 30%).,
Limit your protein intake to 0.8 to 1.25 gram (g) per 1 pound (lb).",How to Choose a Protein Powder2," Protein is stored in the body muscle and must be consumed daily or it will be leached from the muscle for biological repair of tissue. This results in wasting of muscle tissue and loss of strength. For this reason, it is recommended that people get all the essential amino acids needed by the body on a daily basis.

Most people in western society do not need extra protein because the western diet is rich in protein. This doesn’t mean that using protein powders is bad for your health, but that you will need to plan your diet carefully, including the protein powders as a source of nutrition.
The research is still emerging on the amount of protein needed for everyone. However, there are current recommendations for protein based on scientific evidence that everyone can use.

, of body weight. This is what the Institute of Medicine recommends for a healthy adult. These are subsistence levels for sedentary individuals, which means that if you exercise frequently, you will need more protein.


This means that a 200 lb person would need approximately 72 g of protein a day.
If you exercise at all, the minimum should be 0.8 g per pound of body weight. So, a 200 lb. human should have 160 g of protein daily, more that twice as much as sedentary individuals.

, Protein provides 4 calories per gram. So for a 2,000 calorie diet, you would eat 75 g of protein daily.


Again, this is for people who do not exercise regularly and is a minimum amount needed. Active people should get at least twice that amount of protein, or 30%.

, The extra calories you get from protein should be used to limit the amount of refined carbohydrates you eat. Refined carbs are found in high fructose corn syrup and in processed grains like white pasta.


For a healthy adult, this increase should not negatively affect the kidneys if you drink 12 (8 oz.) glasses of water daily. By increasing the amount of calories you get from protein, you should be able to lose weight while also increasing your lean body mass.

, of body weight per day if you are trying to gain muscle mass and decrease body fat percentage. When you are trying to lose weight, it is important to keep the calories you consume in mind. Just because you limit your intake of carbohydrates when trying to lose weight does not mean you can eat excessive amounts of other types of food, like proteins.


If you have any health conditions that could affect your kidneys, limit your protein intake to 0.8 g per pound of body weight and see your doctor for regular blood work to monitor your kidney function. Track your intake with smartphone applications like ""Lose It!"", or another free application.

Pick an egg protein if high bioavailable protein is most important to you.,
Consume milk protein powder if you are trying to lose weight and improve health by exercising regularly.,
Add whey protein powder to your diet if you are using protein powder to aid in post-workout recovery.",How to Choose a Protein Powder3," Body builders looking to bulk up quickly might choose egg powder unless they have egg white allergies. Eggs have a biological value (BV) of 0.93, which means that they are essentially the perfect protein. Eggs contain all of the essential amino acids needed to help you maintain your muscle mass and are the most complete set of amino acids other than human milk. It can also help your muscles to recover after an intense workout.


In addition to helping you maintain your muscle mass, egg protein powder can help to make you feel full, which makes it an ideal protein powder if you are trying to lose weight.
Egg proteins are free of lactose and hence suitable for lactose intolerant people.
Egg proteins are the most bioavailable since they are bound to essential fats in the form of lipo-proteins.

, Milk protein powder can help you to lower your body mass and is thought to be able to help you lower your blood pressure. It can help your muscles to recover after a hard workout, and helps your body to synthesize new muscle protein.


Milk protein is generally consumed after a workout, as it helps your muscles to recover and retain their mass.
Do not use milk protein if you are allergic to lactose as it will have the same effect as drinking milk.

, Whey is the watery substance that is made when milk is made into cheese. Whey protein synthesizes new muscle protein more effectively than regular milk protein powders, which makes it the ideal protein powder if you are looking to bulk up with resistance training. The body can absorb whey protein quickly. However, this protein may cause you some gastrointestinal distress if you are lactose intolerant.


There are three different levels of whey protein: whey protein, whey protein isolate, and advance whey protein isolate. these levels are based on the filtering process each powder has gone through. The more a powder is filtered, the easier it will be for you to take if you are lactose intolerant. This means that if you are lactose intolerant, you would have the least gastrointestinal distress when using advanced whey protein isolate.
However, these advanced powders can be very expensive.

"
"
Understand that plant-based protein powders can have the same effects as animal-based powders.,
Choose a soy protein powder if you are looking to improve overall health.,
Have hemp protein if you are looking for a high quality vegan protein that is also high in fiber.,
Buy a flaxseed powder if you need to increase protein and omega 3 fatty acids.,
Incorporate brown rice protein powder into your diet if you have gastrointestinal issues, but still need a high quality protein powder.,
Pick pea protein powder if satiety is important.",How to Choose a Protein Powder4," The plant proteins available as protein powders are generally complete proteins. Some are gluten free and all can be considered vegan. They have lower protein content than animal sources, but still have many benefits.

Plant protein powders usually require more processing and tend to be more expensive than animal protein powders.

, Soy-based protein powders are the most widely used plant-based protein. This protein powder is generally recommended for women, as soy contains phytoestrogen, a plant sterol that can mimic the hormone estrogen. Phytoestrogen can decrease the ability of the hormone lipase to break down body fat. In the past, soy was thought to aggravate breast cancer, but new studies are showing that it may actually help to shrink tumors.


Soy protein comes very close to animal protein in protein content and quality. It has a PDCAAS value of 0.92 to 0.99.
Studies have shown that soy protein lowers LDL cholesterol and affects fat metabolism.
Soy protein also promotes satiety, which can help to keep you fuller for longer, so that you lose weight.
There have been limited studies showing soy protein having positive effects on cognitive function.

, In fact, hemp is considered a complete protein, as it contains all 20 essential amino acids. It is considered a good protein powder for people hoping to lose weight because it is high in fiber, which can help to fill you up and keep you fuller for longer.


Hemp also contains phytoestrogen like soy. Hemp protein is usually sold in blends with other proteins and is not widely available. It is a relatively expensive protein powder to use.

, Flaxseed is not a protein powder, but does contain high amounts of protein and can be used as a protein powder or with other protein powders. It is high in fiber and contains essential omega fatty acids, including omega 3’s.


The protein content and quality can vary with flaxseed. It is gluten free. Flaxseed powder is sold in most grocery stores.

, Brown rice powder is gluten free and easy to digest. It contains many of the essential amino acids, but not all of them, which means that it should be consumed in conjunction with other protein foods or powders.

, Pea protein made from the yellow split pea and is easily digested, as well as gluten free. It contains a well-balanced amino acid profile and a high amount of protein, though it does not have all of the necessary amino acids. It has a PDCAAS rating of 0.93.


Pea protein is especially good for people looking to lose weight, as it can keep you feeling full for long periods of time.

"
"
Understand what PDCAAS rating stands for.,
Know the difference between isolate and concentrate.,
Check the label when purchasing protein blends.,
Know that amino acid powders are not the same as protein powders.",How to Choose a Protein Powder5," PDCAAS stands for protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This score rates the protein based on bioavailability and essential amino acid supply.


The highest score is 1.00. Eggs have a score of 1.00.

, Protein powders are generally not made entirely of protein. Because of this, it is important to look at how much protein you are getting, and how many other ingredients there are.


Concentrate contains between 30% and 85% protein. It is cheaper and easier to find.
Isolate contains more than 90% protein and is more expensive.
When purchasing protein powder, be sure to check the label for the percentage of protein to be sure you are getting the best powder for your money.

, You will want to know how much of each protein is in the blend before you purchase the powder. This should be stated somewhere on the label.


If the amount of each protein is not stated, you may want to consider another blend.

, Proteins are made up of amino acids and, in order to be a complete protein, they must contain all 9 essential amino acids.


Amino acid powders have their functions, but will not do the same thing as a protein powder.

Meet with a dietitian.,
Calculate your recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein.,
Determine your RDA by percentage.,
Adjust your RDA.,
Consider how protein functions.,
Understand how proteins are built.,
Distinguish between nutrient-dense protein and lower quality protein.,
Include proteins from meat and fish.,
Include vegetarian proteins.,
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.,
Eat dairy proteins.,
Track the protein in your diet.,
Calculate your daily protein intake.",How to Calculate Protein Intake," Since each person's needs vary and depend on a number of factors, consider working with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, who has been trained to determine your specific dietary needs.


Ask your doctor to recommend a nutritionist or find a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.;
, Weigh yourself in the morning after using the toilet. Do this for five mornings and figure out your average weight. Multiply your average weight in pounds by 0.36. The result is your recommended protein intake in grams. The RDA for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which is why you should multiply your weight by 0.36.


You can also use online calculators to determine your RDA: http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/

For example, a person who weighs 120 pounds should eat 43.2 grams of protein a day (120 x 0.36 = 43.2).

, Another way to look at protein intake is to look at percentages. Depending on your age, gender, state of overall health, activity level and whether you need to lose or gain weight, your protein goal should be about 10 – 25% of your total daily calories.While this amount may seem high when figured as a percentage, dietitians remind that RDA is the minimum amount needed to function. Most Americans get 16% of their calories from protein, although they should be getting more., Some people need more protein than others. In general, children and teenagers need more protein (20 – 25% of calories) than adults. Men need more protein than women. And pregnant and lactating women need more protein than non-pregnant women (75 to 100 g per day).Older populations may need more protein to guard against sarcopenia, so aim for 1.2 g protein per kg.


If you have kidney or liver disease, you should decrease the protein in your diet according to your doctor's recommendation., Proteins can act as hormones, becoming chemical messengers that tell cells what to do and when to do it. Proteins are also enzymes, substances that can perform chemical reactions over and over again. In addition, proteins act as antibodies which bind to infectious or foreign particles. Antibodies are one of the body's main lines of defense.Protein also makes up the structure and support of every cell in the body. Transport proteins allow substances to move in and out of the cells.

, When we eat whole proteins, the groups of amino acids are broken down into individual amino acids then re-sequenced into whichever amino acids our bodies need at that particular moment. The amino acids are linked and folded in different ways. There are twenty types of amino acids found in proteins which fall into three main groups:Essential amino acids: You must get these from your diet, as they cannot be made by your body.
Non-essential amino acids: These are produced by the body.
Conditional amino acids: These are ones that we would normally be able to produce in the necessary amount, but during times of stress and illness we need more.

, Eating high-quality or nutrient-dense protein will benefit you more than consuming lower quality protein. For example, eating protein that's high in saturated fats will benefit you less than eating a lean protein that also has other nutrients. While emphasizing lean meats and other protein sources, don't think that you must give up meat.


For example, even though red meat contains protein, it can also increase blood pressure and cholesterol. Instead, choose lean meats like turkey or beans.

, Beef and pork contain high levels of protein, but they should be eaten in moderation. Instead, eat more lean meats which include skinless chicken and turkey. You can also eat fish like tuna or salmon.The egg has the highest biological value of all proteins. The biological value provides a measurement of how efficient the body utilizes protein consumed in the diet. Eggs and other animal proteins are considered ""complete"" proteins, as they contain all of the essential amino acids.2 eggs contain 13 grams of protein.

, Vegetarians need at least 3.5 ounces of protein a day (for a 2,000 calorie diet). You can easily get healthy protein from eggs and dairy products. If you're vegan, you can get protein from a variety of plant-based foods like:Soy products (Eat 75 grams of tofu to get 21 grams of protein)
Meat substitutes
Legumes (Try 3/4 cup cooked lentils for 13 grams of protein)
Nuts (Try 1/4 cup of almonds for 8 grams of protein)
Seeds
Whole grains (Eat 1/2 cup whole grain pasta for 4 grams of protein)

, While these may not have as much protein as other foods like meat or dairy, fruits and vegetables offer some protein and other important nutrients. Fruits and vegetables with the highest amount of protein include:Potato with the skin (5 grams of protein)
1/2 cup of broccoli (2 grams of protein)
Avocado (3 grams of protein)
Banana (1 gram of protein)

, Dairy is a great way for vegetarians and non-vegetarians to get protein. Research suggests that protein from milk may be easier to digest than meat, soy, or wheat proteins.Consider including:


1 cup of milk (8 grams of protein)
1/2 cup of cottage cheese (15 grams of protein)
1.75 ounce of cheddar cheese (12 grams of protein)
3/4 cup of yogurt (8 grams of protein)

, Track the amount of protein in everything you eat during the day. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service has a searchable nutrition database on its website here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods This makes it easy to track how many grams of protein you eat.


For example, protein intake from a simple breakfast like oatmeal with blueberries, milk, and yogurt would break down like this:

1 cup of oats (10.65 g of protein), 1/2 cup blueberries (0 protein), 1 cup of low-fat milk (4.26 g protein), and 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt (10.19 g protein) = 25.1 grams of protein.



, Once you've tracked all of your protein for the day, determine if you ate enough protein. For example, if you're a 120 pound person, you should be eating a minimum of 43.2 grams of protein a day, according to the USDA. If you find that you only ate 40 grams, try to include more protein in your diet.


Remember that there are special circumstances in which you might need more protein in your diet. For example, if you're 120 pounds, but are nursing, you should be eating a minimum of 71 grams of protein a day.

Substitute some of the bread recipe's flour with quinoa flour.,
Add soy flour to the bread's recipe.,
Add ground nuts, seeds, or legumes to the bread.,
Add eggs to the bread's recipe.",How to Add Protein to Bread," Quinoa is the seed of a broadleaf plant, so while not botanically a cereal grain, it is treated as a grain in culinary applications. Quinoa, along with the soybean, is one of the few plants to contain a complete protein. You can substitute about a fourth of the flour in a yeast bread recipe for quinoa to increase the protein content. In a quick bread, such as a muffin or biscuit, you can substitute nearly all of the flour for quinoa, noting that the bread will be more brittle and crumbly as more quinoa is added.;
, Soy flour can be used much like quinoa flour; it contains a complete protein and has a higher overall protein content than barley or wheat. Soy flour can be substituted for about a third of the recipe's flour.


Because neither soy nor quinoa contains gluten, yeast bread cannot be made with a large proportion of these flours. Gluten provides the elasticity that allows the bread to rise and entrap the carbon dioxide created by the yeast.
Powdered soy milk can be used instead of soy flour.

, Nuts, seeds, and beans are all high in protein, and can be easily added to a bread recipe. These ingredients can be bought in flour form, or they can be crushed and added directly to the bread dough.


Organic grocery stores and specialty food stores will stock common flour varieties like garbanzo bean flour and almond flour. These can be substituted for a recipe's flour content in small proportions.
Adding sesame seeds or poppy seeds will increase protein while adding a mild flavor. Caraway seeds add protein and are immensely popular in rye bread recipes.

, Many traditional bread recipes, such as brioche and challah, incorporate eggs into their dough. The result is a rich, almost custard-like texture and a yellow color. Adding eggs also increases the amount of protein in a bread recipe.

Consult your doctor.,
Eat healthy food at regular times.,
Exercise regularly.,
Balance your Circadian Rhythm.",How to Increase Creb Protein1," Maintaining your health is important, particularly if you suspect that you might have a CREB protein deficiency. Cognitive or psychological issues (e.g. anxiety) may be due in part to a lag in CREB protein activation, and can be treated with medications or targeted therapies. Visit a doctor if you experience memory, learning, or concentration issues, or if you want more information about boosting your CREB protein levels.CREB protein levels are typically measured by way of a Western blot test, which is performed in a laboratory using a cell or tissue sample. This test can be ordered by your physician, or requested at a private laboratory.Contact private clinics or laboratories in your area for price quotes for a Western blot test.;
, The body’s production of CREB protein depends on the healthy functioning of the metabolic energy cycle. To keep this cycle running at peak capacity, eat a balanced and low-fat diet that is high in nutrients. It is equally important to eat at regular times of the day to keep your metabolic activity in check, which you can facilitate by keeping a food diary.Keep your metabolism on track by eating meals and snacks at the same time every day.
Opt for snacks and meals that contain fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein (e.g. a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, with an apple and carrot sticks on the side).
Stay away from high fat, processed foods (e.g. fast food fare like hamburgers and fries).

, Exercise creates a molecular response in the body that can increase the activation of CREB protein.Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week, or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity. Moderate exercise may include things like walking or swimming, while more vigorous exercise could include running, jumping rope, or taking a spin class.For instance, go for 30 minute walks five days a week to get moderate exercise.
For an example of a more vigorous exercise routine, do 25 minute sessions of jump rope three times a week.

, Your Circadian Rhythm is an internal process that regulates when you feel sleepy and alert during the day, and at what times you sleep. Maintaining a healthy rhythm is key to regulating your eating habits and giving your body enough energy for exercise. Keep your Circadian Rhythm in check by:Keeping a consistent sleep schedule (i.e. going to bed and waking up at the same time every day)
Steering clear of electronic devices close to your bedtime, which simulate daylight and adversely affect your body’s sleep instincts
Exposing yourself to bright light in the morning to wake up (e.g. opening the blinds, going outside for walk)
Avoiding all-nighters

Figure out how much protein you need.,
Keep a log of what you eat.,
Consult a professional.,
Recognize symptoms.",How to Avoid Eating Too Much Protein1," If you want to avoid eating too much protein, you need to establish how much protein you need. In the US, individuals are encouraged to consume 10-35% of their calories from protein. This amount can vary based on your current weight, activity level, and fitness goals. For instance, if you are a 33 year old, 5’4” tall women who weighs 150 lbs. with a moderate daily activity level, you should aim to consume 1850 calories each day to maintain your current weight. Between 185 and 650 of these calories should come from protein (46-162 grams).An easy way to calculate your protein needs is to multiply your weight in kilograms by 0.8 (divide your weight in pounds by 2.2 to get your weight in kilograms). For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms, then your daily protein needs would be 56 grams (70 x 0.8 = 56).
Keep in mind that optimal protein intake is 1 gram per kilogram, so you would want to aim for between 56 to 70 grams if you weigh 70 kilograms. Older adults also need more protein, so you could have as much as 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight if you are over 50 years old.Numerous online protein calculators can help give you a personalized “protein number” to shoot for.
Eat slightly more protein if you are trying to lose weight and/or build muscle.
Eat slightly more protein if you exercise regularly and live an active lifestyle.;
, Once you know how much protein you need, you need to compare this against the amount of protein you normally eat. Without altering your diet, keep a food log for at least a week. Be sure to include portion sizes. Go back and total up the amount of protein you consumed. You can easily find the protein amounts for specific foods by performing an internet search.Here is a brief guide:


3 ounce piece of meat – 21 grams.
8 ounce piece of meat – up to 50 grams.
8 ounces of milk – 8 grams.
8 ounces of yogurt – 11 grams.
8 ounces of dry beans – 16 grams.

, In order to determine your own personalized protein needs, it is best to consult a professional nutritionist. A nutritionist will be able to weigh a variety of personalized factors and help you draft a specific meal plan for you to follow. Additionally, before making any major changes to your diet or lifestyle, you should consult your doctor.


Perform an internet search for nutritionists in your area.
Make an appointment.
Be prepared to discuss your goals, food preferences, health issues, and medical history.

, If you are consuming too much protein, you may be experiencing some physical symptoms as a result. Keep an out of for these symptoms, and speak to your doctor. Alleviating them may be as simple as eating a little less meat.Watch out for:


Weight gain.
Kidney problems.
Dehydration.

Take butyrate supplements.,
Eat cinnamon.,
Ingest blueberry extract.",How to Increase Creb Protein2," Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that has a wealth of health benefits, including the increased production of CREB protein in the body. Ask your doctor if butyrate supplements (available over the counter at pharmacies and health stores) are right for you. Alternatively, try to infuse butyrate into your diet naturally by increasing your consumption of high fiber vegetables and dairy fats (e.g. butter, heavy cream)., Consuming cinnamon may increase the body’s production of CREB protein, making it a subject of research surrounding diseases like Alzheimer’s. Cinnamon can be metabolized into a non-toxic form of sodium-benzoate, a chemical approved by the FDA to treat brain damage. Purchase cinnamon supplements from a pharmacy or health store, or introduce cinnamon into your everyday diet by:


Using cinnamon oil for cooking or baking
Drinking Cinnamon tea

Using cinnamon sugar

Baking cinnamon rolls, cinnamon french toast, or cinnamon coffee cake


, Blueberry extract has been shown to improve cognitive function and increase CREB protein activation on the body. The compound can be consumed in food form, or more easily in supplement form (i.e. pure blueberry extract powder or isolated anthocyanins derived from the extract). For the best results, aim to consume between 5.5 and 11g of blueberry extract per day, 500 to 1,000mg of isolated anthocyanins, or 60-120g of fresh berries."

Eat some low-fat sausage.,
Opt for bacon.,
Try salmon.,
Have some chicken breast.",How to Add Protein to Breakfast1," While sausage is not traditionally thought of as a healthy food, low-fat sausage can be a great source of protein at breakfast when paired with other healthy choices. Instead of pork- or beef-based sausages, go for chicken and turkey sausages instead. Pair these with something like a bowl of oatmeal, yogurt and fruit, or whole wheat toast for a healthy, protein-rich breakfast., While traditional bacon does have more fat and calories than turkey bacon, it also contains good fat and has less sodium than poultry-based bacons. You can add a few slices of bacon to your morning eggs, toast, or cereal to add a boost of protein.You can also try Canadian bacon, which contains about 20 to 30 grams of protein per serving., Smoked salmon is sometimes served along with bread-based products for breakfast. Fish is a very healthy source of protein that also includes omega-3 fatty acids. Try having a piece of smoked salmon on top of a piece of whole wheat toast. Top it off with some avocado for a healthy, filling, protein-rich breakfast., While not thought of as a traditional breakfast food, there's no reason you can't have some chicken breast during your breakfast.

Snack on fruit.,
Munch on veggies.,
Include some whole grains.,
Make sure you’re eating healthy fats.",How to Avoid Eating Too Much Protein2," If you have found that you have too much protein in your diet, you need to make some changes. You can reduce the protein in your diet back to a normal level, by filling that space alternative healthy foods. Instead of grabbing for that protein bar, snack on a piece of fruit.You can try:


1 medium apple – 0.5 grams protein.
1 cup grapes – 0.6 grams protein.
1 cup blueberries – 1.1 grams protein.
1 medium banana – 1.3 grams protein.
1 kiwi – 0.8 grams protein.
1 cup cantaloupe – 1.3 grams protein.

, Vegetables should take up the most room on your plate. Veggies are full of vitamins and mineral that are essential to a healthy diet. Choose a smaller serving of protein, and fill that space with health-supportive vegetables.Toss mixed veggies in olive oil and roast them in the oven – 2 grams protein per ½ cup.
Choose a green salad for lunch – average 5 grams protein per bowl.
Snack on raw veggies, like carrots, celery, or chopped bell pepper – 3 grams protein per 2 cups.

, Although some modern weight loss fads may have said differently, complex carbohydrates are your friend. Whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Plus, they give you energy!Try eating brown rice (5 grams protein per cup) or quinoa (13.1 grams protein per cup) with meals.
Grab a rice cake for a quick snack (1 gram protein per rice cake).
If you eat pasta or bread, choose whole grain options (7 grams of protein per 1 cup cooked pasta).

, The final ingredient in a healthy balanced diet is the inclusion of healthy fats. That’s right: not all fat is bad for you. Healthy fats build your brain and help your body run. Oils contain very little protein.Some good healthy fat choices include:


Oils – coconut, olive.
Nuts and nut butters – almonds, peanut butter.
Hummus.
Avocado.

Avoid processed meat.,
Opt for poultry and fish.,
Eat plant-based protein.,
Choose healthy snacks.",How to Avoid Eating Too Much Protein3," Alongside eating the right amount of protein, you must ensure that you’re getting the right type of protein. Overly-processed sources of protein can be high in preservatives, additives, and antibiotics, which do not make good fuel for your body. Skip the processed stuff when you can.Avoid:


Lunchmeat.
Lunchables.
Breakfast meat, like bacon and sausage.
Highly processed meats (such as fast food hamburgers and hotdogs).

, Your best bets for clean, lean protein are organic chicken and turkey and sustainably farm-raised fish. Include small portions of chicken and fish at least a couple of times a week.Bake salmon topped with Dijon mustard (40 grams of protein per 0.5 ounce fillet).
Use chicken breasts in soups and stews (43 grams protein per 1 cup chicken breast).
Use organic ground turkey in recipes instead of beef (27 grams protein per 100 grams of turkey).

, An effective way to avoid eating too much protein, while still getting the right amount of this vital building-block, is to give up meat altogether. Instead, you can get all the protein you need from plant-based sources.Make lentil stew or veggie chili with beans.
Sautee sliced tofu in olive oil and eat on a sandwich.
Include nuts and seeds in salads.

, You can also ensure that you consume the right amount of protein by choosing healthy snacks. Keeping snacks with you in case you get hungry will help you avoid making poor food choices. Ideas for foods to toss in your bag include:


Kind bars.
Mixed nuts.
Fruit, such as apples, oranges, or banana.
Chopped veggies with hummus or peanut butter.

Allow the whey to drain completely from the curdles.,
Use a dehydrator to process the whey, if you have one.,
Process the whey by hand if you don't have a dehydrator.,
Blend the dehydrated whey into a powder.,
Store the protein powder in a lidded container.",How to Make Homemade Whey Protein1," You will need 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of milk. For best results, use grass-fed. whole milk.


You can also use 4 cups (950 milliliters) of milk and 2 cups (475 milliliters) of cream.;
, You can gauge the temperature by sticking a cooking thermometer into the pot, then clipping it to the side. If you don't have a thermometer, just wait until the milk starts to simmer. 180°F (83°C) is the temperature at which milk simmers.Don't let the thermometer touch the bottom of the pot.

, If you don't have any lemon juice, you can use white vinegar instead. This recipe will produce ricotta cheese as well. If you wish to eat the cheese, white vinegar may actually be the better of the two options.If you are using milk and cream, add ½ tablespoon (8.5 grams) of salt and 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) lemon juice or white vinegar instead., Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Take it off of the burner and set it some place where it won't get disturbed. Leave it there for 20 minutes.

, Place a large strainer on top of a bowl. Line the strainer with a piece of cheese cloth. Scoop the curdles into the strainer with a spoon of ladle. Pour the rest of the liquid into a large pitcher or jar, and store it in the fridge.

, It's best if you place the bowl into the fridge for this step. It may take at least two hours for the whey to drain out, and you don't want the milk to spoil., Pour the whey (both from the pitcher and the bowl) into the trays that came with you dehydrator; you'll need about 1 cup (240 milliliters) per tray. Process the whey according to the instructions on your dehydrator. Each brand will be different, but for most dehydrators, it will be 12 hours at 135°F (58°C)., Pour all of the whey into a pot. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to a steady boil. Let it cook until it becomes thick and clumpy. Spread it over a tray lined with parchment paper or wax paper, and let it cool off.Break it into tiny pieces, then let it dry for about 24 hours., You can do this with a blender or a food processor. You can even use a clean coffee grinder, if you have one. If your manually-processed whey still feels damp after this, you will have to spread it out again, let it dry another 24 hours, and then blend it once more., A mason jar would work great for this. Use the protein powder in protein shakes, cupcakes, bread, etc.

Add some vegetables and fruit as a side dish, or make an omelet full of veggies, to add extra nutrients to your morning eggs.

, Cottage cheese is a low calorie, protein rich cheese that tastes great when mixed with fruit. Just half a cup of cottage cheese contains 16 grams of protein. Mix in some fresh fruit with a little bit of cottage cheese for a quick, healthy breakfast choice.If you dislike the taste of cottage cheese, try mixing a small amount in with your pancake batter or in an omelet. This will add protein without making the cottage cheese taste overwhelming.

, If you love cereal in the morning, go for whole wheat cereals with high amounts of protein. In addition to choosing protein rich cereals, add milk or soy milk to your cereal for added protein. You can also mix in oats or nut putters, like peanut butter, to up the protein content.In addition to adding protein, add some fruit to your cereal for added health benefits.

, If you enjoy pancakes in the morning, you can increase their protein content with peanut butter. Simply add a few spoonfuls of peanut to the batter before frying up your pancakes for a healthy, protein-rich breakfast.To make pancakes even more nutritious, use whole wheat flour and add fresh fruit like blueberries to your batter.

, Tofu can be fried up for breakfast. If you don't eat eggs, use tofu in their place in something like a breakfast scramble. Try frying tofu with a variety of healthy vegetables for a quick, nutritious breakfast that's packed with protein., Chia and pumpkin seeds are a healthy option for breakfast that contain a large amount of protein. You can mix in seeds to cereal, yogurt, and oatmeal or buy bread with chia or pumpkin seeds included."

Add natural sugars to your shake from fresh fruit and dairy.,
Perk up your shake with starches.,
Give your shake a fiber boost.,
Throw some nuts or seeds into your shake.,
Add some grains to your protein shake.",How to Add Carbs to Your Protein Shake1," Sugar is a simple carbohydrate, and shows up naturally in many fruits in the form of fructose, and milk products as lactose.Add milk to your protein shake for a carb boost — use 2% or skim milk for low-fat options. Experiment with blending fresh fruit into your shake for added carbs and sweetness. Be creative — you can use strawberries, bananas, raspberries, blackberries, peaches, pineapple, mango, and many more.


Blueberries and acai also contain antioxidants, which are good for your body because they fight free radicals.Sucrose, or regular table sugar, is also a simple carb, but it’s healthier to get sugar from natural dairy or fruit sources. Avoid just dumping pure sugar into your shake.
Measure 2 oz. (56 g) of yogurt and blend it into your shake. Choose any flavor you like for great carb boost and taste.;
, Starches give your shake good carb content because they are complex carbohydrates (lots of carbs stuck together).Vegetables, grains, and legumes like beans and peas are good fresh sources of starch.


Whey protein is the most common choice for bulking up a shake with starch.You can get whey protein at many health food stores.
On top of that, add some starchy vegetables like sweet peas, pumpkin, squash, or yams — it will add texture and flavor, as well. It may seem strange to add vegetables to your shake, but it can result in some tasty and nutritious outcomes. Use fresh veggies, not frozen or dried., Fiber is also a complex carbohydrate, and is found in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans and peas. Fiber aids in digestion, and helps you feel full more quickly.Add fiber-rich fruits and veggies to your blended shake like kale, blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, kiwi, mango, orange (whole, not juice), apple, pear, or even avocado.For example, add 2 oz.

, You can use homemade or store-bought yogurt. If you are using store-bought yogurt, make sure that it does not contain gelatin or pectin.


Make sure that you are using plain yogurt or kefir; do not use the flavored kind.

, This can take up to 24 hours. If you used yogurt, you'll be left with sour cream in the strainer. You can leave the bowl in the fridge longer as well; this will give you more whey and turn the yogurt into cream cheese., Save the solids in the cheesecloth. Depending on how long you strained the yogurt/kefir, you'll be left with Greek yogurt, sour cream, or cream cheese! At this point, your whey is complete. It has plenty of protein on its own, but if you want to get even more protein, you'll have to dehydrate it.

, Fill the trays that came with your dehydrator with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of the liquid whey. Dehydrate the whey according to the instructions on your dehydrator. For most machines and dairy products, this will be 135°F (58°C). It will take about 12 hours for the dehydration to be complete., Pour all of the collected whey into a large pot. Bring the whey to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a steady boil. Allow it to cook until it turns into a thick, clumpy, curdle. Transfer it to a tray lined with parchment paper or wax paper, then let it cool.Break it into smaller pieces, and let it dry, about 24 hours., You can do this in a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor. Hand-processed whey may still feel damp at this point. If this happens to you, repeat the process: spread the whey out again, wait 24 hours, then grind it once more., Transfer the whey to a lidded container, such as a jar.

Understand why you might need to eat less protein.,
Determine high-value protein foods.,
Identify low-value protein foods.,
Evaluate your normal diet.,
Know the recommended levels of consumption.,
Stretch out your protein intake.,
Eat less high-value protein.,
Develop modified recipes.,
If necessary, include calorie boosters in your diet.,
Avoid food high in sodium.,
Maintain a healthy balanced diet.,
Keep drinking water.",How to Eat Less Protein," If you have problems with your liver or your kidneys, for example if you have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease you may be told to lower your protein intake. When your body processes food, the wast product urea is formed. If you have problems with your kidneys the urea may not be passed as it should. A build-up of such waste products can be very damaging for your health.By lowering the amount of protein you consume you are decreasing your kidneys' workload.
But remember that protein is an essential part of your diet and you should only switch to a low protein diet when advised and under the supervision of a doctor.;
, The first step to eating less protein is getting a clear understanding of where and how you consume protein in the first place. We consume two types of protein, high-value protein and low-value protein. Animal protein is high-value protein. It's important that you consume enough of this in order to keep your body healthy. This type of protein typically produces less waste than low-value protein due to the balance of amino acids.Chicken, turkey, fish, red meat, eggs, and pork are high-value protein foods.
Dairy is also a high-value protein, but dairy products also contain a high amount of phosphorous. Because of this, you may be required to lower the amount of dairy products you consume., Vegetable and plant proteins are known as low-value protein because they have less of the essential amino acids that high-value proteins contain. Examples of this kind of protein include cereals, bread, nuts, pasta, rice, noodles and dried beans.Sometimes high-value proteins, rich in amino acids, are known as complete proteins and low-value proteins as incomplete proteins.Always check the labels on food packaging to learn about the protein content.

, Once you know the main sources of protein and their respective values you can begin to analyse your diet and discover where and how you consume protein. If you have a problem with your liver or kidney that has required you to lower your protein, you should always carry out this evaluation with a dietician or doctor who can advise you on finding the right balance. You can use online tools to get a rough idea.You should never completely cut protein from your diet. The amount you need to reduce your intake by will depend on your particular condition.
The amounts you need to consume will change over time so you need to keep in close contact with your doctor to ensure your diet is helping your condition.The diet still has to meet your everyday nutrition needs, so it's not just a case of cutting things out haphazardly.

, How much protein you need to eat if you have a diagnosed liver or kidney problem will be determined exactly by your doctor and dietician. It will vary from case to case, but for kidney problems you may be told to consume just 200ml of milk, as well as one serving of protein, each day. This serving could be equivalent to 25g of meat (including chicken and turkey), 40g of fish, 1 egg, 25g of cheese, 25g of soya, or 75g of tofu, lentils or chick peas.For male adults (19-50) without kidney problems, the recommendation is 55.5g daily.
For women of the same age it is 45g.
Males between 11 and 14 normally need 42.1g and females slightly less, 41.2g.
15-18 year old males should get 55.2g daily, and females 45g., One way to lower the amount of protein is to subtly shift the way you prepare food. For example, if you are making a chicken sandwich, instead of loading it with chicken, just use a few thin slices. Add lots of lettuce, tomatoes and salad to balance it out so you still have a satisfying sandwich.Adding vegetables to egg or ground meats can significantly reduce the overall amount of protein in a meal or snack.
You can add bulk to soup by including low-value proteins such as rice. In cream soups cut down on milk and use a lower protein substitute.Favouring these lower-value proteins over high-value protein is a good way to lower your consumption but ensure you continue to get a balanced diet.

, As part of your strategy for cutting down on high-value protein, you will have to reduce the amount of meat you eat. This doesn't necessarily mean cutting it out altogether, but rather re-organising your meal so meat is a smaller side dish instead of the main focus of the meal. You can try incorporating more meat free days into your week.Consider going vegetarian as many plant-based protein sources have far less protein in them than animal sources.
You should always try to replace the calories that you would have consumed from the meat with something else. For example, have more vegetables or grains to compensate for less meat. Use vegetables and whole grains as fillers and remember to consume healthy fats that do not contain high levels of protein (such as coconut oil, avocado, etc).
If you like cheese, try a smaller amount of a stronger cheese so you still get the taste but in a smaller more intense dose., You can create new versions of your favourite recipes to make them lower in protein. One example is making a low-protein version of a chicken salad. A normal recipe could have 3 cups of chopped cooked chicken, with 1/4 cup of celery, 1 cup of red apples, 1/4 cup of pecans and 3tbs of mayonnaise.


You can make this low-protein by switching the ratios of ingredients.
Change to 1 1/2 cups chicken and raise the amount of celery to 1 cup to compensate., There is risk of you consuming insufficient calories when you lower your protein intake. When you planned out your diet with your doctor or dietician, she will have taken this into account, and she may have recommended you include some calorie boosters. This could include healthy fats, such as olive oil, salad dressings, and sunflower oil.


Avoid adding too many carbohydrates to meals to boost calories. Healthy fats are a great calorie-booster and provide amazing benefits to the body.
Honey, jam and other sweeteners can be added to food and drink to boost your calorie intake.
If you are diabetic be sure to consult with your doctor before including these sugary boosters., High levels of sodium can make it harder for your body to control blood pressure and fluid levels in your body. This will be particularly important if you have liver or kidney problems.Processed food is typically high in salt which means high in sodium. Fresh vegetables are a better option. If you are in any doubt, ask your doctor or dietician for advice or clarification., Your low protein diet will be specifically tailored to you and your health condition by experts and it's important that you stick to it. The diet prescribed for you will be one that balances the need to lower your intake of high-value protein, while still giving you the nutrients, minerals and calories you need.


If you have to cut down your protein, your doctor may prescribe nutritional supplements to help you secure all the nutrients you need., Unless you are advised by your doctor to reduce your fluid intake, be sure to continue to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water will help you stay hydrated as well as helping you to snack less. Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger and snack when we should be drinking water.


Eating fewer snacks can make it easier to lower your protein intake. Generally you are recommended to drink 1.2 litres of water a day."

Start your protein shake with a good base.,
Create the right carb-to-protein ratio.,
Avoid processed carbs.,
Try carb supplements.,
Blend your ingredients together for a smooth shake.",How to Add Carbs to Your Protein Shake2," Use a quality whey protein or other protein additive. Verify that your protein additive has all essential amino acids. Amino acids help your body maintain blood and organ functions. They also help boost your metabolism.


Ensure that your protein has low levels of cholesterol, which is not a necessary addition to healthy protein options.
Determine if the additive contains natural proteins. Artificially produced proteins aren't as effective in building muscles as natural proteins. This should be apparent on the label — if not, ask a sales representative.

, Generally, aim to have a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein, especially after a workout.Plan this in advance by reading nutrition labels on your shake ingredients. It may help to write down what you are putting in your shake, and include how many grams of carbs and protein your ingredients contain. That way you can tweak your recipe to get the desired ratio.

, Unlike the natural carbohydrates found in grains and seeds, processed carbs are not good for your body. Starch and extra sugar is added to many foods, like cereal, snack bars, frozen and prepackaged meals, and energy drinks.Check nutrition labels and don’t add anything to your shake that contains high fructose corn syrup and other sugary, processed ingredients.

, Although it’s best to snack on fruits, veggies, and whole grains to get carbs, you can also add carbohydrate supplements to a shake before, during, or after your workout. These “high glycemic” carbs — dextrose, glucose, and maltodextrin — require little digestion and give you a quick blood sugar spike.This helps your body absorb protein and repair muscle better.Waxy maize is another complex carb supplement that helps your body refuel by replenishing its sugar stores (called glycogen)., Start the blender at a slow speed and turn it up to medium. Shut the blender off, and pour your blended shake into a glass or travel mug. Make sure the texture is smooth and there are no sharp chunks in your shake before you enjoy it.

Track your protein intake.,
Buy whole, unprocessed foods.,
Purchase the leanest cuts of meat.,
Be extra mindful if you are vegan or vegetarian.",How to Choose Healthy Sources of Protein," Lean cuts of beef, poultry, fish, and pork can be protein powerhouses. Just be sure to trim excess fat from cuts of meat or buy ground products that have low fat contents.For example, choose pork tenderloin instead of pork belly.
Fresh meat from the butcher section of a grocery store is much less likely to have added salt, fat, preservatives, or sugar than canned, frozen, dried, or pre-packaged options.
There are many canned and frozen options without added salts and oils, however; you just have to check the labels.
Buy meat and fish canned in water instead of oil, for instance, and buy frozen meat and fish products without breading and marinades.;
, Eggs have the most complete amino acid profile found in nature apart from mother's milk and, as such, are one of the best sources of protein available. They are also rich in phospholipids and several micronutrients like anti-oxidants, zinc, calcium, immunoglobulins, and minerals.Try making an omelet, hard-boiled egg, or simply fry an egg in a pan.

, Milk, tofu, eggs, and similar products usually contain high amounts of animal or vegetable proteins. Opt for low-fat versions when possible to keep these protein sources as lean as possible.Keep in mind that products like low-fat cottage cheese, part-skim mozzarella string cheese, and a single hard-boiled egg can be very nutritious high-protein snacks.

, Most natural nut butters do not contain added salt or sugar, but a quick check of the ingredient list or nutrition label should confirm that.Peanut butter, almond butter, and other nut butters can be a great source of protein as well as iron and healthy fats.
When buying nuts pre-packaged or in bulk, opt for products that are unsalted or unflavored. Flavored nut products can contain alarming amounts of added salts and sugars, although some options may be roasted only with pure honey or chili powder, sans the extra sodium and simple carbohydrates. Always make sure to check the labels.

, Dried beans, split peas, and lentils are full of protein and often contain no added ingredients. They are an excellent source of healthy protein.Try using beans and other legumes in soups, stews, or casseroles. You can also get protein from the chickpeas used to make hummus.Some packages of dried beans and legumes may sometimes include a flavoring packet, but adding your own herbs, spices, and even a bit of salt at home can greatly reduce the amount of sodium consumed when preparing these protein sources as soups or side dishes.
Frozen beans can also be healthy sources of protein with very few additives, but always check canned beans to avoid products with salt, sugar, and other seasonings if possible, as these can detract from the overall nutritional value of the beans.

, Quinoa is a kind of seed grain that serves as an excellent source of protein. It is often called a “power food” because of the vast number of health benefits attributed to quinoa consumption.Quinoa also includes all nine essential amino acids that your body needs to function and grow.
This healthy protein option is also incredibly versatile for cooking. Quinoa goes well with vegetables or fruit, added to soup, or even made into a salad.
Cooking quinoa is a lot like cooking rice. You should add twice the amount of water to the quinoa and bring it to a boil. So, if you have one cup of quinoa, add two cups of water. After the water has begun to boil, put the heat on the low setting and cover the pot. Let it sit for twenty minutes and your quinoa will be ready to go.

, Protein powders and shakes can be a great way to include extra protein in your diet. These products provide the body with necessary protein and amino acids necessary for muscle growth and general overall health.


You can buy these kinds of products at most health stores. You can even usually find them at larger merchandise retailers like Walmart or Target.

, In order to choose healthy sources of protein, it’s important to have a basic understanding of how much protein you actually need. To find your recommended dietary allowance for protein, multiply your bodyweight in pounds by 0.36 – this will give you the number of grams of protein you should eat each day.You should have 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.
Your body can benefit from additional protein consumption immediately before and after workouts. Eating protein before a workout will help give your body the energy it needs to complete the workout routine. Eating protein after will help your muscles recover and grow.

, Keeping track of how much protein you consume is an important step in maintaining a balanced diet. In order to ensure you’re consuming an adequate amount of protein, keep track of how much protein you eat – that way, you can make adjustments if you need to.


Try keeping a food journal in which you document your food intake. Make special note of protein estimates.
If you find it hard to do the calculations yourself, try using an app that helps you track the protein you consume. With these apps, you typically search for the type of food consumed and then input the amount and the app calculates the protein for you.
Some popular protein tracking apps include EZ Protein Tracker, Protein+, and Protein Target., This makes the selection of foods without added salts, fats, and sugars much easier. The more ingredients added and processing that happens to a food, the less healthy it will be for your body. You want to consume foods that are as close to natural as possible, then add your own flavoring if necessary.Beans are a better source of protein when they are cooked and seasoned by the individual than when they are mixed with other ingredients in a can of bean soup.
Certain sauces, dressings, seasonings, flavorings, fillers, dips, and other additives or toppings can turn a fabulous, healthy protein source into a very unhealthy source of protein.

, Certain cuts and types of meat are naturally leaner than others. Try buying round, top sirloin, and tenderloin, or opt for turkey, chicken, or bison to limit fat and calories.Although most meat from the butcher is free of additives, check the label for injected salt solutions, marinades, or sugar rubs. These can add calories and sodium to an otherwise healthy lean protein source in a hidden way.

, Vegans and vegetarians don’t eat meat (or, for vegans, any animal products at all), so they miss out on the biggest source of protein available in our diets. If you are vegan/vegetarian, make sure you regularly consider your protein intake and try to supplement other options into your diet.Vegetarians must consume a variety of protein sources each day to get the required amino acids, since vegetable protein sources may not contain the complete proteins necessary for health and are often lower in protein than animal products. Milk and eggs can be valuable.
Vegans rarely get the required complete set of amino acids required for healthy muscle tissue. Supplementation is often recommended.

Add lean meats.,
Try some seafood.,
Top your salad with an egg.",How to Add Protein to a Salad1," Animal proteins are the most common and well-known sources of protein. When choosing meats, opt for high-quality sources that are grass-fed and free of antibiotics and growth hormones. This information is typically displayed on the packaging.White-meat poultry (31 grams of protein in three ounces) is a lean protein, which is especially healthy without the skin (which is high in saturated fat).
Pork Tenderloin (3 grams of protein in three ounces) is not as lean as chicken, but it is becoming leaner—now generally 31% leaner than it was 20 years ago.
Lean beef (22 grams of protein in three ounces) is a great source of nutrients like zinc, iron, and vitamin B12, and is also low in saturated fat, possessing only one more gram than skinless chicken.;
, Seafood is typically high in protein but low in fat. Most fish and shellfish are a great source of protein, as well as all of the essential amino acids our bodies require.Shrimp (20 grams of protein in three ounces) are low in calories and contain key nutrients like vitamin B12 and antioxidants.Scallops (17 grams of protein in three ounces) are low fat and a good source of important vitamins and minerals.Filets of fish vary in protein content, but typically contain about one-third of the recommended daily amount in three ounces. Salmon, mahi-mahi, and tuna are popular choices as salad toppings, but any fish you like will do., Eggs carry most of their protein in the egg white. The whites of an egg contain approximately 4 grams of protein while the yolks contain around 2.7 grams.Most commonly, an egg is hardboiled and then diced or cut into wedges when adding it to a salad.
If you feel like mixing it up, try topping your salad with a poached egg, a method used to make Salad Lyonnaise. The poached egg acts as a dressing-like sauce."

Accept the right position.",How to Become a Nursing Home Administrator in California," You will be charged with the efficient and safe running of a nursing home and ensuring it is in full compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations and requirements. Patient admissions, personnel management, budgeting, and facilities management are just a few of the responsibilities of an NHA in California, which is why the requirements for certification are so stringent.


If you are a registered nurse in a long term care facility who has experience in managing employees, budgeting, or event planning, this could be an ideal career advancement opportunity for you.
Being an NHA requires years of education and training in order to ensure you fully understand and comply with a host of federal and state healthcare regulations, so understand you'll need to continually invest time in your education.
Start by interviewing or shadowing an NHA in your long term care facility or in one near to you. Talk to them about the process of becoming an NHA. These first hand accounts can offer important insight.;
, All NHAs must be at least 18 years of age or older. You must also be able to establish that you are a citizen or legal resident with the right to work within the state of California. You will be asked to prove this by providing identifying documentation such as a driver’s license, passport, birth certificate, social security card, or residency verification documents., Every applicant to be licensed as an NHA in the state of California will undergo an extensive background check. In most cases, any criminal charges, apart from minor traffic violations, are disqualifying factors. However, with appropriate documentation, the National Association of Long Term Care Administrators Boards (NAB) and the state qualifying agencies may waive other infractions.


The NAB recognizes the background check that is required by the state agency.
The California Department of Public Health’s Nursing Home Administrator Program (NHAP) requires all applicants to have a criminal background check by submitting fingerprints through the Live Scan system.If you have been assigned to make payments, serve time, complete volunteer hours, or otherwise make restitution for a criminal act, you must provide proof that you have complied with all parameters of your sentence. This includes paying speeding or parking tickets, being current on alimony and child support, and other similar court appointed items., This includes the personal regulations that mandate education, examination, and licensing within the state of California. However, it’s also important to establish that you have complied with state and federal regulations throughout your career. If you wish to wave some or all educational requirements based on job experience, this is essential.


Ask your references to include information about your compliance with regulations as part of their letters.
Make a list of various tasks you regularly perform within state and federal regulations, and include documentation that proves this.
Commonly, nursing homes will require their employees to take annual exams to ensure they understand and comply with the Human Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, and sensitivity training. You should include documentation of these courses or exams., The most direct route to completing your educational requirements prior to taking the NHA qualifying exams is to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing, nursing home administration, or other related fields. Then, complete a graduate program in health care administration, long term care facility administration, or other related fields. You will be eligible to apply for the licensing exam directly following completion of your graduate work.You can find lists of state and federal programs online through the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME).The NAB is building a list of accredited programs across the US, and as this list continues to grow, these programs will likely set the standard for NHA education. This may be a good point of reference when looking for a program.Ask other NHAs you know about their educational backgrounds. This can be a great way to hear the behind the scenes stories about educational programs, and select a school that works for you.

, During your graduate studies at accredited universities in the state of California, you are required to complete 480 hours of hands-on training by interning or working in a nursing home. You can find internships in your area by talking to your professors, searching California’s NHAP site, or directly contacting long term care facilities in your area.You can attend any university in the US and some international programs to earn admittance to the state and federal NHA exams, but they may have different internship requirements. In these situations, you may need to complete an Administrator in Training program., If you have an undergraduate degree in nursing, nursing home administration, aging care, or related fields, you may be able to combine your education with experience to earn approval to take the NHA licensing exam. If you have a bachelor’s degree, you'll need to apply for a 1000 hour Administrator in Training (AIT) program. If you are accepted into this program, you will qualify to take the federal and state licensing exams upon completion of the AIT., If you’ve worked as a nurse or supervisor within a long term care facility for at least ten years, you may be able to qualify to take the NHA licensing exams by completing the same 1000 hour AIT program that those with bachelor’s degrees complete. At least the most recent five years of your experience will need to be in a supervisory role., The first step in completing this program is to find a preceptor. If you are qualifying based on work experience, you may want to start by asking the NHA in your long term care facility to be your preceptor. If you are applying with a bachelor’s degree, and don’t currently work in a long term treatment facility, you may need to look a little further to find a qualified preceptor.


You can contact California’s NHAP for a list of qualified preceptors in your area.
You must receive approval from the NHAP exam board before beginning an AIT. You’ll receive approval by submitting your preceptor’s qualifications, an outline of the 1000 hours of training, an application form, and the necessary fees.
You have one year from the time your AIT is approved to complete the program., You will need to provide transcripts from all of your course work to the NAB. These should be requested from your university and sent directly to the NAB. Additionally, you’ll need to provide documentation of your internship hours or your AIT curriculum.


Internships completed as part of your graduate education will be verifiable via your transcript.
If you complete an AIT program, your preceptor will need to complete and submit an evaluation form as part of your verification documentation., If you are working within a long term care facility run by a religious organization that for some reason hinders your ability to complete traditional education, you can apply to waive your educational requirements. However, you will still need to hold a high school diploma or GED, and complete an AIT program.


You need to provide adequate documentation to demonstrate that you are unable to attend traditional college or university training due to your religious practices or beliefs. This can include religious texts, letters from leaders within your religious organization, and historical documentation showing that other NHAs in your facility have not completed conventional educational training.
You will also need to provide information proving that the nursing facility you would be working for is a 501(3)(c) non-profit organization approved by the Internal Revenue Service.
You should complete your AIT within a nursing home run by your religious organization.
If you are granted an educational waiver, you may only be hired to work for long term care facilities within your religion., All NHAs in the state of California are required to complete at least 40 hours of advanced training every two years. This helps to ensure you’ll be exposed to any changes in policies and new administrative criteria.


Reach out to state and national NHA organizations to find out about seminars, webinars, courses, and other continuing education opportunities in your area.
College courses taken by semester earn 15 hours of credit, and courses taken by quarter receive 10 hours of continuing education credit.
If you offer seminars or teach courses to other NHAs, you’ll be able to use 16 hours of that time toward your own continuing education hours.
Preceptors may record 20 hours of their time training NHA candidates toward their own continuing education hours., Your education, internship, AIT program, and real world experiences will likely prepare you to know and understand the topics covered by your state and national licensing exams. However, it’s important to take time to review the various subjects covered by each test. Additionally, taking practice exams will prepare you for the types of questions you’ll be presented with.


The federal exam is comprised of 150 multiple choice questions. 38% of these related to resident centered care, 13% relate to human resources, 13% to finance, 15% to environment, and 21% to leadership and management.You can find recommended reading, practice exams, and more at http://nabweb.org/exam-references.
The California exam is 100 multiple choice questions. It covers the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 5, and other aspects of nursing home administration performance and requirements specific to the state of California., Once you’ve complied with basic requirements and completed your educational prerequisites, it’s time to apply for the National Nursing Home Administration Exam. You must meet all of these requirements prior to taking the exam and will need to provide documentation showing proof of your education and training in order to be accepted to sit for the national exam. The entire application process is completed online.


Once you apply, the associated credit or debit card is validated and the examination fee is charged. As of December 2016, the fee was $375.
You will receive an email verifying your application and the fee.
The California state board will be notified of your application, and they will notify you and the NAB within four months confirming or denying your eligibility to sit for the exam.
Upon approval from the California board, you will receive an email from the NAB that includes an Authorization-to-Test letter.
Once you’ve received the Authorization-to-Test letter from the NAB, you will have sixty days in which to schedule and complete the exam., You need to achieve at least 75% on all aspects of the NAB exam to be considered eligible to sit for the state of California NHA test. You will be able to take the test three times within one year of acceptance of your initial examination application. If you do not satisfactorily complete the exam within the first year, you will need to restart the application process., Once you have taken and passed your federal examination, you’re automatically eligible to sit for the California exam. State tests are offered four times each year.The examination dates are posted well in advance, and available through the California Department of Public Health, which is the regulating body for the state exam.You will need to complete an application form. The application is only one page in length and indicates to the California state exam board that you meet all of the basic and educational requirements to sit for the exam.
If you earn at least a 75% on all aspects of the state exam, you will receive notification of your eligibility to apply for NHA licensing in the state of California via email., Once you’ve received your approval and proof of completion of your federal and state exams, you still need to complete the application process to receive your license. The one page form is available online through the California Department of Public Health’s NHAP page. The document itself is almost identical to the application for the state examination. The only difference will be in the amount of the fee. You will need to fill the fee field in based on the current fee schedule at the time of your application. As of July 2016, the license fee was $350., As you begin the job application process, you’ll need to create an adaptable document that lists your education, training, job experience, awards, and other information valuable to employers. Start with a basic list of each topic with date ranges. You may also want to provide wages with your job experience. Once you have this basic outline, you should be able to easily adapt your resume for the NHA job postings of a specific long term care facility.


If you are applying for a position within a nursing home that caters to more active seniors, you may want to emphasize your past experience in planning and implementing activities and events within long term care communities or at other points in your life. Planning an event for a college sorority takes many of the same budgeting, organization, and other skills that planning events for seniors requires.
If you apply for a job where the position asks for someone who can implement employee performance reviews, training, and educational practices, emphasize any experience you have with human resources.
Most importantly, try to use the same terminology the job posting uses. If you show you can speak the language of the long term care facility you hope to work for, those reviewing your application materials are more likely to interpret your resume positively.

, Writing a good, accurate resume that is geared toward a specific job posting is your opportunity to tell a company why they should hire you. Most long term care facilities will call your past employers to verify work history, but your past employer’s aren’t able to disclose much information to your potential employers without your prior consent. Ask your current supervisors, your AIT preceptor, and some of your coworkers if they would be willing to be contacted by and speak with potential employers.


Update your references anytime you apply for a position to let them know they may be contacted. A quick email or phone call will usually suffice. Say something like, ""I sent in an application to a new long term care facility. Would you still be willing to be contacted as a reference for me?""
Ask for letters of reference that verify the information you convey in your resume. If you claim to have managed a large budget in your role as nursing home director, ask your administrator something like, ""Would you be able to write a letter of reference offering your opinion of my performance. Specifically, could you explain how I managed the supply budgets for the past several years, and what that entailed?""

, Networking is one of the main benefits of joining these organization. You’ll be able to meet others who work in your field, and in many cases, these organizations are where potential employers begin their search for new NHAs.


The California Association of Health Facilities is an excellent resource for career opportunities, networking, and continuing education in the state of California.You can also join the NAB. As a member of the NAB, you will have access to a variety of nation-wide training resources, up-to-date information about the NHA community, and current job opportunities., In addition to searching professional organization careers pages, you can also use LinkedIn, Monster.com, Indeed, and other general career resources to look for available positions. Additionally, these sites often offer faster means of application by storing your education and job experience and auto completing applications for you throughout the job search process.

, Healthcare staffing services are available throughout California. These Employment agencies have team members who do the leg work to find the right long term care facility for you. There are a number of options available, but three of the largest healthcare staffing agencies in California are Flexcare Medical Staffing, Maxim Staffing Solutions, and 365 Healthcare Staffing Services. These agencies have done the research on current salaries, workplace benefits, and they have relationships with many of the long term care facilities throughout the state.


Ask other NHAs you know if they used a staffing agency, and what their thoughts are.
Before signing up to work with a staffing agency, ask for a detailed explanation of any placement or service fees associated with their company. In most cases, the employer pays these, but this is not always the case.

, Research any nursing homes that offer you a position so you understand what their organizations are like and what their current states of affair are. Explore the facility’s website, read reviews online from residents and their families, and check on the facility’s standing with the Better Business Bureau and similar organizations. Check sites like Glassdoor to find out about current and past employee experiences.


During your interview, ask questions based on information from their website, especially if the facility seems proud of a specific event or service.
If you find any issues that concern you when exploring resident reviews, the Better Business Bureau, Glassdoor, and other sites, don’t hesitate to ask about them. If you’re going to work for a long term care facility in an administrative role, you’ll need to have a complete understanding of these concerns going in to do an effective job.
Unless a job ad specifies otherwise, wait 2 weeks before following up on your job application and interview. Administrators are often overwhelmed with work and job applicants and need time to review your qualifications.

, Don’t feel that you have to take the first job you’re offered. For a brand new NHA, this can be the biggest mistake. Taking the wrong position can negatively color your feelings towards the business for the rest of your career. Allow yourself the time to find the right place for you, your family, and your future career opportunities.

Get licensed.,
Become a specialist.,
Apply for jobs.,
Open your own pharmacy.",How to Become a Pharmacist3," Upon graduation you must become licensed in order to practice pharmacy. The North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) is a standardized exam used throughout the United States to test pharmacy school graduates on their knowledge of pharmacology. Each state also has specific tests required to practice pharmacy within that state.


You can learn more about state specific licensure through the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.

, In some cases, you may want to further your education to become a specialized pharmacist. For example, if you want to become a clinical pharmacist, you must complete a pharmacy residency and a BPS (Board of Pharmacy Specialties) certification.A pharmacy residency is two years long. The first year consists of generalized training and the second year is specialized training.Specialities are not required.

, Once you are a fully licensed pharmacist, you can begin looking for a job. Search for job openings online with sites like www.indeed.com. Talk to any connections that you made through shadowing, pharmacy school, or residency.


Your first job as a pharmacist may not be exactly what you are looking for. You may have to work odd hours and a pharmacy that is not your first choice.
Don’t expect to “move up the ladder” quickly. Be a hard worker and you will eventually move up.
Even entry level pharmacists make good money. The average entry level pharmacist makes $75,000. Keep in mind that this amount depends on the location of your job.

, There is a lot more to owning your own pharmacy than just pharmaceuticals. There are a lot of startup costs. You will need to know or hire someone who has a business background to handle the marketing and accounting. However, the payoff could be worth it. You will be your own boss, set your own work hours, and potentially make more money."

Network with other periodontists.",How to Become a Periodontist," To be a periodontist, you need to attend dental school and 3 years of specialized training in the field of periodontics. In order to qualify for either of these, you must first get a bachelor’s degree. You don’t necessarily need to focus on pre-medicine, biology, or other scientific fields, but they may help you get into and excel at dental school.Consider taking courses in chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and anatomy once you decide to pursue periodontics. These can help you pass the entrance exam for dental school, get into a dental school, and may make your dental school courses slightly easier.Meet with a pre-health or dental advisor to make sure you’re on the right track to apply for dental school.Think about shadowing a dentist or periodontist as you work towards your bachelor’s degree. This can give you some experience and exposure with periodontists and also a vital push into a hard profession which involves difficult cases, patience and dealing with people. If you do well, you may even get a recommendation letter for dental school from him or her.
Start considering dental schools you’d like to attend before your senior year and before you sit the DAT exam.;
, The Dental Admission Test, or DAT, is an exam that you must take and pass before you apply to dental school. You should take the DAT either in the sophomore or junior year of your undergraduate studies.Fill out the online application to take the DAT, which is done at a Prometric Test Center. Within three business days of applying, you should receive an email notifying you of your eligibility to sit the exam. It will also contain information on scheduling your exam. You should do this 60-90 days before the test date you want.
Have the Department of Testing Services send your scores to one of the centralized dental school application services (ADEA, AADSAS, TMSAS) as well as any dental schools to which you are applying. Make sure you keep a copy of your unofficial score report for your applications.
Review different study aids for the DAT at http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/dental-admission-test/.

, Your senior year of undergrad or later, submit applications to dental schools. Make sure to apply to a variety of different schools so that your chances of being accepted are higher. Have a list that includes three levels of institutions to which you would attend. Having a list of “safety” dental programs that you know you can get into is useful if your top and/ or mid-level choices don’t work out.Submit your applications to one or more of the centralized dental school application services (ADEA, AADSAS, TMSAS). Make sure to check your applications for errors before you submit them. Check that all of the required transcripts and documents are also attached.

, Dental school is very competitive. It takes four additional years of education after your bachelor’s degree to obtain a doctorate in dentistry.These four years generally consist of classroom and lab work. The final two years, you’ll do clinical work that involves the treatment of actual patients. Use your time in dental school to study and excel so that you can apply to residencies in periodontics.Take any opportunities you can to get more experience and work with a practicing periodontist.To get more practice, you can even try several surgical maneuvers such as incision or suturing techniques on orange peels or raw meat in order to get a better manual skill.
Maintain high grades and test scores, which can help you get one of the coveted spots in a periodontic program.
Make sure you meet the expected competencies for periodontics before you graduate from dental school. These include things such as understanding and diagnosing periodontal diseases and developing treatment for a patient.You can find further information and documentation about competencies at https://www.perio.org/education/pe.competencies.htm.

, In order to pursue a residency and career in periodontics, you must have the initial dental licensure. This requires taking and excelling at the National Board Dental Examinations (NBDE), which test your knowledge of the basic sciences and clinical dentistry.Recognize that the NBDE are generally taken in two parts. The first part is taken after your first or second year of dental school. It addresses the basic sciences including anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and dental anatomy. The second part is generally taken the third or fourth year of dental school. This part focuses on clinical dentistry including: operative dentistry, pharmacology, oral surgery, orthodontists, periodontics, patient management. Both exams have 400 questions that you must complete within 7 hours on the first day, and 100 case-based questions that you must complete within 3 ½ hours on the second day.
Familiarize yourself with the NBDE candidate guide and obtain permission to take the exam.

, During your final year of dental school, apply for a residency in periodontology. Residencies usually last 30-36 months. You can pursue your residency at a university, in a hospital, or another medical facility. Be prepare to face stiff competition for a spot because there are only a few spaces for periodontal residents.Recognize that the American Academy of Periodontology recommends that programs accept individuals with a class standing in the upper 50 percent and National Board scores in at least the 80th percentile. Some schools may also require GRE scores above 1000.
Use your residency to hone your dental skills. You’ll also learn more about how gum and bone diseases develop, their relationships to other diseases, and surgical techniques. Your residency may also allow you to participate in clinical trials of new therapies, too., As your residency nears its end, you have the option to become certified by the American Board of Periodontology. Taking and passing the exam is a sign of your excellence as a periodontist and is a way to attract patients.Be aware that to get your certification you must have obtained an unencumbered dental license, finished a periodontics education program per Board’s regulations, and passed the board exams.
Study for the exam as much as you can. The multiple choice exam will ask questions about a broad range of information related to periodontology., Your initial board certification will last for 6 years. After this, you must meet the renewal requirements to keep it up to date. If you don’t you’ll be required to retake the board certification exam.


Fulfill the requirements by completing a self assessment called the Self-Study Recertification Program and completing at least 60 points of continuing education credit., There is a diverse array of careers in periodontology. These include private and public clinical practice, academics, administration, and research.You could early anywhere between $120,000 and $240,000 per year in one of these jobs.If there is one particular area in which you’d like to practice, focus your job search on these jobs. Consider putting an application or two into other types of work as a safety net.


Speak to your residency colleagues and mentors about potential job opportunities. If a career counselor is available, use these services to give you some ideas about where to apply.
Look for job opportunities in the classified ads of professional periodontology associations such as the American Academy of Periodontology., You may not want to go into practice or be in administration or research. There are many options for periodontists in hospitals and other medical facilities, private practices, or at large biomedical organizations which conduct research in your field.Find ads for professional positions in newspapers, academic journals, professional recruiting sites. Consulting a headhunter may also help you find job opportunities.
Compose letters of interest for opportunities at places that interest you. Request an informational interview, which can give you information on qualifications the institution seeks in employees and the working environment.

, Instead of getting a job for a larger practice or facility, you may consider setting up your own practice. This may allow you more freedom over your schedule and the types and numbers of patients you accept. Talk to other periodontists who have their own practices. Ask questions about setting up a private office as well as the advantages and disadvantages of it.Recognize that it can be expensive to start your own practice. It may take a few years to build up your client base to recoup your investment.
Minimize potential headaches by planning your practice well in advance. You’ll need licenses and other certifications to open a business. Developing a business plan that follows “CREPT” may help you attract investors. CREPT stands for: capacity, revenue, expense management, patient service, and team (yours). You should also set short- and long term goals for your practice.

, Perhaps you prefer to work as an academic periodontist at a university. This would allow you to teach, pursue research, and even do clinical work. Competition for academic jobs can be strong. Consider applying to several academic positions in periodontology that interest you.


Search the websites or publications of professional periodontist associations. These often have classified ads for jobs in academic periodontology. Professional journals may also have ads for open positions at universities.
Check with online listservs for academics to see what positions are available in periodontology.
Make sure you submit any information requested by the job advertisement. You may need a cover letter, CV, and copies of transcripts, licenses and certifications.

, Meeting with fellow periodontists or dentists may also provide job opportunities. Even if a position isn’t immediately available, people may remember you are looking for a job and contact you. Participate in conferences, attend local seminars and continuing education courses, and join professional organizations to network with other periodontists.


Set up a regular meeting with other periodontists in your area. This can help all of you stay on top of current research and trade information on open positions.

Add a meat substitute.,
Top with toasted chickpeas.,
Sprinkle with nuts or seeds.,
Add beans.",How to Add Protein to a Salad2," There are a number of options for vegetarians and vegans when it comes to protein sources as well. Choose from some of the following options:


Tofu (8 grams of protein in three ounces) is probably one of the most well-known meat substitutes. Tofu is made of condensed soy milk and is an excellent source of nutrients, including all the essential amino acids our bodies need to function.Tempeh (16 grams of protein in three ounces) is a cake of partially cooked soybeans. It is a nutty, mushroom  plant protein that is still fairly unknown to most people.Seitan (36 grams of protein per half cup) is made from vital wheat gluten.

Consider your suitability for a pediatric specialty.,
Choose a nursing program.,
Take courses related to pediatrics.,
Become a Registered Nurse (RN).,
Gain experience working with children.,
Seek recognition as an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) by your state board of nursing.,
Become a Certified Pediatric Nurse (CPN).,
Determine your preferred work setting once you become a pediatric nurse.,
Find a pediatric nursing job that suits you.,
Look into additional licenses and certifications.",How to Become a Pediatric Nurse," Children are not just smaller adults, physiologically or psychologically. Their growing and changing bodies (and minds) require particular types of care and distinctive ways of providing it. Not all nurses, even exceptional ones, are cut out for pediatrics.First and foremost, you must embrace the challenges and rewards of working with children. You must also dedicate yourself to understanding their specific health needs.
You must be patient, understanding, and ready to deal with the unexpected. You’ll need excellent communication skills, including the ability to explain medical subjects to both small children and their parents.
You need to be willing and able to be a major figure in office visits — you will often be the “first line” of medical care. You need to be able to provide vaccinations to crying infants, exams to tantrum-throwing eight year olds, and sound advice to know-it-all teenagers.
Patient education and preventative medicine are of particular importance for pediatric nurses. It helps to have an interest in going out into the community — visiting schools, working at health fairs, etc. — to provide advice and care.;
, Pediatric nursing is a specialization for trained nurses, not a separate career path. In other words, you have to become a nurse before you can become a pediatric nurse.In the U.S., you can choose between an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) degree, which normally takes two years, or a Bachelor of Sciences in Nursing (BSN) degree, which typically takes four. An increasing number of trade schools, dedicated nursing schools, community colleges, and universities offer one or both of these options.
While the ASN degree offers the faster path, the BSN degree is generally considered the better path toward becoming a pediatric nurse (or any other type of specialized nurse, for that matter). With the strong demand for nurses, both ASN and BSN degree-holders should find employment, but those with the advanced degree will hold an automatic advantage in getting ahead in the field.

, Most nursing schools do not have a specific track for pediatric specialties, but they usually do offer courses with a pediatric emphasis. If you are serious about a career as a pediatric nurse, take as many of these classes as possible while in nursing school.For instance, courses in child health and child psychology should be particularly useful. If you are in a nursing program at a college or university, you can probably find an array of elective courses that deal with childhood development.

, By doing so, you will achieve official status as a nurse, and can then begin directing your career toward a pediatric specialty. To become an RN in the U.S., you must complete an ASN or BSN degree program and pass the NCLEX exam.


The National Council Licensure Exam for RNs is offered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN). The exam takes approximately six hours to complete, and is offered regularly in numerous locations. Check the NCSBN website (https://www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm) for more information on the exam.

, Start while you are a nursing student, using your time to learn all you can about the pediatric nursing field. Read books, look at websites, talk to your teachers, and talk to current pediatric nurses.


The Society of Pediatric Nurses website offers information on the field, and the organization produces the Journal of Pediatric Nursing (http://www.pedsnurses.org/).
Volunteer in the pediatric wing of your local hospital, or a clinic, or anywhere else that provides care to children.
Apply for intern programs that offer new nurses training specifically for pediatrics.
Apply to work at sites that provide care to children, such as a pediatrician's office or pediatric after-hour care facility.

, Research the nursing requirements that are set up in the state you plan to practice in.Consider earning APN status as a step toward additional advanced certifications and licensures that are also either required or highly recommended for pediatric nurses.
You may also want to look into extending your education to earn a Master of Science in Nursing degree (MSN), which normally requires an additional two years of coursework. As discussed in the following Part of this article, the MSN is a stepping stone to several advanced degrees and certifications in pediatric nursing, such as becoming a Certified Pediatric Nurse or Pediatric Nurse Practitioner., In some states, CPN status is required for pediatric nurses, but it is recommended for everyone in the field. It demonstrates that you are certified to give specialized care to pediatric patients, and to educate them and their families on health topics.To become a CPN, you need to already be an RN and have at least 1,800 hours of documented experience in pediatrics during the previous two years. This experience can include work, training, or coursework in an MSN program, among other options.You also need to pass an exam to become a CPN. The Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB) oversees the exam, and can offer valuable information on locating exam sites, fees for the exam, and procedures for registering for and taking the exam.

, Just as the roles and requirements for pediatric nurses are different than those for other nurses, the setting in which you practice will make a significant difference in the type of work you do.You’ll always face the unexpected as a pediatric nurse, but if you prefer providing primary care services like vaccinations, checkups, and dealing with bumps, bruises, and stuffy noses in a somewhat more regimented environment, you may want to work in a pediatrician's office or become a school nurse.
If you want to care for acute, chronically ill, or critically ill children, you'll want to concentrate on acute care and specialty services, such as the PICU (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit). You can seek out advanced certifications in such fields from organizations like the PNCB.
Consider your temperament, your ability to deal with children in varying stages of illness or injury, your ability to handle stress, and more practical matters like job availability and pay rates as you determine your preferred setting.

, Employers may not necessarily be falling at your feet offering you great nursing jobs, but the demand for nurses (pediatric and otherwise) is exceptionally high in the U.S. Additionally, the future outlook indicates continued growth in demand and job openings.Utilize the placement office at your nursing school, as well as connections you've made through coursework, internships, and so forth.
The demand for pediatric nurses is typically greatest in hospital settings, so that may be the easiest place to secure your first job in the field. If that is not your preferred setting, you may want to gain experience in the hospital setting while keeping an eye out for a job at a pediatrician's office, school, clinic, government agency, etc.
In addition to real-world work experience, advanced training and certifications will most likely make it easier for you to score your ideal job in pediatric nursing.

, As with any job in the healthcare field, a pediatric nurse’s training is never truly done. As you settle into your career, it makes sense to always consider your next steps, including additional training and certifications that can enhance your work (and potentially earn you a bigger paycheck).There are numerous specialized certifications available for pediatric nurses, and they usually entail some sort of coursework and passing an examination.
Pediatric nurses with a Masters in nursing (MSN) can choose to become a Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) by completing the requirements, which include a nationally-administered exam. CNSs are specially trained to provide a family-centered approach to care and to provide enhanced expertise in patient consultation and education, among other distinctive aspects.
The MSN degree also permits you to seek certification as a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP). PNPs possess advanced diagnostic and treatment training, and have the power to prescribe medicine in all fifty U.S. states. In some states, PNPs are also permitted to practice independently.

This knowledge will be very important in gaining qualification as a Registered Nurse (RN) and then a Nurse Practitioner (NP).


The foundation of nursing is science. If you don’t like science but find yourself interested in nursing throughout high school, speak with your school counselor about arranging a day or two to shadow a nurse.;
, There are three ways to become a registered nurse. In all cases, coursework includes physiology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and anatomy.Bachelor's degree in nursing (BSN). This level of education is awarded by a college or university and usually takes four years to complete. Class offerings more diverse than other settings and include community health, pharmacology, health assessment, microbiology, human development and clinical practice. A BSN qualifies you for a higher pay grade and a wider variety of certifications and promotions on the job.Associate's degree in nursing (ADN). This is the most common way to obtain a registered nursing license and involves a two-year program at a community or junior college. Many students transition to BSN programs after having completed an ASN and holding an entry-level nursing position.Diploma from an accredited nursing program. You can also be eligible for licensure by completing a vocational nursing program. These accredited programs are often associated with a hospital and vary in length, though they are typically up to three years long. This education path is on the decline since the National Advisory Council on Nursing Education and Practice recommends that at least 66% of the workforce hold a BSN in nursing or higher., It is necessary to first become a Registered Nurse with a BSN before you can start a Master's of Science in Nursing (MSN) to become a nurse practitioner. With a diploma or ADN, nurses will be able to move on to their bachelor's degree through accelerated programs and potentially with the assistance of their employers via a tuition reimbursement program.


You may also wish to earn a more advanced degree called Doctorate of Nursing Practice instead of the MSN.

, The national accreditation agency for nursing schools is the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. This agency ensures the quality and integrity of bachelor, graduate, and residency programs in nursing. Accreditation is voluntary but ensures that colleges and schools providing nursing education are operating at the same professional level and educating future nurses in a manner which ensures that they can provide effective and standardized care., Registered Nurses in the United States must have a nursing license. Take the National Council Licensure Examination - Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) once you have graduated from your accredited program. This examination is the nationally recognized licensing exam for registered nurses. Prepare for the international equivalent, such as CGFNS International, if you plan to work overseas or if you are an international student planning to work in the United States.Prerequisites to and fees for the exam may differ between states. Check with the requirements for your state, or for the state you plan on practicing in.
Be aware as well that each state has their own scope of practice for nursing. It is important to know scope of practice so you know what you can or can not do as a nurse in your state.
Most states have reciprocal agreements, meaning that if you pass your exam in one state, you’ll be able to apply for and receive a license in any other state without retaking the test as long as your license if free from any encumbrances (such as a felony conviction).

, Build some experience on the road to becoming a nurse practitioner by seeking entry-level work in a clinic or a hospital setting to get registered nursing experience. There are more than 2 million nurses in the United States, making the profession the largest in the healthcare field. There are a variety of settings in which a nurse can work, including hospitals, physician's offices, elderly care homes, prisons, college campuses and schools.]


Entry-level work as an RN usually serves as a stepping-stone to a higher-level career as an advanced practice nurse, like a Nurse Practitioner. You can also work as an RN as you pursue the further education required to become a Nurse Practitioner. There is great flexibility in being able to work as RN while obtaining advanced degree.

, Most Nurse Practitioners have obtained a Master's Degree of Science in Nursing (MSN). Master's programs are often designed around the needs of a working professional and frequently offer night and weekend classes. A MSN may take between two and seven years to complete, depending upon if the applicant is pursuing the degree full-time or part-time. Make sure to choose a graduate program that has been accredited by either the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC).To be admitted to this graduate program, you will be required to have a Registered Nurse's license, a bachelor’s degree, and a minimum GPA in the bachelor's degree as determined by the prospective school. Applications often require a statement of purpose, personal history or professional history. Applications may also require an interview.
A MSN degree, particularly one with a Nurse Practitioner concentration, prepares students for careers beyond entry-level and allows them to choose a specialty such as pediatrics, women's health, family care or geriatrics, among other fields.
Be aware that there is a growing movement to require all Nurse Practitioners to have a Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) degree, or basically a doctoral degree. This degree requires three to four years of further education after a bachelor’s degree in nursing., After earning a MSN, take the certification examination administered by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).Specialties that require certification in addition to licensing include pediatrics, family health, mental health, acute care, diabetes management and school nursing.
Once certified, Nurse Practitioners can also choose to take a specialty examination that certifies they have additional knowledge and ability to practice. These specialty certifications include pain management, rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, college health nursing, forensic nursing, diabetes management, nurse executive, pediatrics, and school nursing.

, Nurse practitioners are valued members of the healthcare team, providing cost effective care in the diagnosis, treatment and management of many acute and chronic illnesses. This variety in practice and ability to specialize offers practitioners many options in the work place. Jobs are available in hospitals, private practices, nursing homes, clinics, health departments, urgent care settings, healthcare technology companies, and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), among many other institutions. Different ways of getting a job include consulting online job websites, contacting headhunters in nursing, consulting local hospital job postings, and networking with physicians, nursing managers and community clinics, among other methods.The average salary of a NP is is $90,583 and the job outlook for NPs is considered excellent at present. This is because the numbers of primary care physicians is decreasing as the demand for healthcare services is rising thanks to the aging baby boomer generation.
Other professional opportunities include teaching in schools and universities and working for governmental and military agencies.
Note as well that about 15% of all Nurse Practitioners have their own private practices. There are also a growing number of nurse-run healthcare centers in the United States in which all healthcare is provided by nurse practitioners and other professionals. Keep in mind that not every state allows this — independent practitioners can only do this if it is within their state's scope of practice.

, According to the American Nurses Association, nursing today is designed for the protection, promotion and optimization of health and the prevention of illness and injury. Nurses are advocates in the care of individuals, families and communities.The standardized education of today’s nurses, in contrast to the past, reflects the high expectations communities and physicians have on the men and women who fill these roles.


The nursing profession is not just for women; there are over a hundred thousand registered male nurses working in the US.

, The foundation of all nursing practice is based in human anatomy and physiology. The chief mission of the nursing field is to protect, promote and optimize health. Key responsibilities for nurses include:Performing physical examinations and taking medical and family histories.
Providing counseling and education about health promotion and injury protection.
Administering medication and providing wound care.
Coordinating care and collaborating with other professionals including doctors, therapists and dietitians.
Directing and supervising care and providing education to patients and family, which enable patients to be discharged sooner.

, Nurse Practitioners are advanced practice nurses who have obtained graduate education which in turn increases their professional responsibilities. Nurse practitioners can serve in multiple roles, including providing direct care to patients, research in healthcare, consulting and education. Some of their duties can include:Undertaking physical examinations of patients
Providing immunizations
Diagnosing and treating common illnesses and injuries
Managing chronic health problems (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.)
Ordering and interpret diagnostic tests (e.g., X-rays, EKGs, etc.)
Prescribing medications and/or therapies
Counseling patients on lifestyle and healthcare decisions

, Beyond having a breadth of knowledge in medicine (and being someone who does not get squeamish easily!), a Nurse Practitioner must also be skilled in other areas. In this sense, nursing is like any other profession in that there are specific individual qualities that make the job easier and a more natural fit for some people. It's important to determine whether your personality and abilities can accommodate the various responsibilities and tasks that come with being a NP. Key qualities include:Critical thinking: Nurse Practitioners must be able to assess changes in the health status of their patients from a variety of sources (what the patient says, diagnostic tests, clinical examinations, etc.) and make a quick and evidence-based recommendations.

Interpersonal and communication skills: Being an NP requires working with people everyday—doctors, other nurses, technicians, patients, caregivers, and others. To communicate information and do their jobs effectively and clearly, nurses need strong interpersonal skills, patience, and the ability to break down complex information into something that is accessible for ordinary people (i.e., non-specialists).

Compassion: Caring and empathy are valuable when taking care of individuals who are in sick or injured. Remember that patients may be scared or in pain and need to be comforted, reassured, and motivated to fight through their illnesses.

Detail-oriented and organized: NPs often work with multiple patients and healthcare professional at a time and so they need to be able to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. In addition, attention to detail is key; one small mistake can have a big impact on a patient’s condition and life.

Effective coping with stress: Nurse Practitioners should be able to cope with stress in effective and healthy ways because they often work in urgent, emergency and/or other sensitive situations and face continual workplace pressures and stressors.

Work toward becoming a registered nurse, or RN.,
Determine what field of nursing you want to specialize in.,
Take your state nursing board licensing exam.",How to Become a Nurse in Colorado3," Registered nurses perform all nursing functions while working closely with physicians. Many RNs supervise nursing aides and LPNs. Registered nurses must have a 4-year, Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree from an accredited college or university. During the course of their studies, Colorado RN candidates can select a specialization. RNs sometimes pursue a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, which gives them more opportunity for advancement, including jobs in management, as nurse practitioners and specialized nursing. An MSN also is required to teach nursing.

, Colorado RNs often select a specialization and pursue it during the clinical phase of their training. Your focus can be based on your interest in a particular field of medicine, job availability, pay rate or advancement potential. Some of the leading nursing fields in Colorado are:


Obstetrics: Many nurses find caring for expectant mothers to be a rewarding career.
Emergency room: This is a stressful and challenging specialty that requires decisiveness and an ability to withstand emotional pressure. Emergency-room nurses can work any time of the day.
Surgical: RNs who specialize in this area of nursing assist surgeons during operations and must be detail-oriented.
Public health: Nurses working at public-health clinics help many patients and must be able to diagnose and treat a wide range of illnesses.
Intensive care: Nurses who specialize in ICU closely monitor patients' vital signs and medications, and sometimes must perform emergency procedures. ICU nurses are needed 24 hours a day.
Gerontology: Caring for older patients, often in nursing homes. This field will require study of geriatric diseases like Alzheimer's. It also may require an emphasis on emotional and psychological facets of care.

, After completing your clinical and classroom work, you will be required to pass the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, or NCLEX, exam to become a licensed nurse. All nurses must be licensed before they can practice in Colorado. The NCLEX-RN exam is for aspiring registered nurses. The NCLEX-PN is for practical nurses in Colorado. An applicant must:


Be a graduate of an accredited LPN or RN program.
Be a Colorado resident.
Pay all application fees.
Arrange to take the exam by registering with the Colorado Board of Nursing via standard mail, telephone or online.
Complete the test, which is intensive and can take 5 to 6 hours to finish.

Come up with your ""what if?"",
Research current televised programming to learn about current trends or opportunities.,
Determine your genre.,
Develop some characters.,
Understand what makes a great idea sellable.",How to Write and Pitch an Idea for a TV Show1," premise. This is the premise of every single TV show and idea to run through Hollywood. It can be as simple as ""what if a documentary crew filmed a small paper company?"" (The Office) to complex ideas like ""what if a chemistry teacher started cooking meth?"" (Breaking Bad). This is the basis of your show -- what sets it apart, and what will make it sell.


You don't need, or want, to weigh this down with a lot of subplots or other ideas yet. Just get the essence of your show on paper. Seinfeld, after all, was famously pitched as ""what if we did a show about nothing?"";
, Use ""the trades,"" such as the ubiquitous and essential Deadline.com or Variety to keep up to date about current Hollywood TV trends. For example, Deadline ran a story in August, 2015 stating that networks were looking specifically for 1-hour comedy shows to try out. This can be a good hint as to what is currently selling.Write down names and studios attached to projects that seem like yours. These are the names most likely to buy your work later.

, Genre is the type of show you're making, from sitcom to murder mystery. There are a lot of nuances to genre, but when in doubt you should look up the genres of your favorite shows online for guidance. For example, Arrested Development is a ""single-camera sitcom, meaning there is no studio audience like in classic sitcoms like Cheers, which is a ""multi-cam sitcom. This difference, though subtle, makes a huge difference when pitching your show, because some networks only want certain shows.


Genre affects your mood, tone, and writing style, and the audience's expectations for certain things.
Having a genre doesn't mean you are locked into one type of story. It simply makes it easier to market and sell your idea., The essence of all good TV is the character. Characters are why people tune in week after week and what drives the plot of each episode. Try and come up with between 2-5 main characters, as any more becomes difficult to manage, with 7 main characters (Community, most dramas) being the upper limit. You characters should be:



Round. The characters have multiple facets, not just an ""angry woman,"" or ""strong hero."" Round characters have strengths and weaknesses, and the chance to grow.

Filled with desires and fears. Their ability or inability to get over their fear (of being poor, of being alone, of space aliens, of spiders, etc.) is what drives their conflicts each episode and shows you the goals in the series.

Have agency. A good character makes choices which push forward the plot. They make mistakes, try and fix things, go to parties, etc. because it is something their character would do, not something the writer needs them to do., Development executives are the people who green-light new ideas, and they hear a lot of them. The best ideas, or at least the ones that get through, share a few traits:



Originality: Has this been seen before? Is it similar to anything else and, if so, is it different enough to stand on its own?

Projected Cost: Few studios will risk hundreds of millions of dollars on an unproven writer or filmmaker. It is difficult to sell big concepts like The Walking Dead if you've just started working in TV, because they have high financial risk.

A Screenplay/Proof of Concept: This means writing a treatment, script, or shooting some sketches. Your idea may get you in the door, but you need some work to prove that the show is going to get made."

Learn what a drug detox program entails.,
Determine which type of detox program you need.,
Decide if you want outpatient care.,
Determine if you need inpatient detox care.,
Consider a detox program if you are not stable enough to start a treatment program.,
Determine if hospital detox is right for you.,
Figure out how you will pay for program.",How to Choose the Right Detox Program1," A detox program is not a treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. Instead, it is the first step in an overall treatment program aimed at getting you off the alcohol or drugs.A detox program utilizes antidotes and other techniques, such as dialysis. The goal is to slowly wean the person offer the substance.In an alcohol detox program, the patient will stop drinking alcohol. Instead, they will be given a cross-tolerant drug that does a similar thing but to a less degree, which helps with withdrawal.
After the detox, sedatives are often used to help the patient ease away from the dependency of the drug.
Going through a detox program to help curb craving and withdrawal symptoms allows a person the ability to focus on the psychological side and education for when the patient is discharged.Behavioral addictions, like gambling or sex, don’t require any detox program.;
, There are different detox programs based on the type of substance abuse problem. Finding a detox program that treats your specific issue will help ensure your success. Types of programs include:Alcohol detox
Prescription drug detox, which may include addiction to Oxycontin, Vicodin, Xanax, Ritalin, Adderall, Valium, or Percocet
Street or recreational drug detox, such as cocaine, heroin, meth, hallucinogens, or marijuana
Opiate detox

, Outpatient care is a good option for people with mild addiction symptoms. In an outpatient detox program, you will receive more social support. You also have greater freedom because you still return home.Outpatient detox programs allow you to return home or to a job. You detox at home and check in with your doctors daily. You may also detox at home, but spend a set number of hours each day at a detox center under medical supervision.However, you will not have immediate access to medical personnel, and you may also be exposed to triggers or temptations to use again.
Your doctor can help you find outpatient detox programs. Your doctor can also help you find an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization detox program.

, Inpatient care is for people with a serious addiction who may experience severe withdrawal symptoms when they try to get off the substance. In an inpatient center, you will have access to 24-hour care.You will be removed from all temptation because you will not have any access to the substance.If you go to the hospital with withdrawal symptoms, they can help get you into an inpatient facility. You may also look for a detox clinic or a substance abuse treatment facility that includes a detox program. Some psychiatric hospitals may provide detox programs.

, Detox programs offer help to individuals who are unable to start their substance abuse treatment program due to their addiction. The detox program will help you remove your physiological addiction so you can go through treatment.Detox programs offer safe, comfortable, and mostly pain-free options for weaning yourself off the substance you are addicted to.
In a detox program, you have access to medical personnel who can help and support you through tough times. This can help you avoid potentially embarrassing situations with loved ones as you go through painful withdrawal symptoms on your own.

, Many treatment centers and rehab programs offer detox programs. However, for more severe cases, a hospital detox may be the best option. This may be the choice if the patient needs more intensive medical care, has a lot of complications, or is an overall difficult case.Discuss hospital detox units with your local hospital or treatment center to determine what is available in your area and if hospitalization is necessary.

, Many substance abuse programs are not covered under private and government insurance plans. Contact your insurance company to find out if they cover substance abuse programs. If they do, find out how much they will cover and if there are any guidelines for treatment.Some programs offer financing for qualifying patients. Discuss this option with the program to see if this is an option for you.
You may also need to consider private loans or loans from friends and family, or use your savings to finance the treatment stay.

Read the label!,
Choose foods with good fats.,
Look at protein content.,
Prefer complex carbohydrates to simple, and prefer whole grains to refined.,
Look at fiber content.,
Look for added sugars.,
Check sodium content.,
Look for foods high in potassium.,
Be sure to meet your vitamin and mineral needs.,
Limit cholesterol from dietary sources.",How to Choose the Right Food for You," Remember that everyone's nutritional needs are different. Consider reading both the nutrition facts and the list of ingredients. See How to Read Nutrition Facts on Food Labels for more information. Some consumers, for example, are very concerned about avoiding high-fructose corn syrup. Reading the ingredients can also tell you what kind of oil (such as canola, soy, or palm) is used in the food. Read the nutrition facts to find foods that meet your nutritional needs. Some people need to lose weight and eat low-calorie foods; other people need to gain weight and eat high-calorie foods. Some people have digestive disorders and need to increase or decrease their intake of fiber.;
, Cutting fat will certainly help you cut calories, but make sure that you are getting enough of the good fats, such as monounsaturated fats and essential fatty acids, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Olive oil, canola oil, fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and legumes are sources of good fats that may benefit lipid profiles. Low-fat peanut butter (such as Better ‘n Peanut Butter) gives you fewer calories, but you miss out on good fats. Bad fats include long-chain saturated fatty acids and trans fat. Limiting bad fats is particularly important for individuals with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Remember that a gram of fat has nine calories, but food labels usually round the numbers. For a food with two grams of fat, the label may read, “Calories from fat: 20,” although the fat actually contributes eighteen calories.

, Some people are not getting enough protein; some people are getting too much. Protein helps build muscles, repair cells, and form hormones, such as thyroxine from tyrosine or serotonin from tryptophan. Athletes need a high protein intake to maintain their bodies. Unfortunately, too much protein is hard on the kidneys.

, Complex carbohydrates are starches and take more effort to break down than simple carbohydrates (a.k.a. sugars), stabilizing your blood sugar. Whole grains help keep your blood sugar more stable than refined carbohydrates. Athletes consume carbohydrates for energy; they call it “carb loading.” Carbohydrates are the body’s principal source of energy, but if you choose to follow a low-carbohydrate diet, fats and proteins can also be used for energy.

, Fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed and can be divided into soluble and insoluble types. The average person gets only about half of the fiber that he needs. A few people have digestive disorders and need to cut fiber, especially insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel that soothes the intestines. It may benefit some people with digestive disorders and relieve diarrhea by slowing the movement of food through the intestines. By contrast, insoluble fiber does not dissolve water and is more difficult for the body to digest. It has a rough texture (which occasionally may be bad for digestive disorders) and helps prevent constipation by moving food through the intestines. Both soluble fiber and insoluble fiber promote regularity by providing bulk to the stool. Fiber may reduce the risk of colon cancer and diabetes by slowing the rise in blood sugar after eating food.

, Some healthful foods, such as yogurt and spaghetti sauce, can be quite high in sugar, so look at the sugar content in Nutrition Facts. Remember that many foods contain at least a couple of grams of sugar naturally, so you should also check the ingredients. Sugar goes by many names, including corn syrup and dextrose.


Do not be deceived by fruit-flavored products. Before you buy those fruity popsicles or candies, make sure that you are getting real fruit. Fruit-flavored products may not contain any fruit at all; check the ingredients. The term “fruit-flavored” on the product is generally a red flag; the product has been made with the flavors of fruit (which have no nutritional value) and added sugar. Drinking real fruit juice is much better than drinking a fruit-flavored beverage with only ten percent juice.

, Sodium increases your blood pressure by suppressing nitric oxide, a gas that relaxes the blood vessels. A single side dish, such as sliced potatoes, may use up one-fifth or one-fourth of your allowance for sodium. You can also find no-sodium substitutes for salt at the grocery. Sodium is less of a concern for people who do not have high blood pressure. In fact, athletes may need more sodium because sodium is lost in perspiration. Sodium is a mineral necessary for life.

, Potassium is especially important to athletes because they lose it through perspiration. Potassium also helps lower blood pressure.

, The guidelines are reliable for most people, but there may be times when you need to up your intake of a vitamin or mineral. You may want to add more vitamin C to your diet when you are sick or have a bruise. Some subsets of the population may have different nutrient needs. Nine- to eighteen-year-olds need 1,300 milligrams of calcium. Nineteen- to fifty-year-olds need 1,000 milligrams of calcium. Individuals older than fifty need 1,200 milligrams. Calcium intake should be higher in adolescence to help adolescents build bones and in middle age to help combat the increased risk of osteoporosis.

, Only animal products contain cholesterol, a fat-like substance that may increase the risk of heart disease by narrowing the arteries.


Understand that dietary cholesterol is not the same as serum (your internal) cholesterol, and generally has very little correlation with it. Poor cholesterol metabolism is not aggravated by eating cholesterol-laden foods, except in certain (very rare) cases.

Most TV shows are based on some sort of play on words, and having a good turn of phrase can ensure that your show is immediately recognized. Mad Men, for example, is about Ad Agencies and the men that work there, most whose lives are spiraling out of control. Community is about a community college, but also a group of close-knit. The importance of a great title can not be underestimated.

, The logline is a one or two sentence description of your show designed to sell producers on the idea. It typically tells the main agenda of the show and/or main character. If your concept can’t easily translate to a logline it might not be very marketable, but this is rare. It should tell people what they're watching and what clever hook or premise there is in the show.



Back to the Future: A high school student, is sent to the past on accident, where his presence causes his parents to never meet -- or make him!Jaws: A police chief battles a killer shark despite being afraid of the sea. Meanwhile, the greedy town board refuses to admit there is a problem at the beach at all, complicating matters.

Ratatouille: A French rat teams up with a terrible chef to prove that anyone can cook, though jealous critics and pest-control will do anything to prove that it is a sham., This is a brief but comprehensive overview of the show. There are a lot of potential elements that you can put into this synopsis, but the shorter the sweeter. Try to distill your show into an engaging, brief write-up, the kind of thing that would make you want to watch the show if it was on. Some things to include are:


The setting.
The general plot of the series.
The arc of most episodes (what is generally happening in every episode?)

, On a separate sheet, list each character with a 1-2 sentence overview of who they are. Keep it brief and specific. What makes these characters tick, and what makes them special? Unless it is important to the plot, never include physical details or casting choices., This is a brief 1-2 paragraph outline of several episodes. You want to give someone a chance to see how the show will play out, what each episode will look like, and an idea of the budget and characters in action. If you're writing a drama, you might have 4-500 words each, and try and keep 30-minute shows closer to 2-300 words.


If you're pitching a documentary-style reality series, having any short video on the subject or people involved can help producers see the potential of the project. You can also outline potential plot lines in the people's lives.

, The final document should be 3-10 pages, with all of the parts in order. Add a title page with the show's potential logo, your name, and your contact information. In order, you should have:

In the case of reality competition shows, ensure that every aspect of gameplay is outlined. It is important to write what we are specifically watching unfold in brief, yet powerful points.

, At the end of the day, the treatment will not be on TV. Having a script to go with it means you can give someone the first episode, right off the bat, if they like the idea. That said, many ideas are sold solo, then a script is commissioned later. This is more common if you are already established in Hollywood, however.


Read scripts from shows similar to yours to get an idea for the writing and plotting.
If you are writing a scripted TV show, such as a drama, learn how to write scripts. Script-writing classes can also be taken at local community colleges.
Specialized script-writing software can make quick work of a script. Movie Magic Screen Writer, Celtx, Writer Duets, and Final Draft are popular picks.

Pitch quickly and energetically.",How to Write and Pitch an Idea for a TV Show3," These sites cost money, but in return allow network executives to peruse your scripts. Usually you pay to get a rating, and high-rank scripts will shoot to the top of the lists. However, many of these sites are unreliable, so be sure to look them up online to find reviews, testimonials, and successes. Look up any ""success stories"" from the site on IMDB to check their reliability.


The most reputable site for scripts is The Blacklist, which has been vetted many times over and led to several high-profile successes.
Accepting unsolicited submissions without a mediator puts companies at risk of being accused of stealing. Getting electronic proof of review by companies is a unique benefit that the Internet provides in today's television development arena.

, Go online and find phone numbers, emails, submission ideas for companies that are making shows similar to yours. Get in touch however you can, talking to them about opportunities to meet and discuss your ideas. You don't to be needy, just willing to put in some effort to sell your script.


You would never pitch a cheesy monster movie to NBC, you'd send it to SyFy. You wouldn't send a Historical Drama to Greg Danial's (The Office) production company. Think about what the studio is already making to pitch to the right people.Look into studio fellowship programs. These are paid 6-8 week programs that allow you to hone your ideas at the studio. They are, however, incredibly competitive.

, Meeting people is still the best way to sell any idea or show. Grab coffee with friends, join an improv group, and take jobs on movie sets. Even if one person isn't able to make your idea a reality, they may know someone who could help.


When possible, work on film and TV sets as a production assistant or intern -- anything to get your foot in the door.
While not strictly necessary, selling your idea to Hollywood is easiest if you're in Hollywood. If you're serious, it's time to move to LA. A lot of TV is also produced, however, in NYC.

, You need to knock the executives out once they give you a chance to speak. Pitching is an art form, but it is more of a sales pitch than a script. Your goal is simply to get people excited about the show, to put the image of the show in the executives' minds so they can envision the final product. To do that, talk about:



The Hook: Return to the ""what if"" of your show. Why is it original, compelling, and worth watching?The Audience: Who is this show geared towards? How does it fit with the network's current audience.

The ""Trailer:"" If you were selling this show in a commercial, what parts would you highlight? What are the ""clips"" that flesh out the world of the show., Why does your show fit their audience? How does it complement their other shows? Why do they need your show? Don't just talk about how awesome you or your show is, talk about why it is a good decision for them to buy it.


You must know what types of shows the network produces, and who its audience is, to capture its attention., Your pitch should be no more than 12-15 minutes, and the shorter the better. Give the executives the idea of the show, hook them into the premise, and let them know why it is a good fit for their network. Then say thanks and answer any questions.


You must practice your pitch ahead of time, multiple times. It needs to be as well prepared as your script and treatment.
It can help to have multiple other ideas on hand too, even if they don't have a treatment. They may love you and your idea, but not have room in the schedule for that specific show.

Make sure the program evaluates your specific needs.,
Determine if the program is overseen by medical professionals.,
Undergo close monitoring.,
Go to counseling.,
Look for compassionate, comforting facilities.,
Ensure that the detox program and inpatient treatment program are close together.,
Know that the duration of detox programs depends on the individual.",How to Choose the Right Detox Program2," A drug or alcohol detox program should provide an individualized assessment for each patient. This evaluation and assessment will take into consideration your specific needs and concerns.The evaluation will cover a medical and physical assessment, along with a social and behavioral one.

, Detox programs are a medical removal of the substance from the body. Because of this detox process, withdrawal symptoms can occur. These withdrawal symptoms may be severe or life-threatening. The withdrawal symptoms should be managed by medical personnel to make them more manageable.The detox program should have medical and clinical staff on site with access to the patients around the clock.

, While you are going through a detox program, you should have someone monitor your condition closely. This means a medical team should be there around the clock to help with any severe withdrawal symptoms or complications.Medical personnel, including physicians, nurses, and clinical and technical staff should be 24 hours a day to provide patient care.

, Counseling is an important part of the detox and addiction recovery program. The counseling portion generally occurs after the detox portion, when the withdrawal symptoms have subsided.People who suffer from substance abuse commonly have underlying problems that lead to their drug or alcohol addiction. A good detox program will provide counseling for their patients.Counseling provides a way for the patient to identify and work through the issues that led to the problem.
Counseling also includes education about the dangers of substance abuse, and teaches skills that help prepare the patient to face stressors and triggers when out of the program.

, A good detox facility will provide support for their patients. The aim will be to help make you comfortable and provide you with compassionate and supportive care through the program.A detox program is not easy, but it should not be a painful or bad experience. Going through a detox program will be challenging and take work on the patient’s part, but being in extreme pain or being sick is not necessary. A good detox program with qualified medical personnel can help manage the withdrawal to help eliminate some of the more severe side effects.

, Sometimes, the detox program is held in a separate location than the inpatient treatment program you will go through after the detox is over. By making sure these two things are close together, you can eliminate a long disruption of your treatment while you travel.You will have to go from the detox program to the inpatient treatment, which means there will be a span of time when you are not under supervision or in a facility. If you spend too much time travelling or away from the treatment before you have been fully treated, you could have a relapse or give into temptation.

, Detox programs focus on removing the substance and harmful toxins from the patient’s body. Because of this, the duration of the detox program can vary from person to person.Look for a program that allows you to have the proper time you need to detox. This means it should be tailored to as little or as much time as your body needs to remove the substances.
If a program tries to force you into a predetermined amount of time for the detox, consider another program.

Visit the detox center.",How to Choose the Right Detox Program3," To get a good detox program to help with your addiction, you need to make sure you are going to a quality, professional place. You should check to see if the program and facility is accredited by the state. You can ask for accreditation information from the center, check online, or call the appropriate government agencies.Investigate the mental health specialists and addiction specialists. Find out what licenses they have.

, Any treatment center or program should offer some statistics about their program’s success rate. Preferably, the statistics should come from an outside agency or research institution instead of from the center itself.These statistics may show percentage of people who have successfully overcome addiction, number of people who entered and completed the program, or number of relapses.

, Aftercare programs an integral and important part of drug treatment, detox, and recovery process. Aftercare programs provide support to patients after they have been discharged in case of temptation, relapse, or other issues.Aftercare programs may provide a referral to other treatment services or support groups in your area.

Talk to medical staff about their approaches, experience, and qualifications. You can also ask specific questions about the detox program.Decide if the grounds provides a comforting environment and whether you want to stay there.

Learn to draw.,
Earn a bachelor's degree in fine art or animation.,
Choose a specialty field.,
Get certified in different animation software programs.,
Keep abreast of new technology.",How to Work in Animation1," Although animators today work predominantly on computers, it is still important that you understand the basic foundations of visual art. This includes drawing. This artistic background will benefit you in the design process and in staging shots for animation.To learn to draw you can start taking art classes in high school, or begin courses through community programming.
Alternatively, you can practice sketching from real-life situations.;
, Whichever degree you choose, you should be sure the school has respected animation classes that will teach you about 2D and 3D animation. A degree is not necessary to find work in animation; however, it will help teach you about the industry and some of the necessary skills. It can also help you build your portfolio and gain important feedback on your work.A degree in animation will teach you how to create a storyboard, characters, and will give you the opportunity to learn different software programs.

, If you choose to study animation through formal schooling, you may be able to try your hand at gaming, mobile media, special effects, website animation, TV animation, and more. Think about which style of animation you enjoy the most and then focus your education specifically on that field.


For example, you may really enjoy stop motion animation. As a result, you should take courses in post-production and editing software.
People who focus more on a fine art path than computer animation will want to look for work as storyboard artists, painters, and modelers.

, Instead of earning a four-year bachelor's degree in fine art or animation, you can build your skills by learning to use a variety of computer software programs. These programs can be self-taught, or you can take online certification courses. Animation relies heavily on computer software programs and many employers will require some form of expertise in the following programs:Flipbook (DigiCell)
Flash (Adobe)
Blender (The Blender Foundation)
3Ds Max (Autodesk)
Maya (Autodesk)

, As 3D computer animation grows more popular, you may need to take additional training courses so that your experience stays relevant in the job market. For example, employers often outsource 2D animation to other countries, but there are many opportunities for mobile and website animators.

Write on a freelance basis.,
Apply for a job with a greeting card company.,
Start your own greeting card business.,
Learn to write in greeting card format.,
Become well-versed in different styles.,
Be able to express sentiments for different occasions.,
Be concise.,
Put together a portfolio.,
Further your education.,
Seek out internship opportunities.,
Keep up with social trends.",How to Work As a Greeting Card Writer," For the most part, greeting card companies stockpile their verses and messages through a steady influx of submissions from freelance writers. Do a little investigating to find out which companies accept freelance contributions and send in a few of your most polished samples. If they like what they see, they’ll agree to print it and you’ll receive compensation. Card publishers tend to be particular about the way they want things done, so be sure to look up the editorial and submission guidelines for the company you’re submitting your work to.The pay rate of freelance submissions will vary from $10 a message with small publishers to as much as a couple hundred dollars per card with more prestigious companies.If you’re trying to make a living as a greeting card writer, it will pay to know what kind of compensation you can expect before you send in your work.;
, Though it’s become increasingly rare for greeting card companies to keep dedicated staffs of writers, these openings are still out there. If you think your writing is fresh, innovative and memorable enough, submit your resume and portfolio to the hiring department of one of the big names like Hallmark. If hired, you can look forward to a fast-paced and challenging career of drafting messages for a multitude of occasions, along with some sizable paychecks.Be ready for rejection. Big companies receive thousands of submissions every year, and yours may not always be just what they’re looking for at the moment.Salaries for professional greeting card writers average somewhere between $50,000—$70,000 a year., Of course, there’s no rule that says you have to rely on the auspices of big commercial greeting card companies at all. Writers with a penchant for crafting have the option of composing and handmaking their own greeting cards and selling them through online stores like Etsy, ArtFire or Big Cartel. As an independent producer, you’ll only get paid if you make sales, but you’ll enjoy the freedom of carrying out every step of the process your own way and creating the kinds of cards you’ve always dreamed of seeing on shelves.More work will go into making greeting cards independently, as you’ll have to compose, design, fabricate and sell everything on your own. The upside of this is that all of the profit will go directly to you.
Pay particular attention to visual elements. This is a chance for you to incorporate your own unique touches into your homemade cards. If you want to focus on the writing aspect, consider partnering with a graphic designer or illustrator to handle the images needed to complete your cards., If you want to make it as a greeting card writer, you’ll first need to get used to the unique format of the medium. Most of the time, greeting cards contain short, punchy messages that are designed to absorb the reader’s attention and deliver a touching or humorous message. Practice writing 4-8 line messages, focusing on expressing yourself clearly and conveying a definite message.Read as many different cards as you can get your hands on to get a sense of how style, language and presentation vary between them.
Get in the habit of writing in a specific “voice.” This voice will closely mirror the feelings of the person who is sending the card.Keep in mind how your writing might be paired with images and design elements on the finished card. A birthday card for small children, for instance, will likely contain colorful, cartoonish drawings or silly visual gags. A 25th anniversary card, by contrast, might feature a silver color theme and subtle, classy design cues, such as champagne flutes, wedding rings, velvet, etc.

, Not all greeting cards are made equal. Some are long, sentimental odes full of flowery prose, while others are colorful are jokes that only take a couple sentences to tell. Expand your writing repertoire to include humorous punchline gags, rhyming verses and heartfelt wishes. The more styles you’re able to write, the better chance you have of seeing your work published.Literary techniques like rhyme scheme, meter and basic structure and organization are highly valued in greeting card writers., In addition to mastering a variety of styles, you should also be prepared to tailor your message for specific dates and events. There are cards for birthdays, graduations, breakups, Bar Mitzvahs, Mother and Father’s Day and countless other situations. Try to capture the spirit of these occasions in your writing samples.Not only will different cards feature different themes, they will also each be written from a unique perspective, with the implied sender being “grandmother,” “mentor,” “friend” etc.
As you might imagine, greeting card companies do their best business around the holiday season, with Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year all falling together., Above all, greeting card messages should be short and to the point. You only have a limited amount of space to work with, so there’s no room for unnecessary words and phrases or overly long gag setups. Cut to the chase and tell the recipient what you want them to hear with calculated brevity and panache.It’s often harder to write a good short message than it is a long one. Practice condensing your writing to make it more effective.The best greeting cards are the ones that deliver terse, easily digested sentiments that can be read over and over again.

, Start compiling your best work in a folder or online file that you can share with potential employers. Your portfolio doesn’t have to just contain themed greetings—it could also include selections of short prose or poetry that showcase your handle of clear, concise writing. As you gain experience, you portfolio will grow, and so will your range of works and opportunities to make a successful submission.Having all your strongest submissions in one place will allow the people in charge of hiring new writers to see what you can do without forcing them to wait for multiple submissions over time.
Make sure your writing samples follow the specific formatting guidelines outlined by the company you’re submitting to., Greeting card businesses value practical ability over theoretical knowledge, so having a degree in writing or advertising isn’t a must. It may not hurt, though, especially if you think you might begin your career in some other area of the business, like sales or promotion. If you’re serious about breaking into the field, choose a concentration like creative or technical writing or marketing that will directly translate to the type of tasks you’ll be faced with on the job.Creative writing classes will allow you to become more proficient writing in different styles.
Technical writing prioritizes clear, effective speech and brevity, making it a perfect form of training for composing greeting card messages.

, If your goal is to work for a greeting card giant like Hallmark or American Greetings, you may be well served to start off as an intern. In this role, you’ll be afforded a chance to learn the ins and outs of the business, and, more importantly, the particulars of the company you’re likely to eventually work for. Interns make attractive contributors because they already have an extensive base of experience.Scan the “careers” page of a company’s website or contact a representative directly to find out more about internship opportunities.
A lot of professional greeting card writers got their start as interns with their companies.

, Greeting cards aren’t the same as they were a few decades ago. Writers will need to keep a finger on the pulse of culture and societal norms as they evolve. For instance, being more attuned to modern parenting practices or the peculiar ways best friends communicate will give you a leg up over competing writers who are using flatter, more generic forms of expression. It may also help to able to incorporate well known pop cultural references, or rework viral internet memes into gags or visuals that are instantly recognizable. Pay attention to the language that surrounds you, and learn to change with the times.Analyze the types of relationships you see on a day to day basis and draw upon these insights when coming up with ideas for greetings.
As a purveyor of modern culture, you'll be responsible for filling cards with prominent themes, tropes and symbols from people's everyday lives.

, Including lean protein should be a number one priority when choosing a snack while you're attempting to lose weight.


Protein is an essential nutrient for weight loss. When included in your snack, lean protein helps keep you more satisfied compared to carbohydrates or fat.Aim for leaner sources of protein at snack time. These types of protein have less calories and fat and are the best options when calories are limited.Choose lean protein foods like: a hard boiled egg, low-sodium jerky, a low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese cup, low-fat cheese stick, low-sodium deli meat or roasted nuts. You can make a trail mix, deli meat and cheese roll ups, low-fat Greek yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon, 3 oz of jerky, whole grain toast with sliced hard boiled egg, or celery and peanut butter.

, A snack is a perfect place to get in an additional serving of fruits or vegetables. Plus, these foods are low in calories and can add bulk to your snacks without pushing you over your calorie limit.


Fruits and vegetables also offer the added benefit of being high in fiber. Fiber, like protein, can help keep you satisfied longer throughout the day.Pairing your lean protein with a fruit or a vegetable makes for a nutritious and satisfying snack.
Try: greek yogurt with fruit, a low-fat cheese stick and an apple or pear, roasted nuts and dried fruit, baby carrots with hummus, a small whole grain waffle with peanut butter and sliced banana, a protein shake with fruit and vegetables blended in, a lettuce wrap with chicken salad, or deli meat wrapped around raw veggies.

, Many typical snack foods are high in refined carbs like white flour or white sugar. Switch to high-fiber whole grains for a more complex and satisfying source of carbohydrates.


100% whole grains are higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients compared to refined grains. Go for whole grain whenever you can.
Whole grains to try include: whole grain oats, corn, whole wheat tortillas or wraps, whole wheat bread or quinoa.
Include whole grains into your snacks like: whole wheat pita chips and carrots with hummus, one piece of whole grain toast with smashed avocado and sliced tomatoes, one cup of air-popped popcorn, a small bowl of oatmeal with fruit or yogurt with fruit and a sprinkling of granola.

, You may be feeling hungry between meals and have the urge to snack when in reality you may not need food. Sometimes, symptoms of mild dehydration can seem like physical hunger and cue you to eat.To be sure your afternoon snack craving isn't just your body sending mixed signals, try to stay well hydrated throughout the day.
Aim to drink a minimum of 64 oz or eight glasses of water daily. However, many people need up to 13 glasses daily. The amount will vary based on age, gender and activity level.You know you're adequately hydrated if you do not feel thirsty throughout the day and your urine is very pale yellow by the end of the day.
If you're dieting and aiming for weight loss choose hydrating fluids without calories. Water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea are all great options.

, Choosing low-calorie, nutritious food is the best option for including a snack while you're dieting. Highly processed ""junk food"" snacks are things that you should avoid.


Many processed foods and processed snack foods are high in calories, sugar, fat and salt.These can totally derail your diet or weight loss if eaten regularly or in large quantities.
Avoid foods like: chips, crackers, candy, cookies, snack cakes, pies, sugary granola, sugary fruit bars, or sweetened beverages.

, There are some snacks (like potato chips or candy) that should obviously be avoided when you're losing weight. However there are some tricky snacks that are low calorie and still should be minimized in your diet.


Empty calorie snacks or foods are those that contain little to no nutritional value and provide only calories. They are ""empty of nutrition.""There are many snack foods that are marketed as healthy and ""good for weight loss"" but are still considered empty calories. They are low in calorie but they are also very low in any valuable nutrition.
Minimize foods like: baked chips, ""100 calorie packs"", diet cookies, sugar-free candies, sugar-free pudding or jello, and crackers.

, It's important to make sure you use snacks wisely. One of the best uses for a snack is to keep hunger at a manageable level in-between meals. Only snack if you are truly, physically hungry.


Your body does a great job at letting you know when you're hungry and whether or not you'll need a snack before your next planned meal.
Physical hunger should be your guide to whether or not you need to snack. Pay close attention to your body's signals throughout the day to help you decide whether or not to snack.
Physical hunger feels like an emptiness in your stomach and may come along with stomach pangs and a growling noises.

, Another appropriate time to snack (even if you're not overly hungry) is before a long or high-intensity workout.Your body, especially your muscles, need energy for fuel during workouts. If it has been a few hours since your last meal or you haven't eaten yet, a small pre-workout snack will help provide your body with the energy it needs to sustain activity.
Pre-workout snacks have slightly more specific recommendations compared to a snack used to get you from lunch to dinner. The best type of snack before a workout is carbohydrates which act as an immediate source of fuel for your body.Try: a piece of fruit, a small yogurt, a small bowl of oatmeal, a few whole wheat pita chips, smoothie made with yogurt and fruit, apple with peanut butter, a piece of toast, a whole grain mini bagel, fruit leather or a small whole grain waffle.

, One of the most common reasons to include a snack is to help manage the hunger that can crop up in between mealtimes.Use your snack to curb hunger in between meals. Letting yourself get too hungry between meals may lead to overeating at your next meal time.
If two meals are more than about four to five hours apart, you may need to plan to have a snack to help tide you over to the next meals.
The combination of a lean protein and a fruit, vegetable or whole grain is the best option to quell hunger and keep you satisfied.
Try: fruit and yogurt or cottage cheese, trail mix with dried fruit, deli meat and cheese roll-ups, sliced pear with some cheddar cheese, apple and peanut butter, raw vegetables and hummus, whole wheat pita chips with guacamole, protein shake blended with fruit, protein bar and a small piece of fruit, cereal or oatmeal with fruit and tuna salad with raw veggies.

, Snacks can fit very well into a weight loss diet by managing satiation and nutrition. However, snacking when it's not needed may impede weight loss and set up bad habits.


Don't add snacks, even healthy or low-calorie snacks, that will push you over your calorie level for weight loss.
Don't snack out of boredom. Even if you have the room in your diet for a low-calorie snack, eating out of boredom and without hunger is a bad habit to get into in the long-term.
Also don't sit down with large quantities of snack foods — even if they're healthy. This can lead to mindless eating and overeating (and possibly too many calories).

Compile a portfolio.,
Create a demo reel.,
Keep your demo reel under two minutes in length.,
Include your best work first.,
Keep music to a minimum.",How to Work in Animation2," In most creative and artistic fields your portfolio is more important to potential employers than a formal education. Prospective employers will want to evaluate your past work before hiring you. As a result, you should compile a portfolio that includes a brief bio to explain your training and experience. You should also include some animation stills and storyboards that you have created..


A useful portfolio will also provide contact information and links to various social media platforms and blogs as well as a link to watch your demo reel.

, Enhance your portfolio with a demo reel that highlights your successful animation projects. Most people use either a DVD format or a website that links to Youtube or Vimeo. Your demo reel should be unique and stand out to potential employers., A demo reel should not be more than two minutes in length and should only include excellent content. When you are just starting out in the industry it is unlikely that you will have a lot of stand out footage to show anyways. Do not include average work just to add length to your reel. A potential employer will put more weight on 30 seconds of amazing footage than two minutes of standard content., When you are creating your demo reel be sure to put your best content and animation at the beginning of the film. Employers will look through hundreds of reels and will only continue watching if the content is unique and technically sound. As a result, you want to catch their attention with your most impressive work.If you have created a strong animated character, begin your reel with this. It will highlight your creativity and ability to create dynamic and unique characters.
Alternatively, you could showcase a particular technique, such as stop motion. If this is something you excel at.

, Music can be distracting and may even detract from your work. If you choose to include music in your reel, it should be light and in the background. Similarly, if your reel includes any dialogue between characters, cut the music altogether and let the dialogue speak for itself."

Network with people in the field.,
Apply for animation internships.,
Volunteer to enhance your skills.,
Look for contract work.,
Create a freelance business.,
Update your portfolio after you complete each project.",How to Work in Animation3," A great way to gain work experience and find work in the animation industry is by networking. For example, you could join a professional organization for animators, such as the Animation World Network or The Professional Association for Design (AIGA). Similarly, you may want to attend yearly industry conferences.


Networking can help you find mentors, learn about job postings, and will provide you with connections in the industry.

, It will be hard to get work in the animation field without experience. Many colleges help their students gain experience and will make an internship part of the program. If you did not attend a college, you can still get an internship. Search online for animation internships and apply to as many as possible.For example, if you met someone at a networking event, ask if there are any internships available at their company. You can even offer to intern for free just to get your foot in the door.

, In order to build a portfolio and demo reel you need to create animation. One way to do this is to volunteer your services to companies and friends. If you don't know of anyone who needs animation services, reach out to businesses, such as television programs, film producers, and websites. Offer to create animation content for free.

This gives you an opportunity to be creative and gain feedback on your work. Eventually this approach can lead to a paid position.

, Although some work is available on an ongoing basis, most animation work is based on contracts for projects. Apply for projects individually, and after two to five years of successful work, you may have a large enough client base to get referrals and steady projects.Search online job boards for animation contracts. Alternatively, you may hear about contracts through your networking connections.

, You can create a sole proprietorship and work under your own name, or start an animation business. It is a good idea to seek business and tax advice so that you can keep track of the expenses required to run your own animation business., Once you have started working in animation, you should continue to keep your portfolio and demo reel up-to-date with your best and latest work. Regular updates will highlight your versatility and will demonstrate that you are in demand."

Think about staying close to home.,
Consider volunteering abroad.,
Research organic farming volunteer opportunities.,
Apply for membership with an organization.,
Subscribe to that organization's list of farm hosts.,
Look at the amenities.,
Acknowledge the demands.,
Consider different kinds of farms.,
Make sure that at least one person there speaks a language you speak.,
Pay attention to dates.,
Contact the farm host.,
Make arrangements.,
Stay committed.",How to Volunteer on an Organic Farm," Volunteer opportunities are generally organized by location, so choosing the place (or places) where you'd be interested in working is an important first step. Consider working on a farm in the country where you live. Some benefits for this include:

Lower costs for travel
Speaking the language
Potentially shorter farm stays
Being close to home;
, Another popular option is to use organic farming as a way to see other parts of the world. If there is someplace you've always wanted to see, or a particular climate where you'd love to farm, search for organic farming opportunities in that location!If you plan to travel abroad, you will need a valid passport.
You will be responsible for your own travel expenses, so traveling abroad can be a little more expensive.
Farming is a way to cover your housing, so it is still less expensive than a traditional vacation!
Farming is a wonderful way to live abroad and experience some of the culture.

, If there is an organic farm near your home, you could attempt to contact the farmer there and ask if he could use any volunteer help. In addition to opportunities on your local neighborhood farm, you can also consider looking for volunteer opportunities with trusted organizations, such as organic farm programs sponsored or set up by universities.Be careful about the opportunities you choose.
Never accept an offer from a person or an organic farm that you have no way of researching or doing a background check on.

, An alternate way to find organic farming volunteer opportunities is to join an organization that specializes in connecting hosts with volunteers. Simply search for the country that interests you and go from there. When joining an organization, you can expect to pay a small fee, usually somewhere around $25.The largest and most effective organization is the WWOOF, or World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, which provides opportunities throughout the globe.
There are other organizations you can use, but most are not as far-reaching.

, Depending on the organization you apply with (such as WWOOF), you may need to purchase or request a specific list of organic farm hosts separately. Other organizations may provide lists for free. Purchase or request the list of farms for the region (or regions) of the world you would like to explore. Begin reading about each farm opportunity, one by one.Volunteer farm positions are unpaid, though most provide some form of housing.
Housing can range from an area to pitch a tent, to primitive cabins, to private houses.
Some farms also provide food.
Other amenities--such as internet access or the ability to bring pets--will vary widely from farm to farm.

, Comb through the list of available opportunities, and be realistic about what you can and cannot handle. Look carefully at the different amenities each farm offers. Think carefully about whether or not that will work for you.For example, if you need Internet access, make sure the host farm has Internet access.
Ensure that you will be comfortable living in the accommodations provided (in some places, this is limited to space for a tent).
In some places you may in very close quarters with others. In some places, you'll have lots of privacy and space.

, As you look through the list of farms, consider the workload each is requiring. Consider you own stamina and abilities: Would you be able to meet the physical demands of a particular farm? If you have physical limitations, make sure that the explanation of duties provided do not list a task that you will be unable to perform.
Make sure that you can commit to the daily work requirements. Most farms will want you to work anywhere between five and eight hours a day, Monday through Saturday.
Consider the climate in which you would be working. It might be very hot, cool, or rainy.

, Different farms will specialize in different kinds of agriculture. Take this into consideration when choosing the right farm for you. The majority of organic farms seeking volunteers will focus on vegetation (such as, macadamia nut farms in Hawaii or beet farms in Canada), but some farms will have animals too (such as farms in sheep and goat farms in Israel). Think about the type of work you would like to do and seek out a farm that fits., Theoretically, you could survive on a farm for several weeks without being able to speak the native language, but it would be immensely difficult to take instructions and learn if no one there can speak a language you understand. The head farmer does not need to speak English, necessarily, but if English is the only language you speak, you should make sure that someone in his family or on the farm can translate for you., Before selecting a farm, be sure to look both the start date and minimum time limit. In many instances, there is no maximum time limit, and if there is, it usually indicates the end of the growing season. There is almost always a minimum time limit, however. If you are unable to commit to that amount of time or start date range, that farm is not a good fit for you., Once you have selected the opportunity that best matches your needs and wants, email, call, or send a letter to the farm host. In this initial correspondence, you should include information that demonstrates your interest in the volunteer opportunity as well as what you can offer.Include your membership information. If the organization you are a part of gives you a membership number or card, send either a copy of the card or the number to the prospective organic farm host.
Provide a little information about yourself. Tell the host where you come from, which languages you speak, why you are interested in working for his or her farm, and what skills you can offer. Also mention your limits, including how long you are able to stay and any physical limitations you have or needs that must be met for you.
Ask for more information about the opportunity and the farm. Ask for greater detail about the type of work you will be doing, how to get to the farm, where the nearest town is located, and what sort of accommodation, if any, will be provided. It also helps to take an interest in the farm. Ask about what the farm produces and a little about its history.

, You will be required to make any travel arrangements necessary to get you to the farm. Book any plane, train, or bus tickets, or make sure that your vehicle is fit for the trip. Also, make sure that you have any needed gear, clothing, or other equipment (such as a tent). You can ask your farm host what, if any, specific clothing or gear you need to bring., After you make your final arrangements with the organic farm host, you must stick with them unless something urgent and unavoidable happens. Do not back out. Most of these farms are small and run by families, and the reason they hire volunteers instead of workers is because they have limited resources to work with. In all likelihood, the farm is in desperate need of help. If you back out, you will be putting the farm in a real pinch, as they may be unable to find a replacement in time."

Practice designing around a specific idea.,
Seek feedback.",How to Think Like a Graphic Designer," The elements of graphic design are the building blocks of all design work, so you'll need to be actively aware of them. There are six commonly accepted elements: line, shape, direction, size, texture, and color.A line is a visible mark that connects any two points.
Shapes are self-contained areas of geometric or free-formed, organic space.
Direction refers to the orientation of a line: horizontal, vertical, or oblique (slanted). Horizontal lines are calms, vertical lines are formal, and oblique lines are active.
Size is determined by the relationship between two or more areas of space.
Texture is the surface quality of a shape. Common textures include ""rough"" and ""smooth,"" among others.
Color refers to the the way that light is absorbed and reflected off an object. Color is further broken down into hues (names like ""red"" and ""yellow""), value (light versus dark), and intensity (brightness).;
, Space is a fundamental principle of design work, and knowing how to handle the space in a layout is crucial to arranging the layout effectively.


Space can exist outside or inside any element in the layout, including lines and shapes.
Positive space is active and filled by some element or elements.
Negative space is empty space.
Both positive and negative space must be balanced well for the layout to work.

, When you approach the overall space of the design, you need to break it down into its elements (line, shape, direction, size, texture, and color). Try to view the layout as a combination of these elements to enhance your understanding of how they exist in the visible space.


If you have difficulty separating the design into all six elements at once, work in smaller element sets. Start by breaking the space down into lines and shapes. Note the texture and color of those lines and shapes after that, followed by the size of your lines and shapes and the direction of your lines.

, The principles of design arrangement are the manners by which the elements of design are handled. Space can technically be classified as one such principle. The other five—balance, proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast—are used as you arrange elements within the overall space of your design.


Balance is the way in which visual weight is distributed throughout the design. Too much weight or activity in one part of the design can make the layout aesthetically displeasing.
Proximity is the distance between elements. It creates a sense of relationship between the various elements.
Alignment refers to the way that elements are connected to each other within the overall space of the design. This is another tool used to create order and relationship.
Repetition is used to create a sense of consistency and rhythm. You enact this principle by create commonality between the elements.
Contrast is any opposition created by opposing elements. It is usually used to emphasize certain parts of the design.

, Move the elements around or shift the perspective they are viewed from to improve the balance, proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast of the overall visible space.Each design will be different, but there are a few general tricks and tips worth remembering when you arrange elements by each principle.
Large shapes in one part of the design can be balanced out by smaller shapes in the opposite side of the design.
Objects directly related to one another are often placed in closer proximity than those with less connection.
Similarly, an element that depends upon or closely related to another element may be aligned to the position and direction of that other element.
Use repetition to give the layout cohesion. An object does not need to be perfectly identical to any other object within the space, but it may benefit to connect it to at least one other element in the layout through the use of color, size, texture, or direction.
Use contrast to highlight objects and to prevent things from looking identical and dull. Even similar lines and shapes can vary in color, size, texture, or direction.

, A lack of such constraints can make effective work more difficult to produce.


""Blank page syndrome"" is a phrase often used in writing, but it applies to graphic design, as well. When you start with a blank page and limitless possibilities, your mind can easily become overwhelmed and unable to find a starting point.
Some constraints, like lack of time or tools, will make a good design harder to complete. Creating an effective piece in spite of these constraints will ultimately build your talent as a designer, though.

, Put yourself in the shoes of your audience or client. Ask yourself what they would want to see instead of designing solely based on what you like.


Graphic design is meant to be viewed by other people, and for the most part, it's about those other people and not about you.
There is room for you let your own skills and trademarks shine through, but ultimately, the work needs to have an effect on those it is meant for.

, Even if convention works 99% of the time, there is still that 1% in which something out of the ordinary would make a better choice.


During the early stages of a design, don't be afraid to take any risk that falls within the strict constraints you have to deal with.
Be open minded as you plan the design. The final piece may or may not break with convention, but there is still a wealth of knowledge and experience to gain from experimentation either way.

, A classic novice mistake is to continually add more and more to a design, but oftentimes, less is more.


While each new addition might be good on its own, crowding too much ""good stuff"" into one space can weaken the work overall.
Knowing what to cut out demonstrates more refined talent.

, Good graphic design should do more than present a pretty picture. It should communicate an idea to the audience.


The aesthetics of design are certainly important and necessary, but they alone do not determine good design.

, Treat each project as though it were a new learning experience. Benefit from it in both technical and emotional ways.


Each project can help you grow and improve your graphic design skills.
Each project can also help you grow emotionally, making you more proficient at answering the needs of others and at gaining inspiration.

, Gain inspiration for your work by consciously viewing more of the world around you. Settling for the same sources of inspiration can limit your creativity and stunt the growth of your work, so look for inspiration where you least expect it.


A wider range of inspiration will make it easier for you to produce varied, well-rounded work.
Inspiration can be found in the ordinary and mundane. It can come from nature or from manmade aspects of living.
Walk around familiar and unfamiliar areas, taking pictures of things that grab your attention. Visit local art exhibits. Look through magazines, catalogs, and newspapers for interesting examples of design., Instead of trying to become an expert with one method of graphic design, play around with different mediums, skills, and tools.


Even if you prefer one for most of your work, having experience with multiple tools of the trade can influence your perspective, making your work more varied and unique.
If you do most of your work on your computer, try creating offline work, or vice versa.
Don't be afraid to mess up since the idea is to experiment. You can hone the skills you want to continue using later on.

, You can learn some new techniques through experimentation, but many technical skills are easier to learn when you have an example to follow.


Take a graphic design course if you want hands-on instruction from an experienced professional in the field.
When courses are not an option, read and follow design tutorials. A good tutorial will explain a specific technique in detailed steps, and you can find tutorials online that cover skills from a wide range of design categories.

, When you first start designing, you might base your work around general themes like ""nature"" or ""color."" Narrowing your theme down to a more specific idea can help you create something even more unique, however.


Themes with personal significance are often the easiest to work with, but you can also experiment with something more abstract.
Consider choosing a song lyric, memory, quote, or other meaningful symbol.
No matter what you choose, consider how the theme makes you feel and what sort of associated images it produces.
Vary your themes from time to time to make your work more well-rounded.

, You need to accept and learn from constructive criticism. Through objective criticism, you can gain helpful insights on how to improve.


Instead of waiting for feedback to come to you, try to intentionally seek it out. Post your work to your personal blog, social network accounts, or a reputable design network.

Change the rubber feet.,
Check and replace cracked spring.,
Tighten the clamps that are holding the bowl feeder.,
Clean the bowl feeders, feeding tray, and base plate.",How to Troubleshoot a Vibratory Bowl Feeder," If your feeder has insufficient amount of vibrations or if it is working slowly, there is a good chance that the feeding tray or base plate is not mounted properly. To overcome this problem, check the mounting arrangements and height of the tray so as to provide rigidity to the instrument.
, The coil gap in a vibratory feeder ought to be set properly else there would be functional issues with the equipment. You can troubleshoot this issue by setting the gap between 0,060″ and 0,100″ for DC currents and 0,030″ to 0,060″ for AC currents. Make sure that the arrangement of the coil and the striker plate is parallel to each other., Often, the vibratory panel feeders show decline in the rate of feeding because of change in the hardness (durometer) of the rubber feet. Curing of rubber thanks to continuous usage can result in swelling or hardening of the feet. In order to maintain the feed rate of your equipment, you should replace the rubber feet as and when such a requirement arises., A cracked spring can not only decrease the feed rate of the equipment, it can also halt the overall process. The area adjacent to the holes of a spring is prone to cracks. You should inspect these cracks with the help of a magnifying glass. For clearer inspection, you can brush or polish the spring with the help of an emery cloth. A cracked spring should be replaced immediately., Bowl feeders are held with the help of toe clamps during the parts feeding process. If the clamps are loose, it can result in slow and irregular parts movement. You can easily troubleshoot this issue by tightening the toe clamps and ensuring that the bowl feeder is held in one place properly., Residual dirt, clogged dust, and other impurities adversely affect the working of a vibratory feeder. Make sure that you clean the bowl feeders, base plates, feeding trays, and other parts of the vibratory feeder in order to get better performance."

Other possible sources of interference with the phone line include fluorescent lamps, a light dimmer or electric motors. If you have other possible sources of interference, don't discount them as they'll all need to be investigated.
, Check the phone line to see if the sounds are still happening. If they're not, it's a fair bet that the fence is the cause of interference. If you can still hear interference noise, check for other appliances around the house or yard., If you cannot find them, call your telecommunications provider to help you identify their location., Such sections are more likely to cause interference than other sections., The optimal amount should be about 2 amps per kilometre of energised fence line. If it's higher, then it will be prone to interfere. Try to find the source of it being higher, such as deteriorating insulators or live wires touching the ground.

The fence will work better if mains supply is fed to the fence in the middle of your farm or yard, well away from phone lines.

Decide whether you will start out with a small operation or a large farm.,
Determine what types of sales you will focus on so you can get a marketing plan in place.,
Construct a detailed budget.,
Research what permits you will need to launch your catfish farm.,
Know the signs of fish disease, what actions you can take to prevent it, and what chemicals are safe to use to treat disease that does occur.",How to Start a Catfish Farm,"


A large amount of start-up capital is necessary to launch a commercial catfish farm, potentially an amount in the neighborhood of a half-million dollars. Experts recommend at least 80 to 100 acres of ponds be established to increase the probability that a catfish farm will be successful. The upside to having a larger operation is that you can produce fish for less money per pound. This is because larger producers are able to buy supplies such as catfish feed in bulk, which leads to savings.
Determine whether or not catfish will thrive in the water you will be using. You will need to purchase an aerator; an electric aerator seems to work best for large farms, but if electricity is not available at your location, you may also use a gasoline or diesel powered aerator. If you are using an existing pond, it will likely require modification. For the best harvesting, the bottoms of catfish ponds should be smooth, clean and have gradual slopes.
Check to see if your ponds have spillways. Spillways must be kept free of debris. To keep fish in the pond in the event of excess water runoff, the spillway should allow for no more than 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water to run over at one time.
Experts recommend catfish ponds have soil that is 20 to 30 percent clay by weight. This helps to decrease seepage.
Water depth in catfish ponds should be no less than 3 feet (0.9 m) at the shallow end and no more than 8 feet (2.4 m) at the deep end. Water that is too shallow can lead to the growth of nuisance aquatic weeds.;
,


Larger producers should consider selling their product to fish processing plants. Many times, farmers are able to purchase shares of the plants to which they sell, and although the actual profit per pound is smaller, it can be made up for in volume.
There are also benefits to keeping your catfish operation smaller and doing direct sales to customers. Because fish spoils easily, consumers are often more likely to buy fresh fish instead of fish that have been frozen.

, Be sure to include line items for catfish production essentials you will need each year: feed, fingerlings, work force, fuel, electricity, equipment, supplies, and repairs. If you have secured financing for your catfish farm venture, don't forget to include the interest you will be paying on the borrowed funds.


Also make a list of estimated costs for items such as construction of additional ponds, pumps, wells, vehicles, feed bins, tractors, and buildings.

, Check into building, retail, tax, drainage and other types of permits that may be required. Remember to check the zoning of the land on which the farm will be located; even if it isn't zoned properly, you may be able to take your case to the local board of zoning appeals and get the zoning changed.


In some states, you may also need propagation and transportation permits.

,


Look for open sores, yellowish, eroded areas on the bodies, fins, gills or mouths of the fish, swollen gills or bloody fins.
One way to decrease the incidence of disease is to not overcrowd ponds. Put no more than 2 pounds of eggs in an 8-inch hatching basket.
Check for dead eggs daily and make sure they are removed. Dead eggs can spread disease.
Several chemicals are FDA-approved for treating disease in catfish ponds. These are Formalin, hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and copper sulfate.

Ranch jobs involve herding, feeding, and grooming the animals.Call a local farm or search the internet for opportunities to work with animals. It's possible to gain experience with animals growing up on your family farm, working at the local sale barn, gaining summer employment at an area farm, or volunteering at a large-animal veterinarian's practice.;
, Ranches tend to be quite large and require a lot of handy work. These are the kinds of manual skills that you may not have learned in school. You’ll need some experience to get hired, and it never hurts to have a few extra skills in your back pocket.Prepare for work on a ranch by programs like 4-H, Future Farmers of America, or the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program.Such organizations often have programs for students who are interested in learning about agriculture, common farm practices, and ranch work. Check with your guidance counselor or local government to see if classes are offered in your area.

, Search the internet for blogs or websites that give detailed information about the kinds of jobs that are offered on ranches. Ranch jobs are plenty. Some jobs ask for specific work with certain animals like cows or horses, whereas others are general management or maintenance jobs.Vary your search. Try using keywords like “farm” instead of “ranch” in your search. Although there are technical differences between farming and ranching, you might find useful information about work options if you broaden your search., Talk to any friends and family who have experience working on farms. Someone may be able to put you in touch with a ranch or farm in your area. Express your interest and set up a time to have an in-depth conversation where you can ask for tips.


For example, you might say, “Hi Susie, I heard that you used to work on a farm. I’m interested in working a ranch job. I’d love to hear about your experience and get some suggestions. Would you be willing to chat over a coffee sometime?”

, Prepare to share a resume with your relevant work experience, interests, and skills. Also prepare to share your education level (a high school diploma or GED is often desired) which includes any agricultural or farm-related classes you have taken. Remember to have copies of any legal documents that allow you to work such as a driver’s license and social security card., Decide on a job that fits your experience and interest. Although some ranch jobs are seasonal, many ranches also hire for long-term positions. You may also need to mention whether you will need room and board if hired. Some ranches include room and board as a part of your salary, while others do not.If you’ve found a job listing on a website, follow the instructions for applying. Some ranches also have their own websites where you can contact the employer directly.
Maybe a family friend or acquaintance suggested a job for you. Ask your friend how to go about approaching the ranch owners. It might be appropriate to state that you were referred by a friend.

Work with livestock.,
Consider working with uncommon animals.,
Learn to safely operate ranch equipment.,
Build and mend fences.,
Prepare to use different modes of transportation.",How to Work Ranch Jobs2," Most ranches raise grazing livestock like cattle or sheep. Animals have to be carefully cared for, as they are used for breeding and meat production. Sheep’s wool is also sheared and processed on some ranches.


Many ranches also have horses. They as are used as work animals or to entertain guests with scenic horseback rides. Remember that horse care is another specialty job that must be completed on a ranch.

, Uncommon ranch animals include bison, ostrich, emu, and alpacas.Bison ranches often produce meat, furs, and leather products.Ostrich ranches produce a ranch of products from meat to ostrich leather to eggs.Emu farms also produce eggs, meat, and emu oil.Alpaca farms usually produce yarn to make clothing and alpaca meat., Tractors are commonplace on ranches, as are balers, and augers. Knowing how to operate and provide maintenance on these pieces of equipment will make you a valuable ranch hand.



Tractors are large trucks designed to move heavy material on rough terrain. They have many gears and controls that require extensive training. Make sure you are fully trained on how to operate tractors before use.Balers are large machines that crush large amounts of material into rectangular or circular shapes. On ranches, Balers are often filled with vegetation or hay which is later used as animal feed. Balers are usually used in combination with a tractor, and also require training before use., All ranches have extensive fencing that regularly needs to be built, mended, or changed. Fences are typically constructed with barbed wire, steel posts, and wooden corner posts. Learn the basics of fence maintenance and building. Avoid common mistakes while building fences. Be sure to use the right materials for each part of the fence. Use the correct sizing and spacing when you measure and build your posts.

, Ranches range in size and tend to be quite large. The largest ranches in the United States can be up to 2,000,000 acres in size! Many ranchers use some sort of all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or truck to get around the ranch.Others might use horses to cut back on the cost of fuel.Prepare to ride or drive as you go through your work day on the ranch.

Be physically fit.,
Expect long hours in all sorts of weather.,
Dress for the job.",How to Work Ranch Jobs3," A lot of ranch work involves heavy lifting and physical work. Lifting bales of straw, wrestling livestock, and stretching wire all require a significant amount of strength. Exercise and workout regularly.


Do strength training. Lift weights or simply work your muscles by using your own body. Strengthen your arms and legs with daily push-ups and squats.

, If it rains, you work. If it snows, you work. If the sun is blisteringly hot, you work. If a heifer has a calf at two in the morning, you work. Ranch work happens all around the clock, so be prepared to face the elements.

, Protecting yourself against rough nature is important. Wear jeans, work boots, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat, and gloves in order to adequately protect your skin. A heavy work coat will be necessary in colder temperatures.


Use sunscreen. If you work outdoors all day, your skin will need protection. Wear sunscreen regularly to avoid sunburn and other dangerous skin conditions.

Check the legal authorities in your location.,
Investigate your potential market.,
Select a site for beginning your nursery.,
Research material suppliers to keep your costs down.,
Educate yourself about the local growing conditions and potential problems in your area.,
Talk to local landscapers to find out what they may be in the market for.,
Study the plant species you intend to grow to determine a reasonable time frame between the initial planting and the time the plant is ready for market.,
Take the information you have gotten in the previous steps, and start a business plan.,
Talk to lenders, government agencies who assist in small business start-ups, and potential investors to see if you can develop a financing structure which will cover your start-up costs.

,
Using the above information, you should be able to decide what scale you will begin your business at.",How to Start a Plant Nursery Business," There are several potential jurisdictions which may apply to your new business venture, and because they vary from place to place, you should do some research to see what regulations may apply to you. Here are some to think about:


Business license. If you intend to begin a commercial nursery business, this license is most likely required, and may have a fairly hefty cost associated with it.






Property zoning. For most areas in the U.S., zoning ordinances dictate possible uses for land. Normally, a nursery business would be considered ""agricultural use"", but in some interpretations, it might be ""commercial"", ""agribusiness"", or some other classification.






Look at the requirements for construction permits, if you are in an area where you will be required to build a green house, or you intend to build a storage building or warehouse for materials and equipment.






Check what insurance you will be required to carry on your business. This may include property hazard insurance, workman's compensation if you have paid employees, and general liability insurance if you expect visitors to your nursery.






Check the regulations governing growers in your area. In some places, you will be required to meet government agricultural inspection requirements.






Look at the availability of water for irrigation. Water management authorities may have to issue separate permits if you intend to install irrigation wells or draw water from a stream or lake.





;
, You will need to be able to predict demand for your plants to be able to plan what you will grow. Here are some things to consider.


What plants you will grow. Nurseries produce plants for home gardens, landscaping, reforestation, and other uses. You will need to decide if you are going to produce container grown, bare root, or rootballed plant products.






Quantities. This is going to be a tricky subject. If you produce more plants than you can market effectively, you will be stuck with the surplus, and have to absorb the cost of your investment. Not enough is less financial burden, but being able to meet a customer's demand is essential in maintaining a good relationship with them.






Advertising. This is a cost almost all businesses must absorb to assure themselves a share of the market. Decide early what your advertising base will be, and budget funds in your business startup plan.







, If you do not own land, you may have to lease or purchase a site for your business. Make sure it is suitable for your purpose, zoned appropriately, and will allow for growth as your business prospers. Also make sure your site has good access, particularly if you will be depending on customers coming to you for your product.

, Because you are in the beginning stages for your business, you will need to develop a relationship with wholesale suppliers of the items you will need to become established. This may include, but not be limited to, the following.


Seeds or seedlings. If you do not intend to harvest your seeds and seedling from the wild, you will have to buy these from a nursery supplier or farm and garden supply source. You will need to buy the highest quality you are able, at the lowest price.






Containers. This may simply be ""peat cups"" for seasonal vegetables or flowers, or 1, 3, and 15 gallon (56.8 L) plastic containers for growing ""potted"" shrubs and trees.






Landscape fabric, mulch, and soil conditioners. Again, these will be available from wholesale nursery suppliers if you buy sufficient quantities, or you may have to begin your business venture buying them retail from a garden and landscaping supply.






Equipment. This can include anything from irrigation equipment to a tractor with a loader bucket, depending on the type of plants you grow. Most likely you will at least need a pickup truck and trailer for moving plants and materials, and making deliveries to customers. To be able to develop an accurate business plan, you should consider everything you will need to get started, even shovels, hoes, and rakes.







, You may have to get a chemical applicator's license if there is a problem with pests, diseases, or insects in your region.

, In many areas, there are ""staple"" plant products commonly used in any one area, but these are also going to be the most available. Ask about unusual plants they get requests for, and indigenous species that can be grown and planted for the same purpose, with less environmental impact.

, Ornamental plants grow fairly fast in the right conditions, but they may still take a year or more to be ready for market. Trees may take 3 to 5 years, depending on the market size and species, when started from seed.

, You should be able to create a ""Start-up Cost"" chart with initial investment, and operational costs to determine how much money you will need to start and keep your business going until you begin to sell plants and generate an income.

,, It is fairly common to begin a business as a one person, back yard operation, and allow it to grow as income is generated, but this will mean continuing to work a regular job to meet your financial obligations during the interim.

The amount of protein you need in your diet depends on your age and sex. Adult women need about 5 ounces of protein daily. If you are a pregnant, you may need more protein in your diet depending on your weight and stage of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about protein intake during pregnancy.
Men under 50 need about 6oz of protein each day. After 50, men only need about 5oz of protein daily.;
, Many people are unsure what constitutes an ounce of protein. The answer depends on the type of protein you're consuming.


1oz of meat, poultry, or fish should contain roughly 1oz of protein. With other food types, protein is diluted or combined with other nutrients within the food. This changes how protein is measured.1/4 cup of cooked beans contains about 1oz protein. One egg is 1oz of protein. A tablespoon of peanut or other nut butter also counts an ounce. Half an ounce of nuts or seeds count as an ounce of protein., If you're unsure of the precise amount of protein in a product, make use of nutritional labels. These should give you a sense of the amount of protein in a given food, as well the percentage of your daily protein requirement it entails. However, keep in mind food label calculations are based on a 2,000 calorie a day diet. Also, try to be honest about how much of a given food you're eating. Many people inadvertently under or overestimate how much of a product they're consuming., For fitness, you may need a rough sense of how many of your daily calories come from protein.

The amount of grams in an ounce in inexact, somewhere around 28.3. It can be difficult to convert by hand and may be easier to do the conversion with an online system. You may also have to round numbers when converting ounces to grams., It can also be helpful to know how much percentage of protein a given food contains. If you're trying to eat foods in a certain percentage range regarding protein, this information is essential.


Figure out how many grams of a protein a food contains. Divide that amount by the total calories in the food. Then multiply the sum by 100.For example, say a food contains 200 calories and 8 grams of protein. You would dive 200 by 8, giving you .16. When multiplied by 100, this comes out to 16. That food would be 16% protein., If you want to apply your knowledge to your diet. spend some time figuring out your rough protein requirements for a healthy diet.

A good sports analyst is expected to be like a walking encyclopedia of sports information.It is not enough to know all about one team, or even one sport. Sports analysts have to possess a thorough knowledge of all the most sports, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, hockey, golf, boxing and even Olympic and extreme sports.;
, Start paying close attention to game outcomes, player stats, win-loss records and other statistical information. Commit as much of these facts as you can to memory. Statistics is the language of sports analysis. As an analyst, your job will be to make authoritative assessments and predictions based on statistical models.There is far more use of mathematical principles in sports analysis than most people realize. Taking a formal statistics course or two will help further your understanding of how these principles come into play.

, Go to school and work towards a degree in journalism, communications or broadcasting. While it’s not strictly necessary to have one of these degrees in order to land a job in sports journalism, most employers prefer that applicants hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.

Many online programs can be completed in less time than a full term at a university, and include all the most relevant courses, such as news reporting, media ethics, sports psychology and broadcasting., Once you’ve earned an undergraduate degree, think about channeling your efforts into a post-graduate master’s or doctorate level certification. Many graduate programs include courses that focus more specifically on sports analytics and broadcasting, meaning you’ll be getting an education in your chosen field of expertise. These credentials will be very impressive to potential employers.A graduate degree will require you to significantly narrow your area of focus, which may not help you get your first job but can make you a commodity for special positions later on.

Becoming an athlete will give you a chance to work closely with other players, coaches, recruiters and journalists, and afford you a behind-the-scenes look into the workings of the industry.If you’re not a student and don’t have the option of trying out for a school team, look into joining a community league in your area.
Quite a few well-known sportscasters got their start as players rather than educated journalists.

, Start writing out your thoughts and analyses of sporting events for practice. A substantial amount of the expert opinions offered by sports analysts are written down in the form of blurbs, editorials and written interviews. You should also work on polishing your verbal skills and becoming comfortable talking to people to prepare for conducting interviews and appearing on radio or television.A lot of writing goes into sports reporting, even if you’re working in broadcasting.

Sports fans will be counting on you to provide them with reports that they can count on.Always verify a piece of information before you relay it to the public.
Aim to construct a network of dependable sources that will give you an inside line on developing updates.

, While some sports analysts are confined to offices researching and writing reports, others will find themselves presenting these reports to the masses on the air.

Learn to think on your feet and stay poised and you’ll quickly get over the nerves of appearing in broadcasts.Talking for the radio or TV cameras can be intimidating, but will become easier the more you do it.
It may also be a good idea to know how to work with teleprompters, research databases, word processing programs and other technology utilized by professionals., As a sports analyst, you will be expected to have prediction models, written columns and other materials prepared under strict time constraints.

While a traditional news story focuses on hard facts and data, a human interest story focuses on individual people or animals and the emotion tied to the circumstances they’re in.A human interest story should have a focus, such as a person or even a companion animal, that has an experience that warrants telling their story.
Identify the emotion the story incites. Is your story a motivational tale? Is it a recounting of someone’s personal tragedy?;
, A human interest story can be used to garner support for a cause, change opinions on a topic or bring attention to an important topic that hasn’t received its fair share of press. Identify what you aim to accomplish through writing your story. You may want to create sympathy for a person that has experienced a tragedy.
You may want to bring attention to a subject of importance.
There may be an organization that is viewed in an incorrect light and you hope to shift perceptions of it.

, Human interest journalism is not without its detractors. Because of its emphasis on emotion instead of facts, many people believe that human interest stories are manipulative in nature. Identify common complaints about bad human interest journalism to avoid falling into the same mistakes.Do not misrepresent the person you focus your story on or other people involved.
Base your narrative on real events and the truth of what occurred, instead of what would make for a good story.
While you may be creating your piece in support of a certain cause or organization, avoid language that depicts a clear bias.

, The first part of quality research is gathering the necessary background information. Background information will provide you with important elements of your story such as who was involved and when it occurred. It can also provide a the broader scope of why your story matters.If you are doing a story about a person who was afflicted with a disease or illness, important background information would include basic research about that illness as well as the effects of treatment if that may play a role in the story.
Background information could also provide you with an understanding of important terminology or cultural elements you may not be aware of if you aren’t well versed in the area of your research.

, There is a breadth of quality information to be found online, but it’s important that you determine the legitimacy of the sources you use to ensure the information contained within each source is accurate and appropriate for inclusion in your piece.Websites that end with .Org, .Edu, or .Gov are often more credible than those that end with .Com or other common suffixes.
Look at the author of the content when provided. Search that author or read the provided biographical information and make a judgement regarding their credibility based on the level of expertise they have indicated.
Look for signs of a bias in the material you find online, as well as reasons to believe the content is not accurate or legitimate.


, There are four traditional elements to conducting a successful journalistic interview. Each step is intended to help you gain important pieces of information from someone while treating them with respect and maintaining your journalistic integrity. Interviewing the person the article is about is usually a necessity, but consider interviewing others involved as well.Prepare extensively before the interview by conducting all the necessary background research.
Establish a rapport with the interviewee to put them at ease. Treat them with respect and try to find elements you have in common for the sake of conversation.
Ask relevant questions and be direct. Your questions should provide an opportunity to elaborate, so avoid simply asking yes or no questions.
Listen attentively. Pay attention to body language and record everything said. You may want to use an audio or video recording device to keep a record of the conversation, but ensure you are given permission first.

, When conducting your research, it’s important that you not begin with conclusions already in mind. Although human interest pieces are often started with an idea for a story, you must not allow that idea to effect the way you conduct your research. Instead, conduct good research and let that inform how you write the piece.If your sources provide information that is in opposition to your viewpoints when you started, you may need to reassess the nature of your piece.
Let the research determine what is accurate and true, not your opinions or beliefs.

, Once you have all of your research gathered, go back through all of it to put together a coherent account of the important events and people in your story. Check your research and interviews against one another to identify trends or inconsistencies that may need further research.If some of your research contradicts other information, you may need to conduct further research to verify the accuracy of previous statements.
You may need to make a judgement call at times. When research is contradictory, use the information that seems most reliable and accurate.

, A human interest story can be broken up into three primary elements that each serve the purpose of drawing in and keeping the reader’s attention. Adhering to the appropriate framework will not only improve the reader’s experience, it may be required in order to have your story printed.Make sure you have a catchy headline that concisely explains what the story is about and should transition smoothly into the lead of the article.
The body of the piece is where the real story telling takes place. This will require all of the pertinent information as well as emotional elements that grab a reader’s attention.
The conclusion should efficiently summarize the elements of your story and establish a link between them if it isn’t clear in the body. The conclusion often serves as the emotional punch, or as a culmination of the emotional story elements. An example could be a mother being reunited with her daughter after a story about her efforts to find her after a natural disaster.

, The lead of your story is what will compel readers to stick with your story. It should summarize your story briefly, giving the reader an idea of what to expect throughout the rest of the piece.Consider starting with a brief story about the person you are focusing on, or a person involved in the event of organization.
A lead not only provides a preview of what’s to come, it establishes why your story is important. An example may be starting with a story about a person who fights wildfires and the difficulty of the job in a human interest piece about the dangers of the drought in Southern California.
Your lead should be no longer than two paragraphs in length.

, While your human interest piece may take place in a technical environment or a work culture that utilizes specific jargon, avoid using that language in your piece. Using words that are too specific to a group of people can alienate readers.If you must use technical or workplace specific words or phrases, ensure you explain them clearly the first time you bring them up.
A military story, for instance, may require the use of ranks, but some ranks may be difficult to understand and appreciate for readers. A “Hospital Man 1” in the Navy, for instance, is a senior rank to “Hospital Man 2” but that isn’t immediately obvious to those outside of the military.
Try to relate difficult terms to everyday things. Instead of citing a “Hospital Man 1” as the head of a unit in the Navy, try using terms like “supervisor” if the main character in your story works below them.

, A human interest piece is not about simply recounting facts in a dry manner. Instead, human interest stories can provide a journalist with an opportunity to utilize descriptive language that may not be common in their usual news reporting.Instead of simply saying, “it occurred at night,” describe the night. Was visibility low? Depending on the location, night time can be extremely dark and foreboding, or it may be a well-lit city street.
Descriptive language can transport a reader to the scene. Instead of saying, “the sun was setting,” try something like, “the setting sun painted the sky with red and orange hues.” This gives the reader a sense of what it looked like to be there, instead of simply an understanding of the time of day.

, Because human interest stories are intended to convey feeling as much as information, they allow for terms that help establish the tone in the mind of the reader. While a traditional news story may simply state that a soldier defused a car bomb, a human interest piece may attribute characteristics to the solider such as brave or courageous.Create a tone in your piece by building emotion throughout the lead and body that culminates in the conclusion.
If you are writing the tragic story of a man who lost his wife in an accident, you may want to discuss them being happy together early on, then the events that separated them, and finally the emotional fallout he experienced after the loss.

, A human interest story does not have to adhere to all of the traditional news story rules, but in order to be printed it still needs to be newsworthy in a general sense. While a traditional news story takes into account timing, significance, proximity and prominence to determine newsworthiness, a human interest story has a bit more leeway in each.Timing and proximity usually means when something occurred and how close it was to the reader. Human interest stories do not need to be as recent or as close in order to be newsworthy, but these elements should still be considered.
Prominence is usually a measure of how well known those involved are to the readers. This is less important to human interest stories as they often focus on normal individuals, but using prominent figures can still increase your likelihood of having your story printed.
The significance of a human interest story is usually the emotion. A human interest story should make the reader feel something.

, It may be tempting to craft a human interest story by altering the way you recount events or facts in order to make the story more interesting or increase the emotional weight of what occurred. Doing so, however, will make you less credible as a journalist.Writing your story in a misleading way not only does the reader a disservice, but it does the subjects involved in your story a disservice as well. As a journalist, your job is to recount what occurred, not embellish or mislead your audience.
Human interest stories can be noble endeavors, wherein you draw attention to important topics or garner support for great causes, but doing so in a dishonest way is wrong and often not tolerated by journalistic organizations like newspapers and magazines.

, The final step to writing a good human interest story is proofreading and editing it before submission. Take some time away from your article and return to it with fresh eyes. Read it over looking for spelling or grammatical errors as well as the way the story makes you feel.


The story should be free of errors before you submit it to ensure it is taken seriously as a professional piece of journalism.
Pay attention to the tone and emotion of the story as you read it. Did you convey the story in the way you intended? You may need to revise it if the emotion becomes convoluted or you feel a different delivery could have an increased impact.
Fact check your story to ensure you haven’t included incorrect information.

"
"
Check your facts.,
Describe something that isn’t obvious.,
Do not start a caption with certain words.,
Identify the main people in the photo.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Label historical photos properly.,
Use the present tense in captions.,
Avoid humour when the photo isn’t intended to be humorous.,
Remember to always include credits and citations.",How to Write Good Captions in Photojournalism1," One of the most important aspects of any type of journalism is accuracy. If you use incorrect information, the story or photo loses credibility. Before uploading or printing any photo captions, make sure you’ve checked that anything stated in the caption is accurate.Don’t print an incorrect caption if you have trouble checking your facts, either because you can’t find an appropriate source, or because you’re on a deadline. It’s better to leave the information out if you aren’t sure it’s accurate.;
, If a photo caption simply describes the visuals in the photo, it’s fairly useless. If you have a photo of a sunset and simply caption is as “a sunset” you’re not adding any additional information for the reader. Instead, describe details of the photo that are not obvious, like the location, the time of day or year, or a specific event that is taking place.For example, if you have a photo of a sunset you might want to caption it as: “Pacific coast sunset, March2016, from Long Beach, Vancouver Island.""
Also avoid using terms like: “is shown,” “is pictured,” “and looks on,” or “above.""

, A caption should not begin with the words ‘a,’ ‘an,’ or ‘the.’ These words are too basic and take up valuable captioning room when they aren’t necessary. For example, instead of saying: “A blue jay in the boreal forest;” simply say: “Blue jay flying through boreal forest.”Also, do not start a caption with the name of someone, start the caption with a description first and then include the name. For example, don’t say: “Stan Theman near Sunshine Meadow Park.” Instead say: “Jogger Stan Theman near Sunshine Meadow Park.""
When identifying where someone is in a photo, you can say “from left.” You do not have to say “from left to right.""

, If your photo includes important people, identify who they are. If you know their names, include them (unless they’ve asked to remain anonymous). If you don’t know their names, you might want to put a description of who they are instead (e.g. “protesters on the streets of Washington, DC”).While it shouldn’t need to be said, make sure any and all names you use are spelled correctly and have the proper title.
If the photo includes a group of people, or some people who are not relevant to the story (i.e. their names are not required to tell the story), you do not have to name each of them in the caption., This advice goes hand-and-hand with being accurate. If you are unsure of where the photo was taken, or who is in the photo, find out. Showing a photo without any specific information may not be useful to the reader, especially if you cannot inform them of the context in which the photo was taken.If you were working with another journalist for the story, contact them for more information if needed.
If you are trying to identify a specific person in the photo, describing where in the photo they are is very useful. For example, if Bob Smith is the only one in a hat, you can say: “Bob Smith, back row in hat.""
While specific is good, you can also phrase your caption so that is starts general and becomes more specific, or starts specific and ends more generally. Either method ensures specificity, but creates easy-to-ready statements., If you’re using an historical photo in your story, make sure it’s labelled properly and includes the date (at least the year) it was taken. Depending on who owns the photo, you may also need to credit another photography and/or organization (e.g. museum, archive, etc.)., Because most photos being shown as part of a news story are of things happening “right now,” use the present tense in the caption. An obvious exception would be any historical photos, where using the past tense makes sense.The nice thing about using the present tense is that it portrays a sense of immediacy and increases the impact of the photo on the reader.

, If the photo you’re captioning is of a serious or sombre event, don’t try to be funny in the caption. Funny captions should only be used when the photo itself is a joke or of a funny event that is intended to make the reader laugh., Every photo should include the name of the photographer and/or the organization that owns the photograph. In actual photographic magazines and publications, photos also include the technical details of how the photo was taken (e.g. aperture, film speed, f-stop, lens, etc.)When writing the credits, you don’t have to use the term “credited to” or “photo by” if the information is presented in a consistent and understandable format. For example, maybe the credits are always italicized or are a smaller font size.

Research different nursing career paths and educational requirements.,
Interview an LPN and a RN to learn about their jobs.,
Research nursing education programs.",How to Become a Nurse in Arizona1," In the state of Arizona, you can practice nursing as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or a registered nurse (RN). Explore the job duties of both an LPN and RN.


Licensed practical nurses provide direct patient care under the direction or supervision of a doctor or registered nurse. The LPN can direct the activities of nursing assistants and aides in a health care setting. The duties of an LPN include taking patient vital signs; administering medications; providing patients with assistance in eating, standing and grooming; and updating patient records.
Registered nurses provide direct care to patients as well as educate families and patients about care and treatment. The RN assists physicians in diagnosing illnesses and conditions and in the development of a patient care plan. Registered nurses administer medications, assist physicians in surgery and provide medical care to patients under the orders of a physician.;
, It’s important to learn exactly what a nurse does on a day-to-day basis before deciding to become a nurse. Ask a friend or family member who is a nurse if you can take them to coffee or lunch. If you don’t know a nurse, ask friends and family for suggestions.

, Becoming a nurse means attending school for at least eighteen months and up to four years in the state of Arizona. Take some time to research program requirements, costs, financial aid, and job placement statistics on each school’s website.


A registered nurse can complete a bachelor or associate's degree program to qualify for licensure in Arizona. The bachelor's degree program prepares the RN to advance in the field and pursue administrative positions in the nursing field. The Nurse Practice Act in Arizona requires a registered nursing education program to provide student nurses with the education to care for geriatric patients, infants, patients with mental impairment and conditions, premature infants, adults and patients seeking wellness care. The program must also include clinical education for the registered nurse.
Licensed practical nursing programs are available at vocational and community colleges. These programs prepare the student to provide basic nursing care to patients in a variety of settings. The Arizona Nurse Practice Act requires the LPN education program to include clinical instruction in patient care and basic nursing skills.
Be sure to learn about any courses you need to complete before applying to and/or entering the program.

Use the caption to tell the reader something new.,
Avoid making judgemental statements.,
Do not worry about length of the caption.,
Write in a conversational language.,
Include unessential story items in the captions.,
Determine what punctuation should be used.,
Simplify descriptions in subsequent captions.,
Identify when photos have been digitally altered.,
Considering using a caption-writing formula.",How to Write Good Captions in Photojournalism2," When a reader looks at the photo they’re usually confronted with some form of emotion and some information (based on what they see in the photo). The caption, in turn, should provide the reader with a piece of information they were unaware of from simply looking at the photo. In short, the caption should teach the reader something about the photo.Captions should intrigue a reader to investigate the story further and look for more information.
Captions should also refrain from repeating aspects of the story itself. The caption and the story should complement each other and not be repetitive.

, Captions should be informative, not judgemental or critical. Unless you were actually able to speak to the people in the photo, and asked them what they were feeling or thinking, don’t make assumptions based only on their appearance in the photo. For example, avoid “unhappy shoppers waiting in line” unless you actually know they were unhappy.Journalism is intended to be objective and informative for the reader. Journalists are suppose to present the facts in an unbiased way and allow the reader to form an opinion.

, A photo may say a thousand words, but sometimes a few words are required to put the photo in context. If a lengthy description is required in order to allow the photo to make sense, that’s okay. While you want to try to be as clear and succinct as possible, don’t limit the information in your caption if it will be helpful., Journalism, in general, doesn’t use overly complicated language. But it also doesn’t use cliches or slang. Captions should follow the same basic language requirements. Write your captions in a conversational tone, similar to the way you’d address a family member if you were showing them the photo. Avoid cliches and slang (and acronyms). Don’t use complicated words if they aren’t needed.If the photo is accompanied by a story, try to use the same tone in the caption that was used in the story., Stories that accompany photos tend to be about something specific and, obviously, tell a story. If there is a piece of information that is useful to understanding the photo, but isn’t necessary in telling the story, put it in a caption instead of in the body of the story.This doesn’t mean that captions are only used for unimportant items of the story, but rather items that are not essentially to the telling of the story. A caption can be a free-standing mini-story that can include items not used within the story itself.
Again, remember that the caption and story should complement each other. Not repeat each other.

, If the photo is simply of a person (e.g. headshot) or a photo of a very specific item (e.g. umbrella), it’s okay to caption the photo with the name of the person or item without any punctuation. In other cases, it is also okay to use incomplete sentences in a caption, but this may depend upon the publication and their requirements.An example of a caption without punctuation might be: “Toyota 345X Transmission""
An example of the difference between a complete and incomplete caption: Complete — “Actress Ann Levy takes the Acura 325 for a spin on the British test drive course in London.” Incomplete — “Taking the Acura 325 for a spin.""

, If multiple, consecutive photos in a story show either the same place or person or event, it is not necessary to keep repeating the details of these items in each caption. For example, if you introduce the person in the first caption using their full name, you can simply refer to them with they last name in subsequent captions.It is okay to assume that someone viewing and reading one photo have viewed and read the captions of the previous photos since they likely are in a specific order that tells a story.
You can also skip being too detailed in the caption if the story itself provides a lot of details. For example, if the story tells the details of the event, you do not have to repeat those details in the captions.

, Photos are sometimes enlarged, shrunk, or cropped in order to fit the situation, story, page, space, etc. This type of altering doesn’t need to be explained because it doesn’t change what is in the image. However, if you’ve changed the photo in any other way (i.e. changed the colour, removed something, added something, enhanced something unnaturally, etc.) you must identify this in the caption.The caption doesn’t have to explicitly say what you’ve changed, but should at least state “photo illustration.""
This rule also goes for unique photography methods like time-lapse, etc.

, Until you get use to writing captions, you might want to start by using a specific formula. Eventually your captions will likely follow this formula, or something similar, without you needing to think about it. But until then, rely on the formula to ensure you’ve included all the needed items.One such formula is: during at in on , , . An example written using this formula: ""Dallas firefighters (noun) battle (present-tense verb) a fire (direct object) at the Fitzhugh Apartments (proper noun location) near the intersection of Fitzhugh Avenue and Monarch Street in Dallas (city) on Thursday (day of the week), July (month) 1 (date), 2004 (year).”"
"
Do not be arrogant.,
Avoid making assumptions.,
Make sure you aren’t sloppy.,
Remember that what you print is considered fact.",How to Write Good Captions in Photojournalism3," Arrogance in captions comes when the person writing the caption doesn’t care about the reader, and simply writes a caption that is easy at the moment of writing. This can also be consider being selfish because the writer cares more about themselves than the reader who is trying to decipher what the photo and story are about.This can also happen when a writer is trying to be ‘fancy’ and try something new or clever. There is no need to get complicated. Keep things simple, clear, and accurate.

, You know what they say about people who assume … ! The same goes for writing captions. These assumptions could be on the part of the journalist, photographer, or even someone else at the publication where everything is being put together. Don’t make assumptions about what was going on in the photo, or who the people are. Find out the truth and only include what’s accurate.This also goes for style and format. If you aren’t sure if the publication has a specific format for captions, ask. Don’t use a format you like that may need to be completely revised later because you didn’t ask.

, Sloppiness happens when someone just doesn’t care, or doesn’t consider the situation important enough to double-check. The result of sloppiness can be incorrect spelling, the wrong names for people in the photo, captions that don’t match the photos, referring to a photo in the story incorrectly, etc. If you’re proud of your work, do a good job from start to finish.This can also happen when someone tries to use another language in the caption, but doesn’t check if it has been written properly. Google Translate is not the same as double-checking if the language is correct!

, As a journalist, whatever you print either in your story or caption is usually considered fact by your readers. They rightfully assume you’ve done your fact-checking and that what you’re telling them is accurate. If you were too lazy or sloppy to do the job, you risk passing along incorrect information to a large number of people.Also remember that once information gets “out there,” it can be hard to correct. Especially if that information is related to an event that was tragic, stressful or still ongoing.

Get architectural ""bona fides."",
Start building journalistic qualifications.,
Work with architects.,
Collect clips.,
Approach publications.,
Stay involved in the general arts community.",How to Become an Architectural Journalist," Having qualifications in architecture can help you become an architectural journalist by proving that you have the expertise to understand all of what goes into building design.


Acquire the right architectural degrees. A college degree is often a necessity for someone who wants to become an architectural journalist.;
, Qualifications for becoming a journalist also involve a college degree in print media or a related discipline.


Get internships if possible. One of the best ways to enter a field like journalism is to get involved in an internship with a company directly out of college, or during the term of a college career. An internship may help you get a foot in the door of your desired field. Those who have gone on to become architecture journalists or reporters in the past often started with an unpaid internship at a newspaper or other publication.

, In becoming involved in the field, you can build more of the skills and expertise that you will need to report on the architectural field in the future.


Use architects as sources. You may be able to break into architectural journalism from a more general newspaper or magazine assignment. Part of this is through identifying architects as sources for a general story, then maintaining and developing those contacts into a closer relationship.
Work with architects as collaborators. If you do reporting for an architectural journal, you may also have the kinds of close associations with architects that will get you closer to a career as a professional reporter on architecture or other visual arts.

, As in any kind of journalism, your published clips will be a major part of your effort to secure future jobs in reporting. Show off any specialized clips relating to building projects, architecture or a related field.


Leverage general journalistic assignments. It's important to know that a variety of different reporting jobs provide peripheral focus on architecture. For example, a municipal reporter may report on various stages of building plan approval, view blueprints and talk to public engineers. An arts reporter may report on gallery buildings as part of an overall assignment. Any of these types of journalistic jobs can lead you closer to specialized reporting on an architectural project.

, Send query letters to architectural journals and public interest magazines as possible to grow a list of contacts and maximize the possibilities for future projects in the precise field of architecture reporting.

, Since architecture reporting does track closely with other arts reporting in some ways, branch out into other areas of the visual arts to help in your pursuit of a career as an architectural journalist.

Read the nutrition panel on the food package.,
Multiply the number fat grams by 9.,
Convert the calories from fat to a percentage.",How to Calculate Fat Calories1," The nutrition panel on food packages has all of the information that you will need to calculate calories from fat. The panel is black and white and it should say “Nutrition Facts” at the top of it.Find this panel and then find the number of fat grams per serving.


Write down how many grams of fat are in this food. For example, if the food has 3.4 grams of fat in it, then write this number down.
In some cases, the nutrition panel will also provide a number for the calories from fat. If your panel has this information listed, then you will not need to calculate any further unless you want to find the percentage.
If there is no nutrition panel, then you can try to search for the nutrition information. Try visiting the product’s website if the item is prepackaged. If you got the item in a restaurant, then check the restaurant’s nutrition information. If the item was homemade, then try checking recipe websites for the nutrition information of similar recipes.;
, To get the number of calories from fat using the fat grams, you will just need to multiply the total fat grams per serving by 9. This is because one gram of fat contains 9 calories.For example, if the food has 3.4 grams of fat, then your equation might look like 3.4 X 9 = 30.6. This food would have 30.6 calories from fat.

, After you have calculated the number of calories in the food that are from fat, you can convert this number to a percentage. To get the percentage of calories from fat in a food, just divide the number of calories from fat in one serving by the total number of calories in one serving.For example, if the food has 260 calories in a serving and 30.6 calories from fat, then your equation might look like 30.6 / 260 = 0.1176
To turn this result into a percentage, just move the decimal two spots to the right or multiply your result by 100. For example, 0.1176 X 100 = 11.76% or about 12%. This means that the food has a fat percentage of about 12%.

, If you are a competitive athlete, for instance, you’ll need to take in more calories than the average person to compensate for the high levels of energy you’re using each day. Other conditions that will increase your risk for undernutrition include:


Old age. Even though older individuals often have overall lower caloric needs relative to the average adult, their reduced appetites means they might need encouragement to get more calories.
Injury. Burn victims, for instance, need higher volumes of food than other people because their bodies are working overtime to recover. Other serious injuries may likewise require you to consume more calories than the average person (especially high-protein calories) in order to encourage the healing process.
Surgery. For the same reason that injured individuals need more calories, people who have recently had major surgery will probably need more calories than they usually do.

For example, a 20 year old male who exercises regularly will require more daily calories than a 40 year old male who has a sedentary lifestyle.Consider your activity level, age, and sex to determine how many daily calories your need.
Try using an online calculator to determine your calorie needs. You can also ask your doctor or a dietitian.
There are also charts that you can consult for a rough estimate. These charts give an approximate number. For example, a woman between the ages of 31 and 50 who is moderately active needs 2,000 calories according to a chart provided by the University of Rochester Medical Center., The percentage of your daily calories that should come from fat may vary depending on your goals. However, keep in mind that the ideal percentage is between 20% and 35%.If you are trying to lose weight or if your doctor has recommended a low-fat diet, then you may require a lower fat diet, such as 20% or 25% fat calories.
If you are trying to gain weight, then you may require a higher fat diet, such as 30% or 35%.

, To get the number of calories from fat you can consume each day, you will need to multiply your total daily calorie limit by the percentage of fat calories that you can eat every day.Convert your percentage into a decimal for the equation by placing a decimal in front of it before you calculate.


For example, if you want 25% of your calories to come from fat, then you would use the decimal 0.25 in your equation. If you want 30% of your calories to come from fat, then you would use the decimal 0.30 in your equation.
A sample equation might look something like 2,000 X 0.25 = 500. In this example, your total calories from fat would be 500.

, To get the number of fat grams that you can consume every day to stay within your limit, you will need to divide your total calories from fat result by 9. There are 9 calories in every gram of fat, so dividing by this number will give you a fairly accurate result.A sample equation might look like 500 / 9 = 55.5. In this example, your total fat gram limit would be 55.5 grams.

, Most large libraries have digital collections of photos, news articles and more. The range of technology is large, from microfiche to a complete annotated digital collection of articles, books and more.


You may need to pay or get an account in order to use many of the online and microfiche databases. Some of the materials can only be used inside the library.

, This topic is now a part of many journalism schools. You must embrace the Internet, video and photographs as a part of your story telling, because those who master all these media are more likely to get published.

, With the phone-hacking scandals of 2011, there are new perspectives to consider about how technology can be used to steal information. Hacking and other ways of getting information do not make them credible sources, and there are serious consequences for journalists who use these tactics.

Know your weight.,
Monitor your activity levels.,
Factor in your gender.,
Know your height.Caloric recommendations are based on an individual of average height.,
Think about your age.Once you reach middle age (40 – 50 years old), your caloric needs will begin to decline relative to the average adult.,
Identify your target weight.If your ideal weight and your current weight are not identical, you will want to take steps to increase or decrease your caloric intake.",How to Know if You Need More Calories2," The best way to know your weight is to use a scale. Scales are readily available for purchase in many pharmacies and home goods stores. Step on the scale and look at the display. Most displays show your weight in both kilograms and pounds.


The best time to weigh yourself is in the morning.When you step on the scale, try to wear as little as possible. By weighing yourself the same way each time, you’ll get a more accurate understanding of your weight.
Weigh yourself daily. Mark your weight in a small notebook or spreadsheet. This way you can track changes in your weight over time. This information will help you discover if you need to take in more calories.

, If you exercise a great deal, you will need to eat more calories than the average person. If you are exceptionally sedentary, you will need fewer calories than the average person.


Tracking calorie needs using activity levels is difficult, since each person’s activity level varies, even within the same exercise. Someone who runs one mile will burn more calories than someone who walks a mile. In other words, the more intense the workout, the more calories you will need to maintain your current weight.To better track your activity levels, use an activity diary. The CDC has a template available at http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/physical_activity_diary_cdc.pdf.
There are also many apps and devices that can help you track your activity levels. For instance, the FitBit is a wearable watch-like device that can help you monitor vital stats like how far you walked, ran, or rode your bike. It also monitors how many calories you burn, and tracks other biological statistics like your heartbeat and sleeping patterns.

, Men and women have different caloric needs. If you’re trying to figure out if you should be consuming more calories, you’ll need to check recommended daily guidelines for your gender.Men usually require 2,000-3,000 calories each day.
Women usually require 1,600-2,400 calories each day.

, For women, that means that the caloric recommendations are based on the assumption that you’re 5’4’’ (162 cm). For men, the average height is 5’10’’ (178 cm). If you are shorter than the average person, your caloric intake should proportionally less than the recommended average. If you are taller than the average height, your caloric intake should be proportionally greater than the recommended average.

, This is because older people are generally more sedentary, but it also reflects changes in the metabolic rate (the rate at which the body transforms food into energy). Your caloric needs will probably continue to decline, and your overall average will likely drop again when you reach age 60 – 65.


If you are very physically active even into your older years, your caloric intake will need to remain high.

, Your ideal weight should be within the healthy range relative to your height, age, and sex.


If, for instance, your target weight is less than your current weight, you’ll need to consume fewer calories while maintaining or increasing your level of physical activity.
If you want to gain weight, you should increase your caloric intake while reducing or maintaining your current level of physical activity.
To better track your caloric intake, use a food diary. The CDC has a food diary template available at http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/food_diary_cdc.pdf.
Don’t take caloric recommendations as gospel. Both men and women might need more or less calories than what is recommended. Use these recommendations as guidelines only.

Eat more frequently.,
Choose healthy high-calorie snacks.,
Eat larger meals.While snacking is the most obvious way to get some added calories into your diet throughout the day, you can add calories to your actual meals, too.,
Try quinoa.,
Use peanut butter.",How to Know if You Need More Calories3," Instead of just three meals a day, eat snacks between meals.Try to eat as often as possible until your caloric intake or weight rises to the point where you want it. Tasty snacks that might help you consume more calories include:


Baked sweet potato fries
Crunchy carrots with hummus
Apple slices with caramel dip
Rice cakes

, Snacks like trail mix (nuts, raisins, granola, and chocolate nibs), dried fruit, and starchy vegetables like potatoes will help you boost your daily calorie count.There are lots of high-calorie snacks out there that are not healthy. Cheesy snacks, potato chips, and processed pastries are loaded with calories but not much else. Instead, stick to healthy high-calorie snacks, which also provide essential nutrients.

, Just serve yourself an extra helping of whatever your favorite part of the meal is. For instance, an additional scoop of mashed potatoes or an extra ladleful of soup will add more calories to your diet. Remember, every little bit counts.

, Quinoa is a healthy grain loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and protein. Just one cup (cooked) has 222 calories.Eat it the same way you would eat rice. Quinoa pairs well with steamed broccoli and cauliflower, and makes a good ingredient in tacos and burritos.

, Peanut butter has 100 calories per tablespoon, so if you’re trying to increase your calorie count, it’s the perfect choice.It works especially well on toast and cinnamon raisin bagels. And you can’t go wrong with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Try heating your peanut butter over the stove and mixing with a few tablespoons of water to create a savory Thai-inspired peanut sauce for rice and noodles.

Eat a healthy breakfast.Start your day off right with a filling breakfast packed with complex carbs and fiber.,
Eat protein.Lean, healthy proteins like nuts, seeds, soy, tofu, and legumes can help you stay fuller longer.,
Eat more fiber.Fiber can also increase feelings of satiety.,
Be mindful when eating.Mindfulness in eating refers to the habit of focusing on your food, the taste of it in your mouth, and the experience of chewing.,
Don’t equate calories with fullness.Eating more calories does not mean you’ll feel more satisfied after eating.",How to Know if You Need More Calories4," Compared with high-fat breakfasts, high-carb and high-fiber breakfasts will leave you feeling full longer. With the right breakfast, you will be less inclined to snack throughout the day, and eat less during lunch and dinner.


There are many ways to achieve a healthy, high-carb, high-fiber breakfast. For instance, one cup of orange juice, one banana, and two slices of whole grain toast with two teaspoons of peanut butter will give you about 500 calories.

, These foods have high fiber, fat, and protein content, all of which have been proven to increase satiety (the feeling of fullness after eating).


Animal protein — eggs, meat, and dairy products — will also help you feel full, but is associated with many negative health impacts like high levels of cholesterol, cancer, and heart disease. Avoid these protein sources or limit them to just a few times each week.
Don’t overdo it with protein. Too much can leach calcium from your bones.
Most people need only about 40 – 50 grams of protein each day. Use the USDA’s online calculator at https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/ to figure out how much protein you should be consuming.

, A healthy diet based on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables will have plenty of fiber. Fruit is loaded with fiber. Try strawberries, blueberries, and honeydew melon for dessert or as a snack.


Also, choose whole grains whenever possible. Don’t just get whole grain bread — try whole grain pasta, too.
Air-popped popcorn is also a great source of fiber.

, Instead of sitting down in front of the TV or computer when you work, focus exclusively on your meal. This will help you have the most satisfying meal possible.


Chew slowly and deliberately. Chewing at least eight times per bite will elicit feelings of fullness faster than if you chew quickly.
After you’ve eaten, reflect periodically on the meal and think about how delicious it was. What was your favorite part of the meal? What did it taste like? Think about these questions will help you recall the sensation of eating, and you will stay full longer.

, In other words, you might attain the same feelings of fullness whether you eat 500 calories or 700 calories in a meal. If you want to lose weight, try to cut the calories in your foods by adding vegetables or substituting high-calorie ingredients for low-calorie versions.


For instance, use soy milk for cow’s milk when making smoothies or pasta sauce.
Add a side of vegetables to your meal instead of a side of greasy potato chips.

, People use their cell phones and cameras to document news as it happens. You can employ older research techniques to track down these accounts, and get your news straight from eye-witnesses.

, At 1 time, newspapers may have written editorials or readers would have written letters to the editor of the paper. Now, almost anyone can write a comment on your piece.


In many cases, the more comments that you get on your article, the more in tune it is with what is important to readers today. It is important to have a good Internet moderator, to ensure inappropriate comments are removed so your article can be shared.

, Although most people research their information on wikipedia, it is important for a journalist to pay to access professional or scientific journals, top quality encyclopedias, census material and more. Do not cut corners on citing sources or researching online databases.


There is a reason many top-quality sources make you pay or have subscriptions. They understand the value of good quality information. You may be able to expense it as part of your business costs.

, You can post your work or put links to it. Blogging about writing or journalism on your website may make you a more marketable journalist.

, Gather video sources or photos as well as first hand accounts. Journalism is changing, which means that you can be at the forefront of a new way to deliver news online.

Organize your material according to the “inverted pyramid.” Assume that your reader will quit reading before they reach the end of your story.,
Write a strong lead.,
Give more background after the lead.,
Include a quote early on.,
Write short paragraphs.,
Finish with interesting but inessential info.",How to Write a Hard News Article1," Load the beginning of your article with the most essential facts so they still get the gist of it. Imagine a pyramid flipped upside down, with its widest part is on top. Aim to fill that space with all of the essentials, and then taper off with less relevant info as you reach the narrowest point at the bottom.The inverted pyramid is especially important for online content, since its readers are less likely to read a story in full. Also, having the most relevant information at the beginning increases the story’s chances of popping in keyword searches.This technique is also referred as “front-loading.”;
, Aim to hook your audience into reading further. At the same time, provide them with a condensed version of the story right up front in case they move on. Include the five W’s and one H in your first paragraph: who, what, when, where, why, and how. To present the essence of the story all at once, address them all in the very first sentence (known as the “summary” or “hard news” lead). To tantalize the reader into reading more, experiment by breaking them up over the first and second.Summary lead: “More than 200 firefighters fought a six-alarm fire that destroyed 36 homes and six businesses on Myrtle Avenue in the Ridgewood section of Queens late Sunday night.”

Experimental lead: “Residents of Queens watched on in horror as more than 200 firefighters fought a six-alarm blaze in Ridgewood late Sunday night. The fire tore through six buildings along Myrtle Avenue, destroying a half-dozen businesses and 36 overhead apartments.”
”Leads” may also be spelled as “ledes” in the news industry., Use your first paragraph to provide the most basic info. From there, flesh out the story in more detail. Continue presenting the facts in order of the most relevant. For example:""What began as a grease fire in the kitchen of Tony’s Restaurant at 1411 Myrtle Ave quickly spread to neighboring buildings due to Sunday’s high winds.""
""The M train’s elevated tracks along this stretch of Myrtle Ave further impeded firefighters’ ability to access the burning rooftops.""
""The NYFD evacuated the entire block immediately upon arrival in case the blaze spread any further.""

, Give your reader someone to relate to. Introduce a witness or source within the first few paragraphs. Continue to pepper your story with the voices of people who played a part in and/or were directly affected by its events. For example:“'I just got home from work and went straight to bed,' said Maria Sanchez, resident of 1421 Myrtle. 'Then all of a sudden my husband’s shaking me back awake and saying that the whole block is burning down.'”
“'This is the worst fire this neighborhood has had in some time,' said Fire Commissioner Joseph Hernandez.""

, Remember that your reader is likely to skim the article before deciding on whether or not they will read it.Make your text easy to skim by avoiding long paragraphs. Stick to a maximum of two sentences each, or even just a single sentence.To further avoid large blocks of text, keep your sentences short as well. Use 30 words or less per sentence. Rewrite any dependent clauses so that each one becomes its own sentence.Paragraphs may be referred to as “graphs” in news reporting.

, Conclude your article with a quote or angle that fleshes the story out a little bit more. However, make sure that this info isn’t critical for the reader to know in order to understand the whole story. Expect the very end of your article to be cut to save space if need be.Reread the whole article, minus your last couple of paragraphs, to verify that it still makes sense without the additional info.
If key information is lost, rewrite the article to include that information toward the beginning.
An example of a fitting end that could be cut if needed: “‘My brother’s been letting me crash here with him after my last landlord sold my old building to developers,’ said Brian Guiliano, 27, whose brother, Vincent, lately resided right next-door to Tony’s Restaurant. ‘I don’t know where I’m supposed to go now.’”

Cover some events without credentials.,
Get one through your employer.,
Contact the event organizer.,
Follow the guidelines.",How to Get Press Credentials1," You only need credentials to cover private events. In other words, for any event that is in a public space, you can cover it without credentials., If you work for a newspaper or other type of media, your employer will usually issue an identification that shows you are with that company. That won't get you into every event, but it does provide information about you to people who need it.If you are a freelancer, you can ask for a press identification from one of your employers, or pick one of the many freelancing sites that offer credentials for anyone who works in the media., To get into specific events, you will need press passes for those events, issued by the event organizer. Either you or your editor will need to request passes for the event.The first question the organizers are going to ask is who you represent. They want to know that the photos you take will help publicize their event or person they represent.If you don't represent anyone in particular, you may still be able to gain access as long as you show you are a freelancer who covers similar events.That may mean you need to start out at smaller venues with easier access.Be sure you read the fine print. For instance, if you gain credentials, you may be giving away any copyrights to the photos to the event holders., With the pass, you may be allowed access to certain areas the general public isn't allowed. Stay within the guidelines outlined by the pass. Otherwise, your pass may be revoked, and you may have trouble getting one in the future."

Have each quote stand by itself.,
Aim for accuracy.,
Know when to paraphrase.,
Use neutral terminology.,
Cite sources.",How to Write a Hard News Article2," Structure each one as its own sentence. Avoid using a partial quote as a building block for one of your own sentences. Allow the quote to speak for itself, rather than explaining what the speaker meant by it. Good example: “This was one of the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Richard Sloan, firefighter.

Bad example: The six-alarm fire was “one of the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Richard Sloan, firefighter.

, When possible, use the speaker’s exact words as spoken. Refrain from editing grammar. If their original quote is structured in a way that makes it hard for the reader to understand, make your edits visible. Use ellipses to mark where original content has been cut. If you need to substitute one word for another in order to clarify the context, bracket your substitutions to show that these are your words, not the speaker’s.For example, say that your original quote reads, “I only had my underwear on. I was just sitting there watching TV. Then the firemen started knocking on doors. When they knocked on mine, they, you know, they told me not to waste time, just come now, so I ran out in just that. Some kind lady on the street saw me, ran home, brought me back her bathrobe.”
Now say that, due to space, you only want to use: “When they knocked on mine, they, you know, they told me not to waste time, just come now, so I ran out in just that. Some kind lady on the street saw me, ran home, brought me back her bathrobe.”
Edit the quote so it reads: “When knocked on , they … told me not to waste time, just come now, so I ran out in just . Some kind lady on the street saw me, ran home, brought me back her bathrobe.”

, Use direct quotes only to spice up your story with unique observations, rather than rely on them to establish basic facts. If a quote provides only the fundamentals of the story (like the five W’s and one H), paraphrase it into a sentence of your own, then attribute it to its source. Omit quotation marks for paraphrased quotes.A good direct quote: “One second it was just Tony’s on fire. Then it was like I just blinked and then whoosh, all the other buildings were up in flames, too,” said Brianna Johnson, neighbor.

A quote that should be paraphrased: “The fire spread quickly because of last night’s high winds,” said Fire Commissioner Joesph Hernandez.

A paraphrased quote: Sunday night’s high winds caused the fire to spread swiftly, said Fire Commissioner Joesph Hernandez.

, When quoting a source directly, stick with the verb “said.” Understand that a hard news article should aim to be objective in its presentation of the facts. With that in mind, expect most synonyms for the word “said” to suggest that the speaker is doing more than simply making a statement. Let the speaker’s words speak for themselves, rather than define them further with more specific verbs.Synonyms to avoid include: admit, announce, argue, claim, declare, insist, promise, pronounce, reply, retort, shout, and vow.
Use the term “according to” if your source agrees to provide information, but refuses to be quoted.
Also use “according to” when referencing documents.

, Always identify the speaker when using direct or paraphrased quotes. Additionally, cite your source for any new information that hasn’t already been reported.If your source wishes to remain unidentified, you should still attribute their info to “an anonymous source.”


If you attribute multiple pieces of info to one source, include their full name plus any relevant title the first time you mention them (“Fire Commissioner Joesph Hernandez”). After that, only use their last name (“Hernandez”) and the appropriate prefix (here, “Mr.”) if required. Some news outlets may prefer using the last name without a prefix.
When composing a paragraph, avoid sticking other material in between two pieces of info from a single source. Doing so will force you to cite your source twice in one paragraph, which will sound repetitive.
The only times you do not need to attribute information to a direct source are: if you yourself are an eyewitness; if you are able to prove that the info is true; if the info is already public knowledge; or if three other publications have already reported it to be true.

Write your own leads to other writers’ stories.,
Maintain a neutral voice.,
Use as few words as possible.",How to Write a Hard News Article3," Ask someone to cut-and-paste all but the lead paragraph of an online story into a new word document, or have them clip the lead graph out of a newspaper. Read the remainder of the story and glean as many details as you can. Using those, write your own lead with the aim of condensing the most important facts into one or two sentences. After that, read the original lead to see how well yours measures up to it.If the original writer followed the inverted pyramid, there may be info in the original lead that isn’t repeated in the text that you read. Don’t worry if your lead doesn’t include that precise info. Compare your lead to the original only to see how well each one summarizes the text that follows.

, Remember that hard news aims to report the bare facts objectively, nothing more.To practice objectivity, cover an event that touches on a subject that you feel passionate about (such as a presidential debate or football game in which you strongly favor one side over the other). Write an article about it. Then have someone read it and/or proofread it yourself to spot any instances where your personal opinion shows itself.


Look for adjectives and verbs that overstate what actually happened. For example, describing your favorite quarterback’s performance as “amazing” is unwarranted if all of their plays went by the book.
Watch out for words with loaded meanings that suggest bias. For instance, if you are writing about a crime, avoid using terms like “thug” to describe the perpetrator, since this implies a judgment on your part.
Check to see if you have represented all sides fairly. If you are covering a political debate, for example, make sure you haven’t just highlighted all of your favorite candidate’s high points and all of their opponent’s low points.

, Proofread your article (or even pieces by other writers’) to identify any words or sentences that could be cut without losing the story’s essence. If possible, rephrase necessary facts that could be described in a single word. Shift impressive but unnecessary details toward the end, where they can be cut by editors if necessary without upsetting the article’s flow.Use active verbs instead of passive ones. For example, “The candidate visits New York today,” instead of, “The candidate is visiting New York today.”
Identify clunky word structure and run-on sentences by reading the article out loud.
Use Twitter or the word-count feature to train yourself to write short, crisp sentences."

Wait for your credentials.,
Follow police officers' instructions.",How to Get Press Credentials2," Every city's regulations about press credentials vary a little bit. Generally, you need press credentials from the police department to cover news events. That is, if you want to get behind the scenes to take pictures, talk to people, and gather information, you are probably going to need credentials of some sort from the police department. Therefore, start by contacting your city's police department or searching the department's website for information., In some cities, such as New York City, you will need to schedule an appointment to begin or renew your press credentials with the city. You will need to talk to a police officer or someone in the department who will verify that you are with the media., You will need to file an application with the city that provides basic biographical information, along with information about the nature of your work. The city will likely want to know about who you have worked for and what you have covered in the past.Often, you will need to pay a fee along with your application., Most departments require you to prove that you are in the media. To do so, you must provide examples of articles, books, blogs, or other media to show that you need access to crime scenes to continue your work. Most require that these examples be recent. For instance, in Los Angeles, they need to be in the last three months.If you are a new applicant, talk to the department about what you need to get credentials without having examples., If you freelance for different outlets, you may need letters stating that you have written for particular news outlets recently. These letters can be fairly basic, and your news outlets should be happy to provide them., Most of the time, you will, at least, be provided with a photo identification card. In addition, you may be provided with a special identification to place in your car, as well.Remember that only you are allowed to use these pieces of identification. They may be taken away if other people use them., Even with press credentials, you will likely not be let on certain crime scenes or in certain areas. Follow all orders given by the police officers on duty, or your credentials could be revoked."

Alternatively, you can go down to the court in person.Similarly, you may need special credentials if you are wanting to visit the state or federal legislative bodies while they are in session., Many courts and government bodies require a special pass, while others will let you in as long as you have a government-issued ID.Also, the website should address whether only members of traditional media are allowed in. Sometimes, bloggers and other social media members are excluded from access., If you need credentials, fill in the appropriate application. You will need to fill in biographical information, as well as information about who you work for or where you generally produce content. In addition, you may need to provide information about whether your organization is affiliated with a political party, whether you are a paid lobbyist or not, and other activities you may have been involved in with the government body., In some cases, you may need to contact the media person for the organization directly, in addition to filling out the form. Usually, this information is provided prominently on the organization's website., Government bodies have very particular rules about where the press can be, what kind of photography and videos they can take, and what times press are allowed in.

Be a good leader for your organization.",How to Become an Editor in Chief," There are editors-in-chief for all kinds of publications, from magazines to newspapers to blogs to book publishers. Determine which of these is most appealing. The sets of skills needed by editors-in-chief are typically transferable among various writing industries, from print and online newspapers to magazines and academic publishers. Once you get to the executive level, however, you are an expert in one particular industry and you will probably need to stay in that industry to become editor-in-chief.;
, Do research about the industry and identify some key organizations that are most appealing to you as potential employers. Focus on trends in the industry, as well as successful and unsuccessful models.

, Most publications will require a bachelor’s degree (or higher) in journalism, mass communication, business or similar for executive level positions. For some publications, however, journalism degrees are not the most appropriate. For example, if you want to be editor-in-chief of a fashion magazine, attend fashion school instead.You should also consider location when determining the best program. Access to internships is easier in urban locations, and certain types of publications may be centered in some cities over others. For example, fashion magazines are probably more prevalent in New York City, whereas entertainment magazines may be more prevalent in Los Angeles.


A prestigious program may expose you to more opportunities or connections with higher-profile individuals or organizations. But smaller schools do not eliminate you from higher positions. In fact, smaller programs may give you more opportunities to take leadership roles because there might be less competition.
If you have a bachelor’s degree in another field, you are not immediately discounted from becoming an editor-in-chief. You might build on your bachelor’s degree with a master’s degree, or you might have years of professional industry experience that will substitute for a certain educational background.

, No matter the type of writing, writing will help you hone your skills, find your voice, and become comfortable with writing quickly in many styles. Strike a balance in your writing between creativity, function, and effective communication. Try to refrain from being verbose or inaccessible in your writing. Think about your audience and write dramatic, appealing articles that are compelling, no matter the subject.


Seek out feedback on your writing. What might be clear or dynamic for you may be confusing or muddled to others.

, Being a good writer, and ultimately a good editor-in-chief, means being well-read. Read other people’s writing with a critical eye, recognizing what works and what doesn’t work. Read all types of material, from dense novels to magazine articles to blog entries. It is especially important to be well-read in your field; if you aspire to be the editor-in-chief of a scientific magazine, for example, make sure you read constantly about developments in your field.

, This involves reviewing writing for consistency, quality, tone and style.In addition, you need to be able to judge whether or not the writer used valid, reliable sources. Maintain a balance between editing a piece to reflect the voice of the publication and the voice of the author. You will need to be able to give constructive criticism. Be brutally honest with your writer. Acknowledge positive aspects of your writers’ work first and give concrete suggestions on how to change problematic or unclear writing. Develop good relationships with your writers, who depend on you for guidance and mentorship.


Keep in mind that a writer’s project is still the writer’s project. Do not let your ego overwhelm your editing.

, Start with learning AP style, which is an industry standard for writers and editors.You will likely need to also be very familiar with other citations styles, such as APA, Chicago, MLA and others. As you work your way up the professional editor ladder, you will likely be responsible for knowing some of these styles inside and out.

, There are very few publications that don’t have a digital presence to accompany their print versions. There are many online-only publications, but having an understanding about print will help you position yourself as a versatile worker.

, Your skill set shouldn’t just include technical skills. You also need to be someone who can work well as part of a team and as an individual. Having a positive and optimistic attitude will benefit you at every step of the way.Also have a dose of pragmatism: be realistic about what you can accomplish in a particular time frame, and what you can expect from other people.

, Identifying trends that suit your publication’s editorial style will provide you with story ideas that can then be assigned to writers.This will help your publication be an industry leader and authoritative voice that attracts more audiences.

, Getting an internship at a magazine, newspaper, website or book publisher is a great way to start making contacts, gain experience and learn about the business. Smaller companies may offer more opportunities to do more, while larger companies may be more prestigious on your resume. Target specific companies in which you are interested and contact their human resources departments to inquire about internships. Alternately, visit a career counselor at a university to get suggestions that will best suit your interests and skill set. Searching online or print job listings may also turn up internships.


Internships are often offered as unpaid jobs. They may offer college credit in return, but they can also be quite burdensome financially for someone who is looking to get started in the industry. Be aware of regulations around unpaid internships.There has been a lot of debate about whether it is a legal practice, as many internships are merely methods to reducing labor costs. Generally, internships should be beneficial to the intern, resulting in a quality educational experience (i.e., not just getting coffee for your boss), and interns should not displace regular staff.

, Smaller publications might have smaller audiences, lower budgets and narrower reach, and they are often very niche-oriented (hobbyist publications, for example). These typically have a smaller staff, which may mean that all positions need to take on more responsibility. This will enable you to get valuable experience in a leadership role and to work your way up the ladder. You may become the editor-in-chief sooner than if you were at a larger publication. Alternately, you may then be able to transfer to a larger-sized publication.


Smaller-sized publications are by no means the “easier route.” They can be tougher, because often they do not come with a legacy audience; rather they may need to build up their audiences from scratch. They may also struggle with finances more, which means an editor-in-chief must be inventive and savvy in strategizing how to help the publication survive.

, You might start as a writer, copy editor or editorial assistant. As you get more experience and build your skills, you might be promoted to assistant editor, associate editor, senior editor, or managing editor. Keep in mind that these titles all vary by industry and do not necessarily have the exact same job duties across the board.

, It is easier than ever to start an online publication and you have the discretion to designate yourself as editor-in-chief. If you have a compelling vision and good writing skills, you can start a publication on your own. Declare yourself editor-in-chief. Without the formal structure of an established organization, you might feel that you’re not qualified for the top position or that you’re just pretending to be an editor. Project self-confidence, own your publication’s vision, promote your content, and BE the editor-in-chief.Be prepared to do it all yourself. You may be able to get other writers or editors to contribute to your own publication, but if you are starting up without any capital (or very little), you may not have any additional finances to pay staff. Similarly, you may have to work for free yourself. You may have to write all of the content, be the web designer, solicit advertisers (if you decide to go this route), and promote your publication to its intended audience.

, An informational interview is an informal conversation with someone who can give you insight into a company or industry. This is not an interview for a job, nor should you expect to learn of job openings. Rather, these are opportunities to make contacts and gather advice about the state of the field and a particular company’s place in the field. You may also learn about career paths that you hadn’t previously considered.Schedule the appointment for a time and place that is most convenient to the professional you want to meet. Be considerate of their time; they may be missing their lunch hour to meet with you.
Do your research in advance. Find out all you can about the company, its executives, its work culture, and the individual you are interviewing. Prepare questions in advance. While you are not looking for a job with this company, you should still come across as professional and serious. Wear business attire and maintain a professional attitude throughout.
Follow up the informational interview with a thank-you note. A carefully crafted and proofread email is probably fine for this purpose. Make sure you use formal salutations and thank them for their time and advice.

, Find people who want you to succeed. Try to steer clear of those who want to see you fail. You will run into obstacles along the way to your career goals, and people who want to help you will keep you going. Allies are people whose judgment you trust, who will be honest with you, and who thinks you are a great asset to your industry., This community will be both your professional community (other editors and writers) and your community-at-large (charities, social events, etc.). Expanding your circle of acquaintances and increasing your visibility will contribute to your overall profile as a leader, expert and mentor.

, There are a number of trade and industry associations whose members consist of professionals in similar lines of work. For editors at various levels, there are organizations like the American Society of Magazine, EditorsAmerican Copy Editors Society,Council of Science Editors,and so on. These associations offer great networking opportunities, conferences, professional development workshops, career resources, and research materials., The new position might be more demanding, requiring more public or community events, more executive or board meetings, more travel, and so on. Consider how this job will fit into your lifestyle and how it might impact your family.

, Carefully read the job posting and understand all parts that are required. Craft an eloquent yet concise letter of application that details your qualifications for the job. Include your resume that expands on the duties and skills that you have. You may also be required to submit supplemental materials, such as a strategic vision for the publication or company. Submit your application according to the instructions in the job posting.


If you are already working at the company that has the editor-in-chief vacancy, you may want to talk with your superior about your interest in the position. Do not assume that you will be automatically selected for the position. At this level of executive position, companies want to get the best person for the job; this is the person with the most applicable skills but also the person who may bring innovation and leadership to keep moving the publication forward.
You may be working within a competitive environment in which you have a close working relationship with others who are applying for the same job. Or, you might be moving from one organization to another, and you might not want to tell your manager, audience, clients or writers that you are thinking of moving. Be sensitive and confidential when talking about the job posting.

, Schedule your interview for a time that is mutually convenient for you and the interviewers. You may need to be somewhat flexible and be prepared to dedicate an entire day (or more) to the initial round of interviews. Executive level positions will likely include several interviews and/or interviewers; these may include meeting with the publisher, board of directors, and staff. These might also take place at a company’s headquarters, which might require travel (and time off from your current job).


Expect several rounds of interviews if you are being seriously considered for the position.

, If you have successfully presented yourself as an exceptional choice for editor-in-chief, you will hopefully be offered the job. Congratulations! In your negotiations in the job offer, you will have the chance to negotiate your salary. The starting salary for an editor-in-chief in 2014 is, on average, $70,220. This is the average across many industries and markets, so you should be familiar with your own industry and market in order to determine the most appropriate salary.

, You are taking the reins of the publication. Your leadership, creativity, and innovation will determine how well you perform in your job and how well your publication performs and succeeds.

Familiarize yourself with your publication’s style guide.,
Skim the article to get a feel for its organization.,
Give the article a quick, once-over read.,
Reread the article and take notes.,

Outline your review.,
Write your review’s first draft.,
Revise your draft before submitting it.",How to Review a Journal Article," If you’re publishing your review, check the journal’s format and style guidelines first. Familiarizing yourself with the publication’s standards will give you an idea of how to evaluate the article and structure your review.Familiarizing yourself with format and style guidelines is especially important if you haven’t published with that journal in the past. For example, a journal might require you to recommend an article for publication, meet a certain word count, or provide revisions that the authors should make.
If you’re reviewing a journal article for a school assignment, familiarize yourself the guidelines your instructor provided.;
, First, look through the journal article and try to trace its logic. Read the title, abstract, and headings to get a feel for how the article is organized. In this initial, quick skim, identify the question or problem that the article addresses., After a quick skim, read the article from beginning to end to develop an overall impression. At this stage, identify the article’s thesis, or main argument, and highlight or underline where its stated in the introduction and conclusion., After reading it in full, scrutinize the article section by section. You can print out a copy and write notes and comments in the margins. If you prefer working with a digital copy, write your notes and comments in a word document.While giving the article a closer read, gauge whether and how well the article resolves its central problem. Ask yourself, “Is this investigation important, and does it uniquely contribute to its field?”
At this stage, note any terminological inconsistencies, organizational problems, typos, and formatting issues.

, Examine the abstract and introduction in detail. Ask yourself the following:How well does the abstract summarize the article, the problem it addresses, its techniques, results, and significance? For example, you might find that an abstract describes a pharmaceutical study's topic and skips to results without discussing the experiment's methods with much detail.
Does the introduction map out the article’s structure? Does it clearly lay out the groundwork? A good introduction gives you a clear idea of what to expect in the coming sections. It might state the problem and hypothesis, briefly describe the investigation's methods, then state whether the experiment proved or disproved the hypothesis.

, Most journal articles include a review of existing literature early on and, throughout, cite previous scholarly work. Determine if the sources it references are authoritative, how well its literature review summarizes sources, and whether the sources situate the article in a field of research or simply drop well-known names.If necessary, spend some time perusing copies of the article’s sources so you can better understand the topic’s existing literature.
A good literature review will say something like, ""Smith and Jones, in their authoritative 2015 study, demonstrated that adult men and women responded favorably to the treatment. However, no research on the topic has examined the technique's effects and safety in children and adolescents, which is what we sought to explore in our current work.""

, Ask yourself, “Are these methods an appropriate, reasonable means of solving the problem?” Imagine other possible ways of setting up an experiment or structuring an investigation, and note any improvements the authors could have made.For example, you might observe that subjects in medical study didn’t accurately represent a diverse population.

, Decide whether tables, diagrams, legends, and other visual aids effectively organize information. Do the results and discussion sections clearly summarize and interpret the data? Are tables and figures purposeful or redundant?For example, you might find that tables list too much undigested data that the authors don’t adequately summarize within the text.

, For non-scientific articles, decide how well the article presents the evidence that supports its argument. Is the evidence relevant, and does the article convincingly analyze and interpret the evidence?For example, if you’re reviewing an art history article, decide whether it analyzes an artwork reasonably or simply leaps to conclusions. A reasonable analysis might argue, “The artist was a member of Rembrandt’s workshop, which is evident in the painting’s dramatic light and sensual texture.”

, Even if it's meant for a specialized audience, an article’s writing style should be clear, concise, and correct. Evaluate style by asking yourself the following:Is the language clear and unambiguous, or does excessive jargon interfere with its ability to make an argument?
Are there places that are too wordy? Can any ideas be stated in a simpler way?
Are grammar, punctuation, and terminology correct?

, Look over the notes you took in your section-by-section evaluation. Come up with a thesis, then outline how you intend to support your thesis in the body of your review. Include specific examples that reference the strengths and weaknesses that you noted in your evaluation.Your thesis and evidence should be constructive and thoughtful. Point out both strengths and weaknesses, and propose alternative solutions instead of focusing only on weaknesses.A good, constructive thesis would be, “The article demonstrates that the drug works better than a placebo in specific demographics, but future research that includes a more diverse subject sampling is necessary.”

, After forming a thesis and making an outline, you’re ready to start composing your review. While the structure will depend on your publication’s guidelines, you can typically follow these general guidelines:The introduction summarizes the article and states your thesis.
The body provides specific examples from the text that support your thesis.
The conclusion summarizes your review, restates your thesis, and offers suggestion for future research.

, After writing your first draft, check for typos and make sure your grammar and punctuation are correct. Try to read your work as if you were someone else. Is your critique fair and balanced, and do the examples you included support your argument?Make sure your writing is clear, concise, and logical. If you mention that an article is too verbose, your own writing shouldn’t be full of unnecessarily complicated terms and sentences.
If possible, have someone familiar with the topic read your draft and offer feedback.

Write for a school newspaper.",How to Become a Sports Journalist1," One way you can hone your writing skills is by starting your own blog. First, decide what your blog will focus on.

Then, choose a blogging platform and begin blogging.Since your interest is in sports journalism, start a sports blog detailing commentary, highlights, and results from sporting events you attend. Also, fill your blog with stories and interviews you have conducted with athletes and coaches.;
, Reading also helps improve writing skills.

Reading the work of professional sports journalists will expose you to the writing styles, content, and the ingenuity that is needed to be a successful sports journalist., You can get additional writing practice by writing for your school newspaper or for a local newsletter and/or column. Attend school sporting events and write columns detailing what happened during the event, who played well, and how the team did, for example. If you can, also conduct interviews with the players and coaches to report on in your column.

Become an editor.",How to Become a Music Journalist," The first thing you should do once you’ve decided to begin a career in music journalism is begin building experience doing the thing you want to do: writing about music. Draft up reviews of your favorite albums and record your thoughts on live shows. Develop an eye for detail and take your own work seriously, even if you’re only doing it on an amateur level.Think of your early reviews as training. Aim to express your ideas in a clear and engaging way. Make each and every piece say something, even if no one is reading it.
The more you know about the music you’re reviewing, the better. With a greater scope of knowledge, you’ll be able to better make objective criticisms and comparisons and zero in on what’s good and bad about a song, album or performance.;
, Journalism is a round-the-clock job—the same holds true for critics in the music industry. When you’re not writing about music, you should be researching it. Stay up to date on the activities of major artists, pay attention to big announcements and pick up new releases when they come out. When researching news of the music world, you’re mining for material to use in your work.Research is an important part of any journalist’s daily duties, and may be even more time-consuming than actually writing.

, Become an avid reader of the big print reviewers like Rolling Stone, as well as online publications such as Pitchfork and Stereogum. These news outlets will give you an idea of the style and content that editors are looking for. You’ll also learn more about music in the process, helping you on your way to becoming an expert in your craft.The articles that get published in influential sources tend to be the best of their kind. What stands out to you about their style and message? What do they seem to have in common?
Be on the lookout for career openings with the publications you read.

, Consider enrolling in a writing-focused bachelor’s program at your local community college or university. While it’s not strictly necessary to hold a degree in order to succeed as a music critic, it will only add to your credentials. The type of work you do in school will also hone your language skills and may even provide opportunities to make contacts that will be able to help you out in the future.If a hiring choice ever comes down to you or someone else, having a degree might be just the edge you need to win out.
Decide whether the time and expense of going to school would be worth it to you, or if you’d be better off using your energy to build practical experience. Many notable music journalists have risen to the top of their field without the benefit of a college degree., Write a lot. Practice makes perfect. Concentrate on composing clips (critical pieces that include reviews, interviews, features and editorials) with a concise, punchy style that will grab people’s attention and make them take note. Learn how to write fast to simulate working under a deadline. Resume listings are a bonus, but nothing matters more to the hiring directors at music publications than how solid a contributor’s writing is.Observe what you like about the articles you read on prestigious websites and magazines and try to incorporate those traits into your own writing.
Your writing should say something unique about the music itself.

, As soon as you’ve begun writing clips, compile them into a portfolio that you can show off to interested parties. Having samples of your work collected in one place makes it easy for prospective employers to assess your style and determine whether you would be a good fit for their publication. Choose your strongest work to go into your portfolio. Once you start applying for work, you can send in selections to go along with your work experience.Start a blog. The majority of music journalism is conducted via the internet these days. A well-designed, popular blog with a memorable title that’s full of good writing will serve as a commending portfolio itself.It’s fine if most of your writing is published online, but having physical copies of your work that you can hand out is a definite advantage.

, Establish a reputation in your town by putting yourself on the frontlines of your local music scene. Be in attendance at every show you can and be sure to jot down your thoughts. This is a great way to start meeting other journalists, music managers and even artists themselves. Some cities even have small periodicals that specialize in covering local musicians and venues. Working for or with one of the periodicals would be a great way to break into the business.If a publication worth writing for doesn’t exist in your area, create one yourself. Zines are still fairly popular in niche and underground music scenes, and you can circulate them where you think they’ll get the most attention., When you think your work is good enough to be read by a larger audience, ship it off to the submissions departments of various music news outlets. This can include print sources and online publications. Tell them a little about yourself and your passion, and be sure to include samples of the clips you’ve worked on. If an editor thinks you would make an asset to the publication, they’ll most likely hire you.Know who to get in contact with and where to send your work.

It will highlight your ambition and make it clear that you’re willing to do what it takes to get where you want to be.

, Forge friendly professional relationships with the people that you come into contact with while getting your start.

Be eager to perform favors for people whenever you have the chance. They may be able to return the favor by giving you a leg up.
Do your best to make a good impression. People remember who they like… and who they dislike.

"
Become a sports expert.,
Apply for a sports writing internship.,
Find a niche.",How to Become a Sports Journalist3," In order to write about sports, you need to be an expert in all things related to sports. There are several things you can do in order to develop a broad knowledge base. First, watch and attend as many sports games as you can. Practice memorizing coach and player names and positions on the team. Also, watch and take notes on interviews with players and coaches in order to learn the kinds of questions journalists ask.


You can also become an expert by joining a team. By joining a team, you will become familiar with the actual mechanics of the sport, like the game's rules, the player's positions, and strategies used by players and coaches to win games. This will enable you to write more candidly about the sport as a journalist.

Network and maintain relationships.",How to Become a Sports Journalist4," Sports journalism is a competitive job market. While an internship can give you an edge, doing freelance work while you are searching for a more stable job can enhance your resume. Find freelance work by contacting websites, magazines, newspapers, and radio stations that have regular sports reports. Come up with several writing pitches, and e-mail your best ideas to the editor of the blog, magazine, or newspaper. Do this regularly. Once you start publishing regularly, you will be able to develop a writing portfolio.

, Once you have published several well-written pieces, begin compiling your best pieces for your portfolio. You do not need to include all your writing pieces. A few solid articles are better than a lot of mediocre pieces. Your writing pieces should represent you and your writing interests. If you have several pieces that cover different sports, categorize them as such. For example, have a separate category for football, tennis, and soccer.The number of writing pieces to include varies; some jobs will specifically request a certain size portfolio. As you put yours together, be sure to include at least 8 to 10 strong pieces.
Your portfolio should also have a brief biography detailing who you are, why you are passionate about sports writing, and why you are a great fit for the job.

, Before you go to a job interview, take time to learn about the company. Also, be ready to give examples of some of your outstanding writing pieces, and remember to bring your portfolio.


Brainstorm different writing ideas and angles before you go into the interview, and make a list of your top three.

, Remember to network during your undergraduate studies, internship, and freelancing experience. Create relationships with your supervisor and other writers. These relationships can lead to job opportunities in the future. You can create relationships with your supervisor by being proactive and by creating quality-writing pieces.


Remember to showcase your stuff. Post your best writing on social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook.

Some journalists can be successful without having earned a degree in journalism; though this is the case, having such a degree may facilitate a successful career.Consider doing a double major in journalism and another field if your university offers such a double major. Consider choosing something “wildly different” from journalism in order to diversify yourself.For aspiring legal journalists, the most appropriate second major would be a law-related field.
If you are studying at a university that offers law as an undergraduate degree (e.g. most universities in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), then pursue law and journalism as dual degrees if offered by your university.
If you are studying at a university in the United States, where law is a graduate level degree, then consider doing a ‘pre-law’ or ‘legal studies’ program if your university offers one along with your journalism degree. Note that while some believe that pre-law programs are not the best preparation for law school,you may not necessarily be intending to go to law school, and doing a pre-law program may be a good way to complement your journalism degree on your way to becoming a legal journalist.;
, Consider going to law school if you want to be a legal journalist. Again, you do not need a law degree to become a legal journalist but having one can certainly help. Journalism requires coming up with new ideas, synthesizing existing ideas, and communicating those ideas effectively verbally and in writing. A degree in law can be excellent preparation for acquiring those skills.Importantly, if your goal is to be a legal journalist, then having specialist legal knowledge acquired in law school can help you immensely. There are numerous examples of well known journalists, such as Jeff Greenfield, Geraldo Rivera, and Cynthia McFadden, who attended law school before embarking on a career in legal journalism.If you are studying law as an undergraduate degree, as most people do in Australia, India, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, then doing your undergraduate degree in law can also lead to a career in legal journalism. The Solicitor’s Journal’s Emily Bater, for example, studied law as an undergraduate degree at Cardiff University and chose a career in legal journalism without having studied journalism.Attending law school in the United States first requires completing an undergraduate degree. This degree can be in any field. You may choose not to study journalism as an undergraduate and then attend law school and still become a legal journalist.
Note that attending law school in the United States is particularly costly, and the most well-paid jobs after law school tend to be in legal practice rather than journalism. You may not necessarily earn a salary commensurate with the market value of your law degree if you choose a career outside legal practice. It is perhaps for this reason that journalism, for law graduates, is an “alternative” career.Some U.S. law schools offer joint degree programs in journalism with their law degree. UC Berkeley, for example, offers a masters degree in journalism as a joint degree along with its law degree.. Check if your law school offers a joint degree with the journalism school at your university.

, You may not have a background in either law or journalism and do not wish to attend law school. If so, consider doing a master’s degree in journalism or legal studies (or both). These are not required to become a legal journalist but can help you in much the same way that a law degree or an undergraduate journalism degree can in becoming a legal journalist.


Yale, for example, offers a Master of Studies in Law program for non-lawyers who wish “to obtain a basic familiarity with legal thought and to explore the relation of law to their disciplines.”Many of the leading journalism schools across universities in the U.S. offer graduate degrees in journalism. Note that graduate school in journalism can be expensive,so consider carefully whether you need a graduate degree to achieve your ultimate goal of becoming a legal journalist.

, If you are at a stage in your career where attending school full-time is not an option, you may consider the option of taking a continuing education course in law or journalism (or both) on a part-time basis or enrolling in a certificate program or other non-degree program. Although these are not required in order to become a legal journalist, they offer a cost-effective and accelerated route to acquiring the education that can help you become a legal journalist.


Loyola Law School, for example, offers a three-day fellowship known as “Journalist Law School” to enable journalists with at least three years of journalism experience to learn about reporting on legal matters without a law degree. At the end of the fellowship, fellows receive a certificate of completion.If you do not have a background in journalism, you may boost your resume by enrolling in a continuing education program in journalism. Doing so can give you an insight into the field of journalism that may be useful if you do not have a journalism background. Columbia University, for example, offers a variety of continuing education programs in journalism., While you can certainly make a mid-career switch to journalism, starting early would be a better idea because “the earlier you start and succeed, the higher you’re likely to rise.”For an aspiring legal journalist, this means getting an internship that offers legal journalism experience early on in your career if possible. Getting an internship is also a good way to build a portfolio, meet people in the field, and make contacts, all of which could prove significant for finding permanent employment.Some of these internships may be unpaid, so you have to be willing to do them for the experience alone.

, Consider doing freelancing work, which should help you hone your writing and research skills and provide evidence of journalism experience on your resume. This could mean, for example, writing for your school paper while you are in college., Reading the work of experienced legal journalists should help you understand what type of work you are expected to produce. This should also help you stay abreast with current legal events, which should in turn help you contribute to the debate surrounding the particular issue you are reading about if you are currently working as a journalist or writing a legal blog.

, If you are an established authority in the legal field or have extensive legal knowledge and experience, you may be able to find work as a legal analyst for a television news network or be able to write articles as a legal contributor for print media. This type of work may lead to a full-time position as a legal journalist, but you may not be looking to become a full-time legal journalist after all. Working as a part-time legal analyst or contributor for a news source may be exactly what you want and will offer you valuable legal journalism experience. Note that for this type of job, your views would be sought after because of the expert legal knowledge that you would bring to bear on a news report, so having such knowledge would be crucial to landing a position of this sort.

, In recent years, blogging has become a method of disseminating one’s ideas online to a wide audience in a quick and cost-efficient manner. Blogging may not be regarded as the same as journalism by some commentators, but blogging is also regarded by others as a useful training ground for journalists, and some commentators do not regard the differences between the two as significant.Begin writing a blog on legal matters, and your ideas may reach a wide audience fairly easily and efficiently. Make sure the content of your blog is professional and thoroughly researched so that you make an impact on your audience through the quality of your work.

, Journalism, in many ways, is “a relationship business.”Invest time in building relationships with mentors and colleagues, who may help you down the line in finding work as a legal journalist.

, Keep in touch with your peers with whom you attended college or law school. If you studied journalism as an undergraduate, many of your peers may be working in the journalism industry and may help you find work.Alternatively, you may have attended law school with someone who is now working as a legal journalist, and maintaining contact with that individual can also lead to a job.

, If you studied journalism at university, maintain contact with your journalism professors after you graduate. Many of them work in the industry and can help you find a job or put you in touch with the right people., In addition to helping you find a job, it is also important to know how to foster relationships with your human sources once you are actually working as a journalist. Journalism is about relating stories to the world, and often the most appealing source of information for a journalist is a human source. Having a good relationship with your sources “make you better at your job.”, Use social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to disseminate your work and maintain a professional online presence. If you write a legal blog, you can share links to your blog through your Twitter and Facebook pages. Having an online presence helps you reach out to others who are well-established in the field, and they may be in the position to offer you a job if you impress them with your work.

, Every legal journalist is bound to have a unique story, so try seeking the advice of someone you know who works in the journalism industry. This may offer you an insight into how to enter the legal journalism profession. If someone you know personally does not work in the industry, reach out by email or social media to well known legal journalists, whose email and social media account information is generally readily available on the web. Most of them should be happy to offer advice to someone aspiring to follow the same career path as them.

, Journalism offers opportunities to work on a variety of work schedules. If you already have the credentials to be a legal journalist, decide whether you want to work full-time or part-time as an employee of a media organization or only do freelancing work as and when your schedule permits.

, You may be a practicing lawyer who wants to keep your full-time job and be a legal journalist only on a part-time basis. If you are a legal academic, you may want to keep your full-time job while appearing on Television or writing in print media on news stories that require your legal expertise on a part-time basis. Beginning as a part-time legal journalist can help you acquire a flavor of the industry and decide if legal journalism is the right job for you while continuing to work in your existing career.

, If you like the idea of being a full-time legal journalist after having gained exposure to the industry on a part-time basis, apply for full-time positions. An example of a well-known journalist who made the transition from being a practicing lawyer to a full-time journalist for Salon.com and the Guardian newspaper is Glenn Greenwald.You can find job listings for both full-time and freelancing work in journalism by clicking here.
You should also use the connections made with former professors and others within the industry to find jobs that are not necessarily listed on the internet.

Read online magazines as well. Many popular magazines, like Salon, have a lot of content online.

, Before you embark on the path to become a magazine editor, you should familiarize yourself with the career. Being a magazine editor can be a stressful job, and the industry is highly competitive.

The job can include long hours and a lot of responsibility, which can sometimes be stressful. However, as an editor you also get a lot of creative control of the direction a publication takes, giving you an opportunity to put content you're passionate about into the world.
The salary for an editor varies. On average, magazine editors make about $55,000 per year. However, if you end up working for a larger publication, you can make about $90,000 a year.

, The vast majority of editors have at least a bachelor's degree in English, communications, or journalism. When applying to colleges, specify that you want to major in one of these fields. Double majoring or taking on a minor can also help your career.Study hard in school. While your GPA may not be the number one factor potential employers will look at for hiring, you want to impress your professors. A recommendation from a professor can help you when applying for jobs later on.
Make time to study each week, and always turn assignments in on time. While college can be a fun place for socialization and personal growth, your primary goal should be to learn. The harder you work on your undergraduate degree, the easier it will be for you to find work after graduating.

, Do not do the bare minimum in college. In addition to studying hard and getting good grades, take on some extracurriculars. Most magazine editors do internships in college, and a large amount of extracurricular activities could help you land an internship down the road.Take on a role on a campus newspaper or literary journal. This will give you vital editorial experience.
You can also try to get some writing published in local newspapers and school journals. Many magazines will ask for a writing sample before making a hiring decision.

, If you want to land a job after college, you need a large amount of internship experience. It's a good idea to strive to complete one internship for every year of college.Talk to your school's career counselor about internships. He or she should be able to help you with your search, and also give you advice on your resume and the application process.
Talk to professors and people you work with at school clubs. They may have internships leads, and may be able to put in a good word for you.
It's vital you take any internship you get seriously. You will want a solid recommendation after the internship is finished, so work hard and be professional. A glowing letter of recommendation can help you land a job after completing college.

Working as a social media intern for a local magazine or journal is a great resume booster.
Volunteer to tackle social media at a campus club. For example, you could volunteer to operate the Twitter page for your school's literary journal.

Take on as many leadership positions as you can in college, as this will pay off down the road.Volunteer to be the managing poetry editor in a college literary journal. Run for president of a student run newspaper.
Look into internships that provide leadership experience. You could, for example, take on an internship where you help manage volunteers of a local charity organization.

, After college, you can look into higher education. Many managing editors have a master's degree in a field like journalism. There are benefits and drawbacks to pursuing higher education, so think long and hard about whether or not you want to gain another degree after graduation.For some fields, a degree in journalism is probably not necessary. For example, if your dream is to edit for a fashion magazine, a journalism degree is not really necessary. If you're looking into a literary magazine, however, a master's in something like English may help.
Keep in mind that experience is usually the number one thing employers look at. You may be better off entering the work force and attempting to gain as much experience as possible. Also, a master's degree may put you into debt, which can cause financial stress later in life.

, Once you're ready to enter the workforce, put together a solid resume. A clear, concise resume, that lists all your relevant experience, can help you get called in for an interview.Keep formatting consistent. Use bolded headings to separate sections like ""education,"" ""work experience,"" and ""professional skills."" Use a legible font, like Arial or Times New Roman, over anything potentially difficult to read.
Be choosy with your resume. You should not list all your experience. Stick to experience relevant to the job you're seeking out. For example, internships and work on your college's newspaper are important. A part time job at a coffee shop you worked at over the summer is probably not.
You want to put your most relevant experience ""above the fold."" This means, if you were to fold your resume in half, the most important experience would be above the crease of the fold.

, Networking is one of the best means to find a job. When you begin the job hunt, return to old contacts. Talk to supervisors from your internships. Ask professors if they have any job leads. Email fellow students you worked with professionally in college. You're more likely to get called into an interview if you have an existing connection to a magazine.

, Once you start getting called in for interviews, you'll want to impress the hiring managers. Make sure you brush up on great interview skills, as this will increase your chance of landing a job.Research a magazine beforehand. You should read up on the hiring manager, the editor and staff, the magazine's goals and mission statement, and read an issue of the magazine.
Make sure to dress professionally. You may want to read the dress policy online so you can match it with your attire. Make sure to dress up, however, as it's always better to be overdressed than underdressed. Avoid excessive jewelry and accessories, and make sure all your clothes are clean.
Use confident body language. Sit up straight, make eye contact, and nod as the interviewer talks. At the end of the interview, always ask questions. Go for open-ended questions, like, ""What's your company culture like?"" These are better than questions about logistics, like ""When will I hear back?"" You want to show you're genuinely interested in the company.

, Most editors start off as staff writers at a magazine. You'll have to spend a few years covering stories that you're assigned. Work hard as a writer, and in a few years you may be able to move up to an editorial position.Always produce excellent work. Even if you're not in love with a story, do your best. This shows dedication and work ethic. You should also carefully proofread stories to weed out typos and grammatical errors.
Strive to meet deadlines. You want to come off as well organized and hardworking, so never be late on a story.

, Once you've spent a few years as a writer, pursue the role of an editorial assistant. This will give you the necessary experience to eventually land a role as an editor. You can try applying to an internal position with the magazine you write for, or you can apply for positions with other magazines.As with your role as a writer, you should take your editorial work seriously. You want to be able to impress your boss. This will set you apart when the magazine is looking to hire a new editor, or allow you to get a good recommendation when you apply to outside editorial jobs.
Keep in mind, you may not work in a magazine of your choice right away. You may end up working outside your chosen genre or passion. This can be frustrating, but keep in mind a lot of the skills you're gaining are transferrable to other jobs. You can still apply for a managing editor position in your chosen magazine in the future.

, After working a few years as an assistant editor, you can begin to apply to editor positions. It's a good idea to go for your dream magazine here, as you may end up in this position longterm.Have patience. Editor positions for magazines, especially popular magazines, can be hard to come by. You will get a lot of rejections along the way.
Keep sending out applications. You may have to do dozens of interviews before you land the right job.

, An editor role is a lot of extra commitment. You will be supervising many different writers and freelancers, as well as deciding on a magazine's content and overall direction. If you are passionate about your work, an editorial role can be as fulfilling as it is hectic.Stay on top of organization. You'll be managing staff writers, as well as freelancers, so keep track of everyone's deadlines. You may also have to read through articles for basic grammar, and do things like fact checking.
Keep your magazine developing over time. As an editor, you will be responsible for the creative direction of your magazine. Make sure you stay creative and generate new ideas for content, series, headlines, and more. Keep thinking of new and creative ways to engage the interest of readers.

You need to be a strong writer who has a voice, and the way to get there is practice.Daily writing allows you to get your practice and helps build your confidence, which is key to succeeding as a writer.Keep a journal or log of your activities.

Start a blog.
Offer to help your friends and relatives by completing writing tasks to help them with work or self-promotion. For example, create a short newsletter for your club or church.;
, You need to be able to proofread and edit your writing so that you can produce clean copy. Use a spellchecker to avoid misspellings, and proofread to make sure that you don’t have any typos. Make sure any revisions and edits are made to the article, but check to ensure that your word processor isn’t setup to show comments or changes.Double-check for homophones and often-confused words that might not show up on a spellcheck.
Familiarize yourself with the Associated Press style guide.
Use online resources like Purdue’s OWL and Grammar Bytes to improve your grammar.

, Find articles that you like and try to write your own article in a similar way. This is called using a mentor text. Your mentor text serves as a model for how an article should be written.Choose a style to emulate, or experiment by writing the same story in different writing styles.
Outline an article that you think is formatted well, and write your own article in the same format.
Use sample texts to practice new ways of writing, but make sure that you don’t try to pass off someone’s writing or unique style as your own.

, Journalists have a quick turn-around time between assignment and deadline. Think about how fast news is reported after it happens. To be a good journalist, you need to be able to meet your readers’ expectations by producing speedy and accurate work.


Practice by setting a time limit for yourself to complete writing tasks. When your time is up, stop writing, even if you’re not finished. Assess your performance to see if you’re meeting your goals. Try to improve each time you do the exercise.

, Ask people you trust to review your writing and offer their critiques. If you can get a teacher or tutor to help you, then take advantage of their knowledge base to help you improve your writing skills. While it might be hard to have your writing critiqued, it’s necessary if you want to grow as a writer.Join a writing group that does regular critiques. You’ll get help from people who know what they’re talking about and meet other writers. Look for a group on social media or http://www.meetup.com.

, Your best option for improving your writing is a class. Even accomplished writers still take classes to gain new skills or push themselves to try different forms of writing. Check with your school, find a workshop, or look for an online class.


You can take a basic writing course or one that’s targeted to a specific area. You may want to take classes outside of journalism to help you build different skills.
Try https://www.edx.org/ for free classes from elite colleges and universities.

, Some of your best sources of information will be people you meet. Be open to meeting new people and hearing what they have to say. They may be a source, or they might give you a good idea about a story lead. The more people you’re connected to, the easier it will be to find a source for your story.Stay close to your mentors, teachers, and fellow students because you never know when that person could help you with a story or a job.
Use social media, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, to stay connected to people.
Talk to people you meet. For example, share small talk with people who are sitting at the same table as you are in a coffee shop, sharing your elevator, or waiting in the same line as you are. Say, “Is this your first time coming here?”

, Learn new skills and find opportunities by reaching out to other journalists. Don’t just limit yourself to people you meet. Look up your journalist idols and reach out to them. You can network both in person and through correspondence, such as email or social media.When you contact your idol, explain that you are pursuing journalism and use their work as an example of good journalism. You could say, “As a developing journalist, I consider your work to be a model of the work I aspire to produce.”
Tell your idol your purpose for contacting them so that they know that you aren’t just sending fanmail. You could say, “I hope that by following you and your work that I can reach the same levels of success that you have.”

, When you’re putting yourself out there - whether through your writing or when meeting new people - confidence is essential to helping you be successful. You need to be able to approach others and form relationships that help you, and you also need to project that you know your worth.


Don’t compare yourself to others; instead, focus on being who you are and sharing that with the world.
When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts about yourself, turn the thought around and make it positive. It’s normal to think bad thoughts about yourself sometimes, so don’t feel bad about it.
Tell yourself, “I have important and interesting things to share with the world,” or “I’m just as valuable as anyone else.”

, Going above and beyond is about more than just doing what’s necessary to get a story. You need to be more than just a good writer in today’s journalism market. When you write a story, don’t stop at the minimum to get the job done. Think about what you’d want out of the article if you were a reader, and try to give them that.


Make yourself more marketable by expanding your technical skills. Knowing how to use more programs, do basic coding, and use creative software will help you get your voice out there and will make you more marketable.If possible, beat your deadlines. While you don’t want to rush your work, you do want to provide your publisher with a speedy product so that your article will be timely.

, You may have to give up your free time or miss out on fun events with friends in order to meet your journalism goals. Writing is usually a solitary activity, so it may be a sacrifice for you to miss out on that social time. You may also need to sacrifice earning potential or social connections if you write about polarizing issues.


When you’re faced with sacrifices, ask yourself what’s more important to you. Ask, “Where do I want to be in five years? How will this sacrifice impact my five-year goal?”

, Journalists get information from a variety of sources, so you’ll need to know how to gather, assess, and organize information on your own. Research consists of more than just doing a Google search. You need to be able to find the information you need in print sources, by talking to knowledgeable individuals, and by sorting through relevant materials, such as letters, memos, or file documents., Being able to understand various topics, sniff out stories, and look at things from various perspectives are all necessary to be a good journalist.Consider getting a degree in something other than journalism to make you a more informed writer.
If you want to cover world events, consider studying languages.

, Read or watch the news, and stay plugged in to politics, current events, and pop culture. Anything can be relevant from a journalistic standpoint, so keep yourself open and learn the current trends. You’ll produce better stories and get your readers what they want if you know what’s going on., Before reporting information that you find, make sure that it’s from a reliable source. When possible, try to find a second source that confirms the information. If you receive facts from a source, independently verify that those facts line up.For example, if someone tells you that they knew the subject of your story when they were in college, make sure they were really in college together.

, While you will likely build relationships with some of your sources or the people you write about, make sure those relationships don’t influence how you portray them in your work. For example, if your best friend works as a police officer, then getting your crime information from them will likely be biased toward your friend’s opinion.For example, don’t take payments from a source or a subject of an article. If you are writing an investigative article about a corporation, you’ll lose your independence if you allow them to hire you for freelance work during your investigation.
If you have someone who gives you inside information about the local crime beat, keep a professional relationship with that person. If you start to get too personal, then you may unknowingly have a bias toward them.
If you get too close to a source, you can always ask them to help you find a new one so that your information stays independent.

, Practice your journalistic abilities by running your own blog. In addition to being a great place for you to share your voice and flex your skills, it will also help you promote yourself to people who might hire you or may buy your stories.

, Build a strong and clean social media presence across platforms. Make sure that you are posting meaningful information on a regular basis. You should be able to share your handles with potential employers, so be mindful about what you post., Both paid and unpaid internships are available in journalism. If you don’t need the money, then an unpaid internship might be a great way for you to get experience without as much competition. Paid internships are competitive, but you’ll be getting paid to do what you love.If you get turned down for an internship, contact the employer to ask if you can still submit a story or two for consideration.

, If you’re in school, take any position that is available, even if it’s not what you really want to do. If you do a good job, you’ll likely get more and better opportunities., Include your bio, interests, and examples of your work. If you build an online portfolio, include links to sites that feature your work, as well as links to your social media accounts."

Define your goals.,
Hone your skills.,
Build a portfolio.,
Network and use your resources.,
Become an expert in your field.",How to Become an Activist Journalist," It's important to know exactly what you want before you put time and energy into building a career. There are several questions you can ask yourself to make your goals clearer.


Is it more important to you to make change or to advance in a particular area of journalism? If activism is your primary goal, and journalism only the means, you may become frustrated by working within mainstream newspapers, TV, or radio. Alternative newspapers or online journalism may be more appropriate for you, although you risk earning a lot less, so be prepared to either find other sources of income or funding.
What medium is most comfortable for you? For example, would you rather write or be on radio or camera? Do you want to be covering breaking news or doing more in depth coverage of important issues?
How savvy are you with technology? Your technical talents may lead you for example to blogging or photojournalism.
Do you want this to be a full-time career, or only part-time? How much money do you need to make to stay afloat? Again, journalism is not usually a lucrative career, and you may need to mix activist blogging, for example, with more neutral work that brings in more money.;
, Once you have your goals in mind, practice writing, speaking in front of a camera or into a microphone, interviewing, blogging, or whatever you plan to do. You can always use a personal blog, videoblog, or podcast as practice and a resume builder. Take classes where appropriate and learn the style used by journalists in your area.


Think about the style of writing you'd like to adopt. Activist journalism carries with it a need to be conscious of the use of language and its hidden meanings or ability to shape readers' understandings. Be prepared to reclaim language that has been altered or taken over by agendas that are not inclusive or compassionate. Rethinking the way that language is used in mainstream media or by lobby groups is an important skill when you're an activist journalist.
Read widely and question widely. It's important that you have a broad understanding of differing perspectives in any issue that you're going to cover. This gives your work greater reliability and makes it harder to set aside as uninformed. This requires you to have excellent research skills and the ability to work past your own opinions and beliefs, to try to see all of the angles involved.

, If you want to get paying gigs as a journalist, you need examples of your work. The Internet is a great tool to get your work out there, but you can also try other venues; for example, look for calls for submissions to magazines, write letters to the editor, or shop content around to people you know in the business.

, Networking is an extremely powerful tool in journalism, and especially in activist circles. For example, if you want to get hired by a big progressive blog, you can start by getting active with social media and your own blog, leaving friendly comments for people who write there. Ask around to see if any of your contacts know anyone who might be useful in your job search. Resources like the Women's Media Center support progressive journalists and might be able to help you get a foot in the door. Fellowships are another place to turn; for example, NPR has several great comprehensive fellowships that help young journalists learn about the world of public radio.


Belong to organizations that reflect your activist concerns and beliefs. This will give you the opportunity to meet many people who are actively working to make a difference and you'll have plenty of interview and knowledge resources to call upon.
Ally yourself wherever you go, and try to do this beyond people whose ideas and causes gel with you. There are always more than two sides to a story, and in Western society where we're trained to see daily life in terms of argument and confrontation, it can be too easy to lose this multiple perspective. When looking for the multiple divergences in opinion, try to see the ways in which you can find common ground rather than conflict, and find people whose views have overlaps with your activist approach. Often the best story draws the threads together rather than making the story into a two-sided contest.

, Narrow your activism down to a particular area and become an expert in it. That doesn't have to be your only interest, but it helps if you become known as the person to turn to on queer issues, disability, or women of color, for example. Use an RSS reader or Google Alerts to thoroughly follow all the news in your area, and comment on it widely. Use Twitter, blogging, etc. to get your opinion out in different ways.


Enable readers to draw upon your expertise as a source of developing and tailoring their own viewpoints and solutions. Make it clear that you are facilitating understanding rather than being the last word on an issue. The heart of activism is to enable others to do their part to help make a difference in the world.

Focus on people.,
Go out on foot patrol.,
Be a copycat.,
Concentrate on writing good captions.,
Hand over those photos.,
Create a personal website.,
Stay persistent.",How to Break Into Photojournalism," Those trying to make a leap into the profession can start by shooting photos of people. The basis of photojournalism is the visual documentation of what is going on around us all. Nothing illustrates that more accurately than photographs of people doing the things people do.


The 2008 floods in the American Midwest highlighted this. Countless photos of flood waters were commonplace on mainstream media wires and hundreds more were submitted to newspapers every day. What sets the good photos apart from the ever-increasing stack of common photos, are the people and actions photographed. A photo of a person feverishly grabbing his belongings before his house floods is almost certainly going to be a more gripping photo than the one of the flood water and nothing else. At least, that's the case in the world of photojournalism.;
, When you're out shooting photographs, get out of your car and walk. Meet people. Talk to them. Ask them questions. You may be surprised to learn how many unique story ideas you can come up with just by being curious. Having a unique story is a quick way to impress an editor, but you will rarely find it driving around in your car.


It's better to focus on one or two stories that are unique than to shoot several stories that many other photojournalists are already documenting. Look around you for opportunities to cover stories that are hidden, or notoriously exclusive.In other words, invest in quality over quantity.

, Keep an eye on professional photojournalists while they work. Check your ego and watch how they go about getting their photographs and you may learn a few things. Even simple things, like how they carry a notebook and pen with them to write notes and names while on assignment, will give you an edge. They are professionals for a reason so you can learn plenty from modeling yourself after them. If you’re at an event professional photojournalists are covering, follow up the next day by looking at their printed work in the newspaper or website they work for. You can learn a lot by doing this on a regular basis.

, A striking difference between amateur photographers and professional photographers is the pros have perfected the art of collecting information about their photographs. Who? What? When? Where? If you can't get the facts straight, and write them in a clear, concise and accurate caption, you will not make it far in the business of photojournalism.

, Some photographers treat their work like it's a priceless piece of art that everyone is trying to steal. First of all, it isn't. And second, it's hard to get noticed in the field of journalism if your work is never seen. So show your work to someone in a position to publish it. Plenty of news sites accept amateur photos. Or publish it yourself. Plenty of independent blogs get noticed these days. As long as eyes are on your work, the odds of you making it in the field are better.


It's easy to find the names of photo editors from local newspapers. Call them or email them and say, “I shot a photo today that I thought you might be interested in seeing”. If your photos are good enough, editors will notice.

, It doesn't cost much to get your own domain name. Post a few examples of your photography and a link to your contact information. Send that link to editors of newspapers in your area and ask them to consider you for future freelance opportunities. As a potential freelance photojournalist, you are essentially a business, and businesses need to advertise their product.

, If an editor doesn't respond, that doesn't mean you didn't make an impression. The single most important trait most great journalists have is persistence. Editors are busy people. If you continue to contact them (not too often of course) and search for good photographs, you will eventually crack your way through the walls of a very competitive business.

Continue to talk to people in the industry so that they can keep you abreast of any jobs or assignments that might be available.If you are in school, talk to the editor of the school newspaper and see if there are any opportunities to write for them.

, Several online journalist communities can help you get work as a freelance journalist. Look for communities on LinkedIn and Facebook and become members of them. Start talking to other journalists to help build your network and gain more knowledge. These online communities can help you further your career and is a great knowledge base for new journalists.Other online communities include JournoBiz Forum, Mumsnet, and The No1 Freelance Ladies' Buddy Agency.

, Read different publications and find ones that you'd like writing for. Get to know their writing style and what kind of topics they usually write about. This will give you clues on how to pitch to them. Try to find contact information for editors so that you can send them pitches for articles.For instance, if you're a movie buff, look at publications that review or evaluate new films that come out.
If you're really into gaming, research gaming websites or magazines that talk about computer or video games.

, A website is a perfect way to show off past examples of your work. A website will give potential employers an idea of the type of content they can expect from you. You can either hire someone to build the site for you or build the website yourself. Remember to include your contact details so that people can connect to you.


Your website should contain contact info, a biography, examples of past work, and possibly a link to your personal blog.
Avoid cluttering your website with nonessential links or photos., A pitch is a small summary of an idea that you have for an article. Typically freelance journalists will pitch article ideas to editors who will accept or reject your pitch. If you don't have experience, you can pitch entire articles to editors so they have an understanding of how you write. Pitches contain a catchy headline and then a couple of sentences that explain what you want to write, and why people would want to read it. Start writing multiple pitches to different editors and see if you get any responses."

Eat three small meals a day.,
Stop eating when you are full.,
Chew your food slowly.,
Eat two snacks a day.,
Practice portion control.,
Eat out wisely.,
Drink more fluids.",How to Follow a 1500 Calorie Diet1," While eating three “solid or large” meals a day may have been the key to growing “big and strong” when you were little, as an adult trying to lose weight this is not what you want to do. The best way to stay under that 1500 calorie ceiling is to eat three small meals a day. Do not eat more than 400 calories for any one meal.


The most persistent myth in the dieting world is that you should eat six small meals rather than three moderate meals. The idea is that your body will be able to process this food more efficiently, maintaining blood sugar levels throughout the day, and keeping your metabolism in good shape. Science doesn’t not corroborate such claims. It is far more important to find an eating schedule that corresponds to your lifestyle. Can you stop and eat six times a day? Do you have the time to prepare six small meals? If not, don’t worry. You can still lose an equal amount of weight by eating three times a day.;
, Resign from the “clean your plate” club. Eat half of your normal meal. Stop for a moment and assess your hunger level. Give yourself a couple of minutes before you resume eating. This will let your body catch up. You might just discover that you are actually full.


This is also called ""intuitive eating"" and could mean the difference between maintaining a healthy body weight and being overweight.
There still are starving children around the world. Save your leftovers for later meals or snacks.

, Chewing itself doesn’t burn calories or magically decrease the number of calories in your food. By chewing slowly, you are giving your stomach time to report back to your brain after you’ve consumed something. Either your stomach will tell you to keep eating or that it is full. Fast chewers tend to consume more than they need to, because they haven’t waited for their stomach’s report.


Instead of rushing through your meal, enjoy your food and allow your body to fully respond to the nutrients you are giving it.
This principle was discovered by a research team at Iowa State University. In an experiment, researchers gave 47 subjects 60 pizza rolls on several occasions. They were told to take fewer or more bites of each pizza roll and then to stop eating when they were full. When asked to take more bites, the subjects ate fewer pizza rolls. Thus, they consume fewer calories., Skipping meals is not the best solution for losing weight. Don’t bank your calories for later. Doing so often leads to overconsumption and even binge eating later on. How often have you “rewarded” yourself later because you skipped a treat earlier on? Because you skipped a snack earlier, you’ll be hungrier later on and more likely to justify overeating. Eating consistent meals and snacks better supports your metabolism and energy levels.

, Modern portion sizes have grown tremendously and one meal can make up half of your calorie intake for the day. Try using smaller dinner plates for meals, pre-measure food, and avoid eating from the bag. Be aware of portion sizes of foods, especially snacks. If you really want some potato chips for lunch, check the serving size on the back of the package and pull out the exact number of chips that make up that serving size. Eat those and then re-evaluate if you want more and if more chips are worth the corresponding calories.


Eating off smaller bowls or plates is a simple trick that makes one cup of food on a small plate look like more than if you put it on a large plate. The trick to dieting is finding ways to trick yourself into eating healthy and less. Do what it takes and have fun with it.

, One of the easiest ways to break your 1,500 calorie daily diet is to go out and eat large meals at restaurants. Stay within your calorie limit for the meal. Check posted calorie amounts at the restaurant or check out the restaurant’s website. Some restaurants will have a detailed calorie list for all of their dishes, especially if they are chain restaurants. Don’t forget about the calories from drinks, dressings, and dips. They may seem like “side” items, but they still add up.


Order steamed, grilled, or broiled dishes rather than fried or sautéed entrées.
Order smaller meals at restaurants. If you cannot avoid getting a larger meal, divide it up when it first comes to the table. Cut your steak into a much smaller portion. Give your friend your excess or take it home for later.

, You should drink 11 to 15 cups of water a day, according to the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine.Generally, if you drink enough water so you’re rarely thirsty and your urine is mostly colorless, you’re probably consuming the right amount of water.Water is best, but coffee, tea, and diet drinks are acceptable alternatives. Skim milk is fine, but keep in mind it has around 100 calories per serving. Avoid most juices or other sugary drinks, because they only empty calories.


One trick that Brenda Davy — a professor at Virginia Tech — suggests is to drink two cups of water right before eating a meal. She argues that water suppresses the feeling of hunger by making the body feel full, which reduces the individual’s need to eat more."

Think of unique article topics.,
Pitch often.,
Doublecheck your pitch for grammar and spelling.,
Create a catchy article title.",How to Work as a Freelance Journalist2," Make sure that you're not pitching an article idea that they have already covered unless you can bring new information or a fresh perspective to the story. The best bet is to pitch article ideas on pieces that are missing. Look for niche stories that relate to the content that they usually publish, but a topic that's been underreported.For instance, if you're pitching for a local newspaper, you can get ideas from local gossip or controversies that may not have been covered yet.
Reporting on smaller, marginalized communities may be something that other journalists have not done.
If a report came out recently, you can try to be the first person to write a synopsis of how it impacts people.

, Many of your pitches are likely to get rejected, especially if you haven't developed a relationship with the editor. Play the odds and pitch often. Pitching your ideas to more than one editor can increase your chances of getting your article picked up. Take the assignment that comes first., One of the biggest turnoffs for editors is a poorly formulated pitch. A pitch that's riddled with spelling or grammatical errors shows the editor that you don't care and gives them a negative impression. Make sure to double check your pitch and edit it so that there are no errors., The top line of your story will be the first thing that editors will see and you want to make sure that it grabs their attention. Use actionable verbs and try to make the title of your article as catchy and compelling as possible.For instance, instead of writing ""How to Eat Healthier"" write ""Eat Your Way to Great Health.""

Learn other technical skills.,
Create and stick to a schedule.,
Wake up early and change your clothes every day.,
Set a time to avoid distractions.,
Manage your workload and learn to say no.",How to Work as a Freelance Journalist3," Skills like photography, graphic design, and coding will lend themselves well to a career as a freelance journalist. These skills can translate to journalism and will increase your value to most editors. If you're having issues finding work, let the editors know that you have these other skills and can incorporate them into your work., If you work with multiple publications it can be hard to get all of your work in by the deadline. Write down a schedule of your day-to-day operations and stick to it. This will help you finish your articles by deadline and will keep you on track while you're working., Even if you start working from home, it's important that you wake up and get dressed as if you are going to an office. This will help keep you focused throughout your day and get you in the mindset to work efficiently., When working from home, it can be hard to stay focused. Instead of getting distracted, set a timer for 45-50 minutes and focus solely on working on a single project. Do not respond to emails, answer the phone, or pay attention to any distractions. Once the timer is up, relax and take a break for 20-30 minutes., Sometimes when you're lucky, assignments will come rolling in. It's important that during these times that you manage your workload. If an editor assigns you an article, it's best to be transparent about your workload. Consider if they are pay is high enough and whether you have the free time to complete it by the deadline. If you don't feel like you can complete it by the deadline or it doesn't pay enough, decline the assignment."

Justify the time to track your food.,
Use a food tracking app.,
Keep a food diary.",How to Follow a 1500 Calorie Diet2," Oftentimes, people avoid dieting because they “don’t have the time” to measure out portions or to “count calories.” If you’re serious about dieting and sticking to a 1,500 calorie diet, you need to justify this time expense to yourself. Your diet won’t be as effective without it. Not only will it help you keep up with how many calories you’ve eaten in a day, but it will force you to really evaluate your food choices and your daily routine.

, Using a food tracking tool can be a very useful to help track your daily caloric intake. There are a variety of free smartphone apps available to use such as My Fitness Pal. These apps take the hassle out counting calories. Simply enter your food and let them do the rest.Many apps can also scan products you buy at the store. For example MyNetDiary’s Calorie Counter Pro app can scan barcodes while tracking up to 45 different nutrients. This app also has the ability to track your exercise.Try a couple of different apps to find the one with the easiest interface for you. If the app is easy to use, it should be easier for you to keep up with.

, You should record everything you eat for several weeks. Some people eat without realizing it or thinking about what they are eating. Many people underestimate how many calories they are actually consuming.


You can purchase a food diary from any diet supplement store, online, or simply make your own. Be sure to use columns to keep track of the day, times when you consume food, a brief description of your food/beverages, and the number of calories consumed. It is also a good idea to note how much physical activity you complete each day. Ideally, you should complete 60-90 minutes of moderate activity daily. Since the key to a successful diet is eating healthy and exercising regularly, recording both food and exercise in the same place will help reinforce both."

Eat more tomatoes.,
Eat protein-rich foods like eggs, salmon, and lean meats.,
Consume fiber-rich foods.,
Try some chili peppers.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Avoid foods that have empty calories.,
Don’t sacrifice taste.,
Consult sample menus online.",How to Follow a 1500 Calorie Diet3," Tomatoes are rich sources of vitamins A, C, and folic acid. They contain a wide array of antioxidants, lycopene, choline, beta-carotene, and lutein. Tomatoes have the added advantage of complimenting pretty much any meal. Eat them whole, slice them up, dice them into small cubes, or puree them and add them to your favorite soup. A single tomato normally only costs around 22 calories, but as a superfood — replete with so many things your body needs — they can be a filling food., Meats have gotten a bad rap in the health community in the last decade or so. This is probably a result of the “skinny” craze. Many nutritionists now tell their clients to eat a protein rich diet for two reasons. First, Protein is far more filling than most other foods. Studies have even shown that eating a protein rich diet can reduce cravings by 60%. Second, your body actually burns more calories a day, simply by eating more proteins. The energy expended to process these protein heavy foods — lean meats specifically — will give you an extra window of 80 to 100 calories a day. This is not a license to eat that much more a day, but it is “food for thought”., Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage are extremely high in fiber. So are beans and lentils. Eat a cup of fiber-rich yogurt in the morning to add a quick boost of fiber to your diet. Just make sure that the yogurt you choose isn’t made with a lot of unhealthy sugars and dyes.


Raspberries are a great source of fiber too. They also have the ability to lower cholesterol. One cup of raspberries has 8 grams of fiber.Doctors recommend that women consume around 25 grams of fiber per day and 38 grams per day for men.
In particular, fiber-rich foods help fill you up, without filling you out. They have the same weight as other foods, but don’t cost as many calories. So if you are used to eating a big breakfast every morning, try changing out that bowl of sugary cereal for a nice yogurt. See if you are equally full afterwards., If you can handle the heat, studies have shown that the capsaicin in chili peppers can reduce appetite and increase fat burning. You can even buy capsaicin in supplement form at many commercial weight loss centers or your local pharmacy. Add some chilis to your pastas, sandwiches, and salads. They can give any meal a little boost of flavor., Contrary to popular opinion, eating a low-fat diet is not the key to losing weight. The “low-fat” food craze isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Many “fat-free” labels mask foods high in sugar, refined carbohydrates, and calories, used to enhance the taste. In general, there are two good fats — monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats. Good fats come from many oils (e.g. olive oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil), peanut butter, avocados, tofu, and other kinds of nuts.Add some omega-3 fats to your diet too. Good sources of omega-3 fats are fish, walnuts, ground flax seeds, flaxseed oil and soybean oil.Omega 3 fats are processed into energy, which is great for weight loss., Foods that are high in fat and/or sugar are disastrous for a 1,500 per day calorie plan. Donuts, candy, potato chips, ice cream, and other tasty treats are high in calories and offer few beneficial nutrients. Don't waste your valuable calories, which could be used to fill you up, on food ""fluff""., One of the biggest complaints from those on diets is that their food is simply tasteless. Use more herbs and spices like cumin, basil, and coriander. Stay away from salt, which can lead to water retention. You should only be consuming roughly 6 grams of salt a day. Avoid foods that are high in sodium.Low-fat, low calorie food can be hard to eat day after day. Some of the flavor in common foods comes from the fat, but to stick to 1,500 calories a day you need to eliminate much of your fat intake.


Use freshly toasted nuts to add taste and texture to your meals. Pine nuts pair well with spinach and other sautéed greens. Walnuts work for salads and couscous. If you want to make your own toasted nuts, just set your toaster oven to 250 °F (121 °C), place your nuts on a baking sheet, and cook for four to six minutes.Grate a sharp romano cheese on your salad, vegetables, or rice to give your food a nice cheesy taste.
Add dried fruits like cranberries and figs to add flavor.
Add low-sodium marinade to give foods a sweet and tangy taste., There are many such repositories online that cater to particular tastes. There are menus for fish lovers/haters, vegetarians, smoothie addicts, or anyone else with particular culinary preferences.Here is one 1500 calorie menu:


Breakfast:

2 eggs cooked in 1 tsp coconut oil
½ cup spinach
1 oz feta cheese
1 slice of whole grain toast


Snack:

1 cup of plain low-fat Greek Yogurt
1 cup of fresh berries

Keep track of what you eat.",How to Eat 9000 Calories Per Day," In order to reach 9,000 calories a day, you’ll need to focus on getting “the best bang for your buck” in terms of calories per meal. Dietitians call foods with a lot of calories per bite ""calorie-dense."" These foods will allow you to take in more calories without feeling too stuffed. To stay healthy, focus on calorie-dense foods that also provide a lot of nutritional value.Some examples of nutrient- and calorie-dense foods are:


Nuts
Nut butters like peanut or almond butter
Dried fruit like banana chips
Fresh fruits like mangos and avocados;
, Eating isn’t the only way to increase your calorie intake. If you are having trouble maintaining your weight — that is, losing weight despite drinking enough water and getting plenty of calories in solid form — consider high-calorie beverages. Remember, just having high caloric content isn’t the only goal; try to drink calorie-dense beverages that also offer high nutrient content. .


Replace water in your diet with high-calorie fruit juices like apple, grape, or orange juice. Each of them are great options that won't leave you feeling too full.
Smoothies are great ways to drink a large number of calories in a healthy fashion. If you can make your own, add protein powder, dense fruits, cream-based liquids and yogurt. Smoothies will move through the stomach quickly and allow you to fuel up prior to exercise.
Try to limit your beverage intake during meals to leave more room for calorie-dense foods, but ensure you maintain healthy hydration levels., It’s important to know what your goals are before you begin transitioning to a 9,000 calorie per day diet. Different types of athletes require different types of nutrients to maximize their performance.


If you are training to be an endurance athlete, you should incorporate between 0.5 and 0.7 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.4 g/kg of bodyweight) each day to help your body rebuild the muscle you break down through training.
If you are doing heavy weight training, your protein intake should be more like 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.7 g/kg of bodyweight) every day. This will provide your body with the amino acids it needs to not only restore your damaged muscle, but help your body build new muscle through training.Don’t increase your protein intake at the cost of other important elements of your diet. Developing and maintaining healthy muscle also requires that you take in carbohydrates and healthy fats each day. Ignoring them for the sake of protein can cause your body to use that protein for energy instead of muscle development and retention.It is possible to eat too much protein and some clinicians believe it may cause irreversible damage to your kidneys. The Institute of Medicine recommends that you do not consume greater than 35% of total calories in protein. Additionally, increased dietary protein can result in elevated urinary calcium, which may contribute to bone loss and the subsequent development of osteopenia and osteoporosis., It may seem like the easiest way to increase your calorie intake is to pile on the ice cream and greasy pizza, but eating unhealthy foods in large quantities can lead to other health problems.


Calories aren't the only things that matter. Nutritional value in your foods is just as important. Make sure your diet provides the nutrients you need to be healthy.Junk food and greasy treats can raise your cholesterol and blood pressure. Too much saturated fat can even lead to cardiovascular problems that include heart attack and strokes.
Recent studies also suggest saturated fats can affect insulin production in your body and lead to other health problems like diabetes., In order to get all the calories and nutrients you’ll need in a 9,000 calorie a day diet, you’ve got to start early. Plan for seven or eight meals a day, starting right when you get up.


Use lots of eggs — they’re a healthy source of calories and a huge boost to your protein intake.
Add a steak to bolster your protein and fats.
Include oatmeal or another good source of fiber like granola.
Couple your breakfast with whole milk to add calories and fat.

, Plan to eat a snack between each major meal. If you feel up to another meal-sized helping, go for it, but if you’re still feeling pretty full from breakfast, try calorie- and nutrient-rich nuts.


Five ounces of walnuts alone can account for nearly 1,000 calories of your daily diet.
One serving of oil roasted pecans has nearly 800 calories.One serving of macadamia nuts had 948 calories., Lunch should be one of your bigger meals. If you can, aim for 1,000-2,000 calories at lunch.


Have a carbohydrate-rich soup. Latka Soup can provide over 2,000 calories in a one and a half servings.When choosing foods, remember that your body can only absorb a certain amount of nutrients at once. While three to four chicken breasts might provide up to 1,000 calories, you will only be able to absorb 20 to 30 g of protein, or about the amount of protein in one chicken breast. Don't let focusing only on calories cause you to lose sight of the bigger picture — this amount of chicken is simply too much protein to eat at once.

, Even with plenty of protein coming in through eggs, steak and chicken, you may still need more depending on your body weight and fitness goals.


Mass gaining protein shakes are an excellent source of the right nutrients coupled with a load of calories. Many exceed 1,000 – 1,200 calories per serving.If you like making your own smoothies, incorporate protein powder, Greek Yogurt, and cream based liquids with the calorie-dense fruits.
Peanut or other nut butters are good choices for added calories, protein, and fat.

, As your last substantial meal of the day, dinner is a great opportunity to catch up calories you missed throughout the day.


Take advantage of the protein content in beef. Steak or burgers can be a great source and the condiments you add can provide a significant boost to your overall calorie intake.
Couple your main course with a calorie-dense carbohydrate like beans, potatoes, or biscuits.Include vegetables with your dinner. Roasted vegetables are an excellent source of nutrition and fiber. Add butter for increased caloric value.

, Midway through your evening you should have a good sense as to whether or not you’re on track with today’s diet. If you have some calories you need to make up, give yourself a cheat meal where you choose things you enjoy eating. Preferably stick to healthy foods, but nothing says you can’t treat yourself from time to time.

, Your metabolism does not actually slow down while you sleep, but sleep is when your body does the most repairing and regeneration of muscle mass. Have a snack to make sure your body has a nutrient rich pool of resources to heal.


Walnuts or other nuts make for a great before bed snack.
Another protein shake could help make up for any missed protein throughout the day.

, The first step toward eating 9,000 calories a day is eating more often than most people do and finding ways to increase the amount of healthy food you can take in per meal.


Don't let more than four hours go by without eating a meal (unless you are sleeping).Eating often will provide you with an opportunity to increase your caloric intake.
Drink healthy beverages that have a high caloric content between and with your meals. Fruit juices like apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, and grape juice are high in calories and nutrients.
Buy bigger plates so meals seem smaller. Silly as it may seem, bigger plates can make it easier to add more food to your plate (and your diet) without it seeming like too much., Sleep is when your body does most of its healing and repairing of bodily tissues, so eating right before bed will ensure your body has fresh nutrients available to maximize tissue production.Your metabolism doesn't actually slow down while you're sleeping, but your body is much less active. A meal before you go to sleep will ensure you use as many calories as you can out of your late night snacks for recovery and regeneration., Lost body heat is one of the biggest energy drains the human body endures regardless of activity level. Adopting a 9,000 calorie daily diet means you're burning at least that many through your metabolism and training, so don't waste some of them on just keeping warm. When you're cold, your body burns calories to create body heat. Avoid the caloric cost keeping you warm by staying that way to begin with.


Stay warm to inhibit the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones aid in uncoupling proteins to create body heat and are also known as one of the stronger metabolism regulating hormones.Stress also increases your metabolism. Stress can release adrenaline and thyroxine which both can speed up your metabolism. Reducing stress will limit your body's production and release of these chemicals., In order to make sure you’re taking in as many calories as possible in a healthy way, start logging what you eat and drink.


There are a number of Apps on the market designed to help you not only track how many calories you take in, but also the amount of nutrients. MyFitnessPal and other similar smartphone apps allows you to scan the barcodes or utilize their food catalog to find the caloric content of your meals. It can provide you with a breakdown of how many calories you’ve eaten and where you may be lacking in nutritional content. It can also let you know when you are exceeding healthy levels of things like sodium or saturated fat.Keeping track of your diet will also help you remember which foods and beverages agreed with you and which didn’t. When striving to increase caloric content to 9,000 calories per day, eating things that make you feel sluggish or sick could interfere with maintaining the calorie intake you planned on.

Obtain a diet scale of the load cell type, it is accurate.,
Select a variety of frozen dinners, of different brands and food types, that reflect a normal diet.

,
Choose at least 5 dinners, add the total calories of each product and divide it by the sum of the net weight of the products.,
Use the quick calorie count number of 36.,
Take the total food weight and multiply it by 36.,
Include snacks between meals.,
Count calories and record it along with your body weight on a calender.,
With a planned, nutritionally sound diet and concentrating on counting calories, have a goal of losing a .5, .75 or 1.0 pound a week for a person of average weight.,
Gradually reduce calorie intake so, body resistance stays up.,
Use the logical, methodical approach, it takes effort, but the results will be totally sure.

",How to Count Calories Using Total Weight," This scale can also be used for weighing envelopes and parcels, so the weight increments should be more detailed for these other purposes. Check the type of battery the scale uses: coin shaped batteries do not last long. Buy a second load cell scale for measuring body weight.;
,, The result is the quick calorie count number and is the average calories per ounce.

, This number is a constant, but can be adjusted to 34 for a low calorie meal or 38 for a high calorie meal. The quick count number (average calories per ounce) should be within the vicinity of 36.

, A meal might be 13 oz x 36 or 468 calories. The rest of the meal might be items like beverages, salad, soups or fruits and these have to be individually measured and counted. Use the quick calorie count for foods that are similar to those of frozen dinners which represent the majority of foods in a meal. Weighing a plate of food is a lot easier (and with less dishes to wash) than weighing the parts of the whole.

, Counting calories is easy for snacks and because it is simple to determine the calories for a candy bar, fruit or glass of milk.

, Portion control is useful when without a scale. This method of counting calories is effective too, but it takes preparation, for example a deck of cards might be the amount of proteins allowed at each meal.

, Think in the long term and calculate the results of losing .5 pound/week for a year. Have patience.

, Keep track of the grams of protein intake and take a multivitamin daily.

Your nephrologist will talk to you about your nutrition needs, as will many of the other dialysis staff at your clinic. You will most likely meet with a renal (kidney dialysis) dietitian while you are there and continue to meet with her/him on a monthly basis. The whole team, together, will help formulate a plan that's best for you.;
, You may have lost a lot of weight prior to starting dialysis. It's important to get your weight stabilized once you start treatment. You will also want to increase protein in your diet, as dialysis leads to losses of this very important nutrient. Dialysis can increase a person's calorie needs, so you may find it takes more calories to maintain your weight (or gain weight) than it once did. Many patients find it takes 80-100 grams of protein per day and up to 35 calories per kilogram of body weight to keep themselves healthy.

, Dialysis patients face other dietary issues as well. They usually have to limit fluids and salt. Patients usually have to limit two other minerals in the diet: potassium and phosphorous. This is because while dialysis does help clean the blood, it still cannot do all the work healthy kidneys once did.

, Most dialysis patients are allowed to eat eggs and are encouraged to eat them daily. Eggs are one of the most complete proteins available. Even patients with cholesterol issues are encouraged to eat eggs at least twice a week if they are started on dialysis. Two eggs will provide you with 14 grams of protein, a good start towards that 80-100 grams per day.

, Other protein foods include chicken, beef, pork or fish. Each of these contains 21 grams of protein per 3 ounce serving. Having a daily serving of one of these animal proteins will provide 25-25% of a dialysis patient's daily needs.

, Because milk is high in potassium and phosphorous, many patients are told to limit or avoid it. A solution to this dilemma is to switch to almond milk, which is lower in both these minerals. To add protein to almond milk, you can take 1-2 Tbs of any good protein powder, blend it with a little moisture, then stir into 8 ounces of almond milk. Now you have a high-protein milk alternative that may provide anywhere from 5-10 grams of protein per serving.

, Protein powders vary widely but are often used in other ways to supply extra needed protein. A renal dietitian can provide a list of acceptable protein powder products. It is important to review labels to ensure the protein powder you choose is not too high in potassium or phosphorous, as an overload of these minerals can prove hazardous to a dialysis patient's health. Some brands typically used in dialysis centers are ProCel, Dialyvite Whey Plus, Nectar and Unjury. Again, consult with your renal dietitian to find an appropriate brand for you.


Protein powders can be added to any recipe that utilizes wet or moist ingredients. Adding a scoop or two to muffin, cake, cookie, meatloaf, omelette, quiche or casserole recipes can increase protein significantly. Baking or cooking at high temperatures does not destroy the protein.
A scoop of protein added to a block of cream cheese (one of the lower phosphorous dairy products) in the food processor makes a high protein cream cheese. Add some strawberries and sweetener to the blender for a sweet fruit dip. This can also be a nice, high-protein, high-calorie spread for a toasted bagel.
Make the traditional Rice Krispy treats into a high in protein snack! Melt butter or margarine in the amounts directed in a large pot. Add 2 scoops of protein powder and stir rapidly. Once incorporated, add 1 large bag of marshmallows and stir until melted. Then add 1 box crispy rice cereal. Blend together. Use wetted hands to pat the mixture into a greased casserole dish.
Protein powders can also be blended into shakes. It is recommended that you first wet a scoop of protein powder with some liquid to avoid clumping. Add the wet protein mixture to your blender along with lower potassium fruits (such as frozen blueberries), a sweetener and some almond milk to make a high protein breakfast shake.

, Nepro is a brand of protein shake especially tailored to dialysis patients, in that it is lower in fluid, higher in protein and lower in potassium and phosphorous than some other brands. Some supplemental insurance programs and even Medicaid may pay for Nepro if a patient is determined to be in need. This involves the renal dietitian and social worker reviewing each patient on a case-by-case basis. Paperwork must be completed and submitted to the agencies involved. However, not all insurances will pay for supplements and a lower-priced, affordable option should be investigated if a patient doesn't qualify.


Boost and Ensure are products that can be used by renal patients although labs should be ordered more often to ensure patients are not overloading on potassium or phosphorous. A patient may be instructed to take a medication called a ""binder"" if using protein shakes as supplements.

, Protein bars are often utilized by dialysis patients who want to increase protein and calories in their diet and these may be preferable for a patient struggling to limit fluids. Again, there are many brands and a renal dietitian should have an approved list. Some protein bars used for supplement programs in dialysis centers include the Zone Perfect bars and Pure Protein brand bars. Protein bars should be eaten between meals to encourage a good appetite at meal times. Any binders prescribed should be written to include one at snack times.

, Peanut butter is a good high-calorie protein food that can be included on a renal diet. Because it is higher in phosphorous, a patient should limit their intake to 1 Tbs per day. Again, if the patient takes binders to help control phosphorous levels, a binder should always be taken with the peanut butter meal or snack.

, Soft, easy-to-eat high calorie snacks can include rice pudding made with almond milk (even better if fortified with protein powder!), tuna salad, macaroni salad, egg custards and egg salads.

, They can be found in some athletic retail stores, online and in clinics. A popular product in some dialysis clinics is called Liquacel. Similar products include Pro-Stat and Pro-Cel. THe product is thick and syrupy in appearance and usually comes in fruit flavors, such as orange, grape or lemon. One shot usually supplies around 15 grams of protein, but some patients find the aftertaste objectionable. An ounce of product can be mixed with 4 oz of ginger ale or grape juice to help make it taste better. Or, can be added to jello mix while still hot, then left to cool and firm before cutting into cubes.

Seek approval from a health care professional before starting a weight-loss or exercise plan.,
Use free online BMR calculators to take the mystery out of weight loss.,
If you don't want to use online BMR converters, do the math yourself.,
Factor in your level of daily exercise to your BMR.,
Understand how weight loss and weight gain work.,
Cut 500 calories a day to lose 1 pound per week.",How to Count Calories1," It is not worth jeopardizing your health with a crash diet. For most people, a healthy amount of weight to lose is 1 to 2 pounds per week.;
, BMR stands for basal metabolic rate, is the amount of calories consumed while you're at rest, not doing anything.


The Mayo Clinic and many other health-related websites have calorie calculators that determine how many calories you should eat per day to maintain your current weight. Enter variables such as weight, height, age, gender and frequency of exercise, and the calculator determines the right number of daily calories for you.

, Here's how you calculate your BMR. It's different for men and women:


For women:

655 + (4.3 x Weight in pounds) + (4.2 x Height in inches) - (4.7 x Age in years)


For men:

66 + (6.3 x Weight in pounds) + (12.9 x Height in inches) - (5.8 x Age in years)


You'll come up with a number. What does this number mean? This is a number of calories that you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day and did absolutely nothing.

, Do this to see how many calories you can consume during a day to maintain your weight. Take your BMR, multiply it by the appropriate number below, and add that to your BMR to see how many calories you can eat during the day to stay the same weight. This is called your suggested daily calorie intake.


For no activity, multiply your BMR by 20% (this means BMR x .20, not 20!)
For little or light activity, multiply your BMR by 30%
For moderate activity, multiply your BMR by 40%
For strong activity, multiply your BMR by 50%
For intense activity, multiply your BMR by 60%

, Any calories you consume above your suggested daily calorie intake will cause you to gain weight, while consuming fewer calories than your suggested daily calorie intake will cause you to lose weight. A pound is measured by 3,500 calories. So if you consume 3,500 more calories than you burn during a day, you'll gain a pound; if you burn 3,500 more calories than you consume during a day, you'll lose a pound.


For example, say that your BMR is 1,790. Let's also say that you're moderately active, meaning you exercise three times a week. 1,790 x .40 = 716. Add 716 to 1,790 to get 2,506. That's what you need to stay under in order to lose weight. Any calories consumed above 2,506 means you're gaining weight.

, One pound equals 3,500 calories, so cutting 500 calories a day will add up to a pound a week. Having a target goal for daily calories makes it easier to decide what to eat.


If your suggested daily calorie intake is about 2,500, then shoot for 2,000. This will help you along with your goal of losing one pound every week.

Join a discount club.",How to Cut Calories on a Budget," If you don't cook much, you'll need to find some simple recipes you can use to make your meals if you want to cut calories and eat more healthy foods. You can buy a basic cookbook, or just search for recipes online.You probably want recipes that are relatively simple and don't require a lot of prep time. Look for recipes that have ingredients that are familiar to you, and are foods you already know you like.
The benefit of simple, one-plate meals such as casseroles or soups is that you can augment them to add variety so you don't feel like you're eating the same thing all the time.
If you have friends who enjoy cooking, ask them for suggestions. Once you get more comfortable cooking, you may decide you want to experiment more.
A free resource provided by USDA with healthful recipes can be found at: http://whatscooking.fns.usda.gov/
;
, Try to include fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, grains, and meat or another protein source with every meal you plan. Your menu doesn't have to be fancy — a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, yogurt, and a banana is a simple and well-rounded lunch.Unless you're a vegetarian, you typically will get most of your protein from meat. Lean meats such as chicken, turkey, or fish are generally better than beef if you're trying to cut calories.
Since meats can be expensive, plan on getting your protein from other sources such as canned fish, eggs, and beans.
Ensure plenty of variety in your meals so you don't get bored. Boredom can be a strong motivation to abandon your plan and just head out to a restaurant to eat, which can kill both your diet and your budget.

, Once you've chosen your meals for a week or so, you can shop for the appropriate foods and cook your meals in advance to save yourself time during the work week.If you have a handful of recipes for meals to eat throughout the week, it shouldn't take you more than two or three hours to prepare these meals in advance.
Once you've cooked your meals, all you have to do is freeze them. When it's time to eat, all you have to do is warm them up before enjoying a healthy meal.
You may want to invest in some plastic containers so you can divide meals you've cooked into portions and freeze them.

, Shopping sales and using coupons can be an effective way to save money on grocery items that you were planning on buying anyway; however, avoid buying items just because they're on sale if you can't fit them into your meal plan.The good thing about choosing simple recipes is that you may have some room to substitute ingredients such as vegetables if you see something you like that's on sale.
Be sure to check quantity requirements for some sales. You may have to buy more of something than you need to realize any significant savings.

, When you go to the grocery store, come armed with a list you've made based on the foods you need for the meals in your meal plan. Once you're at the grocery store, avoid any impulse buys or items that aren't on your list.When you get to the store, start at the outside (or perimeter) and work your way in, rather than going up and down the aisles from one end to the other. Grocery stores put their fresh, whole foods — which should be the bulk of your list — on the outside. More processed food and junk food can be found in the center aisles, which you should avoid.
Try to steer clear of end-caps and displays of items on sale. It may look like a great deal, but if it's not on your list, don't buy it.
Focus on whole foods that haven't been precooked or prepared. For example, a can of soup may seem relatively inexpensive, but may contain significant additives that you don't need and that won't help you lose weight. You can make your own soup with vegetables, meats, and complex carbohydrates.

, When buying meat, avoid the prime cuts which will be more expensive. Choice cuts are still quality meat at a price that can be significantly lower. Keep in mind you can do additional prep work on your meat at home.Avoid meat that's already sliced, such as prepackaged deli and sandwich meats. They'll be more expensive. You can buy meat and slice it yourself. One benefit of this is that you can slice it how you want and trim much of the fat.
You also can replace meat with other protein sources, such as beans, legumes, or eggs. These foods are less expensive than meat, and will ensure that you still get the protein you need for a healthy diet.

, Generally, the more packaging involved, the more expensive the food is going to be. Many things are packaged in individual servings for convenience, but it really won't take you too much time and effort to do the same thing yourself.Using plastic bags or small plastic containers, you can portion out larger quantities into individual servings yourself. Although you'll have to invest in the containers initially, you'll save significantly over time by buying the larger containers and splitting them up at home.
For example, you can buy a large container of plain yogurt for significantly less money than the smaller yogurt cups that contain only one serving. Split up your yogurt into individual servings at home, adding fruit if you don't like plain yogurt and want a little more flavor.

, In most grocery stores, you can find store brands for food that is just as good as the brand-name products — sometimes it even comes from the same place. Store brands are cheaper because there are no costs for advertising or branding involved.Many people believe that generic food is inferior to that produced by brands, but typically the same quality controls are in place.
While you may notice a difference with generic snack foods and other processed items, whole foods are usually exactly the same.

, You often can save money on your fruits and vegetables if you buy food that was grown locally when it's in season. If there's a farmer's market near you, this may be the best place for you to stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables.Keep in mind that you may have to adjust your recipes to make use of the particular types of food that are in season at various times of the year.
If you really want to get creative as well as save a lot of money, you can learn some simple freezing and canning techniques to preserve your fresh fruits and vegetables for longer. This way you can buy larger quantities and not have to worry about them spoiling.

, Keep your eye on sales, and when one of your favorite foods is available at a discount, buy larger quantities and freeze it so you'll have plenty to last you for a longer period of time.Don't do this with things that you only eat rarely, or you won't really be saving any money. But if it's one of your favorite foods that you eat at least once or twice every week, this is a good option.

, Whole grains have an extremely long shelf life, so you can save a significant amount of money if you buy large bags rather than just buying small quantities to eat at a particular meal.When you take care of your grains, you don't have to worry about them on a weekly basis when you make your regular grocery store trips.
Whole grains have lower fat and calories than white bread, rice, and pasta. You also can use them as a base for many different types of food.
Keep in mind that you also can buy whole wheat bread in bulk when it's on sale and freeze it to eat later.

, When you're buying in bulk, if you can't freeze or keep the food you buy, you'll end up having to throw a lot of it away. This can eliminate any savings you might have made from buying in bulk.Check the shelf life of foods you buy in large quantities. You might want to post the dates somewhere prominently so you don't inadvertently eat something that's gone bad.
Buying in bulk with the intention of freezing the food isn't an option if you have limited freezer space. Keep in mind that you'll be freezing the weekly meals you prepare in advance as well.

, Most cities have a discount or warehouse club nearby where you buy a membership and get massive quantities of food at a significantly lower price per ounce than you would pay in the grocery store.Before you make the decision to join the club, make sure your potential savings will be more than the cost of a membership. You may want to go as a guest of someone who is already a member so you can check out what the club offers.
If you don't see a lot of foods that you eat on a regular basis, buying a membership isn't actually going to save you any money.
Download a smartphone app for your local store if they offer one and add coupons digitally.

Plan meals that have the right number of calories.,
Choose healthy foods.,
Drink plenty of water, especially before a meal.,
Check the calorie content of every food item before you buy it.,
Look up calories on nutritional websites.,
Get out the measuring spoons and cups to keep serving sizes exact.,
Write down everything you eat and drink, and record the number of calories per item.,
Expect it to get easier.,
Get a tally counter.,
Be patient.",How to Count Calories2," Life is busy; it’s easy to eat whatever is in the house or to head for the nearest drive-through and order something that sounds good. Instead, resisting the urge to eat junk food, plan what you will eat each day. To keep yourself on track, buy the necessary groceries to get you through a few days or a week.


In the beginning, this exercise will be harder because you won't be very good at estimating which foods have which calories. After a few weeks of being strict with yourself, you should be a pro at estimating how caloric certain foods are.

, Healthy foods may not taste the greatest, but they usually have far fewer calories in them, meaning that you can eat more of it. On the flip side, unhealthy foods usually have more calories; a large cola at McDonald's weighs in at over 300 calories, about the same as a McDonald's cheeseburger.That's a lot of calories for a drink. When looking for foods, generally choose:


Lean, white protein (chicken breast, fish, tofu) instead of dark, fatty meat

Colorful, fresh fruits and vegetables instead of dried fruits and vegetables

Whole wheat grains (brown rice, whole grain bread) instead of processed grains (white rice, white bread)

Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated and trans fats

Omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed, cod liver oil, and salmon
Nuts, seeds, and grains instead of sweets and candies


, Water is essential for the health of your body's organs. It also takes up space in your stomach, suppressing your appetite. Best of all, water contains absolutely no calories. That's like stealing calories each time you drink. (Your body spends calories digesting food and water.) If you're serious about losing weight, drink water and stay away from any sweetened drinks like ""energy"" drinks, sodas, or fruit juices. Unsweetened green tea is acceptable to drink.

, Whether it’s bread, snacks or packaged frozen foods, check the product’s number of calories per serving and choose the one with the lowest reading.


If you're younger, go with your parents when they go grocery shopping. It'll be a bonding experience, and you'll get to pick out healthy, nutritional foods for yourself, with dietary information that you can understand.
Pay attention to serving sizes. If a nutritional label says the entire package has about 4 servings, then divide the entire contents of the package into 4 even groups. One group is equal to one serving.

, Not all foods have packaging that shows the number of calories, but there are many websites that tell you the calories of nearly any food. Just make sure that after you check the calories for a 4-oz. piece of fish, for example, you eat only that much.

, This way, you will know you really are putting exactly a tablespoon of creamer in the coffee or ¼ cup of cheese in scrambled eggs.

, You can use a computer spreadsheet program to make this easier. Record what you eat (even on a scrap of paper), and plug the information into your spreadsheet at the end of the day. Then, total up the calories. Not only does writing it down help you to stay motivated and on track, it is also helpful to look back and see the calories of certain foods you eat regularly.


One plus of having a food journal is that it will help you remember healthy dishes that you really liked. Put it down in your journal and you're less likely to forget that grilled asparagus with quinoa is actually pretty darn good.

, In the beginning, when you don’t know the number of calories of any food item, counting calories requires quite a bit of time and research, which can be frustrating. But once you automatically know an apple is 70 calories or a favorite granola bar is 90 calories, it becomes much easier.

, You can find them for less than $1 apiece on most auction sites. Increase the count every time you eat something (it's most practical to make one click per 10 calories consumed).


Alternatively, many smartphones have apps available that will look up caloric values for you, as well as calculate how many calories you should consume per day if you want to lose weight.

, Don't expect your weight loss program to happen overnight. Too often, people with really good intentions get discouraged right before they start to see real results. Had they just kept with it for a little bit longer, they would have started reaping the rewards. So stick with your program, believe in it, and be patient. You owe it to yourself.

Watch for high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).,
Use neotame.,
Pay attention to advantame.,
Watch for aspartame.,
Look for sucralose.,
Watch for saccharin.,
Consider acesulfame potassium.",How to Choose Healthy Sugar Substitutes," Ask your doctor to recommend a sweetener based on your particular health condition. In general, natural sweeteners are safer and offer more nutrients than artificial sweeteners.


You'll still need to limit your sugar and sweetener intake, regardless of the substitute you choose.Remember there really is no ""healthy"" sugar.
Your doctor may recommend that you eat naturally sweet foods instead of adding artificial sweeteners to food. For example, you might pick dark chocolate or fresh fruits instead of a beverage sweetened with aspartame.;
, Honey is a natural sweetener that has 21 calories per teaspoon (or 3 calories per gram). It can be used in baking and cooking. If you're looking for a safe sweetener, honey has no known safety concerns, although you shouldn't give it to children under the age of 1 due to the of the risk of infant botulism.Honey is frequently used in medicine to treat many conditions, heal wounds, and for its antibacterial properties., Stevia is an herb that comes from the plant Stevia rebaudiana. It's approximately 60 times sweeter than table sugar. Stevia has no calories and no nutrients. Because of this, it's often used to help lose weight although studies are needed to support this.There are no proven side effects associated with stevia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) both consider stevia to be safe.If you notice an aftertaste, stevia can be combined with sugar to hide its bitter aftertaste., Sugar alcohols (sorbitol, xylitol and mannitol) are naturally found in foods. They contain 10 calories per teaspoon, but are also only half as sweet as table sugar. Because they aren't linked to tooth disease or obesity, dentists often recommend sugar alcohols. Since they are a sweetener, you should still try to cut back on them.Sugar alcohols are not as easily broken down by the body as table sugar. They can cause gas, bloating, and diarrhea.
Xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and cats. Make sure your pets do not ingest xylitol or anything containing the sweetener. If you suspect they have ingested it, immediately call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435.

, This comes from the agave plant, a type of cactus. It's similar in taste, texture, and appearance to honey and has 20 calories per teaspoon. Agave nectar is sweeter than table sugar and contains fructose, which is usually found in fruit.


Be aware that agave nectar is associated with health problems. It may increase blood lipid levels, reduce insulin sensitivity, and increase the risk of diabetes when eaten in large amounts., Most artificial sweeteners have not been tested thoroughly and products often contain several types of sweetener. This can make it hard to figure out how much sweetener you're actually eating. Read the nutrition information and ingredients list to make an informed decision. Learn about a variety of sweeteners so that you can recognize them in everyday products.Ignore advertising that calls a sweetener ""natural."" Since artificial sweeteners often come from a natural source (like herbs or sugar), they might be labeled ""natural"" even though they're very processed.
Studies show that some artificial sweeteners are safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women., HFCS is cornstarch that has been turned into fructose. While it only contains 17 calories per teaspoon, it has been associated with obesity, heart disease and prediabetes, in several well-controlled studies.Read labels for HFCS. Since it is an inexpensive sweetener, it is used in many products, so be in the habit of reading labels.


The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) recommends cutting back on HFCS.The American Heart Association recommends that most women get no more than 100 calories (about 6 teaspoons or 25 g) of added sugar daily and men get no more than 150 calories (9 teaspoons or 37.5 g)., Neotame is a new sweetener that has zero calories and zero nutrients. It's 7,000 to 10,000 times sweeter than table sugar and has not been linked to any health problems. It is one of the only artificial sweeteners listed by The Center for Science in the Public Interest as safe.Neotame is not used in many products, possibly because it is more expensive than other artificial sweeteners.

, Advantame is a new sweetener that is similar to aspartame and vanillin (an artificial flavoring). It is 100 times sweeter than aspartame. The FDA and European Food Safety Authority have approved advantame to be used in a variety of products.Because studies are ongoing, pay attention to any health reports about advantame that are released., Aspartame is a popular sweetener with zero calories and zero nutrients that's frequently found in diet foods and sodas. While there has been some speculation that aspartame might be a carcinogen, the FDA has found that this is not true and it is safe to consume.Do not consume aspartame if you have phenylketonuria, which is a genetic disorder., Sucralose (brand name Splenda®) is a chemical sweetener. It's frequently used in foods because it has no calories and is resistant to heat. It has studied extensively and more than 110 safety studies were reviewed by FDA before it was approved as safe.Since sucralose is found in many foods (ice cream, breads, baked goods, soft drinks), it's easy to eat large amounts. Limit the amount of sucralose you give to small children, since they can easily get more sucralose than the FDA recommends., This sweetener (Sweet and Low®, Sweet Twin®, Sweet'N Low®, and Necta Sweet®) with zero calories and zero nutrients is not as widely used as in the past because it's largely been replaced by aspartame and better tasting artificial sweeteners. Saccharin was once believed to be a carcinogen, but further research and human trials have proven it to be safe for human consumption.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) still recommends avoiding saccharin.

, This sweetener (Sunett® and Sweet One®) has no calories and no nutrients. It's 200 times sweeter than sugar. It is heat-stable so may be found in baked goods and many other products. It is not approved to use with poultry or meat.While acesulfame potassium has no calories, research doesn't show that it helps with blood sugar or weight management."

Eat fruits and veggies.,
Bulk up on fiber.,
Be picky with your protein.,
Include resistant starches.,
Favor whole grains.,
Use a calorie counter.",How to Feel Fuller on Fewer Calories1," Keep your calorie intake down while filling yourself up at the same time with these healthy snacks and sides. To feel the most full with the fewest calories, choose those that have the highest water content (and thus the fewest calories). These include:Cantaloupe, celery, cucumber, green pepper, iceberg lettuce, spinach, strawberries, and watermelon (90-92% water).Oranges, pineapples, and raspberries (80-87% water).;
, Make that full-feeling last even longer once you’re done eating. Stick to foods that are rich in fiber, which takes a while to digest.Fiber-rich foods with few calories include fruits and vegetables; beans; nuts and seeds; whole grains.Since these foods are pretty much the core of vegan diets, buy vegan cookbooks to learn how to combine these into a variety of soups, salads, stews, and more.

, Proteins are often served as the centerpiece of meals (think meat), but just one serving can pack a lot of calories depending on what type you choose. So make smart choices. Stick to sources like:Fish and poultry
Beans, lentils, nuts, and seedsFruits and vegetables

, These contain prebiotics, which actually feed the healthy bacteria living in your digestive system instead of you. So reap the benefit of feeling fuller for longer with food that you won’t actually digest. Great sources for these starches are:Cold pasta (cooked, then chilled)Cold potatoes (cooked, then chilled)
Lentils
Raw oats
Underripe bananas

, When preparing carbohydrates, avoid refined grains. The refining process can strip away grains’ fiber content, which means the same amount won’t feel as filling. So stick to whole-grain products when choosing:Breads
Pastas
Rice
Oatmeal
Cereal

, Lowering your calorie-intake doesn't necessarily mean that you have to stick exclusively to foods with the absolute lowest number of calories. However, if you have precise goals when it comes your daily goals, do the math. Look up the exact number of calories contained in the specific low-calorie foods you choose, as well as any high-calorie food that you treat yourself to. Online resources include:

Read nutrition labels.,
Look for healthy recipes online.,
Look at the menu in advance.,
Talk with your server.,
Eat a look-alike dessert.",How to Choose Low‐Calorie Desserts1," If you are shopping for a dessert at the grocery store, give yourself some extra time to look over the label details. Pay attention to the number of calories listed towards the top of each label. Then, see how many of these calories come directly from fat. You want to find a dessert with low calories that also contains a low amount of fat.Make sure to only compare similar dessert items to one another. Otherwise, you may make a false comparison due to differing serving sizes. For example, it is a good idea to compare various ice creams, but putting these numbers up against a muffin’s food label may not provide a clear picture.;
, Open your browser and search for “low-calorie desserts.” You will find a ton of websites listing off easy-to-make, or even gourmet, recipes. Go through these recipes and save the ones that interest you. You can then make them yourself, or order something similar when eating out.For example, if you are a fan of brownies, you can learn how to make them the lower-calorie way using sunflower oil and sugar substitutes.
Or, you can make a layered carrot cake using reduced-fat cream cheese and a reduced amount of oil, sugar, and butter.

, If you are going out to eat, hop online and see if you can view the menu. Pay particular attention to their dessert offerings. Making a dessert choice in advance will help you to avoid getting a high-calorie “impulse buy.” You can also scope out how certain desserts could be modified to suit your preferences, such as requesting that the whipped cream be left off or more fruits be added.


Some restaurants may list how many calories each dessert contains. This information may appear on the dessert menu or on a separate nutritional flyer.

, If you are eating out, don’t be afraid to ask your server questions and to see if they can make certain healthy substitutions or changes to the dessert offerings for you. You might tell them that you are trying to keep your calories low, but would still like a dessert. Ask them what your best option would be.


For example, you might say, “I’m currently trying to reduce my calorie intake. Is there a healthy dessert that appears on the menu or could be special ordered?”
If you cannot find out the ingredients or nutrition information, you may have to judge based on what the menu states. Try to choose a dessert that contains fruit, and avoid choices that have cream, whipped topping, icing, or candy.

, If you are craving a high-calorie sweet, try to satisfy this feeling with a doppelganger dessert. You want something that has a similar texture and flavor to the high-calorie alternative. If you want ice cream, you could try out a low-calorie version. You could also get sorbet or an ice pop instead.Some people find that dessert-flavored yogurts are a great way to fight off cravings while indulging in a familiar taste."

Be aware of the science behind your Basic Metabolic Rate (BMR).,
Factor in your age, weight, and gender.,
Determine how active you are on a weekly basis.,
Use your BMR and your fitness goals to determine your calorie intake.,
Create a diet based on your calorie intake.,
Record your calorie intake per a day.,
Update your BMR after several months of healthy eating and exercise.",How to Calculate Calories per Day," Your BMR is the estimated amount of calories your body burns when it is not moving, or at rest. This amount represents the minimum energy your body needs to function, from breathing to maintaining a heartbeat.You use about two-thirds of your daily calories to maintain your BMR, so the daily caloric intake needed to allow you to lose weight or gain weight (and still function as a person) will be based on your BMR.;
, Your BMR is based on your age, height, weight, and gender. Most calorie calculators use the Harris-Benedict equation to determine how many calories you should be eating every day.For men, your BMR is equal to: 65 + (6.2 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)
For women, your BMR is equal to: 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.3 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)

, Calorie calculators also factor in your level of activity. If you are very active, for example, with hard exercise almost every day of the week, you may need to consume more calories than if you lead a more sedentary lifestyle, where you do little to no activity. Be honest with yourself about your level of activity; many people over-estimate their daily activity level. The five different levels of activity are:Sedentary: You have a desk job where you sit all day long and do little to no exercise every week.
Lightly active: You do light exercise or play sports, one to three days a week.
Moderately active: You do moderate exercise or play sports, three to five days a week.
Very active: You do hard, intense exercise or play sports, six to seven days a week.
Extremely active: You do intense daily exercise or sports twice a day, and have a physical labor job or are doing a training camp for football or another contact sport.

, You can put all of the above information in calorie counting tool that will estimate your required calories per a day, based on your BMR, available here. Once you have your estimated calorie intake, consider how you will reduce or increase your calorie intake per a day based on your fitness goals.If you are trying to lose weight, reduce your estimated calorie intake by 500 per a day. Balance your fitness plan by eating 250 calories less a day and exercising enough to burn 250 calories. Try walking or running 2.5 miles a day. When planning your meals, cut back on portion sizes to reduce the amount of calories you consume by 250.
Remember that a pound of body fat is comprised of 3,500 calories, thus subtracting 500 calories per day over seven days will result in one pound weight loss per week.
If you are trying to gain weight, eat 500 calories more per day and limit your cardio exercises. Focus on strength training, involving free weights, to add lean muscle mass. You should also be eating at least one gram per pound of body weight of protein and get plenty of rest to recover after your workouts.
Always start by reducing or increasing your calorie intake a little at a time, no more than 500 calories either way. This will prevent your body from going into shock and ensure you are consuming enough calories to allow your body to function., Use your estimated BMR, minus or plus 500 calories based on your fitness goals, to create meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Always eat three meals a day, and balance out the protein, vegetables, and healthy fats on your plate to maintain a healthy diet.


For example, you might be a 28 year old female who weighs 140 pounds and is very active. You do intense exercise seven days a week, with one hour at the gym every other day and recreational soccer two days a week. Your estimated calorie intake, based on your BMR, is around 2050 a day. If you are looking to lose weight, you would remove 500 calories by subtracting 250 calories from your daily intake and burning 250 more calories during your exercise routine. You would now consume 1,800 calories a day and add more exercise to your existing routine to burn 250 extra calories.
It is very easy to overeat when following a limited diet, so it is important to create a meal plan and stick to it.
You could break down your 1,800 calories a day further into each meal, so 600 per a meal (600 x 3) or you could allot more calories for lunch and dinner and less calories for breakfast (500 for breakfast, 650 for lunch, and 650 for dinner).
Avoid under eating by consuming less than your estimated amount of calories, based on your fitness goal. This will lead to unhealthy weight loss and a lack of energy. It’s always better to burn off weight, rather than starve it off. You should also avoid overeating if your goal is to gain weight by building up muscle mass, as you will need the right amount of energy to get through your workouts., Start a food journal that charts your daily calorie intake, as well as the amount of exercise you are doing every week. Though you should not be too concerned about your weight on a scale, you should also note how much your weight fluctuates every week.


You can also download a calorie counting app on your phone so you can easily record your calorie intake for the day.After several weeks of healthy eating, based on a well estimated calorie intake, as well as exercise, you should start to notice changes in your body weight and your energy levels. Consuming enough calories to maintain your body’s functions and give you enough fuel to do daily exercise, means you will not end up losing or gaining weight in an unhealthy way.
Accountability is key. It is very easy to consume too much food in one sitting when you are not properly measuring and recording your foods for the day.

, Once you start to notice results, you may want to go back into a calorie calculator and adjust your BMR profile. Update the amount of exercise you are doing every week, as well as your total weight. Based on the calorie calculator results, you may need to reduce the number of calories you eat further or increase the number of calories you consume every week.

Add more non-starchy vegetables to your meals.,
Include a starter.,
Pair high-calorie foods with low-calorie ones.,
Play with proportions.,
Make soup your entree.",How to Feel Fuller on Fewer Calories2," Working more non-starchy vegetables into the meals you prepare can help you to cut back on calories without having to eat less. Try topping your pizza with lots of vegetables, layer some veggies into a lasagna, or puree veggies to add to soups and sauces.

There are all kinds of ways to add vegetables to your meals, including pureeing them, grating them in, and using them as a topping.
There are even ways that you can include vegetables in your desserts.

, Either order or fix yourself an appetizer with each meal. Use low-calorie ingredients to start filling yourself up before the main entree, especially if it’s higher in calories. When ordering out, ask the server to hold any high-calorie ingredients or place them on the side so you can keep your intake to a minimum.Start off with dishes like salads and soups.
Stick to vegetables and nix high-calorie ingredients like meat and cheeses.
Avoid extras like bread and crackers.Stick to low calorie dressings on salads, such as light vinaigrettes, or just use balsamic or red wine vinegar as a dressing for zero calories.

, Say you’re salivating for your favorite high-calorie item. Instead of eating it all by itself, minimize your intake by serving yourself less than usual and then adding more bulk with foods containing fewer calories. Fill yourself up with just as much volume, but significantly less calories. For instance:Prepare yourself only half of your normal serving of cereal, pancakes, or waffles and then cover it with fruits.
Instead of eating a whole grilled cheese sandwich, only make a half-sandwich and eat it with a bowl of tomato soup.
Make yourself a slider instead of a full burger, and pair it with cold roasted potatoes instead of hot french fries.

, When following recipes, identify which ingredients have the highest calories. Then tinker with the amounts. Lower the volume of high-calorie foods (or even nix them entirely) and make up the difference by either increasing the lower ones or adding new low-calorie ingredients. For example:When making chili, halve the amount of ground beef that you usually use. Either add more beans than the recipe calls for, or fill the void with non-starchy vegetables like tomatoes, zucchini, red or green bell peppers, and carrots.
Use fewer slices of meat and cheese in sandwiches and bulk it up instead with more tomatoes, onions, lettuce, or any other veggies that you use.
Mix or replace meat with vegan substitutes, which often have significantly fewer calories than the real thing.

, Water has zero calories, so use soup to fill yourself up. Whether it’s for lunch or dinner, serve soup as a main dish daily. Ensure that at least one meal each day will be low in calories but just as filling as any other.Favor broth-based soups over cream-based ones, which have more calories.
Prioritize vegetables and especially beans and lentils, which are high in fiber, protein, and resistant starches.

Pay attention to presentation.,
Make each meal the main event.,
Take your time while eating.,
Drink water.",How to Feel Fuller on Fewer Calories3," Be aware that your eyes can play tricks on your stomach. Expect to feel less full when your food doesn’t completely fill the dishware that it’s served on. Expect the same when your food is served as a single piece, instead of many. Even though the actual volume of food is the same in either case, fool your eyes into thinking that you’re eating more by:


Serving single-dish meals with smaller plates, bowls, and cups so it takes up all available space.
Serving entrees and side dishes with everything on one plate if possible (soup being an obvious exception).Cutting whole foods (fruits, veggies, meat, etc) into strips or bite-size pieces before serving.

, Whenever you eat, make that your primary activity, not a secondary one. Set your work aside. Keep the TV off. If you go to a fast-food place, sit in the restaurant instead of picking at food from the drive-thru while you drive.Eating while your attention is focused on something else can lead you to eating more than you need in two ways.
Because your brain is engaged in something else, it may not register that you’re full right away, which means you will keep eating.
Then, even though you may have eaten a full meal, you may feel like you need to eat again sooner than you otherwise would, just because what you remember most is doing something else.

, Remember: you can shovel food into your mouth much quicker than your stomach can process it. Give it a chance to get a sense of how much or how little food it is receiving. Know when you’ve had enough before you eat too much, instead of only realizing it after the fact. To slow yourself down:

Chew slower or more thoroughly than normal.
Avoid large utensils so you can take smaller mouthfuls at a time.
Pause to enjoy the smell each fork- or spoonful before each bite.
Take a couple deep breaths after each swallow before continuing.
Wait a few minutes (five, ten, or even twenty) before deciding on seconds.

, Expect your brain to sometimes mix its messages, since the same part of it that alerts you when your body feels hungry is also responsible for telling you when you’re just plain thirsty. Whenever you think you feel hungry, pour yourself a glass of water before fixing yourself a snack. See if that alone does the trick.Stick to plain water. Since fruits are a great low-calorie food, fruit juices may seem just as good. However, these are concentrated and they have more calories per serving.Drinking one or two glasses of water right before eating can help fill you up before you even start.
Sipping water between each bite can also help fill you up while slowing your eating down, making you more likely to recognize when you feel full.

Choose a dessert with few ingredients.,
Go with butter substitutes.,
Look for dairy milk substitutes.,
Look for a Greek yogurt substitution.,
Select desserts with secret veggies.,
Pick something with spices.,
Select a low-fat or no whipped topping.",How to Choose Low‐Calorie Desserts2," Low-calorie desserts often contain a streamlined ingredients list. The limited list also makes it easier to calculate the calories per portion. Look for a recipe that has a limited amount of butter, sugar, salt, and other refined starches as well.For example, try out a pumpkin pie with only four ingredients: pumpkin puree, egg whites, a sweetener of choice, and cinnamon., Butter can quickly add to the number of calories that you consume. It is also not that good for the body. Look for baked goods that contain butter alternatives, such as apple sauce, prune puree, or flax meal.If you are cooking, try to cut the amount of butter in half at least., Full-fat milk, heavy whipping cream, half-and-half, and buttermilk can add a number of calories to your dessert dishes. Try to choose desserts that use non-dairy alternatives, such as coconut milk mixed with vinegar or lemon.You may be able to replace cream or half-and-half with whole or 2% milk instead. This will cut down on the number of calories in the recipe.

, Greek yogurt is a great low-calorie dessert ingredient. Chocolate desserts, in particular, can benefit from both the taste and texture of added yogurt. When you are baking, see if you can use yogurt as a sweetener. You can also ask restaurants if they offer a yogurt-based dessert, as it will often be lower in calories., Some recipes that you make at home may actually contain vegetables as an ingredient. This is generally a good sign that it will be low in calories and high in healthy fiber. You usually cannot taste the veggies and the may not affect the texture either.For example, you can mix avocado or zucchini into chocolate chip cookies. Some bakers also use carrot or beetroot juice for extra sweetness., Chili powder is often an unexpected, but flavorful addition to low-calorie desserts. You may also see the more traditional cinnamon, cocoa powder, or vanilla. A well-spiced dessert can make-up for the absent calories by elevating the level of taste. For example, ancho chili and chocolate goat cheesecake popsicles are unusual and flavorful., Whipped cream and other sugary toppings add on tons of calories. If you are eating out, choose a low-calorie dessert and ask that the server leave off any toppings and sauces. If you are making the dessert, skip the toppings and instead make a fruit syrup or sprinkle a little bit of shredded coconut on top.For example, a peach-rhubarb crisp often comes with a whipped topping, but you can opt to place a dollop of Greek yogurt on top instead for fewer calories."
"
Stick to a single serving size.,
Eat mini-versions.,
Try brittle or bark.,
Eat a dip dessert.,
Split a dessert.,
Follow the three bite rule.,
Drink something sweet.",How to Choose Low‐Calorie Desserts3," When you see a low-calorie dessert, it is very easy to reason out that it is okay to eat more rather than less. Instead, segment out one serving of the dessert and when you are finished with that portion, you are done. It might help to drink water as you eat to make the dessert last longer.Overeating low-calorie desserts can quickly increase the amount of calories, fat, and sugar that you are eating. This will negate the purpose of eating a low-calorie dessert in the first place.

, Satisfy your desire to sample a variety of desserts by selecting bite-sized portions. Some desserts, such as mini cupcakes, make this easy as they naturally come in a low-calorie package. A skinny mini red velvet cupcake can contain just 150 calories. However, just make sure to limit the amount of dessert bites that you consume., This is a great option because you can break off a segment, thus limiting your total calories consumed. You can even continue to break down the bark, making you feel as if you are eating a series of small desserts. You can also make a low-calorie brittle or bark by using healthy mix-ins, such as poppy or sesame seeds.You can also do a dark chocolate bark with tart cherries mixed in. This gives you the benefit of the cherries’ and chocolate’s antioxidants. Small pieces of this bark average around 95 calories., Slice or peel a few of your favorite fruits, such as apples and oranges. To maintain portion control, set aside two handfuls of slices. Get a container of Greek yogurt or dark chocolate for dipping. Then, dip and enjoy a low-calorie dessert or snack. You can also use biscotti or pretzels for dipping if you are in the mood for something less sweet and more salty., This is a great way to save calories. Order a dessert off the menu, or make one at home, and then share it with someone else. You can even split one dessert between several people. This guarantees that you will not overeat and divides the calories so that you can indulge., If you're unsure about the calorie content of a dessert or if you're craving a high calorie dessert, you can try following the three bite rule to prevent yourself from overindulging. You should only take three bites of the dessert before stopping. The idea is that the dessert will not taste as good after the third bite, so there is no reason to continue eating it. This rule will let you eat any dessert, as long as you can stop after three bites., It can be dangerous to your health to drink your calories. But, if you do so purposefully, and use a drink as a dessert, then it can be a good option. To keep your portion size under control, limit yourself to one drink only too. For example, if you mix cranberry juice, mint, and lime over ice, it makes a light summer dessert drink."

Avoid all “fast foods.” Fast foods, even salads, are full of hidden carbohydrates.",How to Stop Enjoying Carbs," Bread is the most common simple carbohydrate we consume and the one that is easiest to remove.


Try lettuce wraps. Romaine lettuce works well to substitute for flat breads, while butter lettuce and radicchio make an excellent substitute for sandwich bread. Simple add sandwich filling to the lettuce and fold over and around, or add a second piece of lettuce to the top.Go whole grain. If you must have bread, eat only the whole-grain variety and, if possible, enriched with the germ intact.Embrace mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms act as a great substitute for sandwich bread or buns and are an excellent source of vitamin D.;
, Pasta, like bread, is a processed grain product that, if you must eat, should be consumed in whole grain varieties. Below are some substitutions for pasta:


Try quinoa. Quinoa (pronounced “keen-waa”) is a high-protein, low carb grain that can be substituted for pastas in soups and salads.Use vegetables. Zucchini can be substituted for lasagna and fettuccine noodles when sliced into long ribbons. Spaghetti squash and broccoli slaw can also be used in place of spaghetti noodles. Simply blanch lightly and use in place of noodles during preparation. Use shirataki noodles. Shirataki noodles are a carb-less and practically calorie free noodle made in Japan from yam starch. The texture differs slightly from traditional wheat noodles, but it comes in several different shapes and can be substituted in nearly any noodle dish., Rice, much like bread and pasta, is a staple food across a large part of the world. It is also high carb, especially in its processed, “white” form, and should be avoided on a low-carb diet. Enjoy one of the following substitutes instead:


Vegetable sushi. Use matchstick sliced carrot, cucumber, turnip, or squash instead of rice when making sushi.
Try “riced” cauliflower. Simply grate or food-process cauliflower until it is the texture of rice. Spread thinly on a baking sheet and toast until slightly dried and roasted. Use in place of rice in any recipe.Use quinoa. Not only is it the highest protein of available grains, it is much more nutritionally beneficial and has a similar texture to rice. Add it to soups, or serve cooked quinoa in place of rice in stir-fry.Choose brown rice. When you do eat rice, always choose the brown variety. Because it is less processed than it's white counterpart, it maintains part of the fibrous, natural coating of the rice grains. Fiber digests more slowly than pure carbs, meaning that the carbohydrates in the rice do not breakdown and absorb as quickly, keeping blood sugar more steady.

, Breakfast cereal, instant oatmeal, and grits (to name a few) are popular meals to start the day. They are, however, almost entirely composed of simple carbohydrates and can have a negative impact on insulin and blood sugar.


Scrambled eggs. Not only are eggs a good source of protein and beneficial fats but they are carb free. Dress them up with some chopped spinach, broccoli, or mushrooms to increase nutritional benefit.
Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt is a great source of low fat protein and a good way to start your morning. Add some fresh fruit or a swirl of honey for added flavor.
Eat whole grain. If you are treating yourself to oatmeal for breakfast, be sure to choose the ""steel cut"" or ""whole oat"" variety. Unlike it's processed counterpart ""rolled oats,"" whole grain oatmeal actually suppresses appetite and breaks down slowly, maintaining healthy blood sugar., Beans and nuts are complex carbohydrates and, when incorporated in moderate amounts, offer depth and fullness to foods like quinoa pilaf and salads.Simple sprinkle in a few cooked kidney beans, toasted sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds with any salad or pilaf.

, Sweet potatoes are marginally lower in carbohydrate than their white counterparts, but they are nutritionally more complex, acting as an excellent source of beta carotene and vitamin A.A comforting and tasty potato side dish is to take half a sweet potato and sprinkle with a teaspoon or two of lime juice (to taste). Mash together and eat.

, Dairy is a good source of fats, protein, and lactase, a type of naturally occurring sugar. It can be used in place of processed or fruit sugars after workouts or as a snack.Try keeping cottage cheese around for those sugar cravings, or add a slice of cheese to your lunch lettuce wrap.

, Green peas contain both fiber and the illness fighting power of zinc. They also provide a reasonable amount of good carbs. Eat cold in salads and puree or add whole into soups., Carrots contain natural sugars with a corresponding dose of fiber. They can satisfy a sweet tooth while also providing vitamin A and beta carotene., Your body depends on whole grains for nutrients like vitamin B, folic acid and fiber, necessary for good digestion. When choosing carbohydrates for meals, always look for whole grain bread and tortillas, or dredge meats in bran meal rather than breadcrumbs before baking, to insure you are getting the most complex and nutritionally- enriched carbs possible., Candy is a terribly source of nutrition, is bad for teeth and digestion, and only provides simple carbohydrates. Save sugary treats like this for only rare occasions or substitute entirely with fresh fruit to snack on.


Keep a tupperware of fruit salad in your refrigerator for sweet cravings.
Make chocolate pudding with cocoa powder, vanilla flavoring, skim milk and a sugar substitute like Splenda., Frozen yogurt is a reasonable substitute for ice cream; however, you do one better by by making your own frozen yogurt.


Choose your favorite seasonal fruit. Peaches, berries, even apples work great. Just chop or mash.
Add sweetener and or spice (i.e. cinnamon) if you like
Add 1-2 cups of greek yogurt (depending on amount of fruit) and mix.
Spoon into waxed cups or plastic wrap-lined muffin or pie tins and smooth out.
Put in the freezer for at least 4 hours or even over night (for the waxed cups, insert a popsicle stick or straw for a handle before freezing)
Your frozen yogurt is ready to serve!

, Sodas and alcohol are entirely comprised of simple sugars, which cause irregular blood sugar and can make you feel hungry even while you are full. Even diet sodas have been shown to have a negative impact on gastrointestinal health, contributing to insulin resistance and weight gain.If you want something cold, fizzy, and refreshing, grab some naturally-flavored sparkling water, found on the same grocery aisle as sodas.

, Aside from being high in simple carbs like white flour and sugar, these foods pack a double-punch of poor nutrition. Processes like hydrogenation can take normally healthful foods like butter, milk and vegetable oil and transform them into foods that increase cholesterol and contribute to heart disease.Make your own snack nuggets using tahini, sesame seeds, and pistachios, or bake a pan of homemade protein bars.Bake some spiced kale chips., In order to fry properly, foods must the coated in a layer of processed flour or breadcrumbs and cooked in oil. This increases fat and simple carbohydrate content.


Instead, bake, grill, or broil meats and vegetables. This renders fat and browns the food, caramelizing and creating flavor without added fat or carbs.Craving fried chicken? Drop chicken tenders in an egg wash, then dredge in a coating of crushed bran flakes. Bake on a foil covered baking sheet at 350-degrees until done throughout and crispy.

, Additionally, fast foods are poor in nutrition and intensely processed, causing them to contain trans fat and simple sugars, both of which are bad for health.Carry healthy snacks in your car or purse. Fruit and nut bars (e.g. Kind bars, Lara Bars, Cliff Bars, etc.) can help you feel full and keep your blood sugar balanced.
Pack a healthy lunch for work. Make tuna or chicken salad and eat with whole grain crackers, a slice of whole grain bread, or wrap in lettuce.
Bring a cooler on road trips. Pack things like veggie sticks, grape tomatoes, low-fat flavored cream cheese, whole grain melba toasts, sliced apples or snack-tins of fruit, a canister of low-salt almonds, and cheese sticks (just to name a few possible choices). Make sure you have something for all sweet, salty, and creamy cravings.

Watch out for sugars that are super-refined or contain artificial ingredients or chemicals.,
Read labels on processed food products to determine the total caloric value of the food.,
Limit the amount of low value carbohydrate calories in your total diet by avoiding candy, soft drinks, and high sugar content cereals, which also are attributed to contributing to tooth decay, and may also lead to diabetes.

,
Learn about the benefits of raw carbohydrates to a healthy diet.",How to Know Good Carbs from Bad," Whole wheat flour and highly refined wheat flours are both carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs, but the highly processed wheat flours contain less fiber, and the other nutrients may be depreciated in the refining process.;
, If extra salt, oils, or preservatives have been added, they may be less healthy for many people than more basic foods made with these foods.

, Some people have reservations about the use of high fructose corn syrup as a sweetener, for example, and may prefer natural sweeteners like honey or raw sugars instead.

, Although most slices of common white bread have the same amount of carbohydrates, the addition of vegetable oils, sweeteners, and other ingredients may change the total calorie count of a slice of bread.

Start glycogen loading before your event.,
Reduce your training during this time.,
Experiment with a glycogen load diet before an event.,
Expect to gain a few pounds.",How to Glycogen Load1," You should glycogen load the week before your high-endurance activity. This helps gives your muscles enough time to store the glycogen in your muscles that you will turn into energy.Try doing this three or four days before your endurance workout.;
, Since your goal is to reserve your energy and store it in your muscles, you should go easy on the training on the days you’re glycogen loading. Training will use up some of the energy.One to three days before your endurance event, do no activity. Instead, rest and save your energy for the event.

, If you are interested in using a glycogen load diet for an endurance event, you should experiment with the method before your event. Extreme dietary changes, like significantly increasing your carbohydrate intake, can mess up your digestive system.You want to work out any problems and figure out the best way to make the diet work for you before your big event.

, Because of your glycogen loading, you may gain up to five pounds. This is normal. Glycogen that is stored in your body stores water. This may cause your muscles to feel heavy with this added glycogen and water weight. However, as you go through your endurance event, the glycogen will be used and your muscles will feel lighter."
"
Eat moderate carbs for a few days before glycogen loading.,
Increase your carbohydrate intake.,
Reduce your fat.,
Eat enough protein.,
Choose complex carbs.,
Eat carb-heavy snacks.,
Eat small meals throughout the day.,
Prepare your menu.",How to Glycogen Load2," During the three days before you glycogen load, eat around two to three grams of carbohydrates per pound of body weight. This should increase your carbs slowly.For a person who weighs 160 pounds, you will be eating between 350 to 450 grams of carbohydrates.

, Glycogen loading is done by adding significantly more carbohydrates to your diet. Around 70 percent of your calories each day should be from carbohydrates during this period. To store enough glycogen to provide energy, try increasing your carbohydrates to around four or five grams for each pound of your body weight.To calculate how many carbs you need to eat, multiple four or five grams by your body weight.
For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, your carbohydrate intake during those few days will be around 720 grams.

, While you are glycogen loading, you should reduce the amount of fat in your diet. This helps your body have more room for the carbohydrates. It also doesn’t add more calories to your diet that you don’t need.For example, you wouldn’t have avocado, heavy oils, or nuts while carb loading.

, As you get ready for your endurance event, you want to make sure you eat enough protein. Protein can help your body process glycogen, and it can also be used for energy. In the weeks before your event, eat around 0.6 to 0.7 grams (0.02 to 0.02 oz) per pound of body weight.For example, you can eat lean chicken, grass-fed beef, fish, nuts, and Greek yogurt.

, Glycogen loading doesn’t mean you should eat any carbs you want. Simple carbs, like baked goods, cookies, donuts, or white pasta, are not going to give you the nutrition you need to do well in your endurance event. Instead, choose healthy complex carbohydrates.For example, try whole grain bread, wheat pasta, brown rice, oats, quinoa, barley, or other whole grains. Another good option may be energy bars or granola bars.
You can also try fruit, dried fruit, beans, legumes, or starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes..
Sports drinks, gels, and juices may help increase your carbohydrates. Make sure to combine these with complex carbohydrates to help balance the sugar.

, For snacks, you can eat foods high in carbohydrates. Go for grains, cereals, and granola, along with dried fruit. These foods can provide ample amount of carbs.Try raisin, dried cranberries, or other low-sugar dried fruit. Fruits like bananas, pineapple, apples, and melon also contain carbs. You may want to include low-sugar fruit juices.
Yogurt with granola, pretzels and crackers, oatmeal, baked tortilla chips, or cereal make good snacks.

, You may be more successful with your carbohydrate loading if you eat multiple small meals throughout the day instead of a few extremely large meals. Five or six meals throughout the day can help you get the amount of carbohydrates that you need without feeling sick., Figuring out exactly what to eat when carb-loading can be confusing. Add grains to each meal, like cereals, bread products, and rice. Fruit and fruit juice also helps increase your carbs. Drinking milk can also add carbs to your meals.For example, breakfast may include a bagel, banana or apple, nut butter, honey, cereal, or milk.
Lunch may consist of a meat, multiple slices of bread, carb-heavy vegetables like sweet potatoes or carrots, crackers, tortilla chips, and milk.
For dinner, you may eat meat, rolls, vegetables, and a banana or apple.

Do a rapid loading the day before.,
Do a glycogen load before a bodybuilding competition.,
Follow a week-long glycogen loading program.",How to Glycogen Load3," Your situation may not allow you to taper off your physical activity so you can glycogen load. You can still load your muscles the day before. Start by doing an intense workout 24 hours before your event. The workout should deplete all your glycogen in your muscles.After your workout, your diet should switch to a high carb diet, with five to six grams of carbs for each pound of your body weight.
During a rapid load, you would significantly decrease your protein and fat.
To calculate how many carbs to have each day, multiply five to six grams of carbs for each pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you will eat around 750 grams (26 oz) of carbohydrates.

, The other activity you may want to do a glycogen load for is a bodybuilding competition. Carb loading can help your body have a more muscular look by making your muscles fuller instead of flat. Leading up to your glycogen load, do a light circuit workout that targets your whole body to get rid of glycogen. Three days before your event, lower your carb intake to approximately 50 to 100 grams (1.8 to 3.5 oz).The evening before your event, eat carb-heavy meals every two hours with approximately 30 grams (1.1 oz) of carbs. The carbs should only be complex carbohydrates, like oatmeal, whole grains, sweet potatoes, or bananas.Have another meal of 30 grams (1.1 oz) of carbs when you wake up the next morning.
A couple of hours before your competition, have a meal with 50 grams (1.8 oz) of carbs and 30 grams of fat.

, An alternate way of carb loading for a competition is to alter your carb intake for seven days. Start by consuming low amounts of carbs for the first three days. Shoot for less than 50 grams each day. Two days after that, eat around 100 to 150 grams (4 to 5 oz).The final two days before your competition, consume a high amount of carbs. You should go try for over 150 grams.

Know when to carbohydrate load.,
Understand how carbohydrate loading impacts performance.,
Choose the best foods for carbohydrate loading.",How to Understand the Impact of Carbohydrate Loading1," For carbohydrate loading to have an impact, you must be doing an endurance activity lasting longer then 90 minutes. The muscles typically store enough energy for 60 to 90 minutes of activity. With carbohydrate loading you should have enough energy to last more than 90 minutes without fatigue.;
, Carbohydrate loading saturates the muscles with glycogen, which helps keep you from being fatigued. Not becoming fatigued during an event is important to finish. After loading, your performance may increase because you find you don’t need to slow down as much towards the end of the event and your muscles don’t feel as exhausted. Exhausted muscles can lead to cramps or injuries.

, Since carbohydrate loading affects the body and performance, it is important to choose the best foods for it. You will want to avoid high fat foods because they will negate the impact of carbohydrate loading. Also, you will want to avoid high fiber foods because they digest slower and may negatively impact performance by causing gas or bloating. You will need complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, and simple carbohydrates, such as grape jelly or sports drinks. It is important to take in these simple sources of carbohydrates in order to eat enough to saturate the muscles.

"
"
Decrease carbohydrates for 3 days 1 week before the event.,
After the 3 days of carbohydrate decrease, begin to taper off exercise.,
After the 3 days of carbohydrate decrease, increase carbohydrates to 70% to 75% of total calories.",How to Understand the Impact of Carbohydrate Loading2," You can continue to train during this time. You will need to make carbohydrates 50 to 55% of your total calorie intake. This will help deplete the muscles of glycogen stores. One gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories; if you are on a 2,500-calorie diet, you will need to consume between 312 g and 343 g of carbohydrates in a day.

, Your body needs to rest and not burn too much energy in order to be prepared for the event. Taking a break from exercise not only allows for maximum loading, but also keeps your muscles from being overused before the event begins. This is important to carbohydrate loading and cannot be skipped!

, So, if you are on a 2,500 calorie diet you will need to consume between 437 g and 468 g of carbohydrate in a day.


Plan ahead. This will help ensure you get enough carbohydrates to fully saturate muscles. If you don’t consume enough, then the loading will be wasted.
Add snacks to daily meal plan. You will need snacks to get enough carbohydrates without becoming overly full in one meal.
Eat enough calories during the day. This is pivotal. If you cut back on calories because you are not training, then you will not get enough carbohydrates for the loading to have an impact. Eat the same amount of calories as you would during training. This is especially important for women carbohydrate loading. Women may actually need to slightly increase the amount of calories they consume in a day for the loading to have an impact.

Make meatballs with chicken.,
Prepare meatballs with lean beef.,
Add vegetables to the meatballs to reduce the fat.,
Use lentils to make the meatballs.,
Bake the meatballs.",How to Make Lighter Spaghetti and Meatballs1," To reduce the fat content in traditional meatballs, swap out ground beef or pork for ground chicken breast instead. Chicken still has all the nutrients of beer or pork, but with a lower fat content. You will need a ½ pound of ground chicken breast to serve four people a meal of spaghetti and chicken meatballs. To make chicken meatballs, combine:½ pound ground chicken breast
1 small onion
4 garlic cloves
1 ¾ teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 ¾ teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese
½ egg, slightly scrambled
¼ cup panko breadcrumbs;
, Another way you can reduce the fat content in the meatballs and have a lighter meal is to use lean beef for the meatballs. Go for lean beef that has an 8% fat content or less. This way, you still get beef in the dish without the extra calories.Substitute lean beef for regular beef or pork in an existing spaghetti and meatballs recipe. You will need about 1 pound of lean beef to make a spaghetti and meatballs meal for six.

, You can also try adding vegetables to the meatballs so you use less meat and get some added nutrients. This will also make the meatballs lighter and less fatty. Try adding mushrooms or spinach to the meatballs for added nutrients. Then, cut back on the meat content so the meatballs are leaner.You can also add fresh herbs like parsley to the meatballs to cut down on the meat content.

, To make meatballs that are light and packed with nutrients, try making lentil meatballs. Lentils are a good source of protein and lighter in fat than chicken, pork, or beef. To make lentil meatballs, you will need access to a food processor or a blender.To make the lentil meatballs:


Saute 1 shallot, minced and 3 cloves minced garlic in 3 tablespoons olive oil.
Combine the cooked shallot and garlic with:

1 egg
1 1/2 cup cooked green lentils
1 1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning, such as dried basil and oregano
1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley
1 tablespoon tomato paste
Sea salt and black pepper to taste



, Rather than saute the meatballs in hot oil on the stove, which ups the fat content, bake them instead. Baking the meatballs in the oven can keep them from getting too heavy with oil. Place the meatballs on parchment paper and bake them in the oven until they are cooked through.If you want the meatballs to have a crispness to them, you may take them out of the oven early and saute them in olive oil in a pan. Only saute them lightly to keep the fat content down.

Add the rest of the batter.,
Bake the cake until the top is golden brown.,
Brush the cake with the melted butter and add the remaining filling.,
Allow the cake to cool.,
Combine the cream cheese, powdered erythritol, cream, and vanilla.,
Spoon the icing over the cake.",How to Make Low Carb Coffee Cake," To make sure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cake, you must preheat it. Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it has reached the desired temperature. It will likely beep and/or flash an indicator light as an alert.;
, For the coffee cake, you need an 8-inch by 8-inch (20- by 20-cm) baking pan. It’s important to grease the pan to ensure that the cake won’t stick to it, though. Rub a small amount of butter over the interior of the pan to grease it.You can grease the pan with non-stick cooking spray if you prefer.

, Add 3 tablespoons (40 g) of granulated erythritol and 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon to a small bowl. Mix the two together well so they’re fully combined, and set the bowl aside.Erythritol is a heat-stable natural sugar substitute that is ideal for baking. It is a sugar alcohol that has no calories and doesn’t affect the blood sugar, so it works well in low-carb recipes. You can usually find it at health food stores and online retailers.

, Add 3 cups (288 g) of almond flour, ¼ cup (24 g) of unflavored whey protein powder, 2 teaspoons (12 g) of baking powder, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together so they’re fully combined, and set the bowl aside.You can substitute macadamia nut or cashew flour for the almond flour.

, Add ½ cup (113 g) of butter that’s been softened to room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the butter on medium speed until it is smooth, which should take approximately 30 to 60 seconds.You can use an electric handheld mixer to make the coffee cake batter if you prefer.

, Once the butter is creamed, add ¾ cup (161 g) of granulated erythritol. Mix the two on medium speed until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, which should take approximately 2 minutes., After you’ve beaten the butter and erythritol together, mix in 3 large eggs one at a time on medium speed. Next, blend in ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract until fully combined.Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula after the addition of each egg to ensure that they’re fully mixed into the batter.

, When the eggs and vanilla are mixed in, beat in half of the flour mixture on medium until just incorporated. Next, beat in ¼ cup (60 ml) of almond milk at the same speed. Repeat the process with the remaining flour mixture and ¼ cup (60 ml) of almond milk until both are fully incorporated.The batter should be fairly thick but smooth when you’re finished mixing it.

, Once you’ve finished mixing the batter, transfer half of it into the greased pan. Use a spatula to smooth it into an even layer, and then sprinkle two-thirds of the cinnamon filling over it.If you prefer, you can pour all of the batter into the cake and sprinkle all of the cinnamon filling over the top.

, After the filling is in place, pour the rest of the batter over it. Spread it through the pan with the spatula so all of the lower layer is covered.If the batter is sticking to the spatula, grease it with some non-stick cooking spray.

, Place the cake in the heated oven. Allow it to bake for approximately 35 minutes, or until the top of the cake becomes golden brown.You can be certain that the cake is finished by sticking a toothpick or a knife in the center. It should only come out with a few moist crumbs on it.

, When the cake is finished baking, remove it from the oven. Use a pastry brush to spread 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter over the top while it’s still hot. Next, sprinkle the remaining cinnamon filling over the cake as a topping.If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can fold a piece of parchment paper into a strip and use it to spread the butter over the cake.

, Once you’ve added the topping, allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 to 20 minutes. You want to make sure that it’s not too hot when you ice it, so the icing doesn’t melt off., Add 3 tablespoons (42 g) of softened cream cheese, 2 tablespoons (23 g) of powdered erythritol, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract to the stand mixer bowl. Beat the ingredients together on medium until the mixture is smooth, which should take approximately 1 minute.If the frosting is too thick, add a little bit more cream.
If you prefer, you can skip the frosting and the cake will have even fewer carbs.

, When the frosting is mixed, use a spoon to drizzle it over the top of the cake. Cut the cake into squares, and serve on plates with your favorite coffee or tea.If you prefer, you can put the frosting into a pastry bag and pipe it over the cake.
Cover any leftover cake with foil or plastic wrap, and store it at room temperature. It will stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

Use whole-grain spaghetti.,
Prepare vegetable noodles.,
Make a healthy amount of pasta.,
Prepare your own spaghetti sauce.,
Use pesto instead of spaghetti sauce.",How to Make Lighter Spaghetti and Meatballs2," Whole-grain spaghetti is a great option if you’re looking for pasta that is lighter on the processed wheat and healthier for you. Choose a whole-grain spaghetti when shopping for pasta for the dish. Or make your own whole-grain spaghetti at home.You can also try using pasta made with rice, beans, quinoa, or egg whites. These options have a better texture and flavor as well as a higher protein content.

, Rather than serve pasta made of grains, try using noodles made of spiralled vegetables. Use a vegetable spiralizer or the spiral setting on your food processor to make noodles out of vegetables like zucchini or carrots. Vegetable noodles are much healthier than pasta made from grains and add nutrients to the dish.You may try making zucchini and carrot noodles and combining them together to make a healthy meal of vegetable spaghetti and meatballs.
This is a good option if you are allergic to wheat or grains, but still want to enjoy spaghetti and meatballs.

, Avoid overdoing it on the amount of pasta you prepare for a meal. Making a healthy amount will ensure you can fill the remainder of your plate with vegetables or healthy meatballs. One cup of cooked pasta per person is often enough and well within the healthy amount.One cup of cooked pasta contains 200 calories, making it a healthy option for a meal. Try starting with one cup of cooked pasta per person and balance it out with the meatballs for a light, but satisfying meal.

, Cut down on calories and sugar by making a simple spaghetti sauce at home. A homemade sauce is healthier than packaged sauce and free of sugars or unhealthy fat. To make a simple spaghetti sauce, combine:1 18 ounce can diced tomatoes
2-3 fresh tomatoes, diced
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
Oregano and parsley to taste
You can also buy spaghetti sauce at the supermarket that has no sugar or added salt.

, Another option is to skip the sauce entirely and make a pesto instead. Combine basil, spinach, or arugula, pine nuts and olive oil to make the pesto. You can also buy pesto pre-made at the store and use it in your spaghetti and meatballs dish.


You can keep the dish really simple and healthy with no sauce, just olive oil and a light dash of Parmesan cheese.

Be choosy with dairy foods.,
Avoid added sugars and sweets.,
Go for lean protein sources.,
Choose healthy fats.,
Drink adequate amounts of fluid.,
Avoid carbs when you go out to eat.",How to Go on a Carb Free Diet," Before starting any diet, especially a very-low-carb diet, it's important to talk to your doctor.


Very low-carb diets can cause side effects. Ketosis is a side effect of very low-carb diets and is a condition that may not be safe or appropriate for everyone. Talk to your doctor if this is safe and healthy for you to do.
Also talk to your doctor about why you're wanting to lose weight and ask if they any additional tips or advice to help you. They can also put you in touch with a registered dietitian, who can help you plan meals and ensure you are getting enough nutrients to stay healthy.
Your doctor or dietitian may help you set a carb limit for your meal, for instance 15 grams of carbs (about one serving). For example, you could have 1/2 cup of brown rice for your carb, then have green salad, any veggies you want, and some grilled or roasted meat.
Also, if you have diabetes, you will need to include some carbohydrates in your diet — especially if you're on medication. Talk to your doctor about how to safely include nutritious carbohydrates in your diet.;
, The major drawback of a low- or very-low-carbohydrate diet is the potential side effects they can cause. Be prepared to deal with these.


The typical initial side effects noticed when you're following a lower carb diet include: headache, fatigue, moodiness, irritability, and mental fatigue.If you drastically cut carbs or begin to follow a very-low-carb diet, you can experience these same symptoms (sometimes more severely) in addition to nausea, weakness, constipation or diarrhea. This is called ketosis.Be prepared for headaches with some over-the-counter pain relievers or even a cup of caffeinated coffee. This can also help with fatigue as well.
If you have constipation you can take a stool softener or gentle laxative in addition to drinking more fluid. If you have looser stools or diarrhea you can take an over-the-counter medication as well.

, It's sometimes recommended to forego or ease up on your exercise routine if you plan on following a very-low-carbohydrate diet.


Although exercise is generally always recommended as a weight loss counterpart, it might be difficult to do when following a low-carb diet.
Your body uses carbs as energy-especially your muscles. If you're not eating very many carbs, it'll be difficult to participate in high intensity or long bouts of exercise without extreme fatigue. You'll run out of fuel quickly.
In addition, some studies showed that those who followed a very low-carb diet were more fatigued and felt more fatigued during exercise and were unable to perform at higher intensities., Grains like bread, rice, pasta or wraps are some of the most noteworthy and high-carb foods in your diet. Restricting these foods will help cut out a large portion of the carbohydrates you consume.


Grains are a very carbohydrate rich food group. Fortunately, many of the nutrients found in these foods can also be found in other food groups. Limiting or restricting these foods doesn't cause a risk for nutrient deficiencies.
If you have a craving for bread, rice or pasta, only go for 100% whole grains. These are higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients compared to refined grains.Also, only have one serving to help minimize how many carbs you do eat. Only eat 1/2 cup or about 1 oz per serving., Fruits are another common food tagged as ""high-carb."" This food group contains fructose — a sugar — that counts as a carbohydrate.


Although fruits do contain sugar, remember that sugar comes with a ton of nutritional benefits. Fruits are high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants (many of which you cannot get from other foods).If you want to limit fruits or eat only lower carbohydrate or low-sugar fruits, that's a better choice than cutting them out altogether.
Low sugar fruits include blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and cranberries.Also, stick to the appropriate serving of fruit so you don't over do it. Measure out 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., Vegetables are important food group to include and not limit - especially non-starchy vegetables. Eat multiple servings of these foods each day.


Non-starchy vegetables are those that contain low amounts of starch (a carbohydrate). In addition, non-starchy vegetables are also very low in calories, high in fiber and other essential vitamins and antioxidants.Include at least one serving of non-starchy vegetables at most meals. Go for 1 cup of dense vegetables and 2 cups of salad greens.Starchy vegetables do contain higher amounts of carbohydrates and can be limited or restricted without worry of any nutrient deficiencies. These include: corn, potatoes, carrots, peas, beans, lentils, yams and beets.

, Although dairy foods do contain carbohydrates (sugar in the form of lactose), they offer many, many nutritional benefits to your diet.Be mindful when choosing to avoid some of these foods.


Although dairy foods are a source of carbohydrates, most generally contain minimal amounts compared to other foods. In addition, dairy is very high in protein, calcium, Vitamin D and potassium.The highest carbohydrate containing dairy foods are milk and yogurt. However, choosing products without added sweeteners or flavorings will lower the carbohydrate content in these foods.
Cheese is naturally low-carbohydrate and high in protein. This is an acceptable food to eat even when following a low-carb diet.
If you choose to have milk or yogurt stick to appropriate portion sizes. Measure out 1 cup of milk or yogurt and 1 1/2 ounces of cheese., Another large source of carbohydrates in the Westernized diet is from added sugars and sweets. Avoid these completely when following a low-carb diet.


Although added sugars in very small amounts aren't typically harmful, they provide no nutritional benefit to you whatsoever.They are considered empty calories.
These types of foods can be limited without the risk of any nutrient deficiency. In addition, you are cutting out unnecessary calories from your diet.
Added sugars are typically added to foods or beverages during processing. They may be in the form of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, cane juice or rice syrup and fruit juice concentrates. Read your food label ingredient list to find these hidden added sugars.
Typical foods that contain added sugars are: sweetened beverages, alcohol, candy, cookies, cakes and pies, ice cream, and breakfast pastries.

, Protein foods will be a prominent food group in your low-carb diet. However, limiting carbs doesn't mean you shouldn't stick to nutritious protein sources.


Some low-carb diets suggest eating higher fat protein foods. Although small amounts of higher fat proteins don't pose a health risk, over time, if you eat large quantities of these foods they may lead to higher cholesterol and heart problems.In addition, fat itself is very high in calories and if eaten in high amounts may cause unwanted weight gain.
Choose a variety of protein sources, but try to stick to leaner protein for the more nutritious choice. Also follow appropriate serving sizes of 3 – 4 oz per serving.Lean protein sources to try include: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, nuts and tofu. Beans and lentils are also considered lean, but are also very high in carbohydrates.

, Just because you're avoiding carbohydrates, doesn't mean that you shouldn't include healthy sources of fats each day.


Healthy fats are great for your health. They can help reduce cholesterol levels and reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke.Healthy fats are found in: fatty fish (salmon, tuna or mackerel), nuts and nut butters, seeds, avocados, olive oil, olives, and canola oil.
Although these are healthy sources of fats, still be mindful of portions. Stick to 2 tablespoons daily of liquid fat (like olive oil) and appropriate portions of other foods from their food groups.

, Drinking adequate fluid while you're following a diet will be very helpful. It'll keep you hydrated and may be able to support your weight loss.


Drinking adequate fluids will be very important while following a low-carb diet. It can help prevent or manage headaches and keep hunger at bay.Drink at least 8-13 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids daily. Try: water, flavored water, decaf coffee and teas.
Also, if you're feeling hungry, try drinking a large glass of water prior to a meal to help make you feel more full off of calorie-free water.

, Following a low-carb diet at home is easy since you can prepare foods and meals the way you like. However, be mindful when you go out to eat and choose meals wisely.


Many restaurants now have sections of their menu that are denoted as ""healthy"" or ""low calorie."" They may also tell you if certain items are low-carb. Look for these or ask your waiter for help.
Also, if your restaurant of choice is a chain, they most likely will have nutrition information online or in a separate section of the menu. Review the calories or total carbohydrates of certain foods here.
Also use common sense. Don't order dishes with pasta, bread or rices. Stick to simple dishes like grilled protein and non-starchy vegetables or salads with lean protein on top.

Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate.,
Adjust your BMR to include physical activity.,
Use an online BMR calculator.,
Purchase a continuous heart rate monitor.,
Start a food journal.,
Cut calories to lose weight.,
Increase calories to gain weight.",How to Calculate Calories Burned in a Day," Our bodies are like engines that are constantly running. They're always burning fuel or calories (even during sleep). BMR is the number of calories you burn each day simply by being alive.


Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) can vary based on your age, sex, size, and genetics.To get an accurate picture of the amount of calories you burn per day, start by calculating a value for your BMR.
Use the following equations to find your BMR by hand.
Men: (13.75 × weight) + (5 × height) - (6.76 × age) + 66
Women: (9.56 × weight) + (1.85 × height) - (4.68 × age) + 655;
, To get an accurate count for your daily expenditure, we also need to include the calories burned from physical activity. People need different calorie levels depending on their activity level and energy expenditure from exercise.Multiply your BMR by any of the following activity levels:


If you don't exercise or have a very sedentary lifestyle, multiply your BMR by 1.2.If you do moderate amounts of exercise (1 to 3 days per week) or are lightly active, multiply your BMR by 1.375.If you exercise on 3 to 5 days per week or have an active lifestyle, multiply your BMR by 1.55.If you exercise most days and doing vigorous activity throughout the day, multiply your BMR by 1.725.If you exercise every day or exercise more than once in a day and have a very physically demanding job, multiply your BMR by 1.9., These can automatically find your BMR based on basic info like your age, gender, height, and weight.


Using an online calculator will most likely be a little easier and more simple to use than doing a long mathematical equation by yourself.
If you choose this option, find an BMR calculator from a reputable site. Many wellness clinics, hospitals or government websites offer BMR calculators.
Have your current weight and height information ready as these are important factors in your BMR calculation.

, Another way to measure how many calories you burn in a day is by wearing a continuous heart rate monitor.


There are some heart rate monitors available now that you can wear for 24 hours. It will give you an estimate of how many calories you burn throughout the entire day (with or without exercise).
These types of monitors will ask you for your age, height, weight and gender. Each monitor uses different formulas or algorithms to calculate your total calories burned.
You can wear your heart rate monitor for 24 hours without exercising to get an idea of how many calories you burn with daily activities. Then compare this amount to a tracked 24 hour period where you did exercise.
Note that even some emotions increase your heart rate and may ""trick"" you heart rate monitor into thinking you're exercising and burning more calories than you actually are. Although this is not common, it's something to keep in mind.

, It will be useful to track your total calorie intake using a food journal, food journaling app or website. This will help you manipulate your predetermined caloric goal to result in any desired weight changes. It can also help keep you accountable to your diet plan.


Food journals are also a great way to get insight into what you currently eat and how that compared to your determined caloric goal.
Food journals will be able to give you an idea of where you're eating most of calories during the day.
Lastly, journaling will be able to help you track and successful gain, lose or maintain your weight.

, If you're trying to lose weight, you'll want to make sure that you consistently have a net negative calorie intake each day. You can do this by reducing the number of calories you eat, burning more calories through exercise, or both.


In general, losing about 3500 calories per week equates to losing one-two pounds of body weight. Cutting out 500 calories daily will help you reach this weekly deficit.Don't lose weight too quickly or cut out too many calories. Most reputable sources recommend losing no more than about 1-2 pounds per week. This can be dangerous and may leave you feeling weak, tired and low in essential nutrients.Keep in mind that as you shed pounds you'll gradually have to work harder to maintain your weight. Having a low weight decreases your BMR and the number of calories you burn from exercise, meaning you'll have to further lower the number of calories you eat per day or exercise harder to continue to lose weight.

, Take in more calories than you burn through daily activities and exercise to help you gain weight.


You can do this by increasing the number of calories you eat or decreasing the amount of calories you spend through exercise or with a combination of both.
Regardless of your reason to gain weight, choose healthy, yet high calorie foods to help you meet a higher calorie goal. Choosing fried, processed or other unhealthy foods isn't ideal.
Note that some exercise is necessary to maintain good health. Don't discontinue exercise unless instructed by your doctor.
Though everyone's physical activity needs are different, most medical sources recommend about two and a half hours of moderate aerobic exercise with strength training on two days out of the week (or one and a half hours of intense aerobic exercise)."

Use veggie-based pasta alternatives.,
Add protein to your salad.,
Craft a cauliflower crust pizza.,
Replace rice with grated cauliflower.",How to Enjoy Low Carb Meals1," You can get all sorts of low-carb noodle alternatives, made from everything from seaweed to mushrooms. In fact, many grocery stores now carry many veggies cut into thin, noodle-like strips. Further, spaghetti squash and stringed zucchini can easily be utilized in any dish as an alternative to grain-based noodles.For example, make a shirataki noodle salad. Get shirataki noodles made from tofu and/or yams, as these will contain less carbs than most types of noodles. Toss the noodles in a low sodium, low sugar sauce, such as a tomato-based sauce. Add veggies, greens, and beans or more tofu to make the dish more substantial.;
, The best part about salads if that you can get a lot of nutritional value in one meal — and you don’t have too worry too much about portions. Aside from leafy greens (the darker the better, generally), add good protein sources, such as hard-boiled eggs, smoked salmon, a can of tuna, lean chicken, or a handful of nuts.One specific salad that’s especially filling and enjoyable while staying low on carbs is a steak salad seasoned with herbs and a vinegar-based dressing.

, Pizza is one of those dishes that many people who try to cut out carbs end up missing. Fortunately, you don’t have to. Cauliflower can be mashed and used instead of flour in a low-carb alternative to pizza crust. Top the crust with tomato sauce, feta, and your favorite pizza toppings for an dinner that will give you a whole new dish to crave. , Cauliflower can be used as a great rice substitute as well. It also cooks much more quickly. For great dinner options, bake stuffed peppers or mushroom. Sauté some of your favorite ingredients, such as caramelized onions and lean turkey, with diced or mashed cauliflower. Add marinara sauce as well if you so desire. Use this to fill halved peppers or portabella mushroom tops and bake them for 20 minutes or so at 350°F (177°C). Another good filling for mushroom tops or peppers is a mix of kale, Swiss chard, and beet greens, pan-fried until wilted. Add lemon juice and white beans to flavor, and top with mozzarella cheese.

Opt for Greek yogurt and fruit.,
Eat more eggs.,
Try a tofu scramble.,
Bake with coconut flour.",How to Enjoy Low Carb Meals2," A ½ cup of Greek yogurt topped with ½ cup of blackberries or raspberries is a great way to start the day with minimal carbs. You can also add slivered almonds, walnuts, or pecans to up the protein, which will help hold you over until lunch. Add sunflower seeds or flaxseed meal for even further nutrition.To sweeten, add shredded coconut without sugar added.
The type of yogurt matters immensely. Sweetened yogurt, even if it’s non-fat, contains a large amount of carbs. Choose Greek yogurt or a yogurt made with whole milk. The whole milk will make it extra smooth and creamy, and does not add any carbohydrates.

, Eggs are an especially nutritious and enjoyable breakfast option. They can also be cooked easily and quickly. Prepare eggs as you wish, in a skillet with coconut, flaxseed, avocado, or extra virgin olive oil. Add your favorite veggies, such as peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Spinach and kale are especially low in carbs, and add nutrition and sustenance to your dish.Put some grated cheese on the top to add some calcium and flavor without adding any carbohydrates.
Use herbs to season your eggs. Aside from salt and pepper, rosemary, basil, and turmeric are all great additions to omelets or scrambles.
You can even bake eggs into to-go portions by filling a muffin tin with chopped veggies, cheese, and scrambled eggs.
Eggs are also a great addition to any leftovers from dinner the night before.

, As an alternative (or in addition) to eggs, tofu also makes a great breakfast staple, and can used in many of the same ways. Stir-fried tofu with garlic, olive oil, and green beans will taste great, and can be cooked in a matter of minutes., If you can’t stop dreaming about pancakes and waffles, you’re in for a treat after all. Use coconut flour instead of grain-based flours, which have many more carbs. Favor berries over other types of fruit for sweeteners. You can even use blackberries or raspberries to make a delicious syrup."

Find a low-carb bread you love.,
Maintain variety with vegetables.,
Don’t worry as much about fats.,
Keep snacks low-carb.,
Reward yourself occasionally with low-carb sweets.",How to Enjoy Low Carb Meals3," One of the foods people miss the most when reducing their carb consumption is bread. Fortunately, there are more and more low-carb bread options. Look for an option with low amounts of total carbohydrates, but high amounts of dietary fiber.For instance, breads from companies like Ezekiel's and Udi's often have high nutritional value and low amounts of the ingredients that lead to empty carb consumption.
When looking, check out gluten-free bread options. Since more and more people are reducing their gluten intake, more and more enjoyable gluten-free breads are hitting supermarket shelves.

, Many people that start eating a low-carb diet struggle with the feeling that they don’t have much to choose from; however, considering the plethora of vegetables and herbs that you can find, there is not shortage of different flavors and styles of food.Even within the subcategory of leafy greens, you’ve got kale, green cabbage, spinach, chard, bok choy, kale, and more to work into meals in different ways.
Further, artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, green beans, eggplant, zucchini, and snow peas can increase the flavor and appeal of many different dishes.
Other great under-appreciated ingredients to add flavor to almost any dish include fennel, alfalfa sprouts, chives, and arugula.
Whenever it feels like you’ve run out of options, walk through your grocery store’s produce area. You’ll likely find something you’ve never tried before.

, If you’re successfully reducing your carb intake — particularly refined carbs in packaged foods, you’re also eliminating many foods that include bad fats. Further, a moderate fat intake is needed to supply essential fatty acids, and help keep you full since you are cutting out carbs. Choose olive oil, coconut oil, or a good blend like SmartBalance. Do avoid hydrogenated and partially-hydrogenated fats, and foods that contain trans fats., If you prefer to keep your mind on work during the day and tend to eat smaller lunch, you may find yourself getting hungry before dinner time. If this occurs, there are a few good low-carb snack options that will be especially helpful in holding you over. Try hard-boiled eggs, cheese slices, or a few handfuls of nuts.Cottage cheese, apples, and fruit smoothies made with protein powders, water, berries, and Stevia also make great low-carb snacks., Another type of food that's hard to give up while going low-carb: dessert. Fortunately, there are some types desserts you can get away with eating in small portions.Chocolate-covered nuts or berries and other fruit-based desserts are good options, as long as they have no or very little crust.
For the ultimate low-carb treat, spread a bit of hazelnut spread on a graham cracker and top with a slice of banana.
Try this no-carb chocolate cake. The recipe makes one serving. You will need one egg, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon sour cream, 2 tablespoon cocoa powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1 tablespoon stevia or truvia. Mix all ingredients until smooth in an individual baking dish or ramekin. Microwave for one minute. Enjoy!

Make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable.",How to Reduce Carbs at Dinner," One of the biggest sources of carbohydrates in a Westernized diet is grains. Items like bread or pasta are not only a common food choice, but are also some of the foods that contain the highest amount of carbohydrates, and these foods are often eaten in large portion sizes.If you want to make your dinnertime meal lower in carbohydrates, cut out the grain food group from this meal (just make sure you are getting enough servings earlier in the day during breakfast and lunch). It's an easy way to cut carbs and calories. Limit items like: bread, rice, quinoa, oatmeal, pasta, tortillas/wraps, rolls or buns and couscous.
If you do choose to have a grain, keep your total carbohydrate intake low by making sure to measure an appropriate portion size. Measure out 1/2 cup or 2 oz of a grain per serving and limit yourself to only one serving.Also go for 100% whole grains over refined grains. These items have much more fiber and other beneficial nutrients, such as B vitamins. So if you want to have a grain at dinner, it's wise to choose whole grain, minimally processed items.;
, Another very common source of carbohydrates are starchy vegetables and starchy forms of protein. Again, these foods are popular in Westernized diets and account for a large portion of our carbohydrate intake.


Starchy vegetables include foods like: peas, corn, potatoes, yams and winter squashes. Starchy protein sources include beans and lentils.
These foods are high in carbohydrates, but do offer a wide variety of beneficial and healthy nutrients like fiber, protein and many minerals like calcium, iron and B vitamins.Completely cutting these foods out from your diet isn't recommended, because you may experience a variety of temporary health effects such as headache, weakness, fatigue and constipation. However, if you're only limiting or avoiding them at dinner, that's appropriate.
If you do choose to include an occasional serving of these foods at your dinner time meal, make sure to measure out the appropriate portion size. Measure out 1 cup of starchy vegetables or 1/2 cup of starchy protein sources.To cut carbs even more, only go for a 1/2 cup of starchy vegetables. You'll still get to enjoy the taste and flavor but minimize your carbohydrate intake.

, Surprisingly, the dairy group is another source of carbohydrates. The sugar in dairy (lactose) is the main source of carbohydrates in these calcium-rich foods.Be aware that foods in this group can be high in fat; therefore, reduced or low-fat varieties should be used, such as skim or 2% milk. The reduced fat varieties have the same amount of protein, calcium and riboflavin as their full-fat equivalents, but wit lower fat and calories.
Although dairy foods do contain carbohydrates, the most carbohydrate-rich foods are milk, yogurt and cottage cheese. It should be noted that the total carbohydrate of dairy foods is significantly lower than items like grains, starchy vegetables or fruits.
Solid cheeses (like cheddar or mozzarella) have very minimal amounts of carbohydrate and can be included in a low-carb meal without significantly increasing your total carbohydrate intake. Just remember that these also contain high amounts of fat and calories, so go for low-fat versions.
If you're having something like yogurt for dinner, make sure to measure out the appropriate portion size. Measure out 1 cup or about 8 oz of dairy foods per serving.Like starchy vegetables and protein, dairy foods do offer a variety of great health benefits like being a great source of protein, calcium, Vitamin D, magnesium and potassium.Only limit these items at dinner if possible and include a serving or two earlier in the day.

, Fruit is the last food group that also contains a significant amount of carbohydrates. Monitor how much you're eating in the evenings to make sure your dinners are lower in carbohydrates.


Fruits contain a natural sugar called fructose in addition to containing nutritious fiber. Both of these count towards your total carbohydrate intake.
Limit your intake of fruit at dinner. If you're going to have a serving, make sure to measure out 1/2 cup serving per portion.In addition, you may want to stick to fruits that are naturally lower in sugar and carbohydrates like: strawberries, blueberries, cranberries, blackberries or raspberries.Similar to dairy foods or starchy vegetables, fruits come with a vast array of nutrients and antioxidants that are associated with positive health benefits. Fruits have a lot of fiber, Vitamin C, potassium and folic acid.It is not recommended to completely avoid fruit; however if you have a total of five servings of fruit and vegetables during the day, you can safely avoid them at dinner.

, To help minimize your carbohydrate intake at dinner and evenings, avoid processed grains and refined sugars. These foods are not only higher in carbohydrates but offer very little in the way of nutritional benefits.Refined carbohydrates include processed grains and refined sugars. They are highly processed and all the beneficial nutrients are removed or stripped during the processing. They're left with a high carb count and a higher calorie count.Items that are refined carbohydrates include: white bread, white rice, plain pasta, cookies, crackers, candy, cakes/pies, breakfast pastries, bagels, sugary cereals, pretzels and plain white tortillas or English muffins.
This also includes sweetened beverages and alcohol. Skip the beer or mixed cocktail and give up the sweet teas, sweetened coffees, fruit juices and sodas.
Since these foods offer little to no valuable nutrition, avoid these as much as possible during the day and during your dinnertime meal.

, If you're cutting out or limiting carbohydrates at dinner you're going to be limiting yourself to a select few food groups. Choose nutritious foods to make your dinner count.


For the lowest carbohydrate meal, make half of your dinner a lean protein and half of your dinner a non-starchy vegetable. Both of these food groups are naturally very low in carbohydrates (in addition to fat and calories) and will automatically keep dinners low-carb.For example, you could have: grilled salmon over a spinach salad, grilled chicken and broccoli stir-fry without rice, or flank steak with steamed asparagus.
However, if you want to include some healthier and nutrient-dense sources of carbohydrates you could have meals like: a spinach salad with grilled chicken and 1/4 cup blueberries and raspberries, or a piece of baked fish with 1/2 cup of mashed sweet potatoes or 1 cup of a cold lentil and vegetable salad.

, Just cutting out all the carbs from your dinner meal can be difficult; however, if you make some nutritious swaps for those carbs, you may feel like you miss them a little less.


Try using cauliflower. This cruciferous vegetable can take the place of a whole variety of carbohydrates. You can grate it into ""rice"" or ""couscous"", you can mash it into mashed ""potatoes"" and you can even bake into a ""pizza crust.""
You can also try using spiralized zucchini or yellow squash. A spiralizer will cut these low-carb vegetables into spaghetti-like noodles which can help take the place of regular pasta.
Instead of bread, go for lettuce wraps. You can use romaine lettuce, butter lettuce cups or even kale or Swiss chard leaves. Wrap up your sandwich fillings for a low-calorie and low-carb wrap.
If you're looking for a lower carb dessert, try plain yogurt with cinnamon and berries, chocolate pudding made with avocado or homemade peanut butter cups using dark chocolate and sugar-free peanut butter.

, Your morning meal may be a big source of carbohydrates in your diet. Many common breakfast foods are higher in carbohydrates, which can make following a low-carb diet more difficult.


Common breakfast items like waffles, cereal or even granola bars are all loaded with carbohydrates. Granted, these aren't necessarily considered ""unhealthy,"" but they may not fit into your low-carb diet plan.
Limit breakfast foods that are typically higher in carbohydrate in favor of more protein-dense items. Be mindful of foods like: waffles/pancakes, cereal, granola/granola bars, toast, wraps/tortillas, muffins, bagels, English muffins and pastries.
Instead start your day of with a hit of protein. This helps keep you more satisfied during the day and may help prevent unnecessary snacking.Choose breakfast meals like: two hard boiled eggs, an omelet with low-fat cheese and sautéed spinach, plain greek yogurt with nuts, or two deli meat and cheese roll-ups.

, Whether it's a sandwich, wrap or leftover pasta, lunch can also be a big source of carbohydrates during your day. Keep these high-carb foods in check so you're able to stick to your low-carb diet.


If you typically go for a sandwich or wrap at lunch, try swapping these options out for a lower carb option. You can try: lettuce wraps, deli meat and cheese roll-ups or even using seaweed as a wrap.
If you bring leftovers from home, skip the starchy vegetables and grains and stick to lean protein and non-starchy vegetables instead.
Other easy lunch options include salads or veggie- and protein-packed soups.

, Continue to keep your overall carbohydrate intake lower by making smart and nutritious snack choices.


It may be easy to grab a bag of pretzels or crackers from the vending machine; however, these foods are higher in carbohydrates (and sometimes higher in calories and low in any beneficial nutrition) and could cause an afternoon slump.Skip snack foods like: crackers/peanut butter crackers, pretzels, chips, granola bars, candies or fruit.
Perk up in the afternoon with a protein- and fiber-packed snack instead. Go for 1/4 cup of nuts, a cheese stick, a hard boiled egg, 3-oz of beef jerky or sugar-free peanut butter on celery stalks.

, Outside of the obvious sweetened beverages, there are drinks that contain carbohydrates that you should limit or skip if you're interested in following a lower carbohydrate diet.


Beverages like milk, coconut water, electrolyte drinks or even 100% fruit juice all contain some sugar and are higher in carbohydrates.
Instead of filling up on these types of drinks, stick to naturally sugar-free and decaf beverages. These are the most hydrating and nutritious for your body. Try: water, sparkling water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea.Aim for at least eight 8-oz glasses (1.9 L) of fluids daily or even up to 13 glasses (3 L) daily. This is the typical recommended amount to keep you well-hydrated during the day., If you're interested in following a low-carb diet for any reason, consider speaking to a registered dietitian. They'll be able to help design a diet that will aid you in reaching your goals.


A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert. They'll be able to teach you about proper nutrition, give you guidance when following a low-carb diet and help you design low-carb dinners.
Talk to your dietitian about your long-term goals or reasoning behind following a low-carbohydrate diet. If you're goal is to lose weight, they'll be able to help you reach your weight goal. Or maybe your goal is to improve your blood sugar levels — they'll also be able to help you choose the right eating pattern for this as well.
Your dietitian will also be a great source of accountability for any goal. Consider meeting with your dietitian on a regular basis — like once a month.

, Although you may be avoiding or limiting certain carbohydrates at certain times of the day, it's still important to aim for a balanced and varied diet everyday.


A balanced diet is one that contains foods from every food group most days. That means choosing nutritious foods from the protein, dairy, vegetable, fruit and grain groups.Even if you're limiting certain sources of carbohydrates, you can still have a balanced diet by making sure you include all other food groups.
Also have a varied diet. This means you choose a large variety of foods from within each food group. Don't only have chicken or steak as protein sources. Go for other poultry (like turkey), pork, eggs or dairy foods for a wide variety. The more variety you have, the more nutrients you'll be consuming., Many of your meals or snacks will be based on or focused on protein when you're following a lower carb diet. Protein is naturally low- or no-carb so it's an easy food group to rely on.


Fatty cuts of meat and processed meats are not a healthy or nutritious source of protein. They're higher in unhealthy fats (like saturated fat), calories and many preservatives (like nitrates). Limit or avoid these foods.Instead, focus on lean sources of protein or those containing heart healthy fats. Try: poultry, eggs, lean pork, lean beef, tofu or seafood. These foods are naturally lower in calories and are considered a more nutritious choice.
Make sure to measure your protein sources. One serving is 3 – 4-oz, or a piece the size of a deck of cards., Fruits and vegetables are very important sources of many nutrients in your diet. The most balanced, varied and nutritious diet is one that includes adequate amounts of both of these food groups.


Many health professionals recommend making half your meal or plate a fruit or a vegetable. The reasoning behind this is that these foods are naturally lower in calories and higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.Although fruits do contain carbohydrates, they're such a nutritious food, it's not recommended to completely avoid them. Only have a small serving and choose those low-sugar items.
Any non-starchy vegetable is a great choice. Vary your choices throughout the day to maximize how many nutrients you're consuming. A good rule of thumb is to go for a different color non-starchy vegetable at each meal.

Reduce your caloric intake.,
Cut back on carbs without cutting them out entirely.,
Do not go on an extremely carb-restrictive diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Be safe when dieting and exercising.",How to Eat Carbs and Still Lose Weight1," If you’re an average person, your insulin sensitivity is probably quite good, and you don’t need to make specific cuts to your carbohydrate intake over any other types of calories like fats. People gain weight when the calories they consume exceed the calories they need to maintain their physical functions. For instance, if you burn 1,500 calories daily, but consume 2,000 calories daily, you will gain weight. To reduce your caloric intake, you should reduce the amount of carbs, protein, and fats you take in without totally eliminating any one macronutrient.For instance, instead of drinking soda, drink water.
Instead of eating a sandwich, try a wrap.
Instead of eating a big bowl of pasta, eat a small bowl of pasta.
Cut back on the total amount of calories you consume by incorporating low-calorie meals into your diet, such as salads.
Typically, a diet that permits about 50 to 100 grams of carbs per day is ideal for people trying to lose weight while still consuming some carbs.;
, People with poor insulin sensitivity will benefit from making specific cuts to their carbohydrate intake. If you are obese or overweight, or if you have a diagnosis of prediabetes, then you may have insulin sensitivity. In this case, reducing portion sizes of grains is essential. Reduce your portions and frequency of foods such as bread, pasta, cereal, and other processed grains. Instead, focus on eating whole fruits, vegetables, and protein with small portions of grains.You should speak to a doctor to confirm you have an insulin sensitivity.

, Specialty diets that radically restrict carbohydrate consumption – for instance, diets in which carb intake is less than 20 grams daily – often boomerang back on people and cause them to consume more carbs than they normally would. Instead of eliminating carbs altogether, eat a 50% of your calories from carbs, fats, and proteins.About 20% of your daily calories should be from protein (though you might need more if you are an athlete).
No more than 30% of your daily calories should be derived from fat, and no more than 7% should be from saturated fat. No more than 1% of your daily calories should come from trans fat. Foods with partially hydrogenated oil also contain trans fats.

, Losing weight while eating carbs is easier if you exercise. On average, you should exercise at least 2.5 hours per week to maintain your weight. To lose weight, you should exercise more than that.The extent to which you exercise should depend on your own baseline level of health and fitness, as well as your levels of motivation to lose weight.Try to incorporate exercise into your daily rhythm. For instance, walk to the store instead of driving. Ride your bike to work instead of driving. Go for a walk with your family or pet.
Schedule time into your schedule to exercise. Sprinkle your exercise throughout the week. For instance, aim to exercise 45 minutes four days per week.
Perform both cardio and strength training exercises. You might plan on running, lifting weights, or riding your bike.

, Talk to your doctor if you have a medical condition. If you have a medical condition that could impact the effect of losing weight through a healthy mix of dietary adjustments and exercise – for instance, diabetes, heart disease, or arrhythmia – you should speak to your physician before embarking on a weight-loss diet. Your doctor will be able to help you develop a health plan that enables you to both eat carbs and lose weight safely.You can also ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian.


The fewer calories you consume and the more you exercise, the faster you will lose weight. However, you must not push yourself beyond what you can safely endure physically.
If you find that your exercise regimen interferes with your social, professional or academic life, you should reduce the intensity and frequency of your workouts.
If you find that you’re skipping entire meals, binging, or regurgitating your food, seek counseling.

Choose the right carbs.,
Eat resistant starches.,
Eliminate refined wheat from your diet.,
Remove added sugars from your diet.Added sugars are found in many packaged foods, especially muffins, cookies, and candy.",How to Eat Carbs and Still Lose Weight2," Instead of consuming processed carbs – those that have little or no nutritional value – consume healthier carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. For instance, you might switch from white rice to brown rice. You might also enjoy: Strawberries
Blueberries
Whole grain muffins
Beans
Bananas
Watermelon
Potatoes
Amaranth
Barley
Quinoa
Teff, Carbs containing resistant starches (“carbstars”) speed up the metabolism by exuding fatty acids, causing you to burn more calories. Resistant starches are especially effective at burning belly fat, and can help you lose weight faster by improving feelings of fullness. About 25% of your calories should come from carbstars. Foods with high levels of resistant starches include:Cooked potatoes
Beans
Flaxseeds
Oats
Legumes
Bananas

, Refined wheat is wheat that does not have bran or germ, two important parts of the wheat grain kernel. This produces a wheat that lacks fiber, iron, and B vitamins in the same proportions which occur in whole grains.Wheat products made with refined wheat – like white bread, most bagels, and other processed foods – will leave you feeling less full, thus leading to higher caloric intake., They’re also in abundance in soda, where they take the form of high fructose corn syrup. But these carbs provide no nutritional benefit, and make it more likely you’ll gain weight. Avoid these added sugars to reduce your intake of bad carbs.To identify which foods have added sugar, check the ingredients label.
Whole foods – fruits and veggies – do not have added sugar unless they’re canned or otherwise packaged.

"
"
Manage your portions.,
Treat yourself once in a while.,
Develop a diverse pantry.",How to Eat Carbs and Still Lose Weight3," Portion control is key when eating carbs and losing weight. If you consume too much, you will not meet your weight-loss goals, and may even gain weight. Adhere to your portion needs at every meal.Use nutrition labels to determine how many grams of carbs within a given food.
If you’re consuming a whole food without a nutrition label, search online for the food’s average carbohydrate value.
Generally, your per-meal carbohydrate needs will equal one small baked potato, one banana, or one 125-gram can of cannellini beans.One slice of whole wheat bread, ¾ cup of cereal, 1/3 cup of cooked legumes, and ½ cup of corn contain about 15 grams of carbohydrates and 80 calories each.Veggies contain carbs at lower levels than starchier foods, but can still be a valuable source of carbs. For instance, ½ cup of vegetable juice, one cup of raw veggies, and ½ cup of cooked veggies each contain about 25 calories and 5 grams of carbohydrates.
About half of your daily calories should come from carbs. In a normal diet, that means that about 800-1,000 of their calories should be in the form of carbohydrates.

, Your diet should not be so restrictive that you never allow yourself any of life’s pleasures. For instance, if you wish to snack on a bit of chocolate, drink some wine, or have an appetizer of cheese and crackers with friends, go for it. Don’t overindulge, but help yourself to small helpings of what you love on a daily or weekly basis.If you continue to deprive yourself, your urge to consume the desired foodstuff will build up, leading to unhealthy binging.

, If you have a variety of carbs to consume, you will not get bored of eating carbs while losing weight. This will keep you from eating too much fatty foods, or from eating the wrong sorts of carbs. Fortify your pantry by obtaining a variety of fruits, veggies, legumes, and grains. Be adventurous and try something you might normally skip, like dumplings or honeydew melon."
"
Go for a jog.,
Take a spin class.,
Sign up for an aerobics class.,
Grab a jump rope.,
Go for a swim.,
Get on the rowing machine.",How to Burn 300 Calories in 30 Minutes1," One great calorie burning exercise to try is jogging. It's a higher impact exercise that requires the use of many large muscle groups to perform.


To burn at least 300 calories in a half an hour, you have to jog or run. Aim for your pace to be around a 10 minute mile or 6 mph (if you're on the treadmill).Keep in mind that the number of calories you burn during any type of exercise will depend on factors like your sex, age, weight, and effort level.
Note that the faster your pace, the more calories you'll burn in that 30 minute time span.
Although it's commonly believed that walking burns the same calories per mile as running, it'll take you more than 30 minutes to walk 3 to 4 miles.;
, A high intensity aerobic exercise you can also try is a spin class. These classes are notoriously challenging and will help you torch calories in a short amount of time.


The reason why a spin class is so good at burning calories is that it alternates between moderate and high intensities, requires you to use large muscle groups (like your legs) and keeps your heart rate elevated.You may burn around 400 calories in 30 minutes of spinning depending on your age, weight, sex, and effort level.
Note that you need to make sure you're working at a minimum of moderate intensity to reach this calorie goal. This means keeping the resistance up and not taking many breaks.
Many spin classes run for an hour. Check your gym’s class schedule to see if they offer any 30 minute classes.

, If you're more of a group exercise type of person, consider signing up for some aerobics classes. Many of these are high in intensity and will help you meet your 300 calorie goal.Look over the fitness class schedule at your gym. See if there are any fitness classes that are designed to burn a lot of calories.
For example, some high intensity Zumba, kick boxing, high intensity interval training (HIIT), circuit training or step aerobics classes will help you meet your calorie burn goal.
Many of these classes can help you burn around 300 calories in 30 minutes. Make sure you're working at a higher intensity.

, A fun exercise you can do is jumping rope. Bring back childhood memories and torch about 300 calories in 30 minutes.You might be surprised to know that jumping rope is a great calorie burn. While you do need to work harder than a game of Double Dutch, it's a great form of exercise.
In general, moderate to high intensity versions of jumping rope can help you burn about 350 calories in 30 minutes.But remember that the amount of calories you burn may be more or less depending on your weight, age, sex, and effort level.
Increase the intensity or difficulty by changing speeds, crossing the rope in front of you or jumping on one leg.

, Some forms of swimming can also help you burn calories in a short amount of time. Plus, these pool workouts are easier on your joints.


Swimming, like the rowing machine, recruits just about every major muscle group in your body. This is why it's such a great exercise for higher calorie burns.
In general, treading water or swimming laps may burn just around 300 calories in a half an hour.However, if you do harder or more difficult strokes, the total calories you burn will increase. For example, doing the butterfly stroke or crawl may burn around 330 calories in a half an hour.

, If you want to use a machine, the rowing machine might be a good option for you. This may help you meet your 300 calorie goal.One of the reasons that the rowing machine can help you burn so many calories is that it requires you to use large muscle groups.
When you have more muscles engaged, your body needs to use more energy (or calories) to fuel those muscles.
Remember that calories burned will depend on factors such as your age, weight, sex, and effort level. For example, in a 30 minute time period, a 30 year old 180 pound male working at 75% of his full capacity may burn about 316 calories."
"
Increase the resistance and difficulty of your exercises.,
Increase the length of your workouts.,
Incorporate strength training.,
Exercise in the mornings.,
Move more during the day.",How to Burn 300 Calories in 30 Minutes2," Burning 300 calories in 30 minutes should be fairly easy. However, to help make sure you hit the goal and to even exceed it, try increasing the resistance and difficulty of your exercise routine.


In general, the more challenging a workout is, the more calories you'll burn.You can increase the speed, pace, resistance, weight or add incline to make workouts more challenging.
For example, instead of just running at a steady pace, alternate between jogging and sprinting or jogging on a flat surface to jogging on an incline.
You'll burn more calories per 30 minutes when you add in these fluctuating levels of difficulty.
In addition, you can try doing one set of a resistance exercise every 5 to 10 minutes during your cardio workout, such as doing bicep curls or pushups. You can also try increasing the resistance on cardio machines - like the elliptical or spin bike.

, Although you may only have 30 minutes to work out most days, if you can, try increasing the length of your workouts. This will help you increase how many calories you can burn.You may not have time for a 45 minute run or a 60 minute spin class. However, even small additions in time can make a difference when it comes to the total amount of calories you burn.
Some studies have shown that an additional 5 to 10 minutes can help you burn an extra 50 to 100 calories.
If weight loss is your goal, try going for 35 to 40 minute workouts whenever you can. The other days you can stick to those higher intensity exercises to burn 300 calories in 30 minutes.

, You might not consider strength or resistance training to be a big calorie burner. And by itself, it's not. But when combined with aerobic exercise, it can help you burn more calories.When you have more muscle mass, your body (and metabolism) automatically burns more calories. That's because muscle tissue is active and requires more energy.
When you're performing aerobic exercise or even when you're at rest, the more muscle mass you have, the more calories you'll burn.
Most health professionals recommend that you include one to two days of strength training throughout the week. You need to work every major muscle group and your workout should be at least 20 minutes in length., Another trick to help you burn more calories (especially from fat) is by working out in the morning. Try switching your exercise routine around so your sweat session is in the morning.


Studies have shown that those people who work out in the morning before breakfast burn more calories total and burn more of those calories from fat.Try setting your alarm clock for 30 minutes earlier than normal. This will allow you to get up in just enough time to burn off those 300 calories.
Although you may not like getting up earlier those first few days, after a while it'll feel more routine and you'll find it easier to wake up.

, Another way to help increase your calorie burn over the course of the whole day is by moving more. This increased lifestyle activity can help you torch more calories all day long.


Lifestyle activities are those activities or exercises that you do as part of your regular day. Walking to and from your car or house, taking the stairs, sweeping the floor or cleaning are great examples.
Try to increase how many steps you take in a day or how often you're moving around.
For example, instead of bringing in the grocery bags a few at a time, carry in one at a time. You can extend a quick job to 10 minutes, take more steps and you could burn close to 100 calories."
"
Get more sleep.,
Drink more water.,
Moderate your portion sizes.,
Manage stress.",How to Burn 300 Calories in 30 Minutes3," To help your body burn more calories naturally, make sure you're getting enough sleep. When you're sleep deprived it can affect your metabolism and how many calories your body burns.Studies have shown that those adults who get an adequate amount of sleep each night burn about 5% more calories during the day compared to those who didn't sleep enough.Health professionals recommend that adults get about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.
That might mean you need to go to bed earlier or set your alarm clock for later in the morning.

, In addition to getting a good night's rest, it's also important to make sure you're drinking enough water during the day. This can affect your weight long-term.


Drinking more water doesn't necessarily help you burn more calories. However, it can help keep your appetite at bay and prevent excess snacking or overeating.Aim for at least 64 oz of clear hydrating fluids each day. In addition, stick to the most hydrating fluids like water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea.To minimize calorie intake, stay away from liquid calories. Drinking beverages like alcohol, sodas, fruit juice, sweet tea or coffee can work against those 300 calories you burned during your workout.

, If you're working hard to burn 300 calories, try to support that effort by eating well. Keep portions in control to help minimize your total calorie intake during the day.


It's important to measure out your portion sizes. Guesstimating how much you're supposed to eat generally results in overeating. Take the time to use a food scale or measuring cups to track your portions.
For protein based foods, measure out a 3 to 4 oz serving or about a 1/2 cup per serving.For fruits, measure out a 1/2 cup of chopped fruit, 1/4 cup of dried fruit or about 1 small piece per serving.Vegetables have a bigger serving size. Measure out 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy salad greens per serving.Grains should be measured to a 1/2 cup or about 2 oz total per serving. Also, make sure to measure grains after they've been cooked (like pasta or rice)., Keep your metabolism functioning at a higher level by managing your stress. Over time, chronic stress will effect how many calories your body can burn during the day.Recent research has shown that under stress, your body will burn less calories overall because your metabolism naturally slows.
In addition, this stress causes an increase in appetite and the desire for higher fat, higher carb foods.
If you have a stress lifestyle, job or home life, work on managing this stress better.
Consider: calling a friend to vent, going for a walk, doing meditation, listening to music or reading.
If you're having difficulty managing your stress, consider seeking extra help from a behavioral specialist.

Become active in any way that you can.",How to Burn Calories Fast," If you thought cardio was a great way to burn calories, well, you'd be right. But what you'd be missing out on is that there are even better ways -- and that's interval training. The benefits of cardio (which are innumerable to start with) are amplified with this tactic.High intensity interval training involves repeatedly exercising at a high intensity for 30 seconds to several minutes, separated by 1-5 minutes of recovery (either no or low intensity exercise). Consider the benefits:You'll burn more calories. The more vigorously you exercise, the more calories you'll burn — even if you increase intensity for just a few minutes at a time.
You'll improve your aerobic capacity. As your cardiovascular fitness improves, you'll be able to exercise longer or with more intensity. Imagine finishing your 60-minute walk in 45 minutes — or the additional calories you'll burn by keeping up the pace for the full 60 minutes.
You'll keep boredom at bay. Turning up your intensity in short intervals can add variety to your exercise routine.
You don't need special equipment. You can simply modify your current routine.

;
, Lifting weights isn't the fastest way to burn calories, no. But you do need both cardio and weights to reap the ultimate benefits.Your metabolism relies on it -- more muscle, higher metabolism. Higher metabolism equals more calories burned.


Many women avoid weight training because they're afraid of bulking up. But a little heavy lifting is actually your number-one key to calorie burn: The more lean muscle you have on your body, the faster your metabolism, the more calories you'll burn, and the slimmer and trimmer you'll look. That's because even when your muscles are at rest, they still require three times more energy than fat for tissue maintenance and rebuilding., We've established that you need cardio and weight training to really amp up your calorie expenditure. But what's more, if you do it right, you'll get an afterburn effect; you can burn up to 300 calories post-workout. Seriously.


A simple definition of how to do this would be to lift something heavy, sprint and repeat several times over. It works your heart and lungs but also helps tone your muscles at the same time. Mix up a run with burpees, squats, deadlifts, and sprints to burn calories even while you have your feet up on the couch.Gyms often offer classes that involve both these domains. Ask yours about the cardio/weight classes they have available. You'll get the workout and find buddies to gripe with afterward -- and you thought only Charlie Sheen was winning.

, Burning calories is clearly about working as many muscle groups as you can at one time and circuit training does just that. But did you know that there are also psychological benefits too? It ups your mood and releases stress, in addition to increasing your cardiovascular fitness.The reason circuit training has such great effects is because it switches between muscle groups so quickly. Therefore, you're not wasting any time resting in between stations. Your heart rate gets up and stays up, which definitely doesn't happen with weightlifting. And if you add a bit of aerobics into your circuit training session, even better., Often people fall back into thinking that cardio is code for running. While running is a very efficient way to burn calories, there are others. Swimming, rowing, boxing, and dancing are all great workouts, too.


A good, solid rowing workout can easily have you burning 800 to 1,000 calories in an hour's worth of work.Just 45 minutes in the pool will easily burn 800 excess calories just itching to be stored as fat.Boxing rings in at about 700 calories per hour, depending on your weight.Something simple like ballet even burns about 450 calories an hour., If you can jog around your block blindfolded and with both arms tied behind your back, it's high time you find something else to do. Not only will this keep your mind fresh, but your body needs the challenge, too. It adapts to activities and burns fewer calories when they become old hat. To give your metabolism the ol' fake-out, go for cross-training.Don't forget about the after burn! When your body does something it's not used to, it takes time to recover. In that recovery period, your metabolism is still up. Whatever you do, discover new muscles and keep 'em guessing.

, Not only can the magical stuff fight cancer, but it can give your metabolism a boost, too. In a recent study by the Journal of Clinical Nutrition, participants who took green-tea extract three times each day saw a 4% rise in their metabolisms.


What does that 4% mean to you? An extra 60 calories a day, that's what. You know what that means long-term? 6 pounds! Just by taking a little pill. And if you're of the scientific variety, it's believed to up your levels of norepinephrine., And you thought miracles didn't happen: A recent study has shown that if you drink 17 ounces of cold water, within 10 minutes your metabolism shoots up 30-40% for the next half hour or so. That means you could burn an extra 17,400 calories a year just by consuming an extra 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) a day or so. That's five pounds!In addition to upping your metabolism, water fills you up, keeping you from eating more. Before you go about snacking, grab a glass. And, of course, always have a bottle with you at the gym.

, A study published in the Journal on Obesity Research found that women who ate only low-fat dairy products -- like nonfat yogurt, for example -- at least three times a day lost 70% more fat than their female counterparts who just ate low amounts of dairy. In short, dairy doers have less fat on their body, not the other way around.


In fact, calcium tells your body to amp up the fat burning. Unfortunately, calcium-fortified goods don't fall under the same umbrella -- to feel the calcium power, you have to go for the dairy products in the raw. Try to get at least 1,200 mg a day., With your diet, at least. Turns out those who eat fish on the regular have lower leptin levels -- this blessing keeps up the metabolism, preventing obesity. Try to get a serving of fish in every other day; salmon, tuna, and mackerel, your fattier fish, are best.Replace foods that expand your waistline with healthy foods, like fish. Fish is a food that is full of satisfying flavor, low in calories, and stocked with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 acids are essential fats that your body can't make. They help keep the blood from clotting too easily and add to a better cholesterol ratio., Low-carb, high-fiber foods take more time to digest than other foods, leaving you feeling fuller longer and less likely to snack needlessly. Spinach, broccoli, asparagus, and cauliflower are all healthy, high-fiber foods.Beyond the fiber content, crunching and chewing a whole piece of fruit stimulates your senses and takes longer to eat. So psychologically, it may also be more satisfying than beverages or soft foods. Chewing also promotes saliva and the production of stomach juices that help fill the stomach., Not in an extreme, Atkins sort of way, but having a little protein at every meal fires up your metabolism. Your digestive system uses more energy to break it down, so you burn more calories. However, keep protein levels to between 20 and 35 percent of your diet; eating too much of it can cause kidney strain and may cause your body to store too much fat.Not all protein is created equal. Be sure to look for protein sources that are nutrient-rich and lower in fat and calories, such as lean meats, beans, soy, and low-fat dairy., Stress may contribute to abdominal fat, according to several studies, including a recent one at the University of California, San Francisco. When you're stressed, hormones like cortisol stimulate your appetite, slow your metabolism down and encourage fat storage inside your abdomen.


So what can you do about this? Find an activity that reduces stress for you, whether it's listening to soothing music or taking yoga, and do it daily.Not only will you relax, but you'll lessen your likelihood to stress eat.

, Studies show that eating breakfast plays a part in successful weight loss — almost 80 percent of people who successfully keep weight off chow down on this meal, according to a study published in Obesity Research.


Your metabolism slows as you sleep, and the process of digesting food revs it up again. Aim for a 300- to 400-calorie breakfast, such as an egg whites, high-fiber cereal (another metabolism booster) with skim milk or oatmeal and fruit., For most people, the body uses up more energy digesting smaller meals every few hours than by eating the same number of calories in two or three sittings.So snack away during the day.


Grazing is a surprisingly good idea because it helps you avoid metabolic slowdown. Your body will be tricked into thinking it's constantly eating, so it will never slow your metabolism down. Aim for five small meals (200 to 500 calories) a day rather than three large ones. Also try not to go more than four hours without eating — if you eat breakfast at 7am, for example, have a snack at 10am, lunch at noon, another snack at 3pm and dinner at 7pm., It may be hard to fathom, but alcohol actually depresses your central nervous system, ultimately slowing your metabolism. Now you have another reason to chug the H2O. A study in the UK found that if you consume a high-calorie meal, less of that will be burned off (and more will be stored) if you consumed it alongside alcohol.Alright, that's not entirely true. If you can keep your alcohol intake to one glass of red wine a day, you'll actually be less likely to become obese. That's one 4-oz glass of wine -- not one jug., People who are constantly in motion — crossing and uncrossing their legs, stretching and pacing — burn more calories. When researchers at the Mayo Clinic asked subjects to eat an additional 1,000 calories a day for eight weeks, they found that only the non-fidgeters stored the calories as fat.Overweight people have a tendency to sit, while lean ones have trouble holding still and spend two hours more a day on their feet, pacing around and fidgeting, research says. The difference translates into about 350 calories a day, enough to produce a weight loss of 30 to 40 pounds in one year without trips to the gym., Yeah, Gosling may be on Letterman, but it's way more important for your waistline to head to bed. A study at the University of Chicago Medical Center found that people who got only four hours of sleep had much more difficulty processing carbs. The culprit? Increased levels of insulin and the stress hormone cortisol.


When you're exhausted, your body lacks the energy to do its normal day-to-day functions, which includes burning calories efficiently. So the best way to make sure your metabolism runs smoothly is to get six to eight hours of Zs each night., Don't think of burning calories as something reserved for the gym. You can burn those bad boys anytime, anywhere. The following activities burn 150 calories for a 150-lb person:Golf and carry your own clubs for 24 minutes
Shovel snow by hand for 22 minutes
Spade your garden for 26 minutes
Push a power lawn mower for 30 minutes
Painting the house for 27 minutes
Play ping pong or chase your kids around the playground for 33 minutes

Calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR).,
Account for your activity level.,
Calculate your total calorie needs for weight loss.,
Keep track of how many calories you currently eat each day.,
Don't eat less than your calculated BMR.,
Keep a food journal.,
Weigh yourself regularly.",How to Calculate How Many Calories You Need to Eat to Lose Weight," Your BMR will tell you how many calories your body needs to function properly if you spent the entire day doing absolutely nothing. This is also known as your metabolic rate or metabolism.


Your body burns calories just to fulfill life-sustaining processes like breathing, digesting food, repairing and growing tissue and circulating blood.You will use the results from the BMR equation to find out how many calories you need to either lose weight or maintain your weight.
Use the following equation (known as the Harris Benedict Equation) that is commonly used by health professionals to determine calorie needs. for men: 66.47 + (13.7 * weight ) + (5 * size ) − (6.8 * age )Use the following equation for women: 655.1 + (9.6 * weight ) + (1.8 * size ) − (4.7 * age );
, In addition to essential bodily functions, you must also account for the calories you burn through daily activity.Once you have your BMR, multiply your BMR by the appropriate activity factor:


If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : BMR x 1.2
If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports one to three days/week) : BMR x 1.375
If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports three to five days/week) : BMR x 1.55
If you are very active (hard exercise/sports six to seven days a week) : BMR x 1.725
If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports and physical job or 2x training) : BMR x 1.9
For example, a 19-year-old woman who is 5’5” and 130 pounds would plug her information into the calculator and find out that her BMR is 1,366.8 calories. Then, since she is moderately active, exercising three to five days per week, she would multiply 1,366.8 by 1.55, to equal 2,118.5 calories. That is the number of calories that her body burns on an average day.

, In order to lose 1 pound of fat each week, you must have a deficit of 3,500 calories over the course of a week.Cutting out about 500 calories each day will result in a 3,500 calorie deficit over the course of the entire week.
Only aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds per week. If you were to lose weight through diet alone, you'd need a 500-calorie deficit every day to lose one pound in a week. If you were really pushing it and wanted to lose 2 pounds in a week, you'd need a 1,000-calorie deficit every day.Aim to cut calories out by decreasing how much you eat in addition to burning off calories through physical activity. This combination generally produces the most effective weight loss.

, When you first start your attempt to lose weight, it may be helpful to keep track of how many calories you're currently eating.


Keep a food journal or use an online calculator to help you get an estimate of how much you currently consume.
Compare this amount to your calculated and activity-adjusted BMR. If the numbers aren't even remotely close, it may be easier to start your diet by consuming your calculated amount of calories daily.
Consuming a significant amount of calories less than you're typical day might be difficult. Decrease slowly by first adjusting your diet to line up with your activity-adjusted BMR level.

, It's a bad idea to consistently make your daily caloric intake lower than your BMR. When your body doesn't take in enough calories each day to sustain basic functions, it starts burning muscle for energy.This will make maintaining your weight loss more difficult in the long run.


Very low calorie diets aren't typically considered safe or appropriate for weight loss. They do not provide enough flexibility for you consume an adequate amount of protein, vitamins or minerals that are essential to your health.Try to keep consume at least 1,200 calories daily. This is generally recommended to by the absolute lowest amount of calories to take in daily.

, Consider keeping a food journal that lists everything you eat, as well as the calories per serving and how many servings you had. Studies show that those who journal their foods regularly stick to their diet plans longer and lose more weight.Search online for free apps or websites that allow you to enter what you ate — some will even calculate the calories for you. Try MyFitnessPal or Super Tracker by the USDA. You can also log your activity level and the amount of exercise you get each day.
Seeing the actual amount of calories you consume each day will force you to take responsibility for your health and cut back on eating. Be vigilant about logging everything that goes into your mouth, and you'll find it's easier to stick to your diet.

, Another important component of weight loss is tracking your weight and overall progress.


Studies have shown that those dieters who weighed themselves regularly were more successful long-term than those who didn't keep track on their weight.Weigh yourself about one to two times per week. Try to get on the scale at the same time of day (try for first thing in the morning after you've just emptied your bladder) while you're wearing the same clothes for the most accurate record of progress.
If you're not losing weight, reevaluate your total calorie intake. You may need to cut out more calories or be more accurate with your food journaling.

Add calories to gain weight.",How to Calculate Your Total Daily Calorie Needs," You can calculate your total calorie needs with the number of available online calculators.


These may be easier to use and less complicated than doing the required mathematical equations yourself.
You can find a variety of calculators from weight loss and wellness clinics and some medical associations' websites. Make sure you're choosing a reliable website and do not use calculators from blogs or other personal sites.
Most of these calculators operate in the same way. You'll input your height, weight, gender, age and activity level. Have this information handy when you calculate your needs.
You can try online calculators from the Mayo Clinic or from the USDA's Supertracker.;
, Your BMR is the amount of calories your body requires just to perform daily, life sustaining functions. It's the rate of your metabolism or the amount of calories your body burns at rest.Your body needs a set number of calories just to stay alive and function normally. Anything from keeping your heart beating, breathing or digesting food requires energy in the form of calories. It accounts for the largest amount of total calories burned each day.The BMR equation for the average American woman is: (4.7 x your height in inches) + (4.35 x your weight in pounds) - (4.7 x your age in years). Add 655 to this total for the BMR..
The BMR equation for the average American man is: (12.7 x your height in inches) + (6.23 x your weight in pounds) - (6.8 x your age in years). Add 66 to the total for the BMR.
You will use your BMR in the Harris Benedict equation to find out how many calories you burn with activity included.

, The Harris Benedict Equation can help you calculate an estimate of how many calories you burn each day by multiplying your BMR by your average activity level.Multiply your BMR by your activity level. This will give you a fairly accurate number for your daily total caloric intake.
If you're sedentary (little to no exercise) multiply your BMR by 1.2.
If you are lightly active (exercising about 1-to-3 days each week), multiply your BMR by 1.375.
If you are moderately active (exercising moderately and/or play sports 3-to-5 days) multiply your BMR by 1.55.
If you are very active (people who engage in strenuous sports or hard exercise 6-to-7 days a week) multiply your BMR by 1.725.
If you are extra active (people who engage in very physically challenging jobs or exercise, such as 2-a-day workouts) multiply your BMR by 1.9.

, More muscular bodies or people that have low body fat and high levels of lean muscle may need more daily calories than more average people.


If you're an athlete or naturally have a lower body fat percentage, you may need more calories than predicted by online calculators or mathematical equations.
Lean muscle mass burns more calories than fat mass. Eating a small amount more may help you reach a more appropriate calorie goal.
Also note that overweight or obese people may overestimate daily calories with the Harris Benedict formula.

, These nutrition experts will be able to give you more specific recommendations about your calorie needs. They will also be able to tell you how to use your daily calorie needs to help manage your health. It is especially important to meet with a dietitian if you have any health conditions or medical issues that need to be taken into account.


You may need to look up local dietitians online or ask your primary care physician for a referral to a local dietitian. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has a ""Find an Expert"" feature on their website to help you search.Many dietitians have different focus areas. If you're interested in a specific topic - like weight loss, eating for athletic performance or managing chronic health conditions - look for dietitians that focus in that specialty.

, Many people want to figure out how many calories they burn each day to help them lose weight. Adjust your recommended intake to help support your goal.


If you want to lose weight, it's typically recommended to cut out about 500 calories daily to result in safe weight loss (losing 1-2 pounds weekly).Cutting out more calories is typically not recommended. If you don't eat enough your weight loss may slow and you're at a higher risk for nutrient deficiencies.

, If you and your doctor or nutritionist decide that you need to gain weight, you can also use your total daily calorie needs to help you gain weight.


Health professionals recommended consuming an extra 250-500 calories daily. This will result in about 1/2-1 pound weight gain each week.
To maintain your weight, try to keep calories within the range predicted by your calculations.
If you notice unwanted weight loss or weight gain, revisit your total caloric intake and adjust as necessary.

Learn about low-carb fruits and veggies.,
Choose low-carb protein.,
Opt for healthy breads, rices, and grains.",How to Ease off of Carbohydrates1," While many people assume low-carb diets means cutting back on bread, many food types have some carbs. Even fruits and vegetables can be high in carbohydrates. Learn about the best types of fruits and vegetables for a low-carb diet.


Leafy vegetables and stem-based vegetables tend to be the lowest in carbs. Things like spinach, lettuce, and Swiss chard are excellent leafy options, while good stem options include broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, and asparagus.When it comes to fruits, a wide variety of fruits are low in carbohydrates. Opt for watermelon, strawberries, cantaloupe, avocado, blackberries, grapefruit, oranges, cranberries, plums, raspberries, pineapples, mangoes, and more. Stay away from bananas and apples, however, as these tend to be high in carbs.Beans, lentils, corn, and peas are all high in carbs.
Opt for whole fruits and veggies over juices and smoothies. You get the most nutrients out of simply eating produce in its original form.;
, Dairy, eggs, and meats are very low in carbs. Stock up on these items if you're looking to lessen carb consumption in your diet.


Eggs are excellent choice when it comes to a low-carb diet. Not only are they high in protein and other essential nutrients, they're low calorie and easy to prepare; however, be careful how you prepare eggs. If you choose to fry or scramble them, use olive oil over butter. Do not add too many unhealthy flavor options, like cheese or salt.Meats such as beef, chicken, turkey do not contain carbs.
Seafood such as fish, shrimp, lobster, oysters do not contain carbs.
Processed meats like bacon, sausage and hotdogs contain some carbs because of the processing and additives.
Be careful about incorporating dairy. Certain cheeses can be high in carbohydrates. When using dairy, go for cottage cheese, goat's cheese, and Greek yogurt. In general, white cheeses (e.g., brie, Monterey, ricotta) tend to be lower carb than brighter varieties., You do need some whole wheats as part of a balanced diet. When you do opt for carbs, go for healthier options than white breads and rices.


Go for whole wheat breads and pastas over white varieties. Choose brown rice over white rice. Processed carbs lack nutrients and can cause spikes in insulin that lead to hunger later on.
If you're trying to cut back on carbs, try to lessen your exposure to bread products overall. Try an open-faced sandwich, which uses only one slice of bread. Use half the amount of rice you'd usually add to a plate of stir fry.

Incorporate at least 30 minutes of cardio into your daily routine.,
Add strength training to burn more calories while your body is at rest.,
Look for little ways to burn more calories.,
Fidget.",How to Burn Calories1," The best way to burn more calories is to incorporate more exercise into your daily routine. Cardiovascular exercises like walking, running, swimming, and biking help you to burn calories even after you have finished. You should aim for at least 30 minutes per day, but keep in mind that the longer you work out, the longer your body will keep burning calories after you have finished., Muscle burns 2.5 times more calories than fat, so the more muscle that you have on your body, the more calories you will burn when your body is at rest. If you don’t already have a strength training regimen, add strength training into your daily routine.


Focus your strength training on large muscle groups for maximum burn, such as the thighs, arms, abdomen, back and chest., The more you move throughout the day, the more calories you will burn. Add small bursts of exercise throughout your day to increase your overall calorie burn. Park further away from the entrance at the mall, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or do some lunges or crunches during commercial breaks when watching TV., Studies show that lean people fidget for about 150 minutes a day more than obese people do. That kind of low-grade activity (tapping feet and fingers, twirling hair, gesturing while speaking, etc.) can burn 350 calories a day, which translates into 10 – 30 pounds a year! It's called Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) and it includes any movement that isn't intended as exercise. You can burn an extra 100 – 150 calories an hour by increasing NEAT.Here are some ideas:


Standing burns 50% more calories than sitting. Stand while talking on the phone, using the computer, or reading the paper.
Pacing is even better. By pacing, you can burn 90 more calories an hour than if you were sitting still. Make it a habit to pace whenever you use the phone.
Buy a workstation or desk that you can stand at or, if you can, set up a desk over a treadmill. By walking 1 mile (1.6 km) an hour while you work, you'll burn an additional 100 calories per hour which, if you do this for two to three hours a day, you could lose 44 – 60 pounds in a year. It's recommended that you start slowly, though, walking 15 minutes every hour and then increasing gradually. Alternatively, you can use a mini-stepper under a tall desk, or while watching TV to achieve the same results.

Talk to your doctor or dietitian.,
Always measure portion sizes.,
Follow recommended daily serving amounts.,
Cut out refined grains.,
Limit starchy vegetables.,
Choose a low-starch breakfast.,
Swap out your sandwich for a starch-free option.,
Go for cauliflower over grains.,
Consider purchasing a spiralizer.,
Include nutritious sources of starch at breakfast.,
Boost your fiber intake.,
Include potatoes and yams.,
Include 100% whole grains.",How to Eat Less Starch," Before making any large diet changes — like reducing entire food groups or nutrients — it's important to first consult with your physician. They will be able to tell you if your new diet plan is appropriate and healthy.


Since starch is found in a wide variety of foods — many of them very nutritious foods — it's important to let your doctor know about this change. Ask them whether or not they think this diet change is safe and appropriate for you given your current health conditions or medications.
Also talk to them about why you want to reduce starch in your diet. Are you trying to lose weight? Are you trying to better manage your diabetes? If so, your doctor will most likely be able to provide other guidance and resources to help meet your goal.
Another option is to speak to a registered dietitian. These nutrition experts will be able to provide you with detailed information on starch and the most nutritious sources of starch. They can also help you make a meal plan.;
, If you're trying to limit any food in your diet, you'll want to make sure you're familiar with appropriate serving sizes of that food. In case you do decide to eat it, you can minimize the amount by sticking to the appropriate serving.


Grains like bread, rice and pasta are some of the most starch-heavy foods. In addition, they're also some of the most calorie-dense starchy foods. A serving is 1 oz or 1/2 cup after cooking.Starchy vegetables are another common source of starch. If you're eating foods like potatoes, yams or corn, make sure you measure out 1 cup per serving.Beans and lentils are starchy foods as well but are considered a source of protein. Measure out 1/2 cup of beans and lentils per serving.These are also a source of resistant starch (versus ""digestible"" starch), which improves health and may help with weight control., Even if you measure the appropriate serving size, it's important to not eat too many servings of starch-heavy foods throughout the day.


Your total intake of grains per day should not exceed about five to six servings daily. The USDA recommends consuming a minimum of three servings daily.It's typically recommended to consume about three to four servings of vegetables each day.Starchy vegetables are a part of this recommendation, but are not something that is considered necessary on a daily basis.

, An easy way to cut out some starch in your diet and improve your overall diet is by cutting out or avoiding refined grain products.


Refined grains — like those found in white breads — have been heavily processed which makes them much lower in fiber and other essential nutrients. They still contain the same calories, but without all the good nutrition, which makes them ""empty"" calories.
Refined grains can include foods like: cakes, pies, cookies, crackers, chips, white bread, white rice, plain pasta, bagels, breakfast pastries and cereals. Diets high in these foods can lead to weight gain, diabetes and stroke.If you're choosing to have a grain like some bread, pasta, rice or English muffins, go for 100% whole wheat. These are less processed making them higher in fiber and other essential nutrients., Outside of grains and starchy protein sources, the other main source of starch in a typical diet is from starchy vegetables. If you are concerned about your starch intake, you may want to choose a less starchy vegetable to eat, or just be sure you eat them in the proper portion size. A balanced, healthy diet is one that is full of variety, so it's fine to eat starchy vegetables sometimes — just make sure you're switching it up.


Starchy vegetables include foods like: corn, peas, lentils, beans, potatoes and yams.
Although these foods are starch-heavy, they are lower in calories than other sources of starch like grains.In addition, these foods do offer a variety of health benefits. Most are high in fiber in addition to other vitamins and minerals.

, Breakfast is a common meal for starches to be present. Whether you're having a slice of toast, bowl of cereal or bowl of oatmeal, breakfast can contain a high quantity of starch.


Instead of a bowl of oatmeal or cereal, switch to a bowl of yogurt or cottage cheese topped with some fruit and nuts if you'd like. There's no starch and you'll get more protein and calcium from these foods.If you normally go for an egg sandwich or eggs with toast, skip the bread all together. Make yourself an omelet with veggies and cheese.
If you're looking for a quick or simple breakfast, try a smoothie with yogurt and fruit or a piece of fruit and a cheese stick.

, Sandwiches and wraps are a common lunch time and dinner meal. They're an easy and very convenient meal; however, grains are a calorie dense and starchy food.If you only want to reduce starch, not eliminate it, choose a 100% whole grain wrap instead of sandwich bread. It's usually lower in calories, carbohydrates and starches and will keep you fuller longer due to fiber content.
If you're going starch-free trying using a lettuce wrap instead. It's low-calorie and naturally starch-free.
You can also just pack deli meat and cheese roll ups and skip the bread or bread substitutes all together.

, A new trend that's become very popular is using cauliflower, a non-starchy vegetable, to replace many starchy and high-carbohydrate foods. Cauliflower is naturally low-calorie.Grated cauliflower can be cooked and used in place of rice and other grains like quinoa or couscous.
Cauliflower can also be grated and cooked into the shape of a pizza crust instead of using flour.
Well-steamed and mashed cauliflower is a great substitute for mashed potatoes.
You can even use grated cauliflower to make rolls instead of using flower.
If you're a big fan of hummus, but are skipping the beans, try making cauliflower hummus instead.

, Another nifty trick to help reduce the amount of starch in your diet is by purchasing a spiralizer. These relatively inexpensive tools can be purchased in a cooking store or online and help make noodle shapes out of fruits and vegetables.Spiralizers allow you to make low-calorie pastas or noodles from vegetables. Swapping out your typical pasta for a spiralized vegetable helps you cut out the starch from your pasta.
Try making spaghetti from zucchini or yellow squash. You can quickly cook these ""noodles"" or eat them raw with your favorite pasta sauce.
If you're allowing a minimal amount of starch in your diet, make spaghetti with half 100% whole wheat pasta and half zucchini pasta.
You can also spiralize an English cucumber to make cold noodles. Tossed with your favorite Asian marinade, they make a great cold sesame noodle salad.

, Breakfast gives you the chance to start your day off with a lot of nutrient-dense foods to help you concentrate and power through your day. If you're only reducing starches, not eliminating them, choose nutrient-dense options.


Start your day off with a bowl of oatmeal. Go for rolled oats or steel cut as these are less processed than instant oats. Oatmeal is very high in fiber and also contains many vitamins and minerals like selenium, phosphorus, magnesium and Vitamin E.Oats are a form of resistant starch.
Another source of starch you can include are 100% whole wheat breads like English muffins, toast or whole wheat wraps. Like oatmeal, these whole grains are also high in fiber and many minerals.Top with a scrambled egg for extra protein.
If you want to start your day with cereal, follow the ""5, 5, 10 rule."" This states your cereal should contain at least 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein and a maximum of 10 grams of sugar., Fiber is an essential nutrient to a healthy diet. It helps provide bulk to your meals making you feel satisfied and helps keep your GI system healthy.Although foods like beans, lentils and peas are higher in starch, they are also high in many other beneficial nutrients like: fiber, folate, potassium and magnesium.In addition, they've been found to be helpful in lowering cholesterol.Try adding small portions of beans, lentils and peas to your diet to reap the nutritional benefits, but still minimize the total starch in your day. Try: topping a salad with 1/2 cup of beans or lentils, having 1/4 cup of hummus with 1 cup raw vegetables, having a small bowl of lentil soup with a side salad, roasting 1/2 cup of chickpeas or soybeans for a crunchy snack or make a cold, marinated bean salad.
It's important to aim for adequate fiber each day. By including both starchy and non starchy foods you need to aim for 25 g of fiber daily for women and 28 g of fiber daily for men., Potatoes have gotten a bad rap over the years not only due to their high starch content, but also due to their high carbohydrate content; however, these little spuds are actually quite nutritious and can be a healthy addition to your diet.


Regular, white potatoes are naturally lower in calories, but high in fiber, potassium and Vitamin C. If you eat these spuds, leave their skins on and minimize how much butter, sour cream and other high fat toppings you put on them.
Sweet potatoes and yams are also naturally lower in calories but contain even more benefits than white potatoes. They have more fiber, Vitamin C, Vitamin A and potassium.Eat these spuds with the skin on as well and minimize your choice of toppings.
Potatoes that are cooked and then cooled are high in resistant starch.

, Grains are a high-starch food; however, 100% whole grains can provide your diet with extra nutrition. If you're only reducing starches, considering adding minimal servings of these nutrient-dense foods.


100% whole grains are very minimally processed. The lack of processing keeps the nutritious parts of the grain intact which makes them much higher in fiber, vitamins and even protein.Stick to the appropriate portion sizes of any of these nutrient rich grains: brown rice, millet, quinoa, barely, farro, oats, whole grain bread or whole grain pasta.
Make the proportion of these foods smaller to help reduce your total starch intake. For example, if you're making pasta with chicken and broccoli, only use a little pasta and use more broccoli and chicken instead. Or, you're making a stir fry with shrimp, vegetables and brown rice, only make a minimal amount of rice and bulk up your dish with the shrimp and vegetables.

SCD primarily works by starving bacteria in your intestines. If this is not the source of your digestive troubles, SCD may not work and could even damage your health.Although many people do lose weight on SCD, it is not a weight loss diet, and is not promoted as such. Rather, it's a healing diet that is designed to remedy digestive problems and help improve your digestive processes.
Get advice from your doctor particularly if you have been diagnosed with a chronic digestive disease or disorder and are currently on prescription medication to treat it. The diet may interfere with your medication, or with other treatments.;
, Since SCD is a trademarked system, it is essential to buy the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Dr. Elaine Gottschall, and read it all the way through at least once before starting the diet.You can buy the book online, or pick up a copy at most major bookstores. You also may be able to find a copy of the book at your local library.
The official website for the book, www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info, has a list of places where the book is available for purchase.
It's probably a good idea to read through the book once just to get a general idea of the diet and what it entails. Then, if you've decided you want to try it, go through it again and take notes.

, The SCD is a strict diet plan that must be followed exactly if you expect to see any results. After you've read the book, go through your fridge and pantry and get rid of any foods that aren't allowed, so you won't be tempted.You can find a legal/illegal list online. You may want to print it up so you can use it as a guide while you go through your kitchen.
Keep in mind that in addition to food, there also may be seasonings and spices that you'll need to avoid, especially during the first few weeks you're on the diet.
If you live with other people who will not be following SCD, you may want to separate their foods from yours and keep them out of sight so you won't be tempted to eat them, especially in the first days when the diet is the most restrictive.

, In addition to the official website associated with the book, there are numerous websites and blogs where you can find information about the SCD, including recipes and blogs that describe other people's experiences on the diet.There are some resources listed on the official website for the book, and also some testimonials. Another comprehensive online source for SCD information is www.scdiet.org, which includes links to support groups and detailed background information on SCD if you want to do more research before you commit.
While you're deciding whether to start the diet, it's just as important to read negative experiences as it is to read positive ones.
There is another book, Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™, by Raman Prasad, that will come in handy once you complete the intro diet and start adding new foods. Many of these recipes are included on the website associated with the book, found at www.scdrecipe.com.
You also may find helpful information on websites operated by nonprofit organizations and medical groups dedicated to assisting people with various digestive disorders.

, The SCD requires you to make many of the things you'll be eating at home. It's typically more convenient to buy the necessary ingredients and make your basic foods in batches. Then you can refrigerate or freeze them and they'll be ready for you throughout the week.Go through the intro diet and the recipes included, and make your list. Focus on whole foods, because you'll have to prepare them specially. For example, you should get whole carrots and peel them yourself rather than buying carrot sticks or other prepared carrots.
You'll need several bottles of pressed apple cider or grape juice, since these are the only drinks you're allowed during the intro diet apart from water.
Look for large packages of chicken legs and thighs, since you'll need these to make your chicken soup.

, Homemade yogurt is one of the staples of the SCD. Because the SCD starves the bad bacteria in your gut, yogurt is essential to introduce good bacteria to replace the harmful bacteria.You can make homemade yogurt in your oven without needing any special supplies other than a large pot and a thermometer. Pour one or two quarts (liters) of milk into the pot and heat to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (about 82 degrees Celsius). The milk must be heated to this temperature to sterilize it. You can use cow milk or goat milk.
When you've heated the milk to the correct temperature, turn the heat off and allow it to cool to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (about 21 degrees Celsius). Stir it as it cools, covering it with a towel when not stirring it. If you want smoother yogurt, pour the cooled milk through a sieve to get rid of the skin that forms on the top of the milk.
In a separate bowl, mix together some of the cooled milk with a cup of plain commercial yogurt. When you've blended it well (you can use a whisk or an electric hand mixer), add it back to the pot.
Cover your pot and place it in the oven with a 60-watt light bulb. You'll need to keep a thermometer in the oven and make sure it stays between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (between 37.7 and 43.3 degrees Celsius). If it gets too hot, prop open the oven door.
Allow the milk in the pot to ferment this way for 24 hours, and you'll have your homemade yogurt. Stir it until it's smooth, and refrigerate.

, While you're on the intro diet, you'll be eating the SCD homemade chicken soup every day. You may find the intro chicken soup a bit bland, but you can add vegetables and spices to it once you get further into the diet.Put enough chicken thighs and legs into a large stew pot to fill it about halfway. You can use other parts of the chicken as well, but thighs and legs will make your broth more flavorful.
Peel about 10 carrots and add them into the pot with the chicken, then fill the pot with water. You can season with salt to taste.
Simmer your soup for about four hours, then strain it through a colander or strainer. Skim off the top layer of fat and you have your broth.
Puree the carrots in a blender and return them to the broth.

, The SCD is a healing diet, designed to starve the harmful bacteria in your gut and replace it with beneficial bacteria. In the first few days you begin the diet, you may experience severe cramping and diarrhea.During the first few days, you'll need to monitor the color and consistency of your stools. With the initial die-off of bacteria in your gut, your stools likely will change color several times over the course of the intro diet.
You should follow the strict intro diet until you are producing healthy stools. The length of time this will take varies greatly from person to person. Some people only need to be on the intro diet for a couple of days, while others must follow it for as long as a week.

, As you start adding new foods, you'll need to become very familiar with the SCD list of legal foods, and understand when you can start to add certain foods. Some should be added before others.The list is included in the book. You also can find searchable databases of legal/illegal foods so you can quickly find something in which you're interested rather than having to read through a whole list.
You can find a browsable list on the book's official website, which is organized alphabetically.Look for your favorite foods, and mark or highlight them on the list so you know the earliest time you can add them and you can focus on adding the foods you like first.
You also might want to look through some recipes and find some that you like. Check the ingredients and add those foods at the earliest point so your meals will have more variety.

, Commercial juices and nut butters typically contain preservatives and sugars that aren't allowed on SCD. While you may be able to find organic, all-natural versions at specialty and health food stores, it typically is cheaper to make your own.Making your own juices also allows you to dilute the juice properly and ensure all pulp is removed, which is required by the SCD.
Check the book for instructions on when you can start adding other juices and nut milks or nut butters to your diet.
Generally speaking, you should wait until you've been on SCD for about three months to add nut milks, flours, and butters. The main reason to wait three months is so you can use a variety of nuts. Early in the SCD, you can only eat limited types of nuts. Introduce them slowly.
With juices, you can add them whenever the book tells you that you can add that fruit. Follow the instructions in the book for making your juices, and make sure you aren't adding any sugar.

, A food journal allows you to carefully monitor the food you eat as you follow the SCD. This is particularly important after you've completed the intro diet and start to add new foods.You may have a negative reaction that you don't immediately associate with the introduction of a new food, since symptoms may not occur right away. Your food journal will help you better make the connection.
Also keep in mind that having ""withdrawal"" symptoms after eliminating certain types of food from your diet is not uncommon. Having a food journal can help you to distinguish these symptoms from a negative reaction to a new food.
Certain substances in food, such as sugar and caffeine, can be addictive. If your diet included these substances you may want to taper off of them slowly before you start the SCD.

, Even though you may see timeline-based suggestions, the SCD is based on how far along you are in the healing process. Your digestive health determines when you can introduce new foods, and how much you can introduce at a time.Keep in mind that the initial symptoms of bacterial die-off in your intestines can continue for as long as three weeks – even after you've transitioned beyond the intro diet and started introducing other foods.
Include your observations in your food journal, so you know how your body is reacting to the specific foods you're eating and can determine when it is safe to add new foods.
If you have a negative reaction such as diarrhea after introducing a new food, take that food off the menu and allow your system to adjust, then re-introduce it more slowly if it's something you like and want to be able to eat.

, If you introduce several new foods at once and experience bad symptoms, you won't know which new food is the culprit. For this reason, you should leave a day or two between new food introductions so you can monitor your body's reaction.The SCD doesn't require you to add any new food at any time. You shouldn't add a food if you already have a known allergy or sensitivity to it.
Keep in mind that with a healthier gut, you may have sensitivities to a particular food that you never noticed before. Even if you enjoyed a food before you started the SCD, you still should introduce it slowly in small amounts.
If you notice a negative reaction after introducing a new food, take that food away and see if your system stabilizes. You can re-introduce the food more slowly if you want to have it in your diet, but you may want to wait a few weeks before doing so.

Use lettuce wraps.,
Alter pasta recipes.,
Replace mashed potatoes with squash or cauliflower.,
Go for low-carb options when possible.,
Make healthy snack choices.",How to Ease off of Carbohydrates2," Bread is a major contributor to a diet too high in carbs. If you love having a sandwich or taco for lunch, skip the tortilla or bun and go for a lettuce wrap.


Take a large leaf of romaine lettuce. Place your sandwich ingredients inside the wrap and roll it up. While you may initially miss the taste of bread, the crunchiness supplied by the lettuce can be quite satisfying.Many sandwich chains offer lettuce wraps as an option. Try asking if lettuce wraps are available when stopping for a sandwich at lunch. Jimmy John's has the option of an ""unwich,"" where meats, cheeses, and veggies are encased in lettuce rather than the traditional subway bun., Pasta is a favorite dinner option for many; however, it can be high in carbs. If you're going for a low-carb diet, try altering pasta recipes to lessen your consumption of carbs.


Try alternative types of noodles. Many grocery stores offer noodles made from veggies or more substantial grains, like barley, over flour.Cut up and cook bits of chicken, turkey, tofu, or pork. Then, make a pasta dish with half-protein, half-noodles. This will reduce the overall amount of carbs while making the meal more filling., Mashed potatoes are another staple of dinners. You can replace potatoes for winter squash, which contains half as many carbs as potatoes and 80% fewer calories. Cauliflower is also lower in calories and has 5.3g of carbs per serving, versus 96.73g carbs per serving of potatoes.You can follow your regular mashed potato recipe, just substituting potatoes for squash., If you're craving high-carb items like bread, watch for low-carb varieties when possible. Grab low-carb loafs of bread and packs of tortillas. This can allow you to cut back on carbs without completely giving up the foods you love.

, When it comes to snacking, there are a variety of way to avoid carbohydrates. Many popular snack choices, like chips, are very high in carbs so watch your snack choices.


Nuts can be a healthy, low-carb snack item; however, be careful how much you consume. Many nut-items, like walnuts and almonds, tend to be high in calorie so keep consumption in moderation.
Veggies and hummus can be a great low-carb snack option. Try slicing up carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower in preparation for the week and purchase containers of hummus from your local grocery store.
Air-popped popcorn is usually a better choice than chips when you're snacking in front of the TV as it's lower carb and calorie; however, popcorn at the movies tends to be loaded with butter, oil, and salt. Try option out of movie theater popcorn and instead backing your own healthy snacks.

Stick to a low-carb breakfast.,
Watch out for carbs at lunch.,
Plan dinners for the week.",How to Ease off of Carbohydrates3," For breakfast, stick to foods that are low in carbs. Trying to plan breakfast and stocking up on the right foods can help.


Breakfast staples like cereal and oatmeal tend to be higher in carbs. Eggs might be a better option. If you're short on time, you can hard boil eggs the night before and eat them with some fruit on your way out the door.
Greek yogurt with low-carb fruit, like strawberries and blueberries, is another good breakfast option.
Breakfast smoothies, made from low-carb fruits and veggies, can also be a good choice. While it's generally better to eat fruits and veggies whole, a breakfast smoothie can work if you're short on time.

, Lunch foods are notoriously high in carbohydrates. Sandwiches and pastas are popular lunch items for many, so be careful when planning lunch.


As stated, you can use lettuce instead of bread for sandwiches. You can also pack pasta lunches made from low-carb or veggie/egg based noodles.Salads can be made into meals in and of themselves with the right ingredients. Add protein, like nuts, eggs, or meats, to make a salad more filling. Have something light on the side, like a cup of soup.You can also use leftovers from dinner as a lunch item. This will save time on preparations and avoid the temptation for carbs that comes with mid-afternoon hunger pangs.

, Planning meals for the week is a safe option when it comes to cutting back on carbs. Oftentimes, when people are low on ingredients and time they opt for fast food or eating out. Have a meal plan ready for each week.


Look for low-carb recipes that are easy to reheat so you'll have leftovers all week long.
Plan meals around sales items to save money. If, for example, squash is on sale look into types of soups and pastas you can make with squash.
Write down your meals for the week on a calendar. If you have time, spend Sunday doing meal prep via cutting up and measuring ingredients.

Work on finding a hilly route or using a treadmill and changing the incline to help you burn extra calories on your walk.


Walking hills is a great aerobic exercise. It burns significantly more calories than walking on a flat surface and also specifically helps strengthen the back of your legs and glutes.If you walk outside, look for a route that has some hills. You can find a route with several hills or maybe find a route with just one long hill. Both will help increase your overall calorie burn.
If you do not walk outside or can't find a route with hills, consider using a treadmill instead. You can control the incline of the hill and how often you increase or decrease the incline.
When walking hills, make sure to shorten your stride and take quicker steps. In addition, lean your torso forward slightly and pump your arms in rhythm to your legs.;
, Whether you're pushing a stroller or using a front carrier for your infant or toddler, you can increase the intensity of your walk and burn more calories just by bringing your child along.Holding your infant in a front carrier helps increase the overall weight on your body which makes it harder to move your body while walking.
Pushing your infant or toddler in a stroller is a great extra form of resistance while walking.
Note that with a front carrier, it may be hard to do faster paced walking. If you want to walk at a faster pace, take the stroller instead.Make sure to keep your back upright with your head straight forward. Try to avoid hunching over your stroller as you push it.
If you have a stroller and you choose to do a hilly walk, the extra resistance of the stroller helps target the back of your legs and glutes., An easy way to increase the intensity of any type of aerobic exercise is by incorporating intervals. Even with walking, adding intervals helps increase the total calorie burn of your walk.Interval walking workouts include short bursts of very fast-paced walking with short bursts of more moderate-paced walking.
For example, you can walk at a moderate pace for 2 minutes and then alternate to a very brisk pace for 1 minute. Repeat this interval several times or do these interval sessions as a 10 minute cardio burst into a more lengthy walk.
To avoid injury, do not lengthen your stride when you increase your pace. Keep your stride length short and focus on moving your legs faster., Strength training is an essential part of your overall workout routine. Adding in some short strength training sessions while you walk can not only help increase your overall calorie burn but also help build lean muscle mass.Every 10 minutes on your walk, incorporate a few quick strength training exercises.
You can do a few sets of lunges, squats, crunches (on the grass), planks, push-ups or tricep push-ups. These body weight exercises require no additional equipment and can be easily incorporated into a walking routine.If you're walking outside, consider carrying light hand weights in a backpack with you (do not carry them in your hands) or set them outside in a safe area you'll pass in your walking loop. Stop by them and do some bicep curls or shoulder presses.
If you're walking indoors on a treadmill, you can hop off the treadmill and do some of the body weight exercises listed or use weight machines or free weights if you're at the gym.
Wearing ankle weights or carrying dumbbells while walking can cause great strain on your joints. If you want to carry them, put them in a pack with well-fitted straps and proper support.

, Power walking or race walking is a very different type of walk compared to your leisurely walk in the park. It uses a different form (a more athletic gait) but can burn many more calories, especially from fat.Power and race walkers are usually keeping up a pace of about 4.5 mph (7.2 km/h). If you haven't been walking or have just started walking, you may not be able to hit this pace initially, but will with time and practice.When you're race walking, you'll need to emphasize leading with your heel and rolling through the bottom of your foot to push off from your toes. Keep your stride short and pump your arms to help you maintain your pace.Work on continually increasing your pace and then increasing the amount of time you spend power walking. Generally an increase in time of about 10% every week is appropriate for most healthy adults.
Because power or race walking is a moderate-intensity aerobic activity, you'll need to make sure that you're wearing supportive and comfortable shoes to prevent aching feet., To keep yourself motivated with your walking routine (especially if you're trying to do more race walking), set realistic goals for yourself to meet on a regular basis.


Your goals should be specific and realistic for you. The more detailed your goal and realistic it is for you, the more likely you are to actually meet it.
For example, doing an hour of race walking without having any experience probably isn't realistic; however, starting out with 15 minutes of race walking three to four times a week is more specific and realistic.With higher intensity walking-by either race walking or using weights or hills-it may take you some time to build up the aerobic strength to meet your goals. Work slowly over a long period of time and you'll eventually meet your goals.

, Since walking is such an easy and enjoyable form of exercise, many people walk on a regular basis as part of a group. Joining a walking group may help keep you motivated.Look for local walking groups in your area. You may find groups through your church, school, work, or even local coffee shop. Check online or with friends or neighbors to locate groups close to you.
If you cannot find any walking groups that are local to you or walk at times that are convenient for you, consider making a walking group of your own. Ask friends, family members or co-workers if they'd like to join you.
You may also want to ask co-workers you're close with to walk on your lunch break together or to get to work slightly earlier to walk together.

, Another way to keep yourself motivated and to help you enjoy and look forward to your walks is by finding an enjoyable route to walk on. If you enjoy walking outside, find a route that's pretty or visually appealing to you. Maybe you enjoy walking in the woods, in the morning to see the sunrise or next to farm fields.
If you truly enjoy your walking route and the things you get to see as you walk, you'll look forward to getting up every day and spending your time walking.
Find multiple walking routes as well. Maybe some days you walk indoors, and other days you do one of a few outdoor routes you have. This helps keep things fresh and prevents you from getting bored.

, Even if you have pretty scenery to look at while you walk, you still might find it difficult to concentrate and keep your mind occupied as you walk.


Try listening to your favorite music while you walk. If you're wearing headphones, make sure that you can still hear cars or other people when you're walking.
You may also want to consider downloading an audiobook or podcast that you can look forward to hearing every day that you walk.
Another idea is to talk to a friend or family member through a headset or earphones as you walk. You can catch up and chat while you're working out all at once.

, If you have a four-legged friend, try taking your dog with you on a long walk. Just like humans, dogs also need exercise to stay healthy. You'll both be doing something good for your bodies.


Several studies show there are a variety of health benefits related to walking your dog. For starters, walking your dog can be great motivation. Many people find walking to maintain their dog's health is more motivating than walking for their own health.Other studies have shown that just being around a dog can help significantly lower stress levels.
In addition, when you're walking your dog, you're forced to go outside. Studies show that being in nature can improve memory and your overall sense of well-being.

, Whether you're walking or doing some other type of aerobic exercise, you need to aim for about 150 minutes each week.Walking, especially if at a faster pace, walking hills or walking with a stroller, can count as moderate-intensity aerobic activity. If you're only walking a few days a week, make sure you incorporate more walking or other moderate-intensity physical activity to meet the 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hour guideline.In addition to walking, you can also include other types of moderate-intensity aerobic activity like: jogging, swimming, using the elliptical or dancing.
Regardless of what type of aerobic activity you do each week, the health benefits are all fairly the same. Aerobic activity helps maintain a healthy weight, decrease your risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke and can even help improve memory and mood., If you aren't adding resistance training during your walk, it is advisable to include regular amounts of strength training each week. This type of exercise will complement all your hard work with your walking.


Strength training exercises offer different but equally important health benefits. They will help maintain or build lean muscle mass, increase your metabolism and also help increase bone density and prevent osteoporosis.Unlike cardiovascular activities like walking, you only need to do strength training exercises about one to two times per week. Aim to spend at least 20 minutes per session.
Add exercises like weightlifting or using free weights, yoga or pilates.

, Just like any type of exercise, it's also good to include a warm-up and cool-down session before and after your walk. This is especially important if you're power walking, doing intervals or using weights.To warm-up, slowly walk for about five to 10 minutes. You may also want to warm up your muscles by doing some bending and range of motion movements such as leg and arm circles, kick backs, high knees, etc.
To cool-down, slow down the speed of your walk or walk on a flat surface if you've been doing hills. Walk at a slow pace, breathing deeply, for about five minutes.
Part of your cool-down should include some stretching as well. After a walk, especially a power walk, a hilly walk or one where you used weights, make sure to do some stretching.

, Rest days are important for any type of exercise routine-walking included. Just because walking is a lower intensity activity compared to others, it's still important to let your body rest and recover.


If you're doing a lot of race or power walking, hiking with a heavy pack, doing intervals or using hills to walk, it's important to plan a rest day each week.
It's during rest that your body builds muscle mass, strength and repairs your muscles. Without adequate rest, your progress will be slow and can even stop.A rest day should still be active. You may choose to do another type of cardio activity (like using the elliptical or stair machine) or just do light restorative activities like yoga.
If you're only doing light walking, you may not need to have an actual rest day per se. However, you can take a day off of walking and do other activities like swimming, stretching or light yoga.

Eat foods that help your body burn calories.,
Space your calories out throughout the day.,
Eat breakfast every day.,
Add spice to your meals.",How to Burn Calories2," People who eat fibrous fruit, vegetables, complex carbs, and low-fat meat burn even more calories after they eat. Make sure that your diet features plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. Eat a balanced diet and do not exceed your recommended daily caloric intake. Some good choices include:Kale
Broccoli
Carrots
Apples
Pears
Citrus fruits
Oatmeal
Brown rice
Low-fat yogurt
Low-fat milk
Fish
Nuts and seeds (in moderation)

, Rather than consuming the traditional three meals a day, eat smaller meals throughout the day to help increase your metabolism and burn more calories. Aim for four to five evenly spaced small meals throughout the day. Try to eat every three hours to prevent excessive hunger and keep your metabolism revved up., Eating breakfast jump starts your metabolism, which helps you to burn more calories all day. Studies have found that people who eat breakfast also eat fewer calories throughout the day, while those who skip breakfast tend to eat more to make up for the calories they missed at breakfast. Choose high-fiber, low-calorie foods to reap the benefits of breakfast without going over on your calorie budget.Oatmeal, whole wheat bread, fruit, yogurt, and low-fat milk are great breakfast choices.

, Eating hot peppers can increase your metabolism by as much as 25% for up to three hours after eating. This calorie burning boost is caused by the capsaicin in peppers. Look for opportunities to add hot peppers to your recipes and reap the calorie burning benefits of capsaicin.Add a chopped jalapeno pepper to chili.
Add a ½ teaspoon of crushed red pepper to pasta sauce.
Use hot sauce on pizza, sandwiches, veggies, and other foods.

Keep in mind that many bottled ""hot"" sauces are high in sodium, which could prove problematic for those with hypertension (high blood pressure) or other health concerns. Use raw peppers whenever possible.

Sleep for seven to nine hours per night.",How to Burn Calories3," Caffeine increases the number of calories you burn by a small amount, but it may also make you feel like moving more. Drinking a caffeinated beverage with a meal like black tea, green tea, or coffee may increase your metabolic rate by as much as 10%.



Green tea seems to have even more calorie burning properties and it may even block your absorption of carbohydrates.Keep in mind that drinking coffee or tea plain will take some getting used to, but purchasing high-quality beans or tea leaves will certainly help.

, Drinking water helps your body burn more calories. One study found that drinking eight cups of water per day helps your body burn about 100 extra calories per day. Consider getting yourself a reusable water bottle to help keep track of how much water you are drinking every day., Your body needs adequate rest each night in order to function properly and burn calories. In addition, being sleep deprived makes it harder for you to do other things that help your body burn calories, like eating well and exercising. Make sure that you sleep for seven to nine hours every night to keep your body burning calories and functioning at its best."

Cook your own meals.,
Learn to read nutrition labels.,
Understand what kinds of foods your body needs.,
Get some support.,
Be prepared for a challenge.,
Get snacks.",How to Detox from Sugar," You quickly find that most processed foods have added sugars and by getting any sort of packaged foods it's almost impossible to avoid. Making an investment in your health takes time, and you need to be willing to take it out of your day by loading up on groceries and cooking. This really is the only way to control what's going into your body. Even salad dressing has sugar!;
, Unlike all other nutritional facts, sugar does not come with a daily value % on food labels. It's also given in grams which can be difficult to visualize. 4.2g equals 1 teaspoon, and it's easier to think of it in terms of the spoons you're eating. Men should have only 9 teaspoons, or 37.5 g per day (which is one small coffee!) while woman should have 6 teaspoons, or 25 g per day.

, You should have about 3 servings of vegetables, 2 of fruit, and 1-2 of carbohydrates and meat per day. Fueling your body with the right kinds of food can help you feel truly energized and help your body realize when it's full so that you're not tempted to overeat or go for desert.

, Because sugar is addictive the cravings will hit. Having a friend, support group, or diary along with you for the ride can help you mark your achievements and stay committed. Take note of your attitude changes the longer you go without sugar- overtime you should feel more alert, and happier, giving you more reason to beware of your sugar intake.


Along these lines take time to review your improvement and focus on your good points. Getting bogged down in your one cheat day rather than seeing an overall healthier diet can stop you before you even started. Stay positive! Taking on another hobby, like running or hooking, while doing the detox can help take your mind of sugar.

, The most difficult part of kicking sugar is that it's all around us. When friends offer us a homemade cookie, or a processed meal, it can feel horrible to say no. Try to clear out your spaces so that you're surrounded by as little sugar as possible but beyond that, get used to standing firm. A detox of sugar is something to be proud of and provides an invaluable investment for your health

, Make sure that sodas, crackers and the like are gone from your refrigerator, and replace them with something you can munch. Frozen grapes, lettuce, bananas, tomatoes, and most fruit and berries can provide a healthy and delicious option. One wonderful aspect of the detox is that your taste becomes more sensitive, and your body begins to know what it wants to be healthy, and so sugary substances start to taste gross while vegetables taste twice as good.

Eat leafy greens.,
Limit root vegetables.,
Try vegetables you’ve never had before.,
Keep it seasonal.,
Visit a farmer’s market.",How to Choose Low Carb Ingredients1," Leafy greens like kale, spinach, chard, mustard greens, turnip greens, and collards are excellent sources of nutrition. They provide essential vitamins like A, C, E and K as well as calcium, potassium and fiber.

Since they’re very low in carbs and high in nutrients, leafy greens are an essential component of any low-carb diet.

Choose leafy greens that are dark in hue, rather than lighter salad greens like iceberg or romaine lettuce. While lettuce can be tasty, it doesn’t pack the nutritional punch of darker greens.Most leafy greens require a little cooking in order to soften the leaves and make them easier to digest. Try them sauteed, roasted, or slow-cooked with pork or chicken stock to make delectable side dish.;
, Potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets, and other root vegetables are high in carbohydrates, so they shouldn’t be your first choice when you’re picking ingredients for a low-carb diet. However, root vegetables are high in essential nutrients like vitamins A, C and K, so they still have a place on your plate.Eating a few servings of root vegetables per week can be a healthy part of your low-carb lifestyle.


Eat only freshly cooked root vegetables, like roasted or boiled potatoes. Processing root vegetables to make fries and chips strips them of nutrients and leaves mostly starch, fat and salt.Choose red potatoes, blue potatoes or sweet potatoes over white russet potatoes. Russet potatoes (the classic baking potato) have a high glycemic load, meaning they affect your blood sugar in a way that causes weight gain. Other types of potatoes have smaller glycemic loads., A low-carb lifestyle doesn’t have to feel limiting, especially when you’re open to trying new vegetables. Once you get used to making vegetables the most prominent part of your meals, you’ll come to appreciate the nuances in flavor and texture.


Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts are excellent roasted with olive oil and salt. Try chopping them into bite-sized pieces and tossing them with your favorite spices before roasting.
Baking winter squash, such as acorn or butternut, is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth. Dress the squash with melted butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

, Since grocery stores carry imported produce all year long, it can be easy to forget that vegetables have seasons. Vegetables taste much better when you eat them while they’re in season at the height of ripeness. You’ll be more likely to stick to your low-carb lifestyle if you choose the tastiest vegetables possible, so check a seasonal produce chart to find out what’s in season in your area.Spring and summer are exciting seasons for the low-carb dieter, since there’s no end to the variety of vegetables available during these times. Look for asparagus, green onions, peas, swiss chard, spinach, arugula, and much more.
If you want to enjoy your favorite vegetables out of season, try buying them in season and freezing or canning them when they’re ripe.

, There are a lot of good reasons to buy your vegetables from a farmer’s market: for starters, they’re less likely to have been treated with pesticides, shipped from a faraway place, and packaged with unappetizing plastic. Produce that is grown organically and stored and packaged minimally is more nutritious.

Find a good local farmer’s market and visit it as much as you an to meet your produce needs.

Consider participating in Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). You can sign up with a local farm to receive seasonal produce once a week. It’s a great way to support a local farm and end up with delicious vegetables.
Farmer’s markets are an excellent place to find vegetables you won’t see in big chain grocery stores. Look for special varieties like mini eggplants, stinging nettles (great for soup and pesto), dandelion greens, ramps, and more.

Distinguish between simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates.,
Cut back on the sugars.,
Start the day with a breakfast that will give you long-lasting energy.,
Choose complex carbohydrates at each meal.,
Prefer whole grains.,
Choose vegetables rich in complex carbohydrates.,
Choose fruits that contain more complex carbohydrates and/or fewer simple carbohydrates.",How to Choose Slow Burning Carbohydrates," Simple carbohydrates are sugars such as sucrose (found in fruit and sweets) and lactose (found in milk products). They contain only two sugar units. Sucrose is composed of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule – two sugar units. Lactose is composed of one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule – also two sugar units. Complex carbohydrates are starches and fibers. They are abundant in grains, vegetables, and legumes (e.g., beans, lentils, and peas). They take longer to break down in the digestive system because they contain hundreds of sugar units.;
, Today, Americans get 16% of their calories from refined sugar.Due to their simple chemical structure, sugars are digested and absorbed quickly, producing a roller coaster in blood sugar of peaks and troughs.In fact, if you eat something sugary, your blood sugar may eventually dip below the baseline.Sugars don’t provide the body with a stable source of energy. Sugary drinks have been shown to temporarily increase energy levels and later produce a crash.In The Complex Carbohydrate Handbook, Shirley Ross says that trying to use sugar as a fuel is like “trying to run an electrical appliance on a bolt of lightning.”, You probably know a candy bar wouldn’t make a very good breakfast. If you ate a candy bar for breakfast, you might feel hungry or tired later in the morning. Many breakfast foods have a high sugar content, such as pastries. A breakfast with a lot of fruit might not be the best choice either. Studies show that fruit is digested rapidly, like sugars.By contrast, a bowl of oatmeal, with its complex carbohydrates, can keep you feeling full and feeling good. A 150-calorie serving of oatmeal provides 6 grams of protein,and you could make it with ½ cup milk to add another 4 grams. Two slices of whole-wheat toast would give you 8 more grams of protein., This will help prevent ups and downs in blood sugar throughout the dayand give you plenty of energy for the whole day.

, Whole grains are digested more slowly than refined grains, improving blood sugar levels. Don’t be fooled by products that contain only a small amount of whole grain. Choose 100% whole grain when possible. If in doubt, look for “enriched flour” in the list of ingredients.

, Some vegetables, such as tomatoes, beets, and carrots, are high in sugars, but others are rich in fiber, such as green vegetables, or starch, such as corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin. Many people think potatoes are fattening, but in actuality, potatoes are bulky and filling; it’s the butter and sour cream that are fattening. A medium potato has only 130 calories,about the same as a banana. It provides 21% of the Daily Value for potassium,more potassium than an extra-large banana (16% DV)., A medium banana, for instance, contains 13 grams of complex carbohydrates.Comparing 100-gram servings, you’d find that cranberries contain the least sugar (4 grams),followed by strawberries (5 grams),blueberries (10 grams), and grapes (15 grams).Prefer whole fruit over fruit juice, since fruit juice is so concentrated and since fruit juice lacks the fiber contained in whole fruit. If you’d like to have some fruit juice occasionally, choose the types that naturally contain less sugar, such as pure cranberry juice, pure strawberry juice, watermelon juice, or prune juice (These contain less sugar than apple juice), or drink a smaller amount.

Learn what foods include carbohydrates.,
Avoid or minimize processed grains.,
Avoid sugar and sweets.,
Watch the starch.,
Select meat, fish, and poultry.,
Broil and bake instead of frying.,
Limit portions.",How to Reduce Your Carbohydrate Intake1," Carbohydrates come in multiple varieties, but when it comes to diet, most people are concerned with processed (simple) versus naturally occurring (complex) carbs. You will find naturally occurring carbs in grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, nuts, seeds, and legumes.These complex carbohydrates resist digestion more than simple, refined carbohydrates such as those found in flour and sugar.Sources of simple carbohydrates include white breads and pasta, cake, candy, cookies, and sugar-sweetened beverages.Generally speaking, complex carbs are better because their sources additionally include vitamins, minerals, protein, and other nutritional value, whereas simple carbs do not. The fiber content in complex carbohydrates also alleviates some of the negative impact on blood sugar.;
, White bread, white rice, and flour provide relatively little nutritional value and increase the amount of simple carbohydrates in your daily diet. For fiber intake, stick with small amounts of whole grains. These will cause fewer fluctuations in blood glucose levels as well., Desserts, pastries, sugary beverages, and other confectionery treats may taste wonderful, but they tend to provide little in the way of nutrition, and they increase the amount of carbohydrates in your diet significantly. Opt for servings of fruits or frozen fruit desserts that are made with no extra sugar if you feel the need for a treat.


When something does call for a sweetener, use alternative sweeteners if possible.

, While you do want to eat more vegetables, limit your intake of white potatoes, corn, and other starchy foods. A five-ounce russet baked potato has 30 grams of carbs, for instance.


Substitute with other root vegetables that contain fewer carbohydrates, and increase the amount of dark green vegetables that you consume at each meal. They tend to have few if any carbs while providing the benefit of a lot of nutrients.
Other starchy, high-carb vegetables include beets, peas, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and some winter squashes., Many low-carb diets replace the missing carb calories with high-protein calories. Many red meats have very little in the way of carbohydrates and offer the benefit of plenty of protein. Fish and poultry are also good options that provide nutrients and are filling, which will help to satisfy your body's craving for more carbs.

, When preparing meats and vegetables, avoid battering and frying those foods. The flour used for the coating contains plenty of extra carbohydrates that your body does not need. To add flavor, use plenty of herbs and spices while broiling, and use an egg batter/crushed bran flakes combination to bake chicken and fish and enjoy a crispy coating.

, Learn the difference between a sliver and a wedge of cake or pie, and get an idea of how much is actually in a single serving. Limiting portions will make it easier to enjoy more of the foods you like without taking in a lot of carbs. It can also be beneficial to weigh foods prior to cooking. For instance, it can help to weight out 4-6 oz of raw chicken before cooking to ensure the proper portion size is being consumed.

"
"
Find the total amount of a serving size at the top of the nutrition label.,
Measure out the amount of food you are going to consume.,
Divide the amount of your portion by the volume or weight per serving listed on the label.,
Read the carbohydrate content from the label on the food you are going to eat.,
Subtract the dietary fiber from the total carbohydrate amount to calculate the net carbohydrate amount.,
Multiply the total number of servings you are going to eat by the net carbohydrates per serving amount.",How to Count Carbohydrates1," Product labels give nutritional information based on serving size, not the entire contents of a package.Serving size is generally listed in both volume amounts and weight measurements. The weight is usually listed in parentheses next to the volume amount. For example, 1 cup of this product weighs 250 grams (8.8 oz).;
, If you have a food scale, use the weight amounts rather than the volume amount to get a more accurate measurement. If you do not have a food scale, use measuring cups and spoons to get as accurate a measure as possible.


If you are using a food scale, you may need to use a bowl to contain the food you are weighing. Weigh the bowl empty first. Write down the weight of the empty bowl and subtract that amount from the total once you have added the food.

, Doing this will give you the number of servings you will consume. For example, if your food weighs 500 g, divide by 500 by 250 (the weight of each serving) to calculate that you will be consuming two servings. Similarly, if you have measured out 2 cups of food, divide by 1 to calculate that you will be consuming two servings.


Many labels will list the volume of serving sizes in fractions, such as ½ cup. To convert fractions to decimals for easy entry on your calculator, divide the first number of the fraction by the second number. For ½ cup, take 1 divided by 2 to equal 0.5. If you have measured out 2 cups of food with a serving size of ½ cup, divide 2 by 0.5 to equal 4 servings.

, For example, if the product label lists 20g of carbohydrates, that means there are 20 grams of carbohydrates per serving size.

, Because fiber is not digested before it passes out of your body, it does not count toward your total carbs.Fiber comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber can help regulate the body's use of sugars and help keep blood sugar (glucose) in check because it slows down the absorption of glucose from your GI tract. Insoluble fiber promotes regularity with bowel movements.


Dietary fiber is often listed separately on a nutrition label, just below the total carbohydrates line.

, For example, there are 20 g of carbohydrates per serving. Multiply 20 by 2 (if you are eating two servings), which equals 40. You will be consuming a total of 40 g of carbohydrates with the serving size you measured out.

"
"
Eat eggs for breakfast.,
Increase your meat consumption.,
Match carbs with oils or fat.",How to Choose Low Carb Ingredients2," Versatile eggs are the low-carb dieter’s friend. Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy omega-3 fats.For the highest nutritional content, look for pasture-raised eggs laid by chickens fed a natural diet of healthy plants. It’s hard to get tired of eggs, since there are endless ways to cook them.


Make your scrambled eggs more filling by tossing in spinach, chopped mushrooms, shallots, and any other veggies you have on hand.
To make an easy 2-ingredient pancake batter, blend two eggs with a small banana. Cook the batter in butter or olive oil heated on a griddle.

, Meat is an important factor when it comes to creating satisfying low-carb meals because meat does not have any carbohydrates. Since you aren’t filling up on carbohydrates, you’ll need extra meat in order to feel nourished and full. At least once a day, have a serving of lean chicken, beef or pork to alongside your vegetable dishes.


Fish is another key component of a healthy low-carb diet. Aim to eat fish one to two times a week. Before making a purchase, check to see which types of fish are in season and have been sustainably sourced.Avoid eating large quantities of processed meats, like bacon, sausage and cold cuts. These meats are preserved with nitrates or large amounts of salt, and recent studies have linked them to cancer risks.Any meat that has breading or bread crumbs added will contain carbs.

, Foods high in monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids aid in blood sugar control and heart health.

Cook your vegetables in healthy oils such as olive oil or coconut oil to add flavor and essential nutrients.Avocados, nuts, and fish are also excellent sources of healthy fats.

Avoid foods that contain trans fats, which may increase risk of heart disease and some cancers.Fried foods, processed snack foods, and processed meats are often high in trans fats.
Animal fats, such as full-fat milk, butter, lard and fattier cuts of beef and chicken, can also be healthy when eaten in moderation; however, some sources link these saturated fats with greater levels of cholesterol.

Say no to sweets.,
Give up grains.,
Watch out for fruit.,
Try a milk substitute.,
Cut back on nuts and legumes.",How to Choose Low Carb Ingredients3," Avoiding candy, baked goods and other treats laden with sugar may be the toughest part of following a low-carb diet, but it’s also the most important. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate that causes your blood sugar to spike and leads to weight gain.Most low-carb diets prohibit sugar in all its forms.


White cane sugar is just one form of sugar to avoid. You should also remove other sugars like high fructose corn syrup, maple syrup, and honey from your diet.
Check ingredient labels to see if products contain a form of sugar. Sugar is often a “hidden” ingredient in foods like tomato sauce and salad dressing.

, Wheat, oats, rice, corn and other grains also contain high amounts of carbohydrates. If you’re going low-carb, you’ll want to avoid both processed grains - like white flour - and “whole” grains, like whole wheat and steel-cut oats. That means that almost all bread, pasta and other grain-heavy foods are off limits.


Just because a food is gluten-free, doesn’t make it low-carb. Baked gluten-free items don’t contain wheat, but they may contain rice or another substitute grain that is just as carb-heavy.
If you’re not concerned with eliminating carbs entirely, whole grains are a better choice than processed grains. Unlike processed grains, whole grains have not been stripped of healthy vitamins, minerals and fiber., Fruit is generally considered a healthy food, since it’s loaded with essential vitamins. However, that doesn’t mean it’s low in carbs. Fruit contains fructose, a form of sugar, and should be eaten in moderation. Limit your fruit consumption to 1-2 servings a day when you’re on a low-carb diet.

Eat whole, fresh fruit, preferably with the peel. Fruit contains high amounts of fiber and water, but you lose those benefits when you process fruit by juicing or drying it.
Some fruits are higher in sugar than others. Choose strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and kiwis over bananas and apples.

, Cow’s milk contains natural sugars, so it’s not a low-carbohydrate food. Skim and reduced-fat milk are even higher in sugar than whole milk. If you’re looking for a low-carb alternative, try soy, cashew or almond milk.


Make sure you buy unsweetened milk substitutes. Chocolate and vanilla-flavored milk almost always has high sugar content.
You can make your own nut milk at home: soak a cup of raw cashews or almonds in 3 cups of water overnight. Drain the nuts, blend them well, then strain the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth. The resulting milk can be used in place of dairy milk in recipes., Nuts and legumes, such as black beans and chickpeas, have a moderate carbohydrate content in addition to being high in protein and fiber. If you want to cut carbohydrates significantly, avoid nuts and legumes. However, nuts and legumes can be a healthy part of a low-carb diet when eaten in moderation.

Limit your nut intake to one handful per day, as a snack.
Have legumes as a small side dish, rather than making them the centerpiece of a meal.

Substitute cauliflower for rice.,
Try spaghetti squash.,
Spiralize zucchini.,
Swap out a bed of greens for pasta.,
Use lettuce wraps instead of bread.",How to Choose Low Carb Ingredients4," Cauliflower has a mild, creamy taste that soaks up other flavors well, just like rice. Any dish that calls for white or brown rice can be made using cauliflower rice, instead. Here’s how to make it:Clean and chop 1 head of cauliflower.
Process the chopped cauliflower in a food processor until you have small, rice-sized pieces.
Cook the “rice” by placing it in a saucepan with a tablespoon of melted butter; cover and steam for 8 minutes.

, The flesh of roasted spaghetti squash really does have the texture of al dente spaghetti. It’s a simple dish that hits the spot in the fall and winter months, when spaghetti squash is in season. You can even dress the squash with marinara sauce, or substitute it for pasta in another favorite dish.

To cook spaghetti squash,

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds. Rub the flesh with olive oil, salt and pepper.
Place the squash halves in a roasting pan cut side down and roast for 40 minutes.
When the flesh has cooled, scoop it out; serve plain or dressed with sauce.

, This is your summer vegetable season counterpart to spaghetti squash. Spiralized zucchini has a springy texture and mild flavor that makes it a great substitute for carb-laden pasta. It’s easiest to make it with a spiralizer machine; you just peel the zucchini and feed it through. If you don’t have one, follow these steps:


Peel a large zucchini.
Use the large holes on a box grater to grate long, thin pieces of zucchini. Alternately, slice the zucchini into thin strips with a knife.
Steam the zucchini with olive oil and water for about 10 minutes, until cooked.

, Any pasta dish can be made into a low-carb-friendly meal by subbing out the pasta for fresh greens. You can serve the greens simply dressed with olive oil, parmesan and pepper, or go for a heavier pasta sauce to satisfy your craving.


Try arugula, butter lettuce or a spring green mix to serve with lighter sauces.
If you want a bed of greens that will hold up to thick sauce, try cooked spinach or swiss chard in place of pasta.

, You don’t have to give up your favorite sandwich experience when you go low-carb; simply swap out the bread for a sturdy piece of iceberg or romaine. Start by spreading hummus or mayonnaise on the piece of lettuce, then top with cold cuts, fresh veggies and your other favorite sandwich mix-ins.


If you want a sturdier wrap, try using a collard leaf instead of lettuce.
You can use lettuce in place of the crust when you’re craving pizza, too. Brush the piece of lettuce with olive oil, add a sprinkle of cheese and some toppings, and pop it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.

Calculate the number of carbs you want to eat.,
Consult your doctor or dietitian.,
Check labels.,
Use the glycemic index.,
Consider dietary changes you can maintain.,
Stay aware of potential complications.",How to Reduce Your Carbohydrate Intake2," The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that carbohydrates make up 45-65% of your daily caloric intake for a standard diet.Based on a 2,000-calorie/day diet, this means approximately 900-1,300 calories each day from carbs.Lower carb diets typically mean reducing carbs to between 240-520 calories each day, which equates to 60-130 grams of carbohydrates., Before making any big changes to your diet, consult your doctor or a dietitian regarding the safest way for you to do so. Current blood work results, existing kidney conditions, and other factors can all contribute to the healthiest way for you to cut back on carbs., Once you know your target for carbohydrates, remember to check labels for the food you buy. Try to balance options in order to adequately reduce carbs to your desired amount.


In addition to grams of carbs and calories from carbs, you may also see carbs listed as “servings.” Each serving of carbs is equivalent to 15 grams of carbs. However, you won’t see fractions or decimals of servings, so each serving isn’t exact. Typically, if a food has 8-22 grams of carbohydrates, then it will be listed as one serving., This helpful guide makes it possible to determine how many carbohydrates are found in a number of different foods both raw and processed. The index provides a per serving count of carbohydrates, making the process of carbohydrate counting much easier. Using the index allows you to plan for a healthy amount of carbs at each meal while avoiding the chance of taking in too many carbohydrates at a single setting.For more information on how to use the Glycemic index, check: How to Eat Foods Low on the Glycemic Index.

, You’re better off skipping fad diets that you can stick with only for a month or two before burning out on them. Many high-protein, low-carb diets can simply feel too restricting for long-term adoption. Instead, make changes in your diet that you will have an easier time maintaining., The additional fat from many high-protein sources can lead to additional problems when cutting carbs, such as higher cholesterol, which in turn raises the risks of heart disease.High long-term carbohydrate restrictions can also lead to vitamin or mineral deficiencies, bone loss, and gastrointestinal disturbances.Severely limiting carbohydrates (anything less than 20 grams each day) may also lead to a body process called ketosis.This is when your body does not have enough sugar (glucose) to produce energy, and your body begins breaking down stored fat to operate.Side effects can include nausea, headache, and physical and mental fatigue."
"
Weigh your food item on a food scale.,
Research carbohydrate percentages of your food item.,
Subtract the percentage of dietary fiber from the total carbohydrate percentage.,
Calculate the percentage of net carbohydrates in your food item.",How to Count Carbohydrates2," Calculating the total weight of your food item will help you calculate the percentage of carbohydrates. For example, a large apple may weight 200 g.

, Look up the nutrient listings of your food item online or in a book on nutrition. The USDA has a food composition database that will give you the nutritional information for many different food items.Your doctor or nutritionist may also have pamphlets or brochures to help you research nutritional information for your food item.

, If dietary fiber is listed in your nutritional information, subtract that amount from the carbohydrates to calculate the net carbohydrates for that food item. For example, if the food item has 15% carbohydrates and 2% dietary fiber, subtract 2 from 15 to equal 13%.

, Multiply the total weight of your food item by the percentage of net carbohydrates.For example, if the net carbohydrate percentage for your food is 13% (0.13 in decimal form), multiply the weight (200 g) by 0.13 to equal 26 g of net carbohydrates.


Often, nutritional guides will give you a carbohydrate total that is based on 100 g of the food item. If carbohydrates are listed as the amount per 100 g, turn the number into a percentage by multiplying the grams of carbohydrates by 0.01. For example, if your food item has 13 carbohydrates per 100 grams, multiply 13 by 0.01 to equal 0.13 or 13%.

"
"
Determine the volume of the food item you’re going to eat.,
Place your measuring device next to the food item.For example, place your fist directly next to the bowl of pasta to estimate how many cups of pasta you have.,
Find the amount of carbohydrates for your food item.,
Calculate the amount of carbohydrates in your portion.",How to Count Carbohydrates3," If you do not have measuring cups or a food scale handy, such as when you’re dining away from home, you can estimate portions by comparing the size of your food to a common object.


An average-sized adult fist, a baseball, and a pint of milk are each about the size of 1 cup. A child’s fist, a full cupcake wrapper, and a lightbulb are each about the size of ½ cup.A golf ball and a large egg are each about the size of ¼ cup. , If the pasta takes up the same amount of space as your fist, you have about 1 cup. Move the food around on your plate if necessary to shape it into the size of your fist to help you better estimate.

, Use a nutritional chart that lists the amount of carbohydrates for commonly eaten foods to determine the amount of carbohydrates for your food item. The USDA provides an online tool that provides nutritional information for many foods, found here: https://reedir.arsnet.usda.gov/codesearchwebapp.There are also many apps you can download onto a smartphone that provide nutritional information.


In addition, the American Diabetes Association teaches people there are about 15 grams carbohydrate per serving of common foods. So if you don't have a way to calculate the number of carbs in your food, try to keep serving sizes in mind as a guideline. For instance, if you grab one small piece of fresh fruit, you know that this is equivalent to one serving of fruit, so you can estimate that there are roughly 15 grams of carbs in that one serving.If you do not have a smartphone or access to the Internet while eating, consider keeping with you a list of the carbohydrate contents of foods you commonly eat. You could print out or write a list to keep in your wallet or purse.
Once you make a habit of counting carbohydrates, you will probably memorize the carbohydrate amounts in many of your favorite foods.

, Many nutritional guides will list the amount of carbohydrates per cup of food item. Multiply the amount of carbohydrates listed per cup by the amount of your serving size.


For example, if you are eating 2 ½ cups of pasta and a cup of pasta contains 45 g of carbohydrates, multiply 45 by 2.5 to equal 112.5g of carbohydrates in your serving.
If you are eating ¾ cup of pasta, first convert the fraction into a decimal by dividing the first number by the second (3 divided by 4 equals 0.75), and then multiply the carbohydrate amount (45 g) by that decimal amount (0.75) to equal 33.75 g of carbohydrates in your serving.

Understand how carbohydrates are calculated for nutritional labels.",How to Calculate Carbs1," The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains the labelling requirements of all food products in the United States. It is important to understand what items must be displayed on food labels, where they have to be displayed, and what those items actually mean.


Food manufacturers must place a ""statement of identity"" and the net quantity or amount contained in the package on the “principal display panel” or PDP. This is the portion of the label you can see when the product is sitting on a shelf.The “statement of identity” is not considered the brand name, although that is also most likely on the PDP. Rather, it must be a name that properly describes what the product is (e.g. tomato soup, uncooked pasta, etc.).Even in the United States, food labels are required to include both metric and imperial measurements.Food manufacturers must also include an “information panel” or IP on their products. The IP must be the next panel or area on the package to the immediate right of the PDP. Information regarding the name and address of the manufacturer, the name of the distributor, ingredients, nutritional and allergy information, must all be displayed on this panel if they weren’t also displayed on the PDP.;
, An ingredient list must contain all ingredients in descending order of predominance and weight (i.e. the most abundant item is listed first). Ingredient lists must include added water that may have been used when packaging the product. Plus, ingredient names must be the common names recognizable to the average person (e.g. sugar instead of sucrose).If the product contains any type of chemical preservative, that too must be included in the ingredient list. And in addition to the name of the preservative, a brief description of what the chemical does must also be included (e.g. “Ascorbic Acid to Promote Colour Retention).

, The Food Allergen Labelling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) depicts what items must be listed as allergens on a food label. Meat, poultry and egg products also have special requirements for labelling that are controlled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). FALCPA considers milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts and soybeans as “major” allergens. These items are responsible for about 90% of the food allergies experienced by Americans. Only these “major” allergens need to be listed on the package.Raw agricultural items like fruits and vegetables do not require FALCPA labels.
Only crustacean shellfish are considered allergens, including crab, lobster, shrimp, etc. Oysters, muscles, etc., are not considered allergens.
While allergens must also be included in ingredient lists, FALCPA regulations require them to be listed separately so they stand out (e.g. ""Contains eggs, milk."").

, Nutritional labels are required for all food products (except those listed below). However, the FDA does not dictate how these amounts are calculated. This means that a food manufacturer can use calculations that apply to their product “on average” rather than the actual measured amount in the packaging. In addition, the FDA expects manufacturers to be compliant and does not double-check their nutritional calculations.Note that there are exemptions as to what products require a nutritional label. The following foods do not require an actual label (although you can certainly ask for the information): products sold individually via the deli or bakery counter (not packaged), most spices, fresh produce and seafood, individual items that are packaged within a multi-pack (only the outside packaging requires a nutritional label), and food items that are given away and not for sale.
Foods with less than 5 calories per serving can have “calorie free” on the packaging and 0 calories on the nutritional label.
For items with 50 calories per serving or less, the number can be rounded to the nearest 5 calorie increment. For items with more than 50 calories, the number can be rounded to the nearest 10 calorie increment.
Foods with less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving can have 0 grams of fat on the nutritional label. Foods with between 0.5 and 5 grams of fat can be rounded to the nearest ½ gram. Foods with more than 5 grams of fat can be rounded to the nearest whole gram.

, The FDA dictates which types of nutrient content claims (NCC) can be used on food packaging. Each of those NCCs has specific requirements that must be met before the claim can be displayed on packaging.A product is considered “a good source of” something (e.g. fibre) if the product contains 10-19% of the daily recommended amount of that item (e.g. “a good source of fibre” can be used if the product contains 15% of your daily recommended intake of fibre).
A product is considered “high” in something (e.g. fibre) if the product contains at least 20% of the daily recommended amount of that item (e.g. a product can be considered “high in fibre"" if the product contains 25% of your daily recommended intake of fibre).

, Nutrient content claims (NCCs) include things like “low fat,” “fat free,” “sugar free,” etc. Manufacturers are not allowed to make up non-approved claims for their products - for example, “minor fat” or something similar.Manufacturers are not allowed to use the words “low” or “free” on products that have not been specially processed (e.g. they cannot claim frozen peas are “low in fat”).
“Free” and “low” claims can only be made on products that also have a “regular” version. The “low” or “free” version must be processed such that it contains less of a specific item (like fat or sugar, etc.) than the “regular” version.
When making a “light,” “reduced,” “less,” “fewer,” “more” or “added” claim, the label must include: the % by which the food has been modified; the name of the reference food; and the amount of the nutrient that is in both the labelled product and the reference product. For example, “50% less fat than xxx. Light xxx = 4g fat; Regular xxx = 8g fat, per serving.""

,
A product can be labelled “fresh” only when it is in its raw form and has not been frozen or subjected to any type of thermal processing or preservation.

, All nutritional labels on food products must contain a table with a specific list of nutrients. Nutrients can be excluded from the table only under certain circumstances. And the table must contain both the amount of that nutrient per serving and the % that nutrient represents as compared to Recommended Daily Values (RDVs). However, the RDVs of each nutrient is calculated for someone who has a caloric intake of 2,000 calories. Remember that many people consume less than 2,000 calories per day. Therefore, these percentages are simply a guideline and should be used as such., The FDA requires that food manufacturers calculate total carbohydrates in their food with the following formula: Total Carbohydrates = Total Weight of Food Serving - (Weight of Crude Protein + Weight of Total Fat + Weight of Moisture + Weight of Ash). Sugar and fibre are considered carbohydrates and must be listed separately on a nutritional label.Food manufacturers may use the terms “less than 1 gram,” “contains less than 1 gram” or “not a significant source of dietary fibre/sugar” if the product has less than 1 gram of fibre and/or sugar. They do not need to calculate the exact quantity.

Pass on toast at breakfast.,
Start the day with oatmeal.,
Order or prepare your lunch on a bed of greens.,
Eat dinner from a bowl.",How to Cut Bread from Your Diet1," Toast and other bread type breakfast foods are common in many people’s diet, as they are quick and easy to prepare. There are many healthier breakfast options, however. In particular, opt for eggs with veggies and your favorite herbs.To save time in the morning, cut veggies and scramble your eggs the night before. Store everything in the fridge, and you can cook them up on a well-seasoned skillet in no time.
If you’re accustomed to eggs with a side a toast, swap out the toast for a half baked sweet potato or a side of steamed veggies.
Plain, low-fat Greek yogurt is another great breakfast option. Stir in some fresh fruit and honey to sweeten.;
, If eggs or yogurt aren’t your style, oatmeal is an equally good alternative of a bread-based breakfast. This is partly because oats offer plenty of fiber, which is something you'll want to account for while eating less bread.


Note that whole grain oats are available in several forms, including steel cut, rolled, or instant. Each type has very similar nutritional value, but yields different flavors and consistencies.When making your selection, check the nutrition facts label for information about added sugar and salt.
For an extra fiber boost and additional nutritional value, add flaxseed meal or chia seeds to your oatmeal. These can also be included in other breakfast foods, such as Greek yogurt or a breakfast smoothie.

, One of the best ways to immediately improve your diet in general is by eating a salad for one of your meals everyday. You can still include the high protein ingredients you might usually eat on a sandwich, such as tuna tuna, chicken, or egg salad. Season salads with olive oil, vinegar, and pepper instead of packaged dressings.Even if you’ve been loyal to the classic turkey and cheese sandwich every weekday for a decade, you don’t have to fully abandon your go-to flavors. In fact, turkey, goat cheese, and cranberries go especially well on a bed of dark greens, such as kale or spinach.

, From garlic bread to pizza, the prevalence of bread in many favorite dinners can be hard to escape. Rest assured, however, that there are plenty of delicious and satisfying bread-free meals that will thrill both your tongue and your belly. In particular, start making bowls with either a brown rice or quinoa base. Add whatever veggies, spices, and nuts you favor.A protein is another great addition. Tofu and other soybean based proteins, like tempeh go especially well in bowl.
Get creative with your bowls. Try a salmon teriyaki bowl one evening, and a sesame kimchi bowl the next.
Look online for healthy food bowl inspirations, like the ones suggested here: http://www.foodiecrush.com/25-super-healthy-bowl-recipes/

Shop at the grocery store during the ""induction"" period.,
Buy a low-carb recipe book.,
Pick up carb replacement foods at a natural or health food store after your 2 week induction period.,
Search online for low-carb alternatives to your favorite foods.,
Research acceptable low-carb breads, pitas, tortillas, English muffins, cookies and other snacks in a low-carb book or online before buying.",How to Buy Low Carb Foods," At the beginning of most low-carb regimen, you are asked to cut out almost all flour and sugar and eat high protein foods. These are available at your local supermarket.


Induction foods include eggs and meats like sausage, bacon, non-nitrate deli-meats, poultry, canned tuna and chicken. Berries are recommended, but most other fruits are not. Buy green vegetables like broccoli, string beans, bean sprouts, lettuce, sugar snap peas, snow peas, cucumber and celery. Other foods include mushrooms, tomatoes and red peppers.;
, Make your grocery list according to this book before shopping. This will help you to better follow induction or post-induction food recommendations.

, Your low-carb diets often recommend replacing canola and other vegetable oils with coconut oil, as it is believed to speed up your metabolism.


Buy almond, flax seed or walnut flour to replace all-purpose flour. You can use it to bread meats or make low-carb baked goods.

, An online low-carb store, like Low-Carb Connoisseur, or Carb-Smart will have more variety. They often feature specialty chocolate or pasta sauces. Online stores are usually more expensive than a supermarket, so only buy online products for special occasions, or if they will last a long time.

, Although these options are available at supermarkets, packaging can be misleading. The foods may be high in sugar or nitrates, products that work against a low-carb diet.


Shop for acceptable alternatives at the supermarket. Most supermarkets have embraced the low-carb market. Look for the words ""white flour"" or ""processed flour"" on the package. If they are listed, then it may not be truly low carb. Traditionally, ingredient labels list the ingredients in order of the largest content in the product. If flax, soy or whole wheat are listed first, it will be better.

Determine how much of your diet should consist of carbs.,
Convert carbs into food group servings.,
Learn to measure your food servings with a scale.,
Estimate your food servings visually.,
Calculate how many carbs are in the packaged foods you eat.,
Do not forget there are good carbs.,
Figure out your current carb consumption.",How to Calculate Carbs2," Diets for the majority of people should have 40-60% of their calories from carbohydrates. This may be lower in people with diabetes, PCOS, and other medical conditions.Carbohydrates can be found in fruits, vegetables, dairy products and grains, but not meat. One gram of carbs is, on average, equal to 4 calories.Regardless of what carb counting method or calculation you use, remember that carbs are not the only item you need to count and calculate as part of your diet. You also need to include fat and protein to ensure you’re eating a balanced diet. And it sure doesn’t hurt to watch your sodium intake.

, One way to determine how many carbs you can eat is to turn the fruits, vegetables, dairy products and grains into servings per day. The number of servings per day will depend on your age and gender. You can view a table of serving amounts here - http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/basics-base/quantit-eng.php. On average, adults of both genders should consume the following ranges of servings per day:


Grains = 5-8 servings per day. A grain serving can include things like: 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of cereal, ½ cup of rice, or ⅓ cup of cooked pasta. At least half your grain servings should be whole grains.
Fruits & Vegetables = 4-10 servings day.A fruit or vegetable serving can include things like: ½ cup of 100% fruit or vegetable juice, 1 large carrot, 1 cup of leafy greens, 1 medium apple, ½ cup of berries, or 20 grapes.Dairy Products = 2-3 servings per day.A dairy product serving can include things like: 1 cup of skim milk, 50 grams of hard cheese, or ¾ cup of yogurt.Don’t forget that you also need to consume 1-3 servings of meats or meat alternatives every day, which is where you’ll get the majority of your protein.One serving can include things like: 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, ½ cup of lean meats or ¾ cups of tofu.While not listed exclusively as part of the food guide, a healthy diet should also include a small amount of unsaturated fats every day. For the average person this amount should be 2-3 tablespoons. Unsaturated fats would include vegetable oils, oil-based salad dressings, and soft non-hydrogenated margarine., Another way to calculate how many carbs are in a particular item, or to determine the proper serving size of an item, is to use its weight. Kitchen scales can be found in a large variety of stores, and are relatively inexpensive.


To calculate the grams of carbs in your food based on the weight, you need to know two things: the weight of the food item; and the “factor” for that food item. There is a different factor for each type of food (e.g. bread has a factor of 15, which means there are 15 grams of carbs for every ounce of bread).You can find a list of food factors on the University of California’s Diabetes Education Online - http://dtc.ucsf.edu/pdfs/CalculatingCHObyWeight.pdf. (Note - the website is designed for diabetics, but the food factors are applicable to anyone.)
Example, let’s say you want to know how many carbs are in the bowl of strawberries you want to have for a snack. First, weigh the strawberries. Let’s say you determine that you have 10 ounces of strawberries. Second, look up the food factor for strawberries, which is 2.17. Third, multiply the weight and the food factor = 10 ounces x 2.17 = 21.7 grams of carbs.
You can also use weight to determine how many servings are in an item of food. For example, one serving of lean meat or poultry is considered to be ½ a cup. This is equivalent to 2.5 ounces or 75 grams. If you have a 4 ounce piece of cooked chicken, divide by 2.5 and you’ll find that piece of chicken counts as 1.6 servings., Visual estimations for things like apples, oranges, bananas, eggs, or slices of bread or bagels, are easy to determine. But measuring things like cheese, meat or loose items can be more difficult to estimate. There are several visualizations that can be used to help you measure your food servings, especially when you’re not at home, or not making the food yourself.


Dry cereal - a 1 cup serving looks like the size of a baseball.
Cooked cereal, rice or pasta - a ½ cup serving looks like the size of half a baseball.
Orange, apple or pear - 1 “small” fruit looks like the size of a tennis ball.
Raisins - a ¼ cup serving looks like the size of a golf ball.
Baked potato - 1 “medium” potato looks like the size of a mouse you’d use for your computer.
Chopped vegetables or salad mix - a 1 cup serving would look like the size of a baseball, or a handful.
Hard cheese - a 50 gram serving is almost equivalent to a 1.5 ounce serving which looks like the size of a 9 volt battery (the rectangle ones).
Lean beef or poultry - a ½ cup serving will look the size of a deck of cards.
Grilled or baked fish - a ½ cup serving will look like the size of a chequebook.
Margarine - a 1 teaspoon serving looks like the size of a postage stamp, and there are 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon.
Salad dressing or oil - a 1 teaspoon serving look like it would fill the cap of a normal-sized water bottle.

, A nutritional label on a package of food will list the number of carbs it contains. But there are a couple of things you need to remember when using these numbers to calculate how many carbs you’re eating.The nutritional information is based on a serving size that is determined by the manufacturer. In some cases, like a individual carton of yogurt, the serving size equals the actual amount you’re likely to consume. In other cases, like cold cereal, the serving size may equal a much smaller amount, maybe ½ or ⅓, of what you would normally eat.
You will need to multiply the number of carbohydrates per serving on the nutrition label by the number of servings you actually consume. For example, if the label for a cold cereal says there are 10 grams of carbs per ½ cup of cereal, but you’re going to eat 1 ½ cups of cereal, you will need to multiply 10 grams by 3 to determine the actual carbs you’ll be consuming. In this example, it would be 30 grams.

, Nutritional labels will list Total Carbohydrates, Dietary Fibre, and Sugars. Dietary fibre and sugar are both carbs, but your body doesn’t use them the same way. Fibre is not digested by your body, rather, your body simply passes fibre all the way through. Fibre can help with constipation and overall bowel health, lower your cholesterol, control your blood sugar levels, and help you lose weight.Men 50 or younger should eat 38 grams of fibre per day. Men over 50 should eat 30 grams per day.
Women 50 or younger should eat 25 grams of fibre per day. Women over 50 should eat 21 grams per day.
Remember that fibre is a carbohydrate, so the fibre grams count as part of your carbohydrate intake.

, Depending on what you are attempting to do with your diet, calculating the amount of carbs you’re currently consuming can be helpful. If you are planning to lose or gain weight in the future, knowing how many calories you are currently consuming will help to determine how many calories you have to reduce or add per day. If you aren’t planning to alter your weight, you can use this opportunity to develop a healthier eating plan that includes healthier carbs.


Start by getting yourself a journal, or creating a tracking spreadsheet on your computer.
On a daily basis (or even throughout the day) keep track of exactly what you eat and drink, including the amounts or weights.
Track yourself for one week, assuming the week you’re tracking is an average week for you. Don’t forget to include things like sauces, butter or margarine, dressings, etc.
If you eat any packaged food, keep track of the information from the nutritional label in your journal.
If you eat at a restaurant, try to locate their nutritional breakdowns via their websites. Or ask your server for a brochure.
For other types of food, use the USDA’s Super Tracker to look up the nutritional values (https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx).
Add up the number of calories, total carbs, and dietary fibre for each day. It is probably also a good idea to include fat and protein in your calculations since your overall diet plan will need to take these into account.
Use your calculations as a starting point for making a future plan. There are useful apps available now for phones that allow people to track their daily intake of all nutrients; carbohydrates included.

"
"
Give yourself a goal.,
Develop a meal plan.,
Remember to include fibre every day.,
Do not forget to include nutrients from beverages.",How to Calculate Carbs3," Before you can do any planning, you need to determine what your goals are. Do you want to maintain your weight, but maybe make healthier choices? Do you want to lose or gain weight? Take the number of calories you currently consume per day as a starting point and work to determine the number of calories you will need to consume in the future to meet your goals.


Remember that it takes a reduction of 500 calories per day (on average) to lose one pound per week.For most people, this reduction can come from carbohydrates. Remember not to cut down any macro-nutrient group too low. Avoid cutting back too far on protein and healthy fat as both as used from repair and hormone production.
Example: Say your current caloric intake was calculated to be 2,000 per day. You want to lose some weight, so you decide you need to cut back to 1,500 calories per day to do that safely. In order to maintain a healthy diet, 40-60% of those calories need to come from carbs. To make things easy, let’s assume you want to have 50% of your calories come from carbs. Multiply your daily calorie goal of 1,500 by 50% to get 750 calories per day from carbs. Now divide the 750 calories per day by 4 (as there are 4 calories in every carb) to get 187.5 grams of carbs per day. You now have your daily caloric and carb intake amounts., Using your calculated number of calories and carbs per day, start making yourself a meal plan. Use nutritional labels on food packages and the USDA’s Super Tracker (https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx) to help you determine the number of calories and carbs in each item you include in your plan. The Super Tracker is also a great online tool to make a plan, as a ton of nutritional information is already included.The Super Tracker will also remind you that daily exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.

, You should try to eat something with at least 5 grams of fibre at breakfast, to start your day. Half of the grains you eat every day should be whole grains. Eat breads that have at least 2 grams of fibre per serving (a bread serving is normally 1 slice). Substitute whole gran flour for white flour when baking. Add fresh or frozen vegetables to foods like soups and sauces. Add beans, peas or lentils to your soup or salad.Add unprocessed wheat bran to cereals to increase the amount of fibre.
Try brown rice, wild rice, barley, whole wheat pasta, and bulgur as opposed to the “white” versions.
When substituting whole wheat flour for white flour when baking bread, you may need to add more yeast or allow the dough to rise for a longer period of time. If baking powder is part of the recipe, increase it by 1 teaspoon for every 3 cups of whole grain flour.
Apples, bananas, oranges, pears and berries are great sources of fibre and can easily be eaten as a snack.
Nuts and dried fruit also have a lot of fibre, but some dried fruit may be high in sugar.

, Everything you put in your mouth, even gum, can contribute to your daily caloric intake. Beverages, however, may be the most forgotten or overlooked. Water doesn’t have any calories, but it’s about the only beverage you don’t have to worry about. And while coffee or tea on their own may not be high in calories, you do have to count the milk, cream or sugar you put in them. In general, sugary drinks are the worst culprit. Non-diet soda, energy drinks, juice and added sugar in tea and coffee will add your calories up very quickly.Remember that fruit juice is not the same as eating a piece of fruit. Consuming the same calorie level of juice vs. whole fruit does not mean that those two foods are equal. In whole fruit, fiber is included which helps to regulate the blood sugar spike that comes with consuming carbohydrates. Juices have little to no fiber causing them to spike blood sugar. Choose whole over juice.

Bake bread equivalents with quinoa flour.,
Bake pizza on cauliflower instead of bread.,
Use a mushroom cap instead of a bun.",How to Cut Bread from Your Diet2," There are several ways to make foods that are similar to bread that may work better with your dietary preferences. For instance, quinoa (which is actually a seed), can be ground into a flour and used in baking - even a loaf of “bread” that you may be able to eat.Before baking with quinoa flour, toast it to make its flavor more mild. Spread the flour on foiled baking sheets and bake for about 2.5 hours at 215 degrees F (102 degrees C). Once the aromatic scent of the toasting quinoa has faded, the flour is likely ready.
Toasted quinoa flour will keep for 8 months in the fridge or freezer, so you can make a large batch for use in multiple recipes.
There are many different recipes for baking with quinoa flour freely available online. Try homemade English muffins in particular, as the slightly tangy flavor of quinoa flour lends itself to this type of bread especially well.

, No one will hold it against you if you simply can’t kick pizza from your diet. Fortunately, there’s a way to make surprisingly good pizza crust that isn’t bread at all. You’ll need a head of cauliflower, ½ cup shredded mozzarella, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 2 beaten eggs.Pulse the cauliflower until you have a finely shredded, rice like material. Steam the cauliflower in a steamer basket and drain, toweling it to remove most of the moisture.
After the cauliflower cools, mix it with the cheeses, spices, and eggs. Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, arranging it in the shape of a pizza crust.
Bake the “crust” at 400 degrees F (204 degrees C) to 20 minutes, add any sauce and additional toppings, and bake 10 more minutes.

, While lettuce wraps can be a great substitute for a sandwich on bread, you may simply prefer squeezing your burger between two soft, rounded layers of something a bit more substantial. Believe it or not, a bread bun isn’t your only option. Portobello mushroom caps not only offer the shape of a classic bun, they are hearty and filling.Roast the caps in the oven at 375 degrees F (191 degrees C) for a few minutes, until they begin to brown. Then use them exactly like you’d use a bread bun.
Note that you can also make personal pizzas on portobello caps.

Eat more beans.,
Supplement meals with veggie-based sides.,
Snack on fruit and veggies.",How to Cut Bread from Your Diet3," Fiber is extremely important to a healthy diet. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to get lots of fiber aside from the whole grains one might otherwise eat in bread. Some of the best sources of fiber, in fact, are beans. Split peas, lentils, black beans, and Lima beans have especially high amounts of fiber.Beans are also especially easy to add to all sorts of dishes. Use mashed lentils, for instance, to make a patty with lemon juice, cilantro, and walnut pieces.
Add black beans to your morning eggs to add both fiber and additional protein.

, If, like most people, you enjoy eating, an entree alone might not leave you fully satisfied. For especially contentment-inducing sides, steam or bake some veggies. Those that are high in fiber, such as artichoke, broccoli, and brussel sprouts, will be particularly filling.Steaming veggies is the healthiest preparation method. For instance, steam lightly salted broccoli and season them with turmeric for a savory and delicious side.

, Bread gets a lot of love in part because it is cheap, filling, and easy to carry and snack on. Of course, there are other healthier food categories that offer these benefits as well. Get in the habit of snacking on fresh fruit or slices of cucumber or bell pepper instead of a roll or other bread item.Raspberries, blackberries, and pears are especially high in healthy, filling fiber.
For an extra flavor burst, dip veggies in hummus. This snack will offer the satiating effects of fiber that will quickly quell any mid-afternoon hunger.

Physics, chemistry, and biology will all help prepare you for a college premedical program. If possible, take AP science classes. This will give you a head start in college and allow you to progress to higher level classes faster.Look for after school work or volunteer opportunities in the medical field. Any experience will be extremely beneficial to you, even if you aren’t able to have any contact with patients. This experience may also help you write more confidently about your interest in medicine when it is time to begin applying to colleges.;
, Many universities offer premedical undergraduate programs, which are designed to prepare you for medical school. This may be a good choice for you, but keep in mind that you do not need a premedical undergraduate major in order to be admitted to medical school. Choose a major that suits your interests, while also keeping in mind the prerequisite requirements for the medicals schools you plan on applying to.It is best to have an idea about where you would like to attend medical school when you choose your undergraduate program so you can be prepared to complete all of the necessary prerequisites. Contact your top choices for medical school and ask them about the undergraduate premedical courses that are required for admission into their programs. The Association of American Medical Schools maintains a complete list of U.S. and Canadian medical/osteopathic schools, along with information about their programs and admission requirements.
Decide what kind of degree is best for you. If you are completely sure that you want to attend medical school after college, you can look into B.S./M.D., B.S./D.O., B.A./M.D., or B.A./D.O. programs. These are special programs offered by some universities that allow students to complete both their undergraduate degree and medical degree at the same institution without having to apply to medical school separately.Alternatively, you can choose to pursue a traditional undergraduate degree at any university, and then apply to medical school at another institution.

, Get good grades in all your classes, especially those related to your major. Take the most advanced premedical classes available to you.


If you do choose an undergraduate premedical program, take courses in the humanities as well. Medical schools prefer applicants who have excellent written and verbal communication skills and an appreciation for diversity.In addition to performing strong academically, you should show your interest in the medical field by joining clubs for premedical students and continuing to seek out employment, volunteer, and internship opportunities in your field.

, (A separate application is not necessary if you are already enrolled in a B.S./M.D., B.S./D.O., B.A./M.D., or B.A./D.O. program.) Ask your adviser how to best handle the paperwork involved in medical school applications.


Check application deadlines carefully, and give yourself plenty of time to prepare your applications.
Applications will require personal statements and most likely interviews, so be prepared to talk about your passion for the medical field.
You will need to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) at the end of your junior year in college. Be sure to familiarize yourself with this test, study hard, and get tutoring if necessary, because your score on this test will be an important factor for your admission into medical school., When you graduate, you will receive your Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree or Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree.


You should expect to spend the first two years of medical school taking a wide variety of science classes that will teach you all about the human body, as well as some classes that will help prepare you to interact with patients. You will continue taking classes for the next two years, but will also start clinical rotations. This will give you the opportunity to learn about about many different fields of medicine. Depending on your program, you may have the opportunity to choose some of your rotations based on the fields that most interest you. If you choose a B.S./M.D., B.S./D.O., B.A./M.D., or B.A./D.O. program, you may finish both degrees in less than eight years, depending on the specific program.

, You will not have to commit to your specialty until you begin applying for residency programs. Use medical school as an opportunity to explore different fields of medicine so you will be sure that neuropsychiatry is really right for you.


Make sure you have a genuine interest in treating patients who are experiencing psychiatric symptoms, keeping in mind that this requires compassion, patience, and empathy.
You should also have an interest in the brain and nervous system, as well as strong diagnostic skills, to perform the neurological requirements of the job.
Keep in mind that it is perfectly fine to choose to focus solely on neurology or psychiatry, or to change your focus entirely.

, You will begin taking the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and/or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA) while attending medical school. Most students take the first part of the exam after their second year of medical school, the second part during their fourth year of medical school, and the last part during their residency., You should begin the application process in your third or early in your fourth year of medical school. This is actually on-the-job training for which you will receive a salary.The residency application process involves a personal essay and recommendation letters, both of which are weighed very heavily, so be sure to prepare yourself accordingly.
Talk to an adviser or the residency director at your medical school about your desire to pursue a career in neuropsychiatry. You should also try to talk to as many neuropsychiatrists as possible. The goal is to learn as much about the field as possible before you decide for sure that this is the career path you want to take. If you are interested in other medical fields as well, talk to people in those fields and carefully weigh all your options.
Apply to a variety of residency programs at different tiers. Remember to take geographical location into consideration, as you will be living in the area of your residency for several years.
You will receive interview request letters in response to your applications. After you have completed your interviews and maybe even gone on second visits to some institutions, you will need to rank the programs in order of your preference. You will then be matched to a program by The National Resident Matching Program (NRMP)., The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology The American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry does not offer medical boards in neuropsychiatry, so you will have to pass individual medical boards in psychiatry and neurology in order to practice in both fields.

, Each state has different licensing requirements, so do your research to make sure you qualify for licensure in your state. The American Medical Association provides lots of helpful information, as well as links to State Medical Boards.

, Don’t forget to congratulate yourself for committing yourself to your education and achieving your goal of becoming a neuropsychiatrist.


In order to maintain your board certification, you will need to fulfill the continuing educational requirements established by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. This includes taking an exam every ten years for each certification you hold."

Choose your desired level.",How to Become a Neonatal Nurse," Depending on what your high school offers, taking as many science courses as possible is a great way to start on a career path to becoming a neonatal nurse. You will want to take basic science courses, such as chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as any elective science courses that may be offered (for example, courses in forensics or anatomy would be helpful). In addition, you will want to enroll in mathematics courses, particularly in subjects such as algebra and calculus. Having a strong background in math and science will make you a more attractive candidate for college-level nursing programs.


In addition to math and science courses, you should include English and language arts, psychology, and foreign language classes in your coursework if possible. All of these classes offer skills that you will require as a neonatal nurse.
Take Advanced Placement (AP) courses if offered. These courses can help set you apart as a particularly high-achieving student and can propel you on the right trajectory to becoming a neonatal nurse when you begin college.;
, Admission into college-level nursing programs is very competitive, and your grade point average (GPA) will be important.If you are struggling in any of your courses, talk with your teacher or an adviser to prevent getting a poor grade that may affect your chances of getting into a competitive nursing program.


In addition to having a high GPA, you should look to perform well on your college entrance exams (such as the SAT or ACT).A good score on these entrance exams can help you obtain a place in a great nursing program.

, Volunteering in a healthcare setting shows that you have exposure to the demands of working in a healthcare profession and shows that you are caring and dedicated to helping ill people feel better.


In order to find volunteer opportunities, check with your local hospital to see if they offer a summer volunteer program for high school student. In order to find a program near you, do an online search for “volunteer opportunities in hospital” and you will find many opportunities. Alternatively, visit your local hospital and inquire about any opportunities they may have.
While you are volunteering, talk to nurses and to neonatal nurses in particular. They may be able to offer advice or insight into their careers that is hard to match. If you develop a relationship with a nurse, you might ask her if you can “shadow” her for a day. By following her around and seeing her day to day duties and responsibilities, you will have a better idea of what it takes to be a nurse.

, Your school may offer these classes as part of their curriculum, or you may have to seek them out from a local community center.Taking one of these classes will demonstrate that you have experience with health-related skills and will show your motivation to become a nurse.


To find a first aid or CPR class, visit the website of the American Heart Association. They list options for courses for the general community that you may be interested in., If possible, you may want to look into attending nursing camp during one of your summers in high school. You can do an online search to see if there is a program that you can attend that’s near you. For example, Seattle Children’s Hospital offers a summer nursing camp to expose high school students to the role of a nurse in various clinical settings.Some nursing camps require you to apply. You will want to find out the entry requirements for a camp you may be interested in attending as early as possible.

, You will want to enroll in a college or university where you can get a four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree. Preferably, you will go to a university where you can receive a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN, BScN) degree.Within a BSN program, you will complete your general education courses and also have training in math and science requirements that will be integral to your future career as a neonatal nurse. These courses include statistics, microbiology, anatomy, and physiology.Do an online search for colleges and universities that you may be interested in that have BSN programs. If you are having trouble locating programs, speak with a guidance counselor or other teacher who can help you find a program that would be appropriate for you.
Often times, states have universities and colleges that offer nursing programs. In-state tuition costs are less expensive than out of state programs, and public university is less costly then private.
It is also essential you confirm that the program is accredited through a national organization.

, You will need to complete all the courses in your BSN program and keep your grade point average as high as possible. In order to get into a graduate nursing program (which you will need for your training in a neonatal specialty), many programs will require at least a 3.3 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) as well as a grade of B or better in all science and nursing courses.If possible, take neonatal nursing electives. Your college advisor may be able to recommend some relevant electives, or you can talk to certified neonatal nurses to find out what kind of classes they would recommend that you take.

, In addition to having good grades, you will need relevant work experience. Many potential employers will want you to have experience in particular working with ill infants.This work experience will be critical for building up your resume. Try to get as much experience as possible working in a hospital setting, whether through internships set up by your college or university or by volunteering or shadowing neonatal nurses at a local hospital.

, This is a great way to connect with other students who aspire to become neonatal nurses as well as nurses in later stages of their career that may be able to offer guidance and advice.


To join NANN, visit http://www.nann.org/membership/content/join-or-renew.html. You are able to join online, by email, by mailing a membership application, or by calling NANN Member Services.When applying, you will be asked some basic demographic questions, including your academic credentials, your position, your work setting, and your employment status.
If you are a member of the National Student Nurses’ Association (NSNA), you can join NANN at a discounted rate of $45., This exam is a comprehensive test that must be passed before you can earn your license. Passing this exam will enable you to practice in your state (and some states have licensing agreements with other states) by giving you a state license.Visit the NCLEX website (https://www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm) to find out what you have to do to apply and register for the NCLEX. You will need to be declared eligible to test by the board of nursing/regulatory body. You can find all the necessary details on the NCLEX website.

, After you become a registered nurse by passing your NCLEX exam, you will want to find a nursing job in a hospital that has a NICU. This will give you the opportunity to get experience with ill newborns and enable you to start developing the skills that you need for a successful career in neonatal nursing.


Many NICUs will hire graduate nurses who have an interest in neonatal intensive care.Look for a hospital that will give you the opportunity to work in a NICU as you begin your nursing career.
Look for hospitals that offer mentorship programs.

, Many neonatal nurses start out working as staff nurses who care for ill newborns in hospitals.An average day can consist of assisting new moms with breastfeeding, delivering preterm infants, and caring for ill full-term infants.As you become more experienced in your neonatal nursing career you can grow your career by becoming a neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP).


Look to practice nursing in a NICU (preferably a Level III NICU, which is geared to take care of the most seriously ill and/or preterm infants) as a staff nurse before applying to graduate school.This will give you essential experience that you need for your graduate school application.

, To become a NNP (an advanced practice nurse who works with other staff to provide critical care to infants in the NICU), you will also need a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree or a Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree in Neonatal Nursing.These programs will prepare you to work with critically ill newborns and working in delivery rooms.Many nursing schools will offer a MSN degree through a two-year Advanced Practice Neonatal Nursing (APNN program).Enrolling in this type of program will get you ready to become licensed as a nurse practitioner or as a clinical nurse specialist., There are three different levels in the neonatal nursing specialty. The levels vary in their demands and in the level of intensive responsibilities.You should carefully reflect on what type of setting you want to work in and consider if your desire is to work with critically ill infants. Regardless of your level of nursing, you will make a difference in the lives of the infants that you care for.


Level I nurses care for healthy infants. While still intense and demanding, this is the least demanding level of neonatal nursing.
Level II nurses care for sick and premature babies that are in need of constant attention. They frequently work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
Level III nurses work in the NICU and monitor the most seriously ill and premature infants. In addition to caring for these infants (usually around the clock), they also are responsible for teaching parents how to properly care for their sick babies.

They may work with people who are unable to communicate effectively or have special needs.Meet new people, find things you have in common and try to understand your differences. Put yourself in other people's shoes to understand what a person is feeling or why he choose certain actions.Challenge prejudices. We often have preconceived notions about groups of people. Focus on what you share with individuals instead of what divides you. Listen to people. The ability to focus on another person’s emotional state and needs is an important skill for a neurosurgeon to have. Paraphrase what people say to you to show that you are an active listener and ensure you understand what they are saying. Consider learning another language. This is an extremely valuable skill. You will often encounter people who speak a different language. Speaking another (or multiple) language can help you easily communicate with these patients and can help you stand out when applying to med school.;
, Learn to work well within a team and take on leadership roles. Physicians understand ethical principles and moral reasoning. They must make decisions about patient care and implement treatment plans., Learn how to collect information and research problems to find solutions. Explore areas you are unfamiliar with and use trusted sources of information to gain new knowledge.

, Neurosurgeons operate in and around the brain so they need to be able to understand spatial relationships and use their hands with skill. Visualize how things go together. Put together complex models with your hands. Learn how to collect information and research problems to find solutions. You will also need to be skilled and dexterous with your hands, as neurosurgery is delicate work. However, don't stress over this too much, as much of your manual dexterity will be acquired through experience. , Colleges look for students who can succeed in challenging and rigorous courses. These classes will also help you succeed in the demanding college courses required to get into medical school.

, Familiarize yourself with the way healthcare settings function, such as how physicians and staff interact. Watch how patients are treated and what physicians do. Shadow a doctor, preferably a neurologist or neurosurgeon if you can.

, Make sure to take courses that satisfy pre-medical school requirements. Many successful medical students major in biology but it is not a requirement for admission to medical school. Consider a major in neurobiology or neuroscience if these are offered.


Your degree should include a core curriculum that consists of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, calculus and physics courses with labs.
Taking biochemistry, microbiology and human anatomy classes will increase your chances of getting into medical school and doing well there.
A few medical schools offer combined undergraduate and medical school programs that last six or seven years. If this interests you, look into these programs.

, Medical school is very competitive. Strive for at least a 3.0 GPA, though a 3.5 or above is better. Your first-year biology grades are especially important. Some schools will disqualify students with Cs and lower. Try to earn at least a 3.75 GPA your freshman year of college.Spend time studying throughout the week to review material covered in class. Join a study group and go over important information with friends. Purchase, borrow or rent course reviews and quizzes. If you need help, get a tutor through your college or hire an independent instructor.
The higher you can get your grades, the better you will look to admissions committees. This will give you the best chance of getting into the college you want. GPA is also important to qualify for scholarships that will pay for college.

, This is another way to set yourself apart from other applicants. Participating in undergraduate research indicates that you are a curious and hardworking, and it may help you get additional recommendations and advocates from your mentors. Ask your professors if they are working on any research projects to which you might contribute, or if they have any colleagues that you could work with. In addition, look into research opportunities for undergraduates at medical clinics (such as the Cleveland Clinic)., You will need to submit letters of recommendations to get into medical school from professors or employers who are familiar with you and your work. Take on a research or teaching assistant position and take this opportunity to build a relationship with faculty members.

, This is a standardized examination required by all US medical schools and many in Canada. This test score is one of the most important factors for medical school admission. Give yourself adequate time to prepare for it.


Many students take the MCAT during their junior year after studying for several months, while others prefer to finish four years of college before taking the MCAT. You might decide to take the test sooner if you have taken some advanced placement coursework or classes during the summer.The MCAT tests foundational concepts, scientific inquiry, critical analysis and reasoning skills drawn from biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology. Do your best to be familiar with these disciplines and practice your reading analysis skills.

, The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) administers the MCAT throughout the year at hundreds of test sites throughout the US and Canada, along with other locations. Check with the AAMC for test dates and locations near you.Register early, at least 60 days in advance of the exam date, to get your preferred test date or location. You must pre-register online and pay a fee.
Enter your information into the Scheduling and Registration System exactly as it appears on your identification (ID) and make sure your contact information is correct.
If you are unable to pay for the MCAT exam, you may be eligible for the Fee Assistance Program (FAP). You will need to submit an application and be approved before you register for the MCAT. , Arrive at least 30 minutes early with a government-issued ID. You can only bring yourself, your clothes and a watch into the test room. Lockers and locks are usually offered for your other personal items, such as a cell phone. Study hard before the test. Aim for a score of 32 or higher.Buy or rent an MCAT prep book or take a review course. You may also sign up for practice exams that prepare you for the real thing.If you don’t get the score you want, you can retake the MCAT up to three times a year and seven times during your lifetime. Keep in mind, though, that different schools will treat multiple scores differently—some may average them while others may take the most recent or best score., Medical schools can be very different and you will need to research each school to find the best medical schools for you. Factors to consider include location, cost, curriculum, facilities, financial aid, residency placement and reputation.

, This will increase your chances of getting accepted. If you select schools that take part in the Early Decision Program (EDP), then you may secure an acceptance early and still have time to apply to other schools if you are not accepted. Applicants usually submit transcripts, MCAT scores and letters of recommendation but schools may also consider personality, leadership qualities and participation in extracurricular activities. Most schools will require interviews with admissions committee members.
You will apply through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS) and the services will send your application to your desired schools. US medical schools that confer the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree use AMCAS as the primary application method for students whereas osteopathic medical schools that confer the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree use AACOMAS.
In the case of rejection, don’t give up. Not everyone gets into the medical school of choice but with hard work and dedication you will get into a medical school.
Most applicants to medical school have at least a bachelor's degree, but many have advanced degrees as well. If you have difficulty getting into medical school consider getting a master’s degree or higher before applying again.
If you are selected to interview, study up on the school so you will be able to ask relevant questions. You may want to practice your interviewing skills before you meet with the school. A good impression will give you a good chance at being offered a position with the school.

, or D.O. degree You will attend medical school for four years. This time will be spent in laboratories and classrooms as well as gaining practical skills, such as taking medical histories and diagnosing patients under the supervision of experienced physicians.


Identify a resident and faculty mentor in neurosurgery as soon as possible. These mentors can help you put together your residency application and expose you to operating room and neurosurgery clinics.
Enrolling in an elective during medical school can help you decide if being a neurosurgeon is right for you. If you are interested in neurosurgery, you should do sub-internships during the fourth year of medical school.
You can also gain neurosurgery exposure by attending the weekly didactic sessions and grand rounds at your school’s neurosurgery residency program. You can learn more about neurosurgery and interact with faculty and residents at these sessions.

, You want to do well in medical school and make connections to get a good internship and residency placement later on. You will want to cultivate relationships and earn letters of recommendation.

, You should gain experience with research, preferably in the neuroscience and neurosurgical fields. Research participation will help you get to know faculty members, contribute to exciting advances in medicine and increase your chances of getting into the residency of your choice.


Look into faculty members credentials, interests and the research they are involved in. Talk to them about potential openings for students to participate. Let them know you are interested and find out what you need to do to apply.
Publishing in a peer-reviewed journal about your research will look excellent on your application to residency programs.
The summer after your first year of medical school may be an optimal time to begin researching and shadowing at this level.
You can also attend national conferences like the annual meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons to make connections with residents and neurosurgeons from around the world.

, Toward the end of medical school, medical students interested in a career in neurosurgery will apply through the Neurosurgery Match Program. The program pairs applicants and neurosurgical programs.


There are around 100 neurosurgical residency programs in the US and each accepts about one to three residents. You will need to apply to more than one residency program to ensure that you get in, though odds are very good for candidates in neurosurgery.Plan for alternatives. Matching a residency in neurosurgery is extremely competitive, and there is a possibility you will not match. Ask yourself what you will do in this event. How can you improve your application? What can you do in the year before you can reapply — research, an internship, or something else? You may wish to consider applying for a general surgical position while also applying to neurosurgery positions. Talk to your advisors about what you might do to prepare for this possibility.

, Usually, you will do your internship at the same place as your neurosurgery residency program. This is your first year as a doctor, and you will learn how to manage patients, learn procedures, management decisions and basic operative techniques.

, During this time, you will spend the first two years as a junior resident managing ICU patients, doing consultations and basic to more complicated operations. As a mid-level resident, you may do a rotation at a children’s hospital, elective time or research. Afterward, you will do one to two years of research or a fellowship in a sub-specialty before doing one year as chief resident with increasing responsibilities and performing complex operations.

, At the conclusion of your residency, you will study for and pass the certification examination administered by the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS). Most states require physicians to have this certification to get a license. There may also be other state requirements, so check with your state.

, In the US, surgeons must pass a standardized national licensure examination. M.D.s take the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and DOs take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX). By gaining licensure, you can practice as a neurosurgeon. Candidates must graduate from an accredited medical school, complete one year of residency training in their specialty and pass written and practical exams in order to qualify for a license.

, You may want to specialize in a particular area of neurosurgery after residency. These include pediatric, spinal, vascular/endovascular, tumor, peripheral nerve, functional or skull base. To do this, you must undertake a fellowship under the supervision of a qualified specialist and then obtain state certification.

, Apply for open neurosurgeon positions at the hospital or clinic of your choice. Consult with relevant attorneys and business advisors about opening your practice.


To open your own practice, first secure financing and a location. You may get loans through local or commercial banks. You could also try a lending company as well as philanthropists or those looking for an investment opportunity. Look for a suitable office space that is accessible. Procure computers, software and medical equipment to help your practice run smoothly.
You will need to hire staff members, such as other physicians, nurses, medical assistants, office managers and administrative assistants.
Get credentialed with major insurance companies to begin accepting new patients. This process with the health insurance companies can take several months. Find medical malpractice insurance. Look for reasonable rates and coverage.
Bring in patients through advertisements, online reviews, word of mouth, etc. and start practicing.

, This may include annual meetings, conferences, scientific journals and research. You need to be up to date with rapidly advancing neurosurgeon research and technology.

Be willing to make personal sacrifices.",How to Become a Midwife1," Midwives have played the role of assisting women through the process of childbirth for centuries. Midwives traditionally operate under the philosophy that pregnancy and the act of giving birth can be a spiritual experience in a woman's life, and it's healthier to have as few instances of medical intervention as possible. Many say they have a calling to do the work they do. Midwives have the following responsibilities:


Monitor the health of the mother and fetus throughout the pregnancy.






Provide guidance to the mother on prenatal nutrition and self care as well as emotional well-being.
Educate the mother on available options for labor and delivery, and empower her to make decisions that are right for her.






Guide the mother and child through labor and delivery.
Work with an obstetrician should complications arise.;
, Midwives are incredibly knowledgeable, highly skilled practitioners who take on the highest responsibility: they act as first responders in the unpredictable process of pregnancy, labor and delivery.


Since every pregnancy is different and subject to a range of complications, midwives must be able to act confidently in emergency situations. Responsibility for both the mother and child's life lies in the midwives hands.
Also important is the midwife's responsibility for the emotional and spiritual health of the mother, who looks to the midwife as a leader and guide through the confusing, painful, difficult process of childbirth.
Women who choose to give birth under the care of an obstetrician may work with a midwife who is responsible for acting as the women's advocate in the hospital setting.






Midwives are responsible for standing up for their own profession; in some states, it is illegal to practice midwifery.

, Midwives work with women from the beginning of their pregnancy through the labor, delivery, and for months and sometimes years beyond. Due to the intimate, extraordinarily important nature of their work, midwives must be willing to put their clients' needs ahead of their own.

Midwives must be on call at all times, since they never know exactly when a woman will go into labor.






Labor can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days, and midwives must be present the entire time.






Midwives are often emotionally present for expectant mothers, giving out their cell phone number and email address and making themselves available for questions or as a shoulder to lean on at stressful moments.
Some midwives have to be flexible enough to move to a different city or state, since it's difficult to practice midwifery in some locations.

Consider hospitalization as a last resort.",How to Treat Anorexia Nervosa in Adolescents1," This form of therapy is ideal for helping adolescents with thoughts and behavior that contribute to Anorexia Nervosa. During the 45 minute sessions, the adolescent is taken through a talk therapy known as cognitive behavior therapy. The therapist trains the adolescent to learn positive and healthier ways of coping with strong feelings, such as distress.This process allows the adolescent to gain self-esteem and to learn coping mechanisms that can combat his or her need to control what he or she eats.
Individual therapy can be done by a private practice therapist, or in a psychiatric hospital as part of a more extensive treatment plan.;
, Most adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa end up failing to make sound decision, especially those with low self-esteem. Because of this, it is important that the family knows how to take care of the adolescent. Family therapy can help to air out conflicts so that the family can be more efficient at helping the adolescent. Proper family interaction plays an important role in ensuring that adolescents do not develop anorexia. The family should train a child to focus on inner worth rather than outer beauty through positive appraisal and affirmation. The whole family should practice healthy eating habits and eat a balanced, and healthy diet.


The therapist is involved in providing psychosocial support, information, monitoring progress, and ensuring proper communication between all family members. He or she may schedule a visit to your home twice a week to engage everyone in a family discussion.

, There is no specific medication for Anorexia Nervosa. However, Tricyclic Antidepressants can be used to treat the underlying depression associated with the condition. Pamelor is a commonly prescribed antidepressant for adolescents.


The usual dose is 40 mg of Pamelor taken over the course of four doses each day.

, An adolescent suffering from Anorexia Nervosa might not have an understanding of how to eat properly and still maintain his or her health. Nutritional counseling in this regard, becomes an important component of Anorexia Nervosa treatment. During a nutritional counseling session, a nutritionist or a dietitian will teach your child about healthy eating and proper nutrition.


The nutritionist will also help your child to develop and follow meal plans. These meals will add up to roughly 2,200 calories a day for girls, and 2,500 to 2,900 calories a day for boys., Sometimes, interpersonal, family-based therapies, and medication may fail to work. If your child still refuses to eat, hospitalization in a medical or psychiatric ward may be required. You could enroll your child in a day or residential program, instead of full hospitalization. In the hospital, your child will take part in intensive therapy and nutrition education sessions.


To be hospitalized, your child must medically, and psychologically at risk. A distorted body image can make adolescents experience severe depression, self-mutilation, or even suicidal thoughts.

Look for signs of preoccupation with food.,
Monitor your child’s behavior after dinner time.",How to Treat Anorexia Nervosa in Adolescents2," An adolescent suffering from Anorexia Nervosa will often follow a diet that is severely restricted, despite the fact that he or she is already thin. This is because they feel they are fat, even though they are not. You may notice that your child has become obsessed with how many grams of fat, or calories are in a meal.Your child may also lie about what he or she has eaten that day. Try to keep track of your child’s meals to avoid this.

, An adolescent suffering from Anorexia Nervosa will often be obsessed with his or her body weight, shape, and cloth size. He or she will regularly be involved in weigh-ins, and will be extremely concerned about tiny weight fluctuations.


He or she may complain of feeling overweight or too fat, and may discuss places he or she thinks are fatty, like his or her stomach, thighs, or hips.

, An adolescent suffering from Anorexia Nervosa will think about food constantly because of his or her 'imagined' weight. As such, he or she begins to read food magazines, collect recipes, cook for others, while he or she eats very little.When he or she eats, he or she develops rigid and ritualistic modes of eating such as cutting food, chewing and spitting it out, or using a designated that only holds a certain amount of food.

, An adolescent suffering from Anorexia Nervosa may begin to use diet pills, diuretics, or laxatives, to lose weight. He or she may frequently run to the washroom to throw up in order to starve himself or herself of food to keep thin.


When your child goes to the bathroom to throw up, he or she may run the water to disguise the sound of vomiting. Your child may later emerging smelling of mouthwash, toothpaste, or mint.

"
"
See if your child has a negative attitude towards his or her body image, and other people’s bodies.,
Know that family background can play a role in the development of this condition.,
Understand that your child’s personality type may factor into his or her development of this condition.",How to Treat Anorexia Nervosa in Adolescents3," Your child may have a negative view about other people’s bodies, not just his or her own. As such he or she might make small comments, or compare his or her body to the bodies of people your child’s thinks are thin.

, An adolescent coming from a family with a history of depression, substance abuse, or weight problems is more likely to develop Anorexia Nervosa by imitation.

, Adolescents suffering from Anorexia Nervosa are often perfectionists or overachievers.They are often labeled as good sons and daughters, following exact instructions, excelling in everything, and focusing on pleasing others.


While they please others, inside they feel inadequate, and worthless. They begin to view themselves through a critical lens, feeling they are not perfect, and may take this feeling out on their bodies.

If your high school offers courses in psychology or statistics, those may be useful, as you will need to take coursework in those fields in college., If you think you'd like to pursue a career in neuropsychology, it's a good idea to read relevant books on the subject to ensure you're interested in the field. Some good sources (which are often used in college programs) include:


Neuropsychological Assessment by Lezak, Howieson, Bigler, & Tranel. The book is currently in its fifth edition and has been an educational staple since the first edition was published in 1976.Clinical Neuropsychology by Kenneth M. Heilman & Edward Valenstein. The book, also in its fifth edition, covers most of the neurobehavioral syndromes likely to be encountered by practicing neuropsychologists., Many students wishing to pursue a career in neuropsychology begin by majoring in psychology or clinical psychology, though some students choose to major in pre-med, neuroscience, or biology during their undergraduate studies.If you wish to go on to specialize in neuropsychology, it's important that you take relevant courses during your undergraduate education.Anyone looking for undergraduate or graduate programs in American may find Careers In Psychology's comprehensive program database very helpful, though any online search engine will help prospective students find a program in any region. Sample coursework should involve classes in:


clinical psychologyneurosciencebehavioral psychologycognitive psychologypsychological research and assessmentstatistics, Some doctoral programs allow students to go from undergraduate studies directly to doctoral studies, but many require students to earn a master's degree first. Psychology Career Center's website offers a comprehensive listing of university programs that specialize in neuropsychology.


If you're planning on going on for a doctoral degree (which you most likely will need to), it may be worth looking at the requirements for programs you're interested in. If you find a doctoral program that interests you, look at their requirements to see if you need a master's degree, or if you can enter the program directly from an undergraduate program.
Talk to faculty members you've worked with in the Psychology Department, either in your undergraduate or master's program, and let them know about your interests. They may be able to offer you guidance on how to find a program, and what that program's requirements are., Some students may be able to secure employment in the field of neuropsychology after earning a master's degree, but the majority of students will need to earn a doctoral degree.You can find accredited doctoral programs by searching online, or by using National Register of Health Service Psychologists's listing by state/province for North American universities.


Make sure that the doctoral program you choose is accredited by either the American Psychological Association or the Canadian Psychological Association., The two most common doctoral degrees leading to a career in neuropsychology are a PhD in clinical psychology or a Psy.D in clinical psychology. Students wishing to specialize in neuropsychology should take plenty of neuroscience courses during their doctoral studies., The location and type of post-doctoral internship you choose will vary considerably, depending on whether you wish to specialize in research or clinical work.Make sure that the chosen internship meets the American Psychological Association's (APA) terms of eligibility. Students residing or studying in other parts of the world should ensure that the internship and experience accrued after earning a degree satisfy their regional certification board's requirements. In general, internships can be found by searching through an accredited institution or certification board's website, such as The Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC). The APA requires that all internships:


specialize in psychologyprovide a broad spectrum of experience that will meet the intended goals and objectives of an eligible training programbe an integral part of the institution or agency where the internship takes placeoffer an equivalent of one year's worth of full-time training, taking place over the course of at least 12 months (10 months for internships in school psychology) but not to exceed 24 monthsteach students respect and understanding for cultural as well as individual diversityprovide interns with the institution's written policies and procedures, requirements, performance evaluation and feedback, and generally adheres to staff and interns' rights and responsibilities, After completing the educational requirements and the post-doctoral internship, you will have to pass the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology (EPPP). The EPPP is a broad examination that is required for anyone wishing to practice in any field of psychology and is mandatory for anyone wishing to practice in any of the 62 jurisdictions in the United States and Canada.


As of 2011, the EPPP consists of 225 multiple-choice questions, 175 operational questions, and 50 pretest items. All answers are supported by Practice Analyses.
Prospective neuropsychologists who wish to take the EPPP must pay a $450 exam fee and a $65 fee to the testing center where the EPPP is taken., There are eight primary content areas covered in the EPPP. Prospective neuropsychologists must become well-versed in each content area in order to pass the exam. Experts recommend prioritizing study materials, as prospective candidates will invariably have a greater knowledge in some areas of content than in others.Biological Bases of Behavior - this content area covers biological and neural sources of behavior. It may include the use and abuse of drugs, pharmacological and somatic applications in treating a variety of mental disorders, and how a range of factors (including cultural, environmental, and experiential) can affect an individual in conjunction with certain biological factors.
Cognitive-Affective Bases of Behavior - this content area covers behavior influenced by cognition. It may include various models and theories of learning, motivation, and memory, as well as psychosocial influences as factors that influence behavior.
Social & Cultural Bases of Behavior - this content area covers social cognition and perception as influences on behavior. It may include social interaction and group dynamics, evolutionary theories regarding social behavior, and social-cultural issues such as gender, race, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation.
Growth & Lifespan Development - this content area covers the normal growth and development of healthy vs. unhealthy individuals. It may include various theories of development, as well as interactions between genetics and environment in influencing healthy and unhealthy individuals.
Assessment & Diagnosis - this content area covers psychometric theory, assessment theories, as well as the ways psychologists may select assessment methods and interpret data.
Treatment, Intervention, Prevention, & Supervision - this content area covers contemporary theories and models of intervention and supervision, as well as consultation models and processes available to practicing psychologists.
Research Methods & Statistics - this content area covers best practices for sampling and collecting data, designing and implementing research, and analyzing/interpreting statistics.
Ethical, Legal, & Professional Issues - this content area deals with the ethical principles and codes of conduct outlined by the APA/CPA.

, Test takers have four hours and fifteen minutes to complete the exam. In order the pass the EPPP and become certified, prospective neuropsychologists must receive a minimum score of 500, which is earned by answering about 70% of the exam questions correctly., Didactic learning experiences usually involve the student being given both verbal and written feedback on his treatment methods.Applicants in neuropsychology must document didactic experience in eight core knowledge areas, most of which will have been fulfilled during the course of the applicant's graduate education. Additional sources of didactic experience include educational activities like seminars and conferences.The relevant documentation must be submitted to the American Board of Professional Psychology to attain specialty certification in neuropsychology. The eight core knowledge areas are:


basic neurosciencesfunctional neuroanatomyneuropathologyclinical neurologypsychological assessmentclinical neuropsychological assessmentpsychopathologypsychological intervention, All neuropsychologists who become board certified on or after January 1, 2015 must work toward maintenance of certification (MOC) by engaging in continued education and professional activities, and must complete a self-evaluation once every ten years.Examples of continuing education include approved online courses (on topics like professional development, ethics, etc.), or by taking APA examinations based on articles, books, or newsletters.Examples of qualifying professional activities include teaching and research projects., Neuropsychologists who have completed board certification can find job listings on the Association for Psychological Science's Employment Network's website, as well as other online resources for practicing psychologists.

, EuroPsy, the board certification standard for European psychologists, has its own set of educational and professional requirements.Psychologists who wish to apply for EuroPsy certification may contact their country's National Awarding Committee (NAC) for specifics on EuroPsy requirements and the certification process., The Psychology Board of Australia is the board certification standard for Australian psychologists. Australian psychologists must take the National Psychology Exam in order to become certified.Applicants have three and a half hours to complete the exam, which consists of 150 multiple choice questions. The exam covers ethics, assessment, intervention, and communication strategies. The exam will effectively test the applicant's knowledge in assessment approaches, selecting and implementing intervention strategies, communication and reporting skills, and ethical/professional reasoning.Applicants must get at least 70% of the questions correct in order to pass the examination., Certain smaller nations, including New Zealand, do not have specific post-graduate programs specific to neuropsychology. Instead, graduates who have completed a graduate program (earning either a masters degree or a doctoral degree) in Clinical Psychology must then complete training, research, and internships with a specialization in neuropsychology."

Assess how often you check your weight.,
Consider your clothing.,
Think about how you deal with stress.,
Ask whether you fit the profile of an eating disorder.,
See a licensed mental health professional.,
Seek treatment.",How to Tell Whether or Not You Have a Minor Eating Disorder," People with anorexia nervosa (also called anorexia) are characterized by a very low body weight that is caused by reduced calorie intake; they tend to have an intense fear of gaining weight and can have warped perceptions about their body image. Efforts to reduce weight might include:Excessive exercise.
Intentionally vomiting after eating.
Using laxatives to lose weight.;
, People with bulimia nervosa (also called bulimia) have episodes of binging (eating excessively), at least once a week for three months, and purging (e.g., forcing oneself to vomit) and may report a lack of control over their eating behaviors. Bulimia nervosa is associated with having three or more of the following: You eat much more quickly than most people.
You eat until you are so full that you feel uncomfortable.
You feel disgusted with yourself or ashamed or guilty over your eating behavior.
You eat a lot even when you don't feel hungry.
You eat in private because you are embarrassed by how much you are eating.

, People with binge eating disorder eat too, and feel guilty about it afterwards, much like in the case of those with bulimia nervosa.


However, those with binge eating disorder tend not to purge afterwards.People with binge eating often report feeling a lack of control over their food intake behavior., There are other kinds of eating disorders beyond these major three. Learn about them so that you can compare your own behavior to the disorder to get a sense of whether you might have one of these eating disorders:Pica. People with pica habitually (i.e., the behavior lasts for at least a month) eat non-food items such as hair, clothing, dirt, or soap.
Rumination disorder. Those with rumination disorder repeatedly regurgitate food after eating it. This is not due to a medical condition nor is it attributable to behavior associated with another eating disorder, such as purging (although it is commonly confused with GERD).There is no nausea or gagging that is associated with the regurgitation of food.
Avoidant/resistant food intake disorder (ARFID). People with ARFID show an apparent lack of interest in eating food or show concern about the consequences of eating food; these concerns lead to insufficient calorie intake and nutrition/health concerns., One typical contributor to eating disorders is an excessive focus on one's body image and/or weight.Try to be honest with yourself and ask if you like the way that you look.


Most people have some things about their bodies that they aren't happy with, but people with eating disorders can have warped perceptions about how their body actually looks. Because of this, it is important to ask yourself what you think about your own body, and not just give objective measurements such as how much you weigh.

, Do you ever weigh yourself? Weighing yourself is a great way to keep track of how healthy you are being and what your body likes and doesn't. But, if you continually weigh yourself, sometimes more than once a day, it may be a sign that you have an eating disorder., Do you often tug at, pinch, or cover at the area of your body that you are uncomfortable with? People with eating disorders sometimes try to cover up what they dislike about themselves; they may wear baggier clothes, touch or try to cover any excess fat they may have, etc. To help you figure out how common these behaviors are, keep a journal on you and write down the time and make an entry whenever you find yourself doing one of these behaviors.

, Do you have a lot of stress in your life? People who work a lot, or have a busy life are more likely to succumb to an eating disorder than those with a healthy balance of life and work. People sometimes try to deal with a stressful lifestyle by eating a lot, or eating unhealthy foods.


If this rings true to you, try to manage your stress in healthier ways such as by getting moderate amounts of exercise, getting plenty of sleep, talking to friends and family about your stressors, and/or through meditation., Review the criteria for the various eating disorders: Does it seem like you might have anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or another eating disorder, in either a minor or major form?


If you suspect you may have an eating disorder, it is time to visit a licensed mental health professional for an official diagnosis.

, Only someone qualified, such as a licensed mental health professional, should diagnose you with an eating disorder. If you do not have a ""major"" eating disorder, you may be diagnosed with Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS; although this is now an outdated diagnostic category), or with Unspecified Feeding and Eating Disorders (UFED), which are clinically significant disorders that fail to meet the criteria for another eating disorder.If you feel that you have been misdiagnosed, it may make sense to see a medical doctor to rule out other possibilities for your weight gain or loss.

, If you are diagnosed with an eating disorder, be sure to ask whoever diagnoses you about your treatment options. Treatment is often a team-based approach that involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and education on nutrition, and may include:Medical providers to monitor your health.
Mental health professionals.
Dietitians.

Look for red or swollen eyes and cheeks.,
Take note of any calluses or scars on their hands and fingers.,
Pay attention to how they smell.,
Watch for fluctuations in weight.,
Look at their mouth.,
Discuss your concerns with their doctor.",How to Tell if Someone Is Bulimic1," If someone is inducing vomiting, they will often have a swollen jaw and cheeks. It is also common for them to strain so hard that they burst blood vessels in their eyes. This will cause swollen red eyes and is a sign of bulimia., When you vomit, stomach acid comes up with the food. Frequent exposure to this acid can cause damage to the skin and nails on a person’s hands and fingers. It is also common for someone dealing with bulimia to have scars on their hands and knuckles from hitting their teeth while trying to induce vomiting., One common way of purging is to induce vomiting. This is a difficult smell to mask, and if you are paying attention you might notice it. If a person smells like vomit once, they may simply be sick (and maybe even embarrassed of it). If you smell vomit on a person frequently, it is likely that this could be a way of purging., Purging is not an effective way to eliminate calories from your body (which is usually the goal), and thus a person with bulimia will not usually be underweight. Most people with this disorder are slightly overweight or are normal weight. It is common, however, for someone battling bulimia to fluctuate frequently in weight (e.g., dropping ten pounds this month, then gaining fifteen next month, then dropping seventeen shortly after)., If someone is purging by inducing vomiting, they will likely have dry, cracked lips. Another sign is bleeding gums or discolored teeth. A dentist or doctor might notice swollen saliva glands or eroded enamel, also., If the person you are concerned about is a minor (and you are their guardian) then you can discuss your concerns with their doctor. The doctor can look for signs of bulimia such as metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. High cholesterol is can also be a sign of bulimia."

Understand why organic foods should be an important part of your diet.,
Choose the crucial dozen organic foods.,
Shop for seasonal foods.,
Eat in moderation.,
Eat variety.,
Be realistic.",How to Choose the Most Important Organic Foods," Organic foods are grown with no or fewer chemical or hormonal additives in their growth cycle than conventionally grown produce and meat. This means that laws on organic labeling in many places ban the use of a wide array of pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, hormone treatments, antibiotics etc. on any produce or meat destined to carry an organic certification.;
, The dozen foods listed next are considered to be the foods most vulnerable to the addition of too many pesticides, growth hormones, antibiotics etc. This top dozen lists food items where home washing and cooking practices are unlikely to result in reduction of the chemical or hormonal residues:


Beef, chicken and pork
Dairy products: Milk, cheese and butter
Strawberries, raspberries and cherries
Bananas
Apples and pears
Tomatoes
Spinach and salad greens
Coffee
Potatoes
Stone fruits: Peaches, nectarines and apricots
Grapes
Celery
Peppers (capsicums), green and red

, Seasonally available produce is the budget-conscious shopper's prize. Produce in season is always value for money because it is plentiful and this includes organic produce. In addition, seasonal food often travels less distance as it is grown locally and therefore will keep in better condition (more nutrients), for longer. From a comfort perspective, there is something very calming and traditional about eating the way our ancestors have for centuries; you become attuned to the cycle of the seasons. An added bonus: You are less inclined to overfill your fridge with food that ends up going unnoticed, which saves you money.

, The statistics on obesity continue to rise. We do not need huge quantities of food; too much food makes our bodies sick rather than healthy and happy. While eating in moderation means eating less food overall, it most certainly does not mean going without and feeling hungry. Change to eating more energy-sustaining foods, such as organic grains and pulses to bulk out your diet. You will not need to eat as much of these foods, as unlike processed foods, you will feel full faster and for longer. Your budget will go further simply through choosing prime quality organic foods in smaller amounts. Most importantly, eating in moderation will result in less intake of chemical and hormonal residues and that can only be a good outcome for everyone.

, Variety means including all those vegetables and not just living off potatoes. The more that you vary your diet within seasonal constraints, there is a higher likelihood that you will have less exposure to a build-up of one type of chemical residues. Variety also means an interesting and fulfilling diet, as well as a greater likelihood that you will get all the nutrients, anti-oxidants and fiber that you need to keep healthy.

, Most nutritionists would still prefer that you eat fruit and vegetables whether they are organic or conventional in origin in preference to highly processed foods. Use the list set out in step 2 to pick the organic foods and then purchase conventional foods for the remainder if you have a tight budget. Taking the simple step of choosing some organics to include in your diet is an important one of taking control over what is potentially affecting your health; whilst you will still be surrounded by the chemical load of our industrial age, you are taking positive action to help yourself and to encourage organic growers at the same time.

Notice any signs of withdrawing.,
Check for a consistent eating schedule.,
Listen for any signs of obsessions around body image.,
Pay attention to defensive behaviors.,
Note the excessive use of breath fresheners.,
Be aware of other behaviors linked to bulimia.",How to Tell if Someone Is Bulimic2," If someone is binging and purging, they will often excuse themselves from the table before anyone else. They will also go to purge if they feel that they have eaten too much or eaten the wrong foods. This often means they will go to the restroom, but not always. You should pay close attention to after meal habits., It is common for someone purging in the bathroom to run water to cover up the sounds of purging.They also may flush the toilet several times, as the smell is unpleasant in between bouts of purging. These episodes usually happen shortly after eating., When someone is combatting bulimia, there is an underlying component of guilt and low self-esteem. This will cause someone to stop engaging socially, such as making eye contact. It can also cause a person to stop engaging physically and emotionally in relationships., It is common for someone with bulimia to have trouble sticking to a meal schedule. They may skip meals and they eat large portions, stopping only when they are physically uncomfortable. Sometimes clear cycles of overeating and then fasting will be clear. These are all signs of bulimia., These obsessions can be elusive and well hidden under the guise of “being concerned about health.” Common body image obsessions include picky eating, calorie counting and crash diets, excessive exercise habits, constantly worrying over food and weight, and obsessing over the way they look. While it is healthy to take care of one’s self, obsessing over “health” or “looks” can be a sign of bulimia., If someone you care about is hiding bulimia, they do not want you to find out. The guilt and shame that fuels the binging and purging cycles also makes the thought of being caught unbearable for most. If you bring up food or eating habits, it is likely that someone struggling with bulimia will become irrationally defensive., If a person is purging by inducing vomiting, they will likely use minty breath fresheners (e.g., gum, mouthwash, or mints) to cover their breath. If you are noticing other signs of bulimia, or have a strong suspicion of bulimia, this is another sign to watch for. Remember that just having gum is not a cause for suspicion., Bulimia stems from emotional and self-esteem struggles. It is very common that someone with bulimia will engage in other behaviors that reflect those struggles. Drug use, depression, anxiety, and anorexia are all common in people struggling with bulimia."
"
Watch for food to go missing.,
Monitor the trash or recycling.,
Look for purging products.,
Pay attention to anything that smells like vomit.,
Take note of stopped up drains.",How to Tell if Someone Is Bulimic3," For someone with bulimia, eating is often something to be ashamed of. It is common for someone with bulimia to sneak or steal food and eat it in secrecy. If large amounts of food go missing often, this deserves your attention., If someone is eating in secrecy, they will likely dispose of the evidence. Even if you do not notice food missing, large quantities of wrappers or food containers being thrown away might suggest binging. Be sure to look in the trash or recycling right before taking pick up, as someone who is being diligent to hide wrappers may wait until the last minute to dispose of them., Not all people struggling with bulimia purge by inducing vomiting. It is common to use laxatives or diuretics to purge. Diet pills and appetite reducers may also be used to help in fasting stages., Sometimes it is difficult to notice the smell of a person after they purge. However, you might notice that the bathroom often smells like vomit. You can also take note of whether their dirty clothes smell like vomit. These might be signs of bulimia., Not all induced vomiting happens in the toilet. Some people choose to vomit in the sink, and others find the shower to be very convenient because the water covers up the sound of purging. If you are having drain issues, this could be a sign that someone is struggling with bulimia."
"
Look for low-calorie greens.,
Examine nutrients.,
Create your own mix.",How to Choose the Healthiest Salad Greens1," If your idea of healthy is synonymous with low in calories, you might choose red leaf lettuce. This lettuce, like all varieties of lettuce, is mostly water. But it has half the calories of an equal serving of romaine lettuce, and about 40% of the calories you’d get in an equal serving of iceberg lettuce. It also has vitamin A and vitamin K in ample amounts.


Arugula, likewise, is low in calories, and weighs in at just six calories per cup.It also has a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that could prevent certain types of cancer.Possibly the lowest-calorie salad green is watercress. Watercress is an aquatic plant native to Asia and Europe. It has just four calories per cup.;
, If you’re looking for salad greens packed with vitamins and minerals, you’ll need something more substantial than arugula and iceberg lettuce. Instead, you’ll need to choose spinach. Spinach has lots of vitamin K, C, A, and B-complex vitamins. It also has a hefty dose of calcium and iron.Another nutritious salad green is romaine lettuce. Unlike iceberg lettuce, romaine has lots of vitamin A – 81% of your daily dose per cup, in fact.It has ample quantities of vitamin K, too.
Spinach has more vitamin K per serving than any other salad green.
Romaine lettuce has more vitamin A and more vitamin C per serving than any other salad green.
Romaine and spinach are just about tied for having the most folate per serving.

, If you want a low-calorie salad and a nutritious salad, employ a mixture of salad greens to make your salad base. For instance, you could mix one cup of arugula, one cup of chopped romaine lettuce, and once cup of spinach in a tasty salad. Or you could mix one cup of kale, one cup of iceberg lettuce, and one cup of radicchio. Remember, there is no wrong way to mix salad greens. Use whichever will help you meet your health goals – and whichever taste most delicious to you."

Observe the person's eating habits.,
Consider whether the person seems obsessed with food.,
Ask yourself if the person routinely makes excuses to avoid eating.,
Observe if the person you are concerned about seems underweight, yet still talks about dieting.,
Watch the person’s exercise habits.,
Look at the person’s appearance, keeping in mind that it may or may not be affected by anorexia.",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic1," People with anorexia have an antagonistic relationship with food. One of the driving forces behind anorexia is an intense fear of gaining weight, and anorexics severely restrict their food intake -- i.e., starve themselves -- in order to avoid gaining weight. However, simply not eating is not the only sign of anorexia. Other potential warning signs include:Refusal to eat certain foods or whole categories of foods (e.g., “no carbs,” “no sugars”)
Food-related rituals, such as excessive chewing, pushing food around on the plate, cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces
Obsession with measuring food, such as constantly counting calories, weighing food, double- or triple-checking nutrition labels
Refusal to eat out because it’s hard to measure calories;
, Even though they eat little, people with anorexia are often obsessed with food. They may obsessively read many magazines about cooking, collect recipes, or watch cooking programs. They may talk frequently about food, although these conversations are often negative (e.g., “I can’t believe anyone eats pizza when it’s so bad for you).Obsession with food is a common side-effect of starvation. A landmark starvation study performed during WWII demonstrated that people who are starving fantasize about food. They will spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about it. They will often talk about it with others and to themselves., For example, if invited to a party where there will be food, they may say they ate before they arrived. Other reasons commonly given to avoid food include:


""I’m just not hungry""
""I’m on a diet/need to lose weight""
""I don’t like any of the food available""
""I’m sick ""
""I have 'food sensitivities'"" (A person who truly has food sensitivities will eat enough as long as they are given food that works with their sensitivities.)

, If the person seems very thin but still talks about needing to lose weight, they may have a disturbed view of their own body. One hallmark of anorexia is “distorted body image,” where the person continues to believe they are much heavier than they actually are. People with anorexia will often deny suggestions that they are underweight, even if they have many visible bones.People with anorexia may also wear large or baggy clothes to hide their true size. They may dress in layers, or wear pants and jackets even in the hottest weather. Part of this is to hide body size, and part of it is because people with anorexia often cannot regulate their body temperature effectively and are thus frequently cold.
Don't rule out overweight or obese people automatically. It is possible to be anorexic at a large size. Anorexia, restricted eating, and fast weight loss are very dangerous regardless of the person's BMI, and you shouldn't wait until they become underweight before getting them help., People with anorexia may compensate for food they eat by exercising. Exercise is excessive and usually very rigid.A person with anorexia may dangerously over-exercise, going for too long or pushing their body too hard.


For example, the person may exercise for many hours each week, even if they are not training for a particular sport or event. People with anorexia may also exercise even when they are fatigued, ill, or injured, because they feel compelled to “burn off” the food they have eaten.
Exercise is a particularly common compensating behavior for males with anorexia. The person may believe he is overweight, or may be unhappy with his body composition. He may be preoccupied with body-building or “toning.” Distorted body image is common with males, too, who will often be unable to recognize how their body actually appears and will see themselves as “flabby” even if they are fit or underweight.People with anorexia who cannot exercise, or who have not exercised as much as they want to, will often appear fidgety, restless, or irritated.

, As it progresses, anorexia causes a host of physical symptoms. However, you cannot tell if a person has anorexia just from their appearance.A combination of these symptoms with disordered behaviors is the best sign that the person is suffering from an eating disorder. Not every person has all of these symptoms, but people with anorexia will usually display several of the following:Dramatic, rapid weight loss
Unusual facial or body hair in females
Increased sensitivity to cold
Hair thinning or loss
Dry, pale, yellowish skin
Fatigue, dizziness, or fainting
Brittle nails and hair
Bluish fingers

Consult your doctor.,
Figure out your own nutritional needs.,
Choose fresh greens.,
Store your salad greens properly.,
Eat seasonally.",How to Choose the Healthiest Salad Greens2," You should speak with your doctor if you have any health issues or concerns. They can help you figure out the best greens for you. If you have kidney stones, for instance, you should avoid spinach and Swiss chard.And if you take warfarin, the vitamin K content in spinach and certain other greens might negatively impact the efficacy of the medication. To avoid problems, talk to your doctor before choosing the healthiest salad greens., Salad greens should be incorporated into your meals as part of a balanced diet that also includes fruits, other veggies, whole grains, and a small amount of lean protein. Your exact caloric needs depend on your age, sex, activity level, and weight.Use a caloric intake chart like the one produced by the American Diabetes Association to determine your caloric needs based on the relevant data.
There is no daily nutritional requirement for salad greens. Instead, there is only a requirement for vegetables. If you wish, however, you could use salad greens to satisfy your daily nutritional requirement for vegetables.
Most adults require two to three cups of vegetables per day. However, this metric counts two cups of raw salad greens or one cup of cooked salad greens as a single cup. In other words, you will need to consume four to six cups of raw salad greens in order to meet the average daily nutritional requirement.If you are very active, you will need to consume more food – including more vegetables – than someone who is less active.

, Whether you’re buying loose, bagged, or packaged salad greens, it is important to ensure that they are fresh. Check the salad greens to ensure there are no wilted leaves. Bagged salad greens should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice.Don’t bother checking the “use-by” or “sell-by” dates before purchasing salad greens. These dates are generally of no use when trying to determine the freshness of salad greens.Instead, use your eyes to identify salad greens that are wilted or rotten.

, Frozen salad greens must remain in the freezer until you’re ready to use them. Fresh salad greens need to be refrigerated at 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (zero to four degrees Celsius). There are several options for you to store your salad greens in the refrigerator.If you have unpackaged salad greens, wash and dry them before attempting to store them.
You could choose to store your salad greens in a plastic container lined with paper towels. For instance, you might line a plastic storage container intended for use in the fridge with paper towels, then pour a layer of salad greens into the container. On top of that, place another paper towel and top it with more salad greens. Continue in this way until the container is full.
You could also place your salad greens directly into your crisper drawer. The crisper drawer is the bottom-most drawer in your fridge. Just empty it of its contents, line it with paper towels, and add alternating layers of salad greens and paper towels.
Stored properly, your salad greens will last over 10 days.

, If you buy salad greens out of season, they will cost more. Shop at farmers markets whenever possible to save money and get only in-season produce. For instance, try buying winter greens like kale, collards, chard, and rapini during the winter.Additionally, purchasing your salad greens at local farmers markets will keep money in your local community.

Eat a salad.,
Make a smoothie.,
Steam your greens.,
Eat the right volume of salad greens.",How to Choose the Healthiest Salad Greens3," As their name suggests, salad greens are useful for creating salads. You could use your salad greens to create a Caesar salad, a summer salad, or a sweet citrus salad.For instance, make a sweet citrus salad by mixing one cup of kale, one cup of romaine lettuce, one sliced orange, ¼ cup sliced almonds, and one tablespoon poppyseed dressing.
If you choose to add dressing to your salads, ensure it is low in calories and fat. Use a lighter vinaigrette and avoid heavy, creamy dressings like thousand island.Check the nutrition facts label on the dressing bottle to discover the fat and calorie levels.
To keep your salads low in calories and fat, avoid topping them with bacon, cheese, fried chicken, or tuna salad.

, A smoothie is a type of blended drink. Some salad greens taste good in smoothies. For instance, mix two cups of spinach, three ice cubes, one banana, one cup of milk, and three strawberries in a blender on high for about twenty seconds. Pour the smoothie into a cup and drink it.Not all greens are good in smoothies. Kale and spinach are the most common salad greens used in smoothies. Explore other options through experimentation, swapping out recommended greens for others in an equal amount.
You could use frozen or refrigerated salad greens in your smoothies.

, Collards or spinach can be a bit chewy when raw, but when steamed for a few minutes, they soften right up. Place one or two cups of spinach or collards on a steaming tray. Fill a pan with ¼ cup of water and boil it. Place the steaming tray over the pan. Check the salad green you’ve selected for steaming every few minutes to ensure it does not wilt too much.There is no correct way to define how much wilting constitutes “too much.” Some people prefer their salad greens very wilted when they steam them. Others prefer crisper salad greens.
Alternately, you could place a few cups of spinach or kale in a large microwave-safe bowl with four to eight tablespoons of water. Cover the bowl loosely with a paper plate or piece of baking parchment. Microwave the salad greens for about five minutes. Pour out excess water and consume the steamed salad greens.

, According to the USDA, a healthy person will eat two cups of salad greens per day. Of course, if you eat a bit more, there’s nothing wrong with that.Eat a variety of salad greens. If you eat the same salad greens every day, you will get bored of eating them.
To keep your salad-green consumption enjoyable, swap out the greens you eat from time to time.For instance, if you usually eat a salad of kale and romaine lettuce, try a salad of spinach and iceberg lettuce instead.

Consider the person’s mood.,
Analyze the person’s self-esteem.,
Be alert to the person exhibiting guilt or shame.,
Think about whether the person has become withdrawn.,
Note whether the person spends significant time in the bathroom after eating.,
Consider whether the person is secretive about their habits.",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic2," Mood swings can be very common among people with anorexia, because hormones are often imbalanced by the body’s starvation.Anxiety and depression commonly co-occur with eating disorders.People with anorexia may also experience irritability, listlessness, and trouble focusing or concentrating., People with anorexia are often perfectionists. They may be over-achievers, and they often perform very well at school or work.However, they often suffer from very low self-esteem. A person suffering from anorexia may frequently complain that they are not “good enough,” or that they can’t “do anything right.”Physical self-confidence is also usually very low in people with anorexia. Although they may speak about getting to their “ideal weight,” it is impossible for them to attain that because of their distorted view of their body image. There will always be more weight to lose.

, People with anorexia will often feel very ashamed after eating. They may interpret eating as a sign of weakness or a lapse in self-control. If the person you're concerned about frequently expresses guilt over eating, or guilt and shame over their body size, this could be a warning sign of anorexia., People with anorexia may withdraw from their friends and usual activities.They may also begin to spend increasing amounts of time online.People with anorexia may spend time on “pro-Ana” websites, which are groups that promote and support anorexia as a “lifestyle choice.” It is important to remember that anorexia is a life-threatening condition that can be successfully treated, not a healthy choice made by healthy people.
People with anorexia may also post “thinspiration” messages on social media. These types of posts may include pictures of extremely underweight people or messages making fun of people who are a normal weight or overweight.

, There are two types of anorexia nervosa: Binge-Eating/Purging Type and Restricting Type. The restricting type is the one most people are familiar with, but the binge-eating/purging type is also common.Purging can be in the form of induced vomiting after eating, or the person may use laxatives, enemas, or diuretics.


There is a difference between binge-eating/purging type anorexia and bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder. People suffering from bulimia nervosa do not always restrict calories when they aren’t binge-eating. People suffering from binge-eating/purging type anorexia will severely restrict calories when they are not binge-eating and purging.
People suffering from bulimia nervosa will often binge-eat huge quantities of food before purging.People with binge-eating/purging type anorexia may consider much smaller quantities of food a “binge” that requires purging, such as a single cookie or small bag of chips., People with anorexia may be ashamed of their disorder. Or they may believe that you just don’t “understand” their eating behaviors and would try to keep them from performing them. People with anorexia will often try to conceal their behaviors from others to avoid judgment or interference.For example, they may:


Eat in secret
Hide or throw away food
Take diet pills or supplements
Hide laxatives
Lie about how much they exercise

Learn about eating disorders.,
Understand the real risks of anorexia.,
Find an appropriate time to talk with the person in private.,
Use “I” statements to convey your feelings.,
Avoid blaming language.,
Encourage the person to share his/her feelings with you.,
Suggest the person take an online screening test.,
Emphasize the need for professional help.,
Seek support for yourself.",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic3," It can be easy to judge people suffering from an eating disorder. It can be difficult to understand why someone is doing such unhealthy things to his or her body. Learning about what causes eating disorders and what the people suffering from them experience will help you approach a possible sufferer with empathy and care.



Talking to Eating Disorders: Simple Ways to Support Someone with Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge Eating, or Body Image Issues, by Jeanne Albronda Heaton and Claudia J. Strauss, is a highly recommended resource.
The National Eating Disorders Association is a non-profit organization that provides extensive resources for friends and families of those affected by eating disorders.The Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness is a non-profit organization aimed at providing education and resources to heighten awareness of eating disorders and their impacts.The National Institute of Mental Health has a variety of excellent information and resources for individuals with eating disorders and their loved ones., Anorexia starves the body, and can result in serious health conditions. In females between 15-24, anorexia nervosa causes 12 times more deaths than any other cause.In up to 20% of cases, anorexia will cause early death. It can cause a variety of medical issues, including:Lack of menstruation in females
Lethargy and exhaustion
Inability to regulate body temperature
Abnormally slow or irregular heartbeat (due to weakened heart muscles)
Anemia
Infertility
Memory loss or disorientation
Organ failure
Brain damage

, Eating disorders are often a reaction to more complicated personal and social issues. They may also have genetic factors at work. Talking about your eating disorder with others can be an intensely embarrassing or uncomfortable topic. Make sure you approach your loved one in a safe, private environment.Avoid approaching the person if either of you is feeling angry, tired, stressed, or unusually emotional. This will make communicating your care for the person much more difficult., Using “I”-statements can help the other person feel less like you are attacking him/her. Frame the discussion as safe and in the other person’s control. For example, you could say something like “I’ve noticed some things lately that worry me. I care about you. Could we talk?”


The person may become defensive. S/he may deny having a problem. S/he may accuse you of meddling in his/her life, or harshly judging them. You can reassure them that you care about him or her and would never judge, but don’t get defensive.
For example, avoid saying things like “I’m just trying to help you” or “You need to listen to me.” These statements will make the other person feel attacked and encourage them to stop listening to you.
Instead, keep the focus on positive statements: “I'm concerned about you and I want you to know that I’m here for you” or “I am ready to talk whenever you feel ready.” Give the other person room to make his/her own choices.

, Using “I” statements will help you with this. However, it’s very important that you do not use other blaming or judgmental language. Exaggerations, “guilt trips,” threats, or accusations will not help the other person understand your true concern.For example, avoid “you” statements, such as “You’re making me worried” or “You’ve got to stop this.”
Statements that play on the other person’s sense of shame or guilt are also unproductive. For example, avoid saying things like “Think about what you’re doing to your family” or “If you really cared about me you’d take care of yourself.” People with anorexia may already feel an intense sense of shame about their behavior, and saying things like this could only make the disorder worse.
Don’t threaten the person. For example, avoid statements such as “You will be grounded if you don’t eat better” or “I’ll tell everyone about your problem if you don’t agree to get help.” These will cause significant distress and can make the eating disorder worse.

, It’s important to give the other person time to share how s/he is feeling too. Conversations that are one-sided and all about you are unlikely to be productive.Don’t rush anyone through this type of conversation. It can take time to process feelings and thoughts.
Reiterate that you do not judge or criticize your their feelings.

, The National Eating Disorders Association (ensure the any advice supplied applies in the nation you live in) has an online screening tool that is free and anonymous. Asking someone to take this test may be a “low-pressure” way to encourage them to acknowledge their problem.There are two screenings available through NEDA: one specifically for college students, and one for adults.

, Try to communicate your concern in productive ways. Emphasize that anorexia is a serious condition but is highly treatable under professional supervision.Destigmatize the idea of seeing a therapist or counselor by letting them know that seeking help is not a sign of failure or weakness, nor a sign that they are “crazy.”


People with anorexia are often struggling to find control in their lives, so emphasizing that seeking therapy is an act of courage and control over one’s life may help them accept it.
You can frame this as a medical issue, which may help. For example, if your loved one or someone you know had diabetes or cancer, you would encourage her/him to seek medical help. This is no different; you are simply asking them to seek professional help for an illness.
NEDA has a “Find Treatment” feature available on their website. This feature can help you find a counselor or therapist who specializes in anorexia.Particularly if the person is a young person or teenager, family therapy may be helpful. Some studies suggest that family-based therapy is more effective for teens than individual therapy, because it can help address ineffective communication patterns within the family as well as offer ways for everyone to support the sufferer.In some severe cases, inpatient treatment may be required. This is common when the person is so underweight that they are at a high risk of things such as organ failure. People who are psychiatrically unstable or suicidal may also require inpatient treatment., It is hard to cope with seeing a loved one struggle with an eating disorder. It can be particularly difficult if the person you're concerned about refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists, which is all too common with sufferers of eating disorders. Seeking help from your own therapist or a support group can help you stay strong.


NEDA has a list of support groups on their website.They also have a Parent, Family & Friends Network.The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) has a list of support groups by state.Your physician may also be able to refer you to local support groups or other support resources.
Seeking counseling is particularly important for parents of children with anorexia. It is important not to control a child’s eating behaviours or use bribes, but it’s hard to accept that when you see any child at risk. Therapy or a support group can help you learn ways to support and help a child without making his/her disorder worse.

Validate your loved one’s feelings, struggles, and accomplishments.,
Be flexible and adaptable.,
Focus on fun and positivity.,
Remind the other person that s/he is not alone.,
Help your loved one handle triggers.",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic4," With treatment, about 60% of people with eating disorders recover.However, it can take years to see full recovery. Some people may always suffer from feelings of discomfort with their bodies or compulsions to starve or binge, even though they manage to avoid damaging behaviors. Support your loved one through this process.Celebrate even small successes. For someone with anorexia, even eating what seems like a small quantity of food to you may represent a huge struggle for her/him.
Don’t judge relapses. Ensure that your loved one gets adequate care, but don’t judge him/her for struggles or stumbles. Acknowledge the relapse, then focus on how to get back on track.

, In some cases, particularly those involving young people, treatment may incorporate changes to routines by friends and family. Be ready to make changes that are necessary for your loved one’s recovery.


For example, the therapist may recommend that certain ways of communication or certain ways of handling conflict change.
It can be hard to acknowledge that something you do or say could be affecting your loved one’s disorder. Remember: you didn’t cause the disorder, but you may be able to help your loved one recover from it by changing some things about your behavior. Healthy recovery is the ultimate goal.

, It can be easy to slip into a “support” mode that can feel smothering to a person struggling with an eating disorder. Remember that a person struggling with anorexia already spends a great deal of his/her time thinking about food, weight, and body image. Don’t let the disorder be the only thing you talk about or focus on.


For example, go out to the movies, go shopping, play games or sports. Treat the other person with kindness and care, but let him or her enjoy life in as normal a way as possible.
Remember, people with eating disorders are not their disorder. They are people with needs, thoughts, and feelings.

, Struggling with eating disorders can feel intensely isolating. While you don’t want to smother your loved one, reminding him/her that you’re there to talk or be supportive can help with recovery.


Find support groups or other support activities for your loved one to join. Don’t force her or him to join them, but make the options available.

, Your loved one may find certain people, situations, or things “triggering” to his/her disorder. For example, having ice cream around may pose an impossible temptation. Going out to eat may cause anxiety over food. Be as supportive as possible. It can take some time to discover triggers, and they may come as a surprise even to the person with the disorder.Past experiences and emotions may also trigger unhealthy behavior.
Stressful or new experiences or situations may also act as triggers. Many people who suffer from anorexia are desperate to feel in control, and situations that make them feel uncertain may trigger the need to perform unhealthy eating behaviors.

You may want your sister to know but you may feel less comfortable with your younger brother knowing.Consider who will support you and help you with your eating disorder.

, It may take some time for your family to recognize what you are saying or to let it “sink in.” Your family may act shocked, surprised, uncomfortable, or worried.Remind yourself that it’s okay for them to have their own reactions. It may take a few minutes, hours, or days for the shock to wear off.


Some people may not think an eating disorder is a “big deal”, or may shrug it off. Communicate the seriousness of having an eating disorder and how it physically and emotionally affects you.
Prepare yourself for different outcomes, and remember that each person will respond in his or her own way. These reactions have nothing to do with you, they are just how your family is processing the information.
You are responsible for your own thoughts, feelings, and actions. You are not responsible for other people behave or react.

, If your family is unfamiliar with eating disorders and the harm they can cause, look up some resources ahead of time that you can share with them.Your family may want to learn more about eating disorders, or you may want to rely on some information to share with them if you’re unsure of how to explain eating disorders to them. Look up some resources ahead of time and share them with your family. Once your family is educated about eating disorders, they will be more prepared to help you.


If you give resources to your family, this allows them to take in the information and process it at their own speed.
Check out some websites such as http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml and http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org.

, If you choose to tell your family in person, arrange a time and a place to talk. Choose a time when people are available and not rushing off to other activities. Pick a place that you can comfortably talk and where there will be minimal or no interruptions.You may choose to have the discussion in your home, in your backyard, or on a walk outside.

, If you’re worried about telling your family on your own, ask a friend to come and support you. You may ask a friend you’ve already told to come and sit with you, or encourage you to keep talking. If you’re scared of telling your family alone, having a supportive friend can help., You’ll need to find a way to open the discussion about your eating disorder. Making the first statement may be the hardest part of the whole discussion. Once your family is present, start with saying something general. You may wish to ask for their support up front before you talk about your eating disorder.


Say, “Thanks for making time for me. This is something that’s hard to talk about, so I hope you’ll be supportive. I’m really struggling to balance my health, and I think I have an eating disorder.”

, Eating disorders are not just about overeating or undereating. Complex emotions are involved and are responsible for some of your actions regarding food. Share the feelings you have about food, your body, or having an eating disorder.You may say, “Having these health problems makes me feel scared and alone” or, “I’ve felt isolated and embarrassed dealing with this on my own.”

, Your family may not know much about eating disorders and they may need your help to learn.

Feeling shame, guilt, and disgust about yourself and your eating habits
Denial about the harm the disorder causes your body or that you have a problem
Obsession with food, body weight, and calorie counting
Chewing and spitting out food or vomiting food

, You may need to educate your family on any myths they may believe about eating disorders that are not true, especially for you. Some people assume that only very thin, young women have eating disorders. Others may think that people with eating disorders are vain or self-obsessed. If need be, address these issues with your family and educate them about the myths.It’s important that your family sees the eating disorder as serious and not a “phase.”

, You may want to find a therapist or to seek medical help. Ask your family for help in reaching out for treatment. You may not know where to start or what you need. Ask your family to help you get on a healthy track. You may ask for their help in finding a therapist, getting treatment in a residential setting, seeing a medical doctor or getting nutritional counseling. If you need help, don’t be afraid to ask for it.Say, “I’m struggling to deal with this on my own, and I need help. I’d like to get professional treatment for support and guidance. Would you help me?”

, It can be helpful to tell your family directly how you’d like them to support you. Some families may not get involved at all while others may become overly involved in your care. Clearly tell your family how you’d like to be supported and what that support looks like.


If you want help with meal planning or keeping track of binging habits, say this to your family. Let them know what you do and do not want help with in managing your eating disorder.

, Tell your family that eating disorders often result from a desire to be in control. If you feel out of control of your life, it’s not helpful for someone to swoop in and take control for you. Ask your family not to force you to eat, or trick you into doing something you don’t want to do. Let your family know if you are sensitive to criticism about your eating, and ask them not to criticize your habits.Tell them specifically what you want control over. For example, you may tell your family that you’d like control over breakfast foods or snacks throughout the day. Remind them that engaging in a power struggle is not helpful for you.

, Let your family know you do not want to talk about appearance. While well-intentioned, even compliments can be a trigger for self-criticism. Comments regarding weight or appearance can set you off on negative thoughts regarding your body.Say, “I don’t find comments about weight or appearance helpful to my recovery. I would appreciate it if your focus on me excluded these things. I would, however, appreciate any helpful encouragement you have.”

, It’s not helpful when family members say, “Just eat something!” or, “If you’d just eat, you wouldn’t have any problems!” Let your family know you don’t find this helpful. Instead, ask them to provide you with helpful encouragement.Ask them to say things like, “I’ve noticed you’ve been working hard to get on track lately” and, “You’ve been taking care of your health well.”

Try brown rice.,
Cook up wild rice.,
Look for black rice.,
Try sprouted rice.,
Buy Bhutanese red rice.,
Always go for whole grains.,

Add extra nutrition to your rice.,
Ask for your rice options at restaurants.",How to Choose the Healthiest Rice," Brown rice is probably the most common and well known nutritious types of rice. It's a 100% whole grain and has a whole host of nutrients and health benefits, including potentially lowering cholesterol levels, associated with it. If you're looking for a nutritious rice, try this chewy and nutty version.


Brown rice is actually the same grain as white rice, just less processed. More of the kernel is removed to make white rice, which can cause the loss of nutritional value including around 90% of the vitamin B6, 50% of the manganese and phosphorus, more than half the iron, and all dietary fiber and essential fatty acids.Each one of these parts has it's own set of nutrients.
Brown rice is considered a fairly nutrient dense food. For only 1 cup, its about 200 calories total.
In addition, per cup, brown rice has 4 g of fiber, 24 g of protein and 88% of your daily needs for manganese. It's also high in phosphorus, selenium, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin and Vitamin B6.;
, Another extremely nutritious rice to consider is wild rice. Although technically not an actual rice per say (it's a water grass seed), wild rice has even more nutrients and antioxidants than your more commonly found brown rice.Wild rice was originally grown and farmed in the United States by Native Americans. Although this is a grass seed, wild rice is still considered a 100% whole grain.
Wild rice has fewer calories than brown rice - about 160 calories per cup compared to 200 calories - and also contains 3 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein.This grain also contains high amounts of folate, zinc, copper, manganese and choline.
Studies have shown that consumption of wild rice may help lower unhealthy triglyceride and cholesterol levels., Black rice or forbidden rice is a much more unique and exotic form of rice. It's nice black color is beautiful to look at but also is the source of a variety of antioxidants and vitamins.


What makes black rice black in color are antioxidants called anthocyanins (the same ones found in blueberries and blackberries). These cancer-fighting compounds are found in exceptionally high quantities in the hull or outside of black rice.Black rice is particularly high in Vitamin E which helps protect and support your immune system and also helps protect your body's cells from damage by free radicals.
Black rice also contains about 160 calories per cup with slightly more fiber when compared to brown rice, as well as high levels of protein and B Vitamins., Sprouted grains and grain products are 100% whole grains and have become more popular lately due to the health benefits they contain. Sprouting rice makes it nutritionally superior to other forms of rice - even brown rice.When you're sprouting rice, you're allowing the seed to germinate and get ready for growth in a new plant. As the seeds continue to get ready to grow, certain enzymes are deactivated which makes all the nutrients of the grain more available to your body.
Sprouted rice has higher amounts of Vitamin C, folate, iron, protein and fiber. Some studies have shown that sprouted rice is slightly lower in carbohydrates compared to those that are not sprouted.If you cannot find sprouted brown rice near you, try making your own sprouted rice at home. Keep brown rice grains in a moist environment for at least 3 days until the hull just cracks open.

, A little less common, this red rice is another very nutritious type of rice. In addition to being high in a variety of nutrients, this rice is great because it take about 20 minutes to cook.Bhutanese red rice is native to the Himalayas. The nutrient content of the soil is why this particular rice is also high in a variety of nutrients as well.
Like black rice, Bhutanese red rice also contains anthocyanins in the hull. Due to these antioxidants both red and black rice have 10 times the amount of antioxidants than brown rice.
This particular type of rice is also high in protein and fiber but has 20% of your daily needs magnesium, phosphorus, and molybdenum.

, Not all rice varieties sold in supermarkets are considered a whole grain. Whenever you're looking to purchase a healthy and nutritious rice, you want to choose a rice that's also a whole grain.


It's important to find a rice that's considered a whole grain because those versions of rice have more nutrients and are considered more nutrient dense. Whole grains are less processed than refined grains leaving all those beneficial nutrients intact.
100% whole grains are typically higher in fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals compared to refined grains. If you're going for some rice, always choose 100% whole grains for this reason.Try to limit or avoid white rices. It doesn't matter if it's basmati rice, long grain rice or sushi rice, if it's any type of white rice, it's lower in nutrients.

, When you're shopping for rice at the supermarket, you'll see there are a whole bunch of varieties available. Although this is great for consumers, it can get overwhelming when you're trying to find a nutritious and healthy rice to serve at home.


One of the best bets, is to go with a box or bag of plain whole grain rice. These may be found in bulk or bulk bags at your grocery store. They have no additives or seasonings at all.
Beware of rice mixes or rice dishes. Although they may look like a good deal, these may have a significant amount of added salt to them. It's best to buy your own plain rice and add seasonings at home.
If you do buy a boxed rice blend or seasoned rice mix, read the label to see what's in it. Look to make sure its 100% whole grain rice (brown rice, wild rice or brown basmati rice) and that the seasonings included fit into your eating plan.

, One downside of rice, especially the nutritious whole grain rice, is that they can take a long time to cook. That nutritious outer hull lengthens the cooking time (to 45-60 minutes total) compared to the more processed white rices.If you want to include some of these nutritious whole grain rices to your meals, consider looking in your freezer section. You might be surprised to find bags of frozen, pre cooked whole grain rice. A quick microwave and your nutritious rice is ready to go.
You may also want to look for the par-cooked or ""microwavable"" rice you see in the grain aisle of the store. These are almost all the way cooked and are just as nutritious as cooking them from scratch yourself. A few minutes in the microwave and it's ready to go.
If you have time and enjoy cooking, consider making larger batches of your favorite whole grain rice on the weekends. You can portion out individual servings and freeze them for a quick dinner time side during the week.

, Another option you might want to look for is organic rice. Although the nutrient content is the same compared to conventionally grown rice, there are some benefits of choosing organic.When you're grocery shopping, look for rices or rice mixtures that are labeled 100% organic. This means that they abide by the USDA organic labeling laws and none of the ingredients (if you buy a rice blend) are conventional.
Farmers do use a variety of pesticides on rice plants. Purchasing organic rice will allow you to avoid pesticides and any residual residue that's left on the rice grains themselves.
Note that the nutritional value of the rice remains the same regardless of whether or not you choose an organic variety.

, Portion sizes are a very important part of an overall nutritious and balanced diet. If you're going out of the way to choose a nutritious grain, make sure you incorporate it into your diet in a healthy manner.


Choosing a more nutritious food, like a whole grain rice, is a great start to a healthy diet. However, if you eat larger portions of even these healthier foods, you may still be consuming too many calories for your body.
Since grains are a carbohydrate rich group, it's important to measure the appropriate portion size. Make sure you're measuring the appropriate portion size of your whole grain rice. Go for 1/2 cup of cooked whole grain rice per serving.In addition, you want to incorporate them in the right amounts. It's not a good idea to eat several servings of grains each day. Go for 2-3 servings of whole grains everyday. The rest of your day should be divided up with lean protein, fruits and vegetables.

, Although brown rice, wild rice or even sprouted rice are all wonderful sources of a variety of nutrients, you should consider trying some other whole grains as well.


One aspect that's important to a healthy diet is variety. Even if you eat nutritious foods each day, if you have a very limited and unvaried diet, you're missing out on the nutrients that are available from other foods.In addition to whole grain rice, try other whole grain foods like: millet, farro, quinoa, teff, amaranth, oats or whole grain wheat.
For example, you could have a bowl of whole grain oatmeal for breakfast, a sandwich made with whole wheat bread for lunch and serve your favorite chicken and vegetable stir fry with sprouted brown rice for dinner.

, Although there aren't too many different cooking methods for rice and other grains, it's still important to make sure that you're using healthy cooking techniques.


Although whole grain rice does come with many health benefits it wouldn't make sense to cook it with a lot of added fat, sugar or sodium.
For basic cooking, boil rices in water or even low sodium or homemade broth. These methods add very little extra fat or sodium. Broth in particular is a great way to impart a lot of good flavor.
If you're making a rice dish, be careful of what you add to it as well. For example, instead of tossing butter with your steamed rice, go for a drizzle of olive oil for a heart healthy source of fat., To really boost the overall nutrition content of your whole grain rice is by serving it with other nutrient dense foods. Together, these foods can provide you with a whole host of beneficial nutrients.


Serve your whole grain rice with some sort of lean protein. These foods are naturally lower in calories and fat. Include a 3-4 oz serving of a lean protein like chicken, turkey, lean beef, tofu, seafood or beans.Also serve your whole grain rice with a serving or two of vegetables. These foods are also nutrient-rich, with naturally low calories and fat. However, they're also high in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. Add in a cup or two of your favorite vegetables to round out your meal., When you go out to eat, be sure to ask about rice options. Opt for the healthiest rice choice available, whether that be steamed rather than fried rice, brown rather than white rice, or some other option.

If a restaurant cannot provide you with healthy rice choices, ask about nutritious substitutes such as a side or a bed of steamed vegetables.

Refrain from trying to control the other person’s behavior.,
Avoid commenting on the other person’s behavior and appearance.,
Avoid “fat-shaming” or “skinny-shaming.” The healthy body weight for each person may differ.,
Avoid simplifying the matter.,
Avoid perfectionistic tendencies.,
Do not promise to “keep it a secret.” It may be tempting to agree to keep your loved one’s disorder a secret in order to gain his/her trust.",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic5," Do not try to force the other person to eat. Don’t bribe your loved one to eat more, or use threats to compel behavior. Sometimes, anorexia is a response to a lack of feeling control over one’s own life. Engaging in a power struggle or taking control away from your loved one may only make the problem worse.Don’t try to “fix” your loved one’s problem. Recovery is as complex as the eating disorder. Trying to “fix” your loved one on your own may do more harm than good. Encourage him/her to see a mental health professional, instead.

, Anorexia often involves a great deal of shame and embarrassment for the person suffering from it. Even if well-meaning, commenting on your loved one’s appearance, eating habits, weight, etc., can trigger his/her feelings of shame and disgust.


Compliments are also unhelpful. Because the person is dealing with a distorted body image, s/he is unlikely to believe you. S/he may interpret even positive comments as judgment or manipulation., If your loved one comments that s/he feels “fat,” it’s important not to respond by saying things like, “You’re not fat.” This only reinforces the unhealthy idea that “fat” is something innately bad that should be feared and avoided.Similarly, do not point out thin people and comment on their appearance, such as “Nobody wants to hug a bony person.” You want your loved one to develop a healthy body image, not focus on fearing or diminishing one particular type of body.
Instead, ask your loved one where those feelings are coming from. Ask what s/he thinks s/he would gain by being thin, or what s/he fears about feeling overweight.

, Anorexia and other eating disorders are highly complex and often co-occur with other illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. Peer and media pressure may play a role, as may family and social situations. Saying things such as “If you would just eat more, things would be fine” ignore the complexity of the issue your loved one is struggling with.


Instead, offer your support with “I”-statements: “I realize this is a tough time for you” or “Eating differently can be hard, and I believe in you.”

, The struggle to be “perfect” is a common factor in triggering anorexia. However, perfectionism is an unhealthy way of thinking that hampers your ability to adapt and be flexible, a crucial part of success in life.It holds you and others to an impossible, unrealistic, and ever-shifting standard.Do not expect perfection from your loved one or yourself. Recovering from an eating disorder may take a long time, and both of you will have times when you act in a way that you regret.


Acknowledge when one of you slips up, but don’t focus on it or beat yourself up for it. Instead, focus on what you can do going forward to avoid similar mistakes.

, However, you do not want to help promote your loved one’s behavior. Anorexia may cause early death in up to 20% of its sufferers.It’s important to encourage your loved one to get help.


Understand that your loved one may initially be angry with you or even reject you for suggesting s/he needs help. This is common. Just continue to be there for your loved one and let him/her know that you support and care for him/her.

Eating disorders are life-threatening and, while teachers, friends, and loved ones all care for you and are well-meaning, it is essential you speak to a professional who can get you help and that you can trust.


If you are in junior high or high school, talk to the school counselor. If your school doesn't have one, speak with the nurse about what you're going through.
If you are in college, there may be counselors available on campus to speak with. You may also have access to a health center with a medical doctor on staff. Many larger universities do, especially if they offer a wide range of studies, which include nursing and medical school.
If you are an adult, search for a mental health professional who specializes in eating disorders. Try using this website or this one to begin your search if you live in the US. Outpatient therapy is also a good place to start when beginning the road to recovery, and can help address the emotional needs that accompany eating disorders.Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are beneficial therapeutic practices when treating eating disorders.These approaches help you challenge your thoughts and feelings, which are crucial to examine in eating disorders.
Family therapy is often a strong component in treating eating disorders.Families may need a better understanding of eating disorders and how to relate to a family member with an eating disorder in an understanding way. Sometimes, family dynamics may make an eating disorder worse.
Many people have been treated successfully for eating disorders and no longer suffer emotionally. They end up living happy, peaceful, and fulfilling lives.;
, Eating disorders, particularly anorexia, can cause significant harm to your body and can even lead to death.Take your health seriously. Receive a full medical evaluation from your medical practitioner and determine the state of your health. An evaluation can reveal any underlying health problems that you may be suffering due to your eating disorder, such as osteoporosis, abnormally slow heartbeat, severe dehydration/kidney failure, gastric rupture, or peptic ulcers.By taking care of your body, you can begin to nourish yourself and build a better relationship between your mind, body, and emotions.
Be sure to follow up with your medical professional regularly throughout your recovery.
If you have bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder, your doctor may prescribe fluoxetine (Prozac) to help reduce binge episodes.Mortality rates in people who do not treat their eating disorders is high.In order to give yourself the best chance at a long and healthy life, seek medical and psychological treatment.

, If you suffer from depression or anxiety or any other mental health disorder, make sure these issues are being addressed with therapy, and/or medication.Therapy will teach you the coping skills you need to get healthy and deal with the stressors of life. If you are feeling anxious or depressed, you may be more at risk to jump back to disordered eating habits, so it is essential you work on these skills.


Many people who suffer from eating disorders have a history of trauma, including neglect in childhood, bullying, physical abuse, or sexual abuse that has led to low self-worth.It’s important to talk about these feelings and resolve these traumas through working with a therapist.

, Surround yourself with people who love and support you. Keep the people that want you to be happy and healthy. Stay away from people who encourage disordered eating habits or make you feel bad about your body.You may need to find different friends or friend groups to help you avoid triggers. Surround yourself with people who want to love and support you, not bring you down. Ignore any judgments from anyone.

, Long-term inpatient treatment is good for individuals who cannot manage their psychological and/or medical symptoms on their own and need more intense care.Inpatient treatment means going to a specialized eating disorder center to receive more acute medical and psychological care. Residential treatment is for people more medically stable and often focuses more on psychological treatment with medical support. Many places also work with dietitians and help plan or provide food options.If you feel like you need more support than weekly therapy, or are struggling significantly with medical and psychological symptoms, seek inpatient or residential care.

, While eating disorders can vary from one person to another, some symptoms are similar across all eating disorders. Most people with disordered eating are overly concerned with their body, weight, and appearance. Emotional symptoms include:Preoccupation with food and counting calories
Fears of certain foods, like those containing fat
Intense fear of gaining weight or of being “fat”
Perception and self-esteem based in body perception
Avoiding situations involving food
Frequently weighing oneself
Denial of eating problems or weight loss
Withdrawal from friends

, It can be hard to determine what is healthy and unhealthy weight loss for each person. If weight loss and negative feelings about your body preoccupy your thoughts, you are not and will not be happy with your appearance, and you think you are fat regardless of how much weight you lose, you may be at risk for anorexia.Anorexia is a serious medical condition that people have died from. Some symptoms of anorexia include:Extreme food restriction
Extreme thinness, emaciation
Inability to maintain a healthy weight, pursuit of being thinner and thinner
Loss of menstruation in women and girls
Dry, yellowish skin and brittle hair
Low blood pressure

, Bulimia is characterized by eating large quantities of food (bingeing) and then preventing weight gain by vomiting, using laxatives or other pills or exercising excessively.Most individuals suffering from bulimia tend to be of average weight or sometimes slightly heavier. Symptoms of bulimia include:Eating large amounts of food at one time
Feeling out of control while eating
Eating when you feel full
Eating until you feel sick
Finding comfort in food after feeling sad or lonely
Immediately vomiting or taking laxatives or exercising after eating
Bingeing and/or purging in secret
Having worn tooth enamel
Sore or swollen throat

, Binge eating, also called compulsive overeating, occurs when a person eats an excessive amount of food, but does not take any actions afterward to lose weight.When bingeing, you may feel a loss of control or a depersonalization when eating. Binge eaters tend to be overweight or obese. The bingeing behavior tends to result in feelings of shame and embarrassment, which can lead to more bingeing., You may be triggered by looking at images of skinny women, browsing pro-ana websites, preparing for swimsuit season, or dealing with stress around exams or anniversaries of a painful event. Be aware of when you feel vulnerable to revert back to disordered eating.Once you identify your triggers, have a plan for how to handle them. You may want to call your sister or best friend, say a prayer, or call a therapist.
Your therapist can help you learn healthy ways to cope when you are triggered.

, Dieting can be like telling a child not to play with a fun toy: once it’s out of reach, it becomes more desirable. This can be true for eating disorders, too. Once certain foods are off limits, they may become more tempting, and if you eat them, you perpetuate guilt and shame. Dieting can provoke cravings and compulsive eating.Work with a dietitian to help you get back on track to healthy eating.
You may choose to engage in being vegetarian or vegan, but assess your motivations. If choosing to be vegan is a way to restrict your food instead of a purely health-related or moral choice, reconsider this lifestyle.Allow yourself the occasional treat. If you enjoy brownies or cheeseburgers, allow yourself to have one occasionally.Food is meant to nourish us and also to enjoy. It's important to eat foods you like and enjoy.

, If you excessively exercise, consider cutting down on your exercise habits.Exercise is healthy for you, as is food, but both are good in healthy, balanced amounts. Too much or too little can be damaging to your body.


Reducing exercise doesn’t mean cutting it out completely, but you may want to take a temporary break for a bit to help your body reset if you’ve been putting a lot of stress on it. Consult with a medical professional when you’re ready to change your exercise habits.
Let exercise be something you do to honor and love your body, not break it down or make it lose weight.

, Stop engaging in talk that puts down your body or other people’s bodies.This includes commenting on celebrities’ bodies, too. Train yourself to get out of the mindset of putting yourself and others’ appearance down. And don’t let people around you talk negatively about their bodies, either.


List the positive qualities of your body. They don’t need to be connected with your weight; maybe you appreciate your curly hair or the color of your eyes, or the fact that you have an outie belly button. You have beautiful parts of your body that get neglected when you focus only on what you perceive as ugly.
It might be hard to receive a compliment without finding a way to put yourself down, but smile and say: “Thank you.”
If you hear other people talking negatively about their bodies, remind them that it’s important to treat yourself and others kindly.
Avoid situations that encourage fat shaming, whether related to media, friends, or in magazines.

, Instead of focusing on the negative associations with food, pay attention to the act of eating. Spend time practicing awareness when you eat. Create time to eat and sit down. Give thanks for the food in front of you. Take a moment before eating to visually enjoy your food: look at the colors, textures, and arrangement. Smell your food and notice your mouth salivating. When you are ready to eat, chew slowly and enjoy the tastes, textures, and smells.When you eat, be present with the experience. Turn off the TV and remove other distractions. Set down your fork between bites, and try to concentrate on the smell, texture, taste, temperature, even the sounds of the food you are consuming.If your mind wanders, that's okay, just try to guide it gently back to the present moment.
Mindful eating involves making a conscious choice to eat and to determine what you eat.When struggling with mindful eating, tell yourself, ""I will eat my breakfast to nourish my body because I love myself.""
When struggling with previously avoided foods, tell yourself, ""I am making the choice to eat this brownie for dessert because I enjoy it.""

, You may not even realize how many negative thoughts go through your mind. When you become conscious of your negative thoughts, stop and observe them. Then, engage with the thought.


Ask if the thought is based in reality (Is there any fact or is this just an interpretation?).
Look for alternate explanations (Is there a more positive way to approach this? Can there be other meanings?).
Put the thought into perspective (Is it possible you are catastrophizing the situation, or expecting the worst? Will it matter in two years?).
Use goal-oriented thinking (Is there a way to approach this situation that helps me achieve my goals? Is there something I can learn from this?).If you have the thought: “I am fat and nobody likes me”, observe the thought and begin challenging. You might ask yourself: ""Is it true that nobody likes me? No, I have my best friend and my dog, and I know they love me."" Or: ""Am I actually fat? I only weight 110 pounds and I'm 5'8"", and that's underweight. Also, my friends tell me I'm too thin. Even if I was fat, I am still lovable and loving.""

, If you have disordered eating, you are in the habit of ignoring your body's signals. You must learn to focus on listening closely to your body. Let your body communicate when it is hungry, and then listen to it. When your body has had enough food, it will feel content. Not bloated or in pain, but content.The same is true for exercise: your body will give you signs that it has had enough activity such as feeling tired or exhausted. The key here is learning moderation.


Your body will tell you when to eat and when to stop eating, when it wants exercise and when it’s had enough exercise. Learn to trust your body’s messages, and most importantly, listen to them. Trust your body’s innate ability to communicate these messages to you.If you overate or engaged in binge eating in the past, learn to listen closely to your body and any signals it has for you to denote hunger and satiation.

, Do you reach for food when you feel happy, stressed, or sad? Or do you punish yourself for your emotions by restricting food? Some people run away from their unpleasant emotions by taking out those emotions on food. Challenge yourself to face your emotions and allow yourself to actually feel them. Recognize that eating disorders have more to do with avoiding unpleasant emotions than with food.Refusing to eat is one way to practice self-control, while binge eating may be a way to comfort yourself in distress or sadness and purging may be a way you punish yourself.


Think about what feelings drive your eating habits, and remember that “fat” isn’t a feeling. You may struggle with self-worth and self-esteem problems. When your attention turns to food, what happened right before? Were you focused on a perceived shortcoming, loneliness, or sadness? Figure out what emotions drive your disordered eating., Once you figure out what emotions you struggle to acknowledge, find ways to cope with those emotions and ways to cope with stressors when they arise. Not everybody copes in the same way, so it may take some time to figure out what helps you work through your problems. Try different techniques and discover which ones work best for you. Some techniques to try include:Calling a friend or family member
Listening to music
Playing with a pet
Reading a book
Taking a walk
Writing
Going outside

, Learn to cope with the struggles of everyday in ways that are not related to food. Engaging in activities each day that help you manage stress keeps stress from becoming overwhelming.By making stress management a part of every day, you can address stress as it occurs instead of letting it build up.


Practice light yoga, meditation, and relaxation exercises.
Try progressive muscle relaxation. Lie down and relax your body, breathing more and more deeply as you relax. Starting with your right fist, tense the muscles, then relax. Then move to your right forearm and then to your upper arm, tensing then relaxing. Move through your right arm, then left arm, face, neck, back, chest, hips, and each leg and foot. You should feel very relaxed throughout your entire body, not carrying any tension in your muscles. , Eating disorders are active protests in denying the needs of your emotions and your body. Learning to accept yourself as you are may be a painful and long-term process. Accept who you are on all levels: body, mind, spirit, and emotions.


Make a list of your positive qualities. You might be intelligent, creative, artistic, a math whiz, kind, caring, and compassionate.You have beautiful things to add to the world; acknowledge them!
Combat negative thoughts about appearance with statements about who you are as a whole. When you find yourself critical of your appearance, transition your focus to things that make you feel valuable that are outside of your looks. These can include your kindness, generosity, intelligence, and skills. Remind yourself that your value is not your appearance, but who you are.

, A big part of eating disorders is taking control over your body’s natural processes by imposing control over them. Allow yourself to release the control of your mind and begin to trust yourself.You may have created food rules (“I don’t eat red foods” or “I can’t eat food high in carbs like bagels”), but allow yourself to challenge your own rules. Start slow, and stay present.


Reflect on what it felt like to break a “rule”. Did you feel anxious before? What about during? How do you feel afterward? How did your body respond? Learn to improve the relationship you have with food, and begin to enjoy the process instead of dread it.

Look in the fruit and vegetable section.,
Look in the snack area.,
Look in the candy section.,
Go to the dairy or refrigerated section.,
Check out the baked goods.",How to Choose Healthy Snacks from the Supermarket," Everything there is a potential snack but the best quick snack ideas include:



Fruit, especially if it is easy to peel or wash
Pre-cut packages of fruit or vegetable pieces, such as baby carrots, celery sticks, and apple slices

Sprouts and crunchy small greens such as snow peas and beans.;
, Here things get a little harder because most snacks are full of sugar, fat, and salt. However, there are some things that you can find amid it all. Look for:


Unflavored, unbuttered popcorn


Pretzels, especially salt-reduced and definitely just the plain flavor
Rice cakes
Raw nuts and seeds (sunflower seeds, pepita seeds) - just beware that the fat content of many nuts means you can't munch them in huge quantities.

, Snacks here? Not really but if you must eat from this area, go for the dark chocolate with low or no levels of sugar. And marshmallows and jelly beans are probably okay in very small quantities on the odd occasion. Chewing gum can help to clean your teeth without adding calories or too much sugar. Remember that no candy has nutritional value, so you're aiming for low calories if you do indulge in them.


Some modified candies might be all right but what they're modified with could be just as unhealthy as the sugar they're replacing. Be very suspicious of diet product additives.

Dried fruit might be a fair exchange for candies. It's still high in sugars though, so don't have too much.

, Snacks here include small quality cheeses, real cheese cheese-sticks, yogurt (unflavored), dips, salsas, and some vegetarian products. All dairy products should be eaten in moderation and infrequently as snacks.

, Here snacks are likely to be high in fats and calories. Choose crackers with low fat levels and lots of seed additions. Look for Scandinavian crackers which have no fat or sugar in them. As for cookies, they're best left on the shelf; they are not good snacks and should treated as an occasional treat only.


Supermarket bakery muffins that have been made with healthy products might be okay as an occasional snack but should not be eaten regularly. It's likely that they'll contain way more ingredients of dubious origin than you'd add to homemade muffins, so be careful with them.

Try sushi rolls.,
Enjoy chocolate for dessert.",How to Choose Heart Healthy Winter Foods2," Oatmeal is not only a quick and easy breakfast option, it is also extremely healthy for your heart.

They are self-packaged, easy to take on-the-go, and great for busy people. Try apples, bananas, raisins, fruit leather (with no added sugar), or grape tomatoes. , Protein is an essential part of a healthy diet. It works to build tissue, muscle, and bones, and slows digestion, which keeps you fuller longer. Foods high in protein include fish and chicken, beans and legumes, nuts, kale, and whole grains. Try low-fat or non-fat greek yogurt with granola and fruit, hard-boiled eggs, Justin’s peanut butter packets, cheese sticks, edamame, or whole-grain protein bars. , Among many health benefits, fiber-based snacks are very filling in small quantities. Foods high in fiber include oats, citrus fruits, beans, barley, whole-wheat flour, potatoes, and bran. Try spiced chickpea nuts, pumpkin seeds (still in the shell), an almond-honey power bar, or a cranberry-nut mini loaf with flaxseed. , Healthy doesn’t mean sweet-free. If you love dessert, make sure to incorporate something sweet. A few healthy ideas include fruit crumble muesli bars, nut butter brownies or the three-ingredient brownie, apple cinnamon yogurt bites, and strawberry oatmeal bars. , Too much of a good thing can be harmful and overeating any type of food is unhealthy.

Do your best to stick to the list, while also keeping an open mind to trying new things. , The unfortunate truth is that organic, sugar-free, and low-fat items are generally more expensive. If you rely on fresh fruits and vegetables, you may find that you’re shopping more frequently and having to replenish food items in larger quantities. , This is where fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, and fresh grains are stocked. The inner aisles carry processed and packaged foods such as potato chips, cookies, and frozen snacks. Health food stores offer healthy options throughout the entire store. Feel free to wander unhindered!

, If you want a packaged snack, make sure to read the ingredients on the label. A label that claims it has all-natural ingredients does not always mean it is a healthy choice. A common example is all-natural fruit juice, which is actually high in sugar. , Organic may be healthier, but it can still be an unnecessary and indulgent snack. Choosing a package of cookies just because they are organic will do nothing to improve your snacking habits. Stick with healthy food choices and avoid purchasing items that you can easily do without.

Choose a super-low-carb berry.,
Select berries with mid-range carb levels.,
Choose berries with higher carb counts.",How to Choose Low‐Carb Fruits1," Berries that have some of the lowest carb counts include strawberries, raspberries, pokeberry shoots, cranberries, and blackberries. Among this group of low-carb berries, pokeberry shoots have the lowest carbohydrate count (about 1 gram of carbs per quarter-cup), while blackberries have the highest (about 2.7 grams of carbs per quarter-cup)., Other berries that have slightly higher – but still low – carb levels include elderberries, currants, blueberries, and açaí berries. Elderberries and currants have 4 grams of carbs per quarter-cup, while açaí berries have 5 grams of carbs per quarter-cup., These are berries with carb counts of 8 grams of carbs or more. This group includes salmonberries, boysenberries, loganberries, huckleberries, and gooseberries.The berry in this group with the highest carb count is the boysenberry, which packs a whopping 13 grams (0.46 oz) of carbs per quarter-cup.
Loganberries, huckleberries, and salmonberries tie for the lowest carb count in this group. Each of these contains 8 grams of carbs per quarter-cup.

Choose a super-low-carb fruit.,
Select fruits with mid-range carb levels.,
Choose fruits with higher carb counts.",How to Choose Low‐Carb Fruits2," Cantaloupes, coconuts, lemons, and plums are among the fruits with the lowest carb counts. All of these fruits have either 6 or 7 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving of fruit., Other fruits with slightly higher carb levels include watermelon, clementines, cherries, peaches, oranges, apples, pears, kiwis, and pineapples. These fruits have carb levels that range between 9 grams (peaches) to 12 grams (0.42 oz) (apples, pears, kiwis, and pineapples) per 100-gram serving of fruit., Bananas have the highest carb count of any fruit, packing 20 grams (0.71 oz) of carbs per 100 grams of fruit. Grapes, likewise, are quite high in carbs, and contain 16 grams (0.56 oz) of carbs per 100 grams of fruit. Mangoes are another relatively high-carb fruit, and contain 13 grams (0.46 oz) of carbs per 100 grams of fruit."

Use fruit preserves.,
Avoid fruit juice.,
Avoid added sugar.",How to Choose Low‐Carb Fruits3," Fruit preserves containing 100% fruit are a great way to get low-carb fruit into your diet.Most fruit preserves have a ton of added sugar, as this is what helps preserve the fruit and keep it from molding. Look specifically for preserves with no added sugar, as this will significantly lower the amount of sugars (and therefore carbs).

, Fruit juices often contain sugar at rates equal to soda or other sweet drinks. Juice pressed from whole fruit as well as juice made from concentrate contains high levels of sugar (which means high levels of carbs), and is therefore not a good option if you want to choose low-carb fruits.If you want to continue enjoying fruit-flavored beverages, squeeze a lime or lemon wedge in a glass of sparkling water for a fizzy, fruity treat.
Alternately, you could dilute a fruit juice by mixing an equal portion of water and fruit juice together. This will reduce the carb levels of the juice., More sugar means higher carb levels. Check the packaging of any canned, prepackaged, or dried fruit, and develop a preference for dried or canned fruits that are labeled “no added sugar” or some similar commitment.Canned fruit packed in syrup has higher sugar levels than fresh fruit. Canned fruit packed in light syrup has less sugar than canned fruit packed in regular syrup, but still more than fresh fruit. The best canned fruit will be packed in water or 100% juice.Dried fruits often contain added sugar, but not all dried fruits contain added sugar.
Prepackaged low-carb fruits are a great choice, but be sure that they do not have added sugar.

Obtain fruits at peak season.,
Feel low-carb fruits for freshness.,
Smell the low-carb fruits.,
Look at the color.,
Buy frozen low-carb fruits.",How to Choose Low‐Carb Fruits4," Different low-carb fruits grow best at different times of the year. While today’s modern, globalized food system allows access to many foods year-round, low-carb fruits that are grown and obtained during peak season will taste better and be priced more affordably than they would be if grown and obtained during the off-season.Use a peak-season map like the one at http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/seasonalingredientmap to identify low-carb fruits that are at peak season in your area.

, Many low-carb fruits have certain telltale signs regarding their freshness that can only be evaluated through handling them. These signs indicate whether a low-carb fruit is ready for consumption, ripe, or rotten. For instance, when evaluating blueberries, feel them for firmness and ensure they are dry.Learn to identify the feel of ripeness in low-carb fruits you are interested in, and before obtaining them, turn them over in your hands to ensure they are fresh.

, Low-carb fruits tend to have a slightly sweet and aromatic smell if they are ready for consumption. Low-carb fruits that are rotten often have a foul stink to them.For instance, if you smell an orange, you should be able to detect a distinct citrusy scent characteristic of an orange.
Learn to identify the correct scent of the low-carb fruit you are interested in and check for that scent before purchasing.

, Low-carb fruits that are past their prime are often blotchy or discolored. Low-carb fruits that are ripe and ready to eat tend to have a consistent color. For instance, bananas are often greenish before they are ready to eat. When they are ripe, they are yellow. Once they go off, they are mushy and brown.Color is not always an accurate indicator of whether you should choose a particular low-carb fruit. But many low-carb fruits — especially bananas, red berries, cherries, and apples — are good candidates for visual examination when trying to determine freshness.
Before purchasing a low-carb fruit, give it a once-over. If your low-carb fruit is packaged, turn the package around in your hands and look at the fruits or berries on the bottom. Do not buy low-carb fruits that do not appear fresh.

, Frozen low-carb fruits stay good for much longer than fresh low-carb fruits. They are a great choice if you prefer to incorporate low-carb fruit into your diet in the form of smoothies or baked goods.Frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries are readily available commercially, and you can easily chop up and freeze banana slices in resealable containers that are perfect for making smoothies or topping your ice cream.
Frozen low-carb fruits do not have added sugar, so they are a great option for keeping carb counts low.

Look at the first four ingredients on the package.,
Avoid foods that contain corn syrup and added sugars.,
Watch for other additives.,
Check for ingredients that you are allergic to.",How to Choose Healthy Packaged Foods1," Start by looking on the back of the packaged food for the list of ingredients. The first four ingredients are the main ingredients in the food and should be products you recognize.For example, if you were buying packaged chicken nuggets, check that one of the first four ingredients is chicken. If you are buying packaged hamburger patties, one of the first four ingredients should be beef.;
, You should also look on the ingredients list for items added sugars, which have many names — from high-fructose corn syrup to dextrose to cane juice to molasses and many more.Added sugars are not just in desserts — you need to check sugar levels in bread, pasta sauce, cereals, crackers, etc. When checking the first four ingredients of a product, notice if added sugars are among them., Check if there is sodium nitrate, BHA or BHT on the ingredients list. These preservatives have been linked to certain health issues and should be avoided., You should also scan the ingredients list for items that could cause an allergic reaction for you or others in your family. Soy, wheat, nuts, and dairy are all common allergens."
"
Look for the serving size.,
Check the calorie content.,
Pay attention to the sodium, cholesterol, and fat content.,
Note the vitamin and mineral content.",How to Choose Healthy Packaged Foods2," The amount of food that equals one serving will be listed right under the “Nutrition Facts.” It will be given in measurements like cups, pieces, or grams, depending on the food. The information on the nutrition label is based on one serving of the food. Many packaged foods contain more than one serving so you need to keep that in mind when you are eating the packaged food.For example, if you eat two servings of chicken nuggets, you are then eating double of everything listed on the nutrition label. This includes the fat, sodium, and calorie content of the food.
If you do eat more than one serving at a time, you should be aware of how many calories total you are consuming so your meal is still healthy.

, You should also note the calories listed for one serving of the packaged food. The label may say “Calories”, and then next to it, “Calories from fat.” This number is how many fat calories are in one serving of the food. Remember that if you eat more than one serving of the food, you are doubling the calorie content.

Checking the calorie content will help you get a better sense of how much fat is in the food. A product that is advertised as fat-free may not be calorie free. Reading the label will help you determine the exact calorie content in the food.

, You’ll find the sodium, fat, and cholesterol content listed next on the nutrition label. There will be a “Percent (%) Daily Value” or a daily value in grams column for these sections, which tells you how one serving of food contributes to your total daily diet based on a 2,000 calories per day diet. Have packaged foods that are low in sodium, fat, and cholesterol as you do not want them to make up a large percentage of your daily calorie intake.Go for packaged foods that have 20 grams of fat per 100 grams, or no more than 20% fat content. Foods that have no more than 600 milligrams of sodium per 100 grams, or 6% sodium content are ideal.Having too much fat, cholesterol, and sodium in your food can increase your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and some cancers.

, You should check if the nutrition label lists any vitamins or minerals like vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, potassium, and fiber. These nutrients are essential for a healthy diet and will ensure you get enough energy from your packaged food. Look at the percentage or amount per grams listed on the nutrition label of the packaged food. If they are not listed at all, the food may not be of quality or very healthy for you.

Foods that contain at least 3 grams of dietary fiber per 100 grams are ideal, or at least 3% of the total Percent Daily Value.

Go for plain frozen vegetables and fruits.,
Choose healthy canned goods.,
Look for bagged fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Grab a healthy packaged option when you're on the go.,
Vary your packaged food choices.",How to Choose Healthy Packaged Foods3," You can make better choices in the packaged food aisle that are healthy and easy to prepare by going for frozen vegetables that are plain with no additives or seasonings. Look for frozen vegetables like spinach, broccoli, peas, corn, and carrots. Pick up frozen fruits like blueberries, strawberries, mango, and pineapple.Make sure the label does not list any added sodium, sugar, or seasonings to the vegetables or fruits. Getting plain frozen produce will ensure it is healthy. You can always add seasonings of your choice when you prepare the packaged foods based on your dietary needs.

, Go for canned goods that are low sodium. Items like carrots, beans, corn, tomatoes, tuna, and salmon can be found at your grocery store in the canned goods section. They are a healthier option than other packaged foods and are easy to prepare.You should also check the label of the canned goods to make sure it is Bisphenol A (BPA) free. BPA has been linked to cancer and other health issues.If possible, try to go for packaged foods that are in glass containers as glass does not contain BPA.
If you buy canned fruits, make sure they are packaged in water or their own juices and not syrup.

, You can go healthier in the packaged food aisle by picking up bagged fresh fruits and vegetables. Go for packaged salads or packaged sliced fruit. Make sure you check the date the fresh items were bagged, often noted on the front of the package. You want bagged produce that is fresh so it tastes good and is good for you.You should also inspect the bagged fresh produce to make sure it looks fresh and appetizing. Avoid salads that appear soggy or moldy in the bag. Make sure the sliced fruit looks vibrant and fresh in the package.

, If you are on the go, such as at the airport, and need to grab food fast, you may opt for healthy packaged food. Choose packaged nuts like almonds, cashews, or walnuts. Go for packaged dry fruit or dark chocolate covered nuts or fruit. You can also get a healthy packaged to go meal like yogurt and granola or a packaged salad.


If you are not sure if the packaged item is healthy, check the label quickly and note the fat, sodium, and cholesterol content.

, You can still go for other packaged foods like chicken nuggets or hamburger patties on occasion, as well as healthier options like produce or canned goods. Try to vary your packaged food choices so you get enough vegetables, fruit, and protein on your plate. Look at how to have a balanced meal based on portion size so you are getting enough of each food group at every meal.


Be smart about reading the ingredients list and the nutrition label so you know exactly what is in your packaged food. Having a varied diet that is high in nutrients will ensure you are eating healthy, even when you are eating packaged foods.

Read the labels.,
Shop locally.,
Go for organic fruits and vegetables.,
Always choose organic red meat.,
Choose organic dairy products.,
Purchase organic baby foods.,
Consider purchasing organic and chemical-free household goods as well.",How to Choose the Best Organic Foods1," If you're interested in purchasing organic foods, you'll need to understand organic labeling laws. Not everything labeled ""organic"" is necessarily 100% organic.


Foods that are labeled as 100% organic or organic must abide by the following: be produced without genetic engineering, radiation or sludge; not use any synthetic chemicals or pesticides in the farming process; and go through and pay for the USDA certification process.Foods that are labeled 100% must meet these guidelines. In addition, all of their ingredients need to be 100% organic as well. No other additives outside of water or salt are permitted.Foods that are only labeled ""organic"" are 95% organic.If you're interested in buying organic foods, make sure they are labeled with the USDA seal.Avoid products without specialty labeling.;
, Some of the best types of organic foods you can buy — of all categories — is locally grown organic products. The benefits of these foods extend beyond the benefits of organically raised items.


Local foods and produce are often times more flavorful. These foods are picked at the peak of freshness instead of being picked early to account for long shipping and transit times.Locally grown items are often higher in nutrients as well. Foods that are grown far away or in other countries slowly lose many of their nutrients over time.Like organic foods, local produce is also environmentally friendly. You don't need to have the items shipped far and it helps support the local farming community., Some of the absolute best foods to buy organically grown are fruits and vegetables. These foods tend to be the ""dirtiest"" or contain the highest amount of pesticide and chemical residues.You can of course, go for all organic fruits and vegetables; however, organics can be costly to purchase and put you over your food budget. The method of farming and lower output makes these foods pricey.
If you want to limit your organic produce purchases to be more economical, consider only purchasing organic versions of the common ""dirty dozen."" The following foods are known to have the highest amount of chemical residue:apples, peaches, nectarines, strawberries, grapes, celery, spinach, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, cherries and lettuce.

, Although there are benefits to buying all organic protein sources (due to less chemicals, hormones and antibiotic use), the best protein to buy organic is red meat.


The hormones added to beef may be linked to increased risk of certain cancers, though research is ongoing.
In addition, many cattle are given a variety of antibiotics when they are raised and these levels of antibiotics have been shown to show up in the meat itself. The USDA believes these antibiotics and the common use of them may lead to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria., Similar to beef products, dairy products can also be contaminated by the chemicals, hormones and antibiotics the cows are fed or given when they are raised. This is a great group of foods to buy organic.


Milk makes up a large part of the dairy foods consumed. Studies have shown that conventional milk contains higher levels of the hormones rBST or rBGH, which may be linked to certain cancers in humans, though this is inconclusive.If you have children or you yourself drink large quantities of milk, use it in cereal or oatmeal or to make smoothies, buy organic milk.

, Although there is no nutritional difference between conventional and organic baby food, purchasing organic baby food may be a good idea, as infants and babies may be more susceptible to the residues found in conventional produce used to make baby foods. Their immune systems are not as mature as an adults.If you're purchasing baby food, go for 100% organic — especially of the ""dirty dozen"".
In addition, if you're making your own baby food from scratch, use 100% organic meats and produce.

, Outside of the food arena, there are other household products that are considered organic or free from harmful chemicals. These may be good to buy in addition to your organic foods.


Many non-stick cookware pieces — like pots and pans — contain a fluorochemical called PTFE. When overheated (over 35 ºC or 662ºF), the pan releases toxic chemicals into your food and air that can coat your lungs and cause allergy-like symptoms.Many cleaning agents contain harmful chemicals like bleach, ammonia, chlorine and phthalates. All can irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tract.You may want to look for natural or chemical-free versions of your household cleaners.

Use ordinary objects to describe healthy portion sizes.,
Prepare meals with healthy proportions.,
Serve smaller meals at regular times each day.,
Look out for large portions at restaurants.,
Consult your child’s pediatrician.",How to Choose Portion Sizes for Kids1," It’s easier to compare portion sizes to everyday objects, especially for foods that are measured by mass or volume instead of by count. Doing so will help you teach your child how to choose the best portion sizes for themselves.For example, bread can be counted by the slice, and one slice is one portion.
Think of a two to three ounce (57 to 85 g) portion size of beef or poultry as a deck of cards. A portion of fish is the size of a checkbook.
For most foods measured by volume, a baseball-sized amount equals one cup (240 mL).
Fruits and veggies can vary: one apple might be larger than another or you might serve veggies chopped up or in a salad. Think of one portion of fruit as the size of a tennis ball. Think of a portion of veggies as the size of a baseball.
A portion of fats and oils, like butter, is the size of a postage stamp.;
, Do your best to serve meals that are not only well portioned, but that have the healthiest proportions of each food group. In general, half of each meal should consist of fruits or veggies, a quarter should be grains, and the last quarter should be lean protein.For example, a well-proportioned lunch for a ten year old could be a baseball-sized serving of mixed greens, a piece of grilled chicken breast the size of a deck of cards, and a serving of brown rice half the size of a baseball.

, You should serve smaller-sized portions over the course of three meals and a couple snacks instead of trying to pack nutritional requirements into larger portions. Regular meals and snacks distributed throughout the day will help your child maintain their energy level. Healthy portion sizes are also easier on their developing digestive systems.A healthy snack could be a small piece of fruit, 12 unsalted almonds, or a few whole wheat crackers with a ping pong ball-sized portion of peanut butter.
If your child gets full easily, breaking up their nutritional requirements into smaller meals and snacks will help you make sure they meet their daily needs.

, When you and your family are out to eat, be on the lookout for massive portions. In the last few decades, portion sizes at restaurants in the United States have doubled in size.Try sharing meals or packing up half of a meal to take home.Visualizing healthy portion sizes as everyday objects will help you and your child stick to your nutritional goals even when you’re out to eat.

, Following basic guidelines will help you plan your child’s meals, but don’t hesitate to get help from their pediatrician. They can help you determine if your child has specific dietary needs or deficiencies. In addition, they can help you tailor your child’s meal plan to their activity level.Tell the pediatrician about your child's diet and ask if they have any specific recommendations. You could ask, ""Do you see any signs that my child isn't getting enough of any particular nutrients? Is their BMI (body mass index) on track for their age, height, and sex?""
Be sure to mention any upcoming changes in activity level. You might, for example, ask the pediatrician, ""Sam is starting soccer in a few weeks. Do you recommend that I serve meals with more calories, bigger portion sizes, or any particular nutrients?""

Measure the portion sizes correctly.,
Use the ""fork method."",
Choose naturally low-calorie items.,
Be smart when choosing reduced fat toppings.,
Choose toppings that have added health benefits.,
Try making your own condiments from scratch.,
Order condiments and sauces on the sides.,
Pack on extra vegetable toppings.,
Ask for ""light"" amounts of toppings.,
Limit the amount of ""calorie-heavy"" toppings.,
Read the food label.,
Avoid items with trans fats.,
Look for low-sodium condiments.,
Be wary of high sugar items.",How to Choose Healthier Condiments and Toppings," Regardless of what type of topping or condiment you're planning on eating, it's important to measure the appropriate serving size. This will help you stick to your eating plan.


If you have the package or food label available, make sure to read the serving size of your item. Measure it out with measuring spoons or cups so you can get an accurate amount on your plate.
If you're out at a restaurant or do not know the serving size, try to take an educated guess. Most condiments (like ketchup or mayonnaise) will have a serving size around two tablespoons. One tablespoon is about the size of your thumb tip.You can also download a food journaling app that can help you track the portion sizes of your condiments and how many calories you're eating.;
, In addition to eyeballing or measuring portion sizes, you can try the ""fork method."" It significantly limits how much you use. This is great for salads and salad dressings.


This is where you dip your fork in your favorite condiment or dressing and then into the food itself.
For example, order your salad dressing on the side. When your salad comes, dip the tip of your fork into your salad dressing and then spear a few pieces of your salad.
This method gives you the taste of the dressing, but without using a large quantity of dressing on your salads.

, Many toppings, condiments and sauces are actually naturally low in calories. These are great items to use more regularly with your favorite foods.


Condiments and sauces that are naturally low in calories include: mustard, soy sauce (though high in sodium), pickle relish, vinegars, salsa, marinara sauce, hot sauce and horseradish sauce.
Toppings that are also naturally low in calories include: vegetables (like lettuce, tomatoes or onions), pickles (though can be high in sodium), olives, fruit and lean proteins (like grilled chicken, hard boiled eggs and low-fat cheese).
When you're making foods for yourself, feel free to use any of these low calorie items. For example, if you're making hamburgers for dinner, use a little mustard and as much lettuce, tomatoes or onions as you want. Or if you're making a salad for dinner, top it with olive oil and vinegar, grilled chicken and an assortment of your favorite raw vegetables.

, Many condiments come in a regular form and a reduced fat or fat-free form as well. This allows consumers another lower calorie and lower fat option. However, you still should be careful when using these types of condiments or toppings.


Remember, even though it may be lower in fat or ""lite"" doesn't mean its calorie free or even low calorie.
You should still measure portion sizes of these items as well. Many people use a bigger serving thinking they're ""saving calories or fat"" but use so much the calories or fat are equivalent to the regular version.
In addition, many of these items have higher sodium, sugar or artificial preservatives in them. Whenever they take out fat or reduce calories, the flavor can be affected so food manufacturers may add more sugar and sodium. Review the nutrition label to double check what you're purchasing.

, Some condiments, toppings or sauces will have nutritional benefits associated with them. If you're going to have a topping or use a condiment, consider using some that will have some added health benefits.


Nuts and seeds are common toppings - especially for salads, yogurts or even frozen yogurt or ice cream. Both nuts and seeds are high in protein, minerals and even have some fiber. In addition they're high in healthy fats which can support a healthy cardiovascular system.Fruit is another topping you might find on salads or even at the frozen yogurt bar. Fruit is high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.Low-fat or regular cheese. Whether its on your salad, pizza or hamburger, cheese can come with some benefits. It has protein, calcium and Vitamin D which can support bone health.Toppings like salsa or guacamole also have some health benefits. Salsa is basically all raw vegetables which are high in fiber and guacamole is high in minerals, Vitamin E and healthy fats.

, The best type of toppings or condiments to use are the ones you make at home from scratch. You'll be choosing the ingredients and will be able to control the total calories, fat, sodium and sugar.You will also be able to control the portion sizes as well. Serve yourself just enough and keep to appropriate portion sizes.
An easy condiment to make at home is ketchup. All you need to do is cook together tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and a little bit of water. You can add other spices too - like cayenne pepper - for additional flavor.

, You might encounter more condiments at restaurants and have the options of ordering special toppings for your meals. Try ordering these things on the side to control the overall nutritional value of your meals.


If you're ordering a dish that comes with condiments or a sauce, ask for it to be served on the side. This will allow you to control how much you add and therefore control how many extra calories you'll be adding.
For example, ask for your salad dressing to be served on the side, or the ketchup and mustard to be served on the size instead of on your burger.
If you're order a dish that has a lot of toppings (like a cobb salad) you can also ask for these on the side so you can control how much you eat of these items. When they're on the side, you can visually see the portion sizes and can determine if you want to eat all of it or just some of it. Once they're mixed into the salad, its harder to control how much you eat.
For example, if you're ordering a dinner salad like a cobb salad, greek salad or chopped salad, ask for the cheese, olives, avocado or other toppings on the side and add as much as you want yourself.

, One way to feel like you're eating a lot of tasty toppings is stick with toppings that are naturally low in calories - like vegetables. You can bulk up meals and add extra veggie toppings without worrying about eating too many calories.


Some of the most common toppings for a variety of dishes (like pizzas or sandwiches) are vegetables. Luckily, these are naturally very low calorie, but also contain some fiber and other beneficial nutrients.
If you're ordering a sandwich, add extra lettuce and tomatoes. You can also ask for other vegetables like sliced peppers or cucumbers for extra crunch.
If you're order a pizza or getting a take out pizza, also ask for extra vegetables. Add black olives, onions, mushrooms and peppers.
Also, don't hold back on condiments like salsa or marinara sauce. These sauces are vegetable based and naturally low in calories.

, If you're not a fan of some of the lower calorie toppings or condiments or you're really in the mood for some of those tasty higher calorie items, consider asking for less.


There are many toppings that aren't considered overly healthy due to their high calorie, fat or sodium content. But that doesn't mean you can never have these or should always try to avoid them.
By ordering less of these higher calorie items or asking for a ""light"" amount, you can still enjoy these toppings but feel comfortable knowing you're not over doing it.
For example, if you're order pizza, ask for just a little cheese. Or if you're ordering a sandwich, ask to go light on the mayonnaise.

, Another trick you can use is limiting the total amount of toppings or condiments you have in your dish. Many condiments, even full fat or full calorie items, don't have tons of calories per serving. It's when you have multiple toppings or multiple types of condiments in one dish that the total calories of your dish can get a little high.


If you're ordering a salad, limit the total amount of ""calorie-heavy toppings."" These are the ones like croutons, grilled chicken, cheese, bacon bits, beans or avocado. Limit yourself to 3-4 toppings and keep the serving size to 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) or less. Extra vegetables like bell peppers or tomatoes don't push the calorie level too high.
Use the same theory when ordering an item like pizza. Feel free to add as many veggies as you like, but only stick to one or two ""calorie-heavy"" toppings like cheese or pepperoni.
Frozen yogurt bars are another place that toppings can get out of control. Go wild with the fresh fruit, but limit yourself to 2-3 ""calorie-heavy"" toppings like candy, nuts, chocolate syrup or granola.
Some sandwiches also come with multiple toppings and sauces. Stick to one higher calorie sauce (like mayonnaise) and 1 or 2 calorie-heavy toppings (like avocado or bacon).

, When you're in the grocery store and need to purchase a condiment, dressing or some sort of topping, make sure you pay attention to the food label. This will guide you on the overall healthiness of the product and help you determine whether or not you should buy it.


The nutrition label contains a few things. It'll tell you the serving size, calorie, sugar, carbohydrate, fiber, cholesterol and fat content in addition to listing the ingredients that are contained in the product.The first thing you need to look at is the serving size. It's listed at the top of the nutrition fact panel. For most condiments or dressings, the serving size will be somewhat small. It might be 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) or even 1/4 of a cup. Make sure to take note of this because if you consume more than 1 serving, you need to increase the total calories, sugar and fat per serving.
Also take note of the total calories per serving. You don't want to use a high calorie condiment and have it push you over your designated calorie limit for the day.
Review the other information on the nutrition label as well. Make sure the amounts of different nutrients fit in with whatever current diet or eating pattern you're following.

, One item that, unfortunately, that is still found in many foods is trans fats. Trans fats are considered very unhealthy and most health professionals recommend you avoid them at all costs.Trans fats are typically used as a flavor and texture enhancer and to help prevent foods from spoiling. They are found in a wide variety of foods including baked goods, fried foods, refrigerated doughs (like cinnamon roll dough), and chips.They have been linked to high cholesterol and heart disease and should therefore be avoided.
In addition, trans fats are found in some of your favorite condiments and toppings. For example, there is frequently trans fats in non-dairy and regular creamer, margarine, and some creamy salad dressings.
Look for partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils on the ingredient list. Trans fats may also be listed on the nutrition fact panel underneath ""total fat"". Make sure this says ""0 grams (0.0 oz)"" and there aren't any trans fats listed in the ingredient label.

, More prominent than trans fats in condiments and toppings, is sodium. This salty ingredient can come in many forms and is typically quite high in a variety of condiments, sauces and toppings.


Sodium is another nutrient that you should look for on the nutrition fact panel. It's found under ""total cholesterol"" on the label. Also look for ""low-sodium"" on the front of the label. This means there's less than 140 mg of sodium per serving.Items market as ""low-sodium"" are a better bet and may be a healthier choice.
A diet that's high in sodium has been linked with an increased risk for high blood pressure. This can also lead to heart disease and stroke over time. Limiting high sodium condiments and toppings can help you decrease your overall sodium intake.Some of the highest sodium containing condiments and toppings include: soy sauce, pepperoni or sausage, bacon bits, hot sauce, low-fat salad dressings, teriyaki sauce, pickles or pickle relish, olives and cheese. Some of these items are low in calories or fat (like pickles or olives) but still contain a large amount of sodium.

, Like salt, sugar is another common culprit in many of your favorite condiments, sauces and toppings. You'd be surprised about the total sugar in many items. Make sure to read the labels and stick to low-sugar versions of your favorites.


Condiments that are typically higher in sugar include: ketchup, BBQ sauce, teriyaki sauce, marinara sauce, sweet dessert sauces (like chocolate or caramel syrup), candied nuts, dried fruit, honey mustard and sriracha sauce. Also note that many reduced fat or fat-free salad dressings and condiments may have higher amounts of sugar to help improve the flavor when the calories are reduced.The total sugar amount is also listed on the food label. You'll find it listed under ""total carbohydrates"" on the food label.
Look for condiments that are labeled ""no sugar added"" or ""sugar-free."" No sugar added items do not have any added sources of sugar, however there may be some natural sugar. Sugar-free items contain less than 0.5 g of sugar per serving but also may contain some artificial sweeteners."
"
Consider the calorie count.,
Consider the sugar levels.,
Consider the amount of nutrients.",How to Choose Healthy Juices1," Even though juices come from healthy fruits and vegetables, they still contain calories that can add up quickly. Even 100% apple juice and orange juice have higher calorie counts than an equal volume of regular cola per portion size.If your notion of healthy juices revolves around their calorie counts, select juices with low calorie counts like beet juice, grapefruit juice, or a mixed juice containing celery, cucumber, and kale.If you’re making juices at home, utilize recipes that don’t add sugar, or substitute a noncaloric sweetener in its stead.;
, Juices with added sugar are less healthy than those without. To choose healthy juices, only drink juices that are pure juice. These juices might be labeled as “100% juice.”Avoid juices labeled “made from concentrate,” as these have higher sugar levels.Check the label on store-bought juices to make sure that the “juice” you pick is actually juice — not “10% juice” or some other fraction, as is often the case.

, Nutrients – that is, vitamins and minerals – help keep your body healthy. If you believe that “healthy juices” refers to juices that are high in nutrients, stick to those made of watermelon, honeydew, citrus fruits, berries, guava, and papaya.Of the homemade juicers, centrifugal juicers are the least desirable, as the heat they produce might reduce the amount of enzymes in the resulting juice. Triturating juicers, while more expensive, are more efficient, and thus retain more nutrients.

Include vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, and slices of cucumber. You can also add fruits such as almonds and bananas. Healthy meats are also great options, and those include roasted turkey and beef low in fat.

, Salads contain healthy nutrients, and they can be filled with the vegetables you like. You can also add protein-filled foods to your salad, such as salmon, chicken, and hard-boiled eggs, to make it more nutritious and flavorful. You can also add a touch of salad dressing, or even a little amount of olive oil, in a separate container.

, There's no need to throw them away; just put them in a light container and take them for lunch at work. It's fine to reheat foods, but some foods can stay cold, such as chicken, burgers and beans.

Purchase produce that has minimal residue.,
Choose quinoa over other grains.,
Avoid purchasing organic seafood.",How to Choose the Best Organic Foods2," Many different types of fruits and vegetables are grown differently and require different farming techniques to maintain. This changes how much or how little pesticide residue is found on certain foods.Outside of the ""dirty dozen"" are some foods that contain relatively low amounts of pesticide residue. If you're only purchasing organic food to avoid pesticides, not for environmental reasons, consider purchasing the less expensive versions of these foods.
Foods that are much lower in residues include: onions, corn, pineapple, kiwi, mushrooms, avocado, eggplant, mangoes, sweet peas, asparagus, cantaloupe, cabbage, watermelon and sweet potatoes., Grains like wheat, rice, barley and rye are all plants and can be grown either organically or conventionally. However, choosing quinoa can be the best choice of all.


Not typically included in the ""dirty dozen"" list, grains still can contain some pesticide residue just like other fruits and vegetables.
In addition, any products made from grains — like bread, pasta, wraps, tortillas, crackers, or muffins — will also contain those same pesticides.
Quinoa, however, has a naturally occurring pesticide that makes it nearly impenetrable to pests and bugs.Instead of rice or other grains, choose to serve quinoa. You can also purchase pasta and other products made from quinoa flour.

, Unlike beef, chicken or pork, the USDA has no organic labeling standards for fish or shellfish at this time.Stick to conventional seafood to avoid a higher price.


The organic definition refers to chemicals and pesticides. However, even organic seafood still can contain harmful levels of PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) and mercury.Instead of going for organic seafood, choose fish or shellfish that is low in mercury or other contaminants. This includes tilapia, sole, oysters, catfish, crab, scallops, shrimp, herring, haddock, and flounder.Also choose fish and shellfish that are raised or caught using sustainable fishing methods.

Look for bread, pastas, and cereals that are labeled whole wheat.A day’s worth of grains could be: a baseball-sized portion of whole grain cereal or oatmeal for breakfast, a sandwich (with two slices of whole wheat bread) for lunch, and a baseball-sized portion of pasta with dinner.
Keep in mind that the portion sizes listed on a package may not always be appropriate for younger children. For example, a child between the ages of 2 and 3 will only need half the portion that is indicated for an adult.Adapt the portion size for your child as needed.
Make sure to teach your child how to recognize when they are full and allow them to stop eating when they get full., Younger children (ages 2 to 6) need three servings of vegetables per day and older children (ages 7 and up) need four servings of vegetables per day. Try to mix up the veggies you serve by color and kind.In other words, try to serve a combination of leafy greens (lettuce, kale, or broccoli), orange veggies (carrots, peppers, or squash), and legumes (beans or peas). You and your family don’t have to have all the veggie groups every day, but try to have at least of portion of each every week.A day’s worth of veggies by portion size could be: 3/4 cup (180 mL) of vegetable juice (like tomato juice) with breakfast, a baseball-sized portion of mixed green salad or carrot sticks with lunch, and a baseball-sized amount of squash or medium-sized sweet potato with dinner.

, Your child under ten needs two servings of fruit per day. Fruits offer great options for midday snacks, or can easily be incorporated to breakfasts.A tennis ball-sized apple, orange, or pear counts as a serving of fruit.

, Your younger child (ages 2 to 6) will need two servings of dairy daily and older children (ages 6 and up) will need two to three servings of dairy daily. A serving of dairy is one cup of milk or yogurt, or 1 ounce of cheese.

Try including a container of applesauce with lunch. Have them eat a large orange as an afterschool snack.

, An extra glass of milk is the easiest way to get that extra serving of dairy. A few slices of cheese, or a portion about half the size of a tennis ball, for a snack will add the needed serving. You can also have them eat a container of yogurt as a snack, too.Low or nonfat options are the healthiest sources of dairy.

, You can increase each portion of protein at lunch and dinner by a half ounce (14 g) to meet an older child’s additional requirement.

Mix your juices.,
Drink a smaller portion of juice.,
Cut your juice with water.,
Don’t make too much.",How to Choose Healthy Juices3," If you have two juices with two different healthy qualities, feel free to combine them for a super-juice. There are endless combinations of healthy juices. For instance, mix cucumber juice with apple juice, or grapefruit juice with beet juice., If you’re worried that your healthy juice consumption is adding unwanted calories to your diet, drink a smaller portion of juice. Use a juice cup – a small cup that holds about eight fluid ounces – instead of a tall glass when drinking healthy juices., Another way to cut back on unwanted liquid calories is to mix water and healthy juices.Mixing a drink that is two parts healthy juice and one part water should be a good start.

Use a juicer.,
Ensure you’re getting a nutritionally complete juice.,
Ensure your juice is free of contamination.",How to Choose Healthy Juices4," If you’re having trouble locating healthy juices, you can make some yourself with a juicer. A juicer is a device that allows you to separate the flesh of a given fruit from its juices.

Consult manufacturer directions before use.
Do not drink juice as your only source of fruits and veggies., Some people choose healthy fruit juices with the intent to switch to a liquid-only diet as part of a weight-loss plan, or because they cannot consume solid food due to a medical condition. However, unlike whole fruits and veggies, juices lack significant amounts of fiber.Fiber is the indigestible portion of the fruit or vegetable that helps increase nutrient absorption and keeps the gut clean.
If you’re on a juice or liquid-only diet for a medical reason, your doctor might prescribe a fiber supplement to you.
Some juicers incorporate fruit and vegetable pulp back into the juice so that you can get additional fiber.

, Homemade juices can be made safely if the fruit or vegetables used to produce it are cleaned thoroughly, and if the juicer itself is clean. Clean your juicer’s many removable parts with soap and hot water after each use.To clean fruits and veggies, simply place them under swiftly flowing cool water. This will remove excess biocides, fertilizers, and grime. Do not use alcohol, soap, or other cleaning agents.
Remove produce stickers from your fruits or veggies before juicing them.
If you have several fruits you wish to use at once, place them all in a colander and rinse the whole batch.

Language you use must be as simple as can be.;
, Yes, play with words, try different possible combinations of them, just keep their relevance in mind while you are at it. Banking up on vocabulary is no math to dread of.

, Take time from your leisure and go through the dictionary, like you would go through a magazine, scan it and make note of words that draw your attention and grasp them into your knowledge bank so as to use it in future at the right groove for the word.

, Make it a habit to read the newspaper every morning, or at least scan through. Read, understand, and try to pick up the most you can. Reading the newspaper is not just going through the coffee break column. Go through the Head lines and observe the excellent presentations made by the column writers and journalists.

, Self analysis and research can compensate for this, even though it may take some time before one gets a complete grasp of things.

Work could also entail creating summaries or huge tomes, writing for the web, researching on specific topics, or reporting on meetings and conferences.

,, The second most important aspect is to create a list of clients. Networking, communicating well, and building a good relationship with clients is essential to freelance writing.

, You could be a journalist, web content writer, or resume writer. These are just a few examples of the umpteen choices a writer has.

,, Study the different writing styles as well as what constitutes good writing. To get the ""perfect"" job write a triumphant profile and send it out with a brief but succinct covering letter to potential employers. Scan the classifieds as well as online job sites for vacancies that suit your profile. Consider registering with a placement consultant or go for online sites that specialize in jobs for writers. Another option is a paid job coach, agency, or resume blasting service.

, Learn how to research competently using the World Wide Web. Have a working knowledge of graphic design, page layout, and multimedia software would add weight to your goodie bag.

Try recreating your favorite takeout recipes at home.",How to Choose Healthy Chinese Takeout," If there are multiple Chinese restaurants around your area, take a look at each one of their menus. Although many items on the menu will be similar or even identical, you might find more healthy options at certain places.


Some restaurants may offer a wider selection of certain foods. Look for menus that have more steamed dishes, more vegetable dishes or are able to make changes or substitutions.
Also check for a ""healthy"" or ""diet-friendly"" section of the menu. Many restaurants now are catering to the large population of people looking to lose weight. They may offer things under a certain calorie limit or that are cooked a bit healthier.;
, Most Chinese restaurants offer a few different types of soup on their menu. Starting with a soup can help curb your appetite and total calorie intake.


Studies have shown that if you start a meal by consuming a low-calorie soup, you end up eating less quantity and fewer calories overall.Try order a ""small"" or cup of hot and sour soup. This generally is about 100 calories and contains vegetables and broth.
Although the soup may be low in calorie, it's most likely still higher in sodium. Ask for a low-sodium option if available and plan on sticking to the small serving.

, No matter what entree or side dish you're in the mood for, try to go for the steamed option over fried. This automatically cuts calories and fat.


Anything battered or marked as '""crispy"" is deep fried, e.g. prawn crackers and spring rolls. Anything in batter means that it will be high in fat.
If your order comes with the option of fried rice or steamed rice, always go for steamed. Fried rice has over 100 more calories per serving than steamed rice.Also go for steamed or stir-fried proteins. Things like General Tso's chicken are deep fried and higher in calories. Opt for a lower calorie option like chicken and broccoli.
For appetizers, skip the egg roll and fried dumplings and order spring rolls or steamed dumplings instead. Two steamed dumplings are only around 50 calories., Adding an extra vegetables to any dish — takeout or homemade — can help decrease the overall calorie content of the meal and help you stick to a healthier, more nutritious meal.


Adding extra vegetables to your Chinese takeout meal will help provide bulk to your meal. That means you'll be eating the same quantity of foods, but filling up more on vegetables.
Since vegetables are low in calorie and high in fiber, you'll get full and feel satisfied on fewer calories.With any Chinese takeout dish, ask for extra vegetables. If it comes with peppers and onions, ask for a double amount. Or if you're ordering chicken and broccoli, ask for extra broccoli.
You can also ask for an order of plain steamed vegetables or a side order of steamed vegetables. Eat these in addition to your meal or toss them with your entree of choice.

, Another option to try is ordering brown rice. Again, many restaurants are catering to healthy eaters and may offer this nutritious side.


Brown rice is considered a 100% whole grain. It's less processed compared to white rice and is higher fiber, protein, and other essential nutrients.Although brown rice is a more nutritious or nutrient-dense choice, it will have the same or very similar amount of calories to steamed white rice. The benefit here is the added nutrition.

, There are a variety of different meals and types of foods that you can order to make Chinese takeout more healthy; however, don't forget about how it's cooked and served.


Ask for sauce on the side. Many times, Chinese food is slathered and drowning in some sort of sauce. Although usually very tasty, the excess amount of sauce can add up to a lot of extra calories. Ask for the sauce to be served on the side and monitor how much you add.
Also ask if your foods can be prepared with less oil or butter. This can help cut down on fat and calories as well.Ask about reducing the amount of soy sauce, MSG or salt that's added to your foods during cooking.Although these ingredients don't come with a calorie content, they can help cut down on the overall sodium content of your meal.

, When you're ordering Chinese takeout, it may be tempting to order a few tasty appetizers as well. Although appetizers can add calories to your overall meal, if chosen wisely, they can actually prevent you from overeating. Here are your best bets:


Hot and sour soup. Order a small of this low-calorie soup. It'll help fill you up and possibly save you extra calories overall.
Steamed vegetable dumplings. Splitting an order of four or six won't push you too far over your calorie limit.
Spring rolls. These non-fried, vegetable-filled rolls are the perfect low-calorie appetizer.

, Chinese food entrees are known to be high in fat, sugar and sodium. Stick to these healthier options:


Buddha's delite. This common dish is filled with steamed vegetables and tofu and leaves out unwanted calories and fat.
Chicken and broccoli. This is another popular dish that is also naturally lower in calories. Ask for the sauce on the side to help control calories even more.
Moo goo gai pan. Similar to Buddha's delite, this dish is filled with vegetables and steamed chicken. It's low in calories, fat but high in fiber.
Shrimp with lobster sauce. A tasty seafood dish that's high in protein and moderately low in calories.

, Sometimes the side dishes of Chinese takeout are the tastiest part; however, they can pack on a significant amount of extra calories. Limit these:


Fried egg rolls. These large, deep fried rolls are high in calories and fat.
Crab rangoon. These little deep fried dumplings contain little filling and are mostly deep fried dough.
Fried rice. This side dish is re-fried, refined white rice. It has a ton of calories and fat.
BBQ spare ribs. Sometimes these are listed as an entree as well, but are incredibly high in saturated fat and calories.

, Before you even get your Chinese takeout meal, make sure you're managing your hunger appropriately throughout the day. Try to plan when you are going to have Chinese takeout instead of impulsively ordering when you are starving.


If you go into a tasty Chinese takeout meal and you're starving, you're more likely to overeat. This means much larger portion sizes and more calories by the end of your meal.
To calm your hunger down before a meal, try having a large glass of water or flavored water. This can help fill your belly with a calorie-free liquid and make your brain feel less hungry.Also don't skip meals throughout the day. Even though you know you're going to be indulging in a higher calorie meal, skipping meals can lead to increased hunger.Consider having a small snack about two hours before your takeout arrives. Including a small snack can help calm hunger and decrease the risk of overeating. Go for something like: a small piece of fruit, a low-fat cheese stick, a small cup of yogurt, or a hard boiled egg.

, Following the appropriate portion size when eating higher fat or higher calorie foods is key. Keeping portions in check will also help keep your overall calorie intake in check as well.


Many Chinese takeout entrees are large and can be split. Offer to split with your spouse, family member or friends.
You can also order a small or side orders instead of a large or entree sized meal.
When your takeout arrives, try immediately packing up half your entree or meal for lunch or dinner the next day. If it's out of sight, it's out of mind.

, If you're planning on a more indulgent meal during the day, make sure to make a pit stop at your gym or fit in a workout.


Although you won't be able to work off your entire meal, going to the gym can help burn a few extra calories to help keep your diet or weight in check.
Also, by going to the gym, you're doing something healthy and positive for yourself. This can help keep you in a ""healthy mindset"" while you're ordering and eating your takeout.
In addition, consider going for an extra walk after you're done eating your takeout. This can help boost your activity level and total calories burned.

, If you love Chinese food and find yourself craving it or ordering it often, consider making some of your favorite recipes at home.


By making more food at home, you can control what goes in (or what stays out) of your foods. You can control the calories, fat, sugar and sodium content of your meals.
In addition, you can take charge of cooking foods in a more healthful or nutritious manner. You can bake foods or stir-fry in little added oil for a low-fat and low calorie version at home.
You can also serve more nutritious sides like brown rice and steamed vegetables.

Write a cover letter.Your cover letter should give more depth to the info on the resume.,
Apply for jobs.,
Land a job.",How to Get Into Graphic Design," Instead, pick up a how-to book like You Can Draw in 30 Days and follow the book’s instructions.


Practicing your drawing for half an hour each day over the course of a month will help you develop your own artistic style and get you used to the rhythm of creative work.
If you do want to take a class, check your community arts website for information on free or affordable classes.;
, However, even clients that contract a private designer will want to know a bit about your background to ensure you know what you’re doing. Getting an education will give you the bona fides you need to impress potential clients and employers.


Not only does a graphic design degree expand your opportunities for networking and employment, but it may open your eyes to new techniques, styles, and theories that could inform your work in a positive way.
While many schools offer graphic design programs, the top-ranked schools include Rhode Island School of Design, Yale University, and the Maryland Institute College of Art.Even a certificate program can help you learn a lot more about your trade.
Take advantage of free graphic design lessons online.Tutorials on how to become a better graphic designer are readily available online. For instance, Envato offers 50 design lessons at http://design.tutsplus.com/articles/50-totally-free-lessons-in-graphic-design-theory--psd-2916. Type a simple search like ""How to improve as a graphic designer"" into your favorite search engine.

, As a graphic designer, you could choose to design logos, mobile apps, websites, and more. Experiment with different aspects of graphic design and pursue the specialty or specialties that speak to you.


If you want to create websites, check out the book Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.
If you want to design apps, read the book Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps. Check your local library or bookstore for availability.
Apple offers many design guides for designers to build new apps on its software. Check https://developer.apple.com/design/ for more details.

, At the professional level, many jobs depend on having the right set of computer skills.


Macs are more common in the graphic design world because they are geared towards media use and creation.
If you’re going to get a PC, ensure it is clear of pre-loaded programs and junk software. This way it will run faster and encounter fewer technical hiccups. Ensure your computer has a powerful graphics card and processor, and a large hard drive.
It’s important to know the basics of both a Mac and PC, but at home, you will likely have just one or the other. Test both and choose the one that works for you.
A tablet is also a good graphic design tool. With the right tablet and stylus, you can use it as you would a pen and paper to create slick digital sketches of your ideas or incorporate fine details into your design. The Wacom Bamboo is a good option if you’re looking for a tablet that caters to graphic designers.

, While you will probably develop a liking for one particular program, it is best to be familiar with several.


Adobe Photoshop is a crucial piece of software that every graphic designer should understand. While it could take literally years to gain an in-depth understanding of Photoshop, a basic understanding is easy to obtain. Look for how-to videos online and play around with the program a bit.
There are also many books available on how to use the many tools Photoshop offers. Check your local library or book store for availability.
Adobe Illustrator is another important program that you can learn through exploration. Two books --- Adobe Illustrator Classroom in a Book and Vector Basic Training -- can help you understand the basics of the program.
Additionally, Adobe InDesign, Microsoft Publisher, Quark and CorelDRAW are useful programs to familiarize yourself with.

, In graphic design, as in life, it’s not just about what you say, but about how you say it. Having the right font can make or break a design. Sites like Dafont (http://www.dafont.com/) and MyFonts (http://www.myfonts.com/) are good places to start, but many graphic designers offer their fonts for download through their personal blogs or websites. Look around for fonts that speak to you.


Make note of well-executed websites or apps. Identify the aspects of each that work, and those that don’t. Use them as inspiration when designing your own work. Once you know what's been done (and being done), you'll be able to identify and develop your own style., Join design organizations.There are many graphic design organizations at both local and national levels that host webinars, conferences, and other events where their members can ask questions and learn new techniques.


For instance, the American Institute of Graphic Arts has chapters throughout the country. Use their database at http://www.aiga.org/chapters/ to locate one near you.
You could send some of your work to a designer with a style similar to yours, along with a complimentary note explaining, “I think you might like this piece I did recently. Let me know what you think!”If they show interest, develop the relationship and stay in contact with them. They might send work your way.
Stay connected to your classmates. When you’re developing graphic design skills in college, develop close ties to your classmates. They will be your future peers in the graphic design industry, and could be helpful when you’re looking for work. Be genuinely friendly and interested in their ideas and designs.

, As a nonprofit, they naturally want to save money on these costs. Offering your graphic design abilities is a good way to both give back to your community and bulk up your resume.


Identify a charity you believe in and approach them with an offer to help them with graphic design. For instance, if you’re passionate about food justice and poverty, you might approach your local food bank or soup kitchen with an offer to lend a hand.
Ask the nonprofit’s management what kind of projects they want help with. Draft several iterations for the designs they need and let them choose the one they like best.

, Tumblr caters to image-based graphic design posts, though you could also use a blogging platform like WordPress or Squarespace to make a digital showcase of your work. Behance, an online portfolio service, is another good option that you can direct potential employers or clients to. Finally, you could always use more traditional social media like Facebook and Instagram to show your work and get your name out.


Enter graphic design competitions.Many graphic design organizations and universities offer graphic design competitions based around a certain design feature or theme. For instance, your local university or college might offer design contest based around designing new typefaces.
Check with the AIGA (http://www.aiga.org/competitions/) and with sites like Graphic Competitions (http://www.graphiccompetitions.com/graphic-design/) to find one you feel qualified to submit work to.
Winning a competition -- or even placing second or third -- looks great on a resume and can be useful for getting more work. Plus, it will give you the confidence you need to get deeper into graphic design.

, The more quality material you have under your belt, the more you’ll be able to share with prospective employers when you go on job interviews or seek new clients.

, Check employment sites like Monster.com or your local newspaper for employment opportunities. You could also try cold-calling a company you’re interested in working for.You could apply for either a job or an internship.


An internship is a temporary work assignment with a company or design firm. If you’re lucky, you can get a paid internship. If not, you might settle for an unpaid internship. However, even unpaid internships can provide valuable work experience, network connections, and open the doors to better opportunities further down the road.
Look for ads that closely conform to your skill set.,


For example, if the employment ad asks for a graphic designer with a degree in graphic design and experience in photography, and you have both, be sure to emphasize that on your resume.
Double-check your resume and submit a portfolio of your best work.
You don’t need to list every job you’ve ever had on your resume. List only jobs you’ve had in the past five years, plus any other volunteer positions or internships pertinent to the position you’re applying for.

, For instance, if you listed your education and other jobs on the resume, explain in the cover letter exactly what classes you took, and exactly what the nature of your responsibilities at your other relevant jobs were. Limit the cover letter to one page, single-spaced.

, Submit your resume and portfolio promptly. If the company is accepting applications only until the first of the following month, don’t wait until the end of the current month to submit your application. If the company holds interviews as it receives applications, you could be the first to get an interview. If you impress, you might get the job on the spot.


Call or visit the company you applied to. If possible, submit the application in person. You could also go to the firm with questions about your application before submitting it. For instance, if the application asks for three pieces of recent work, you could ask if it’s alright to include slightly more than three. Visiting or calling the graphic design department of the company you want to apply to will give the staff there an idea of who you are and help you build rapport with department leaders before they see your application.Even if you don’t have questions, it’s a good idea to make a pretext for visiting just to check out the conditions under which you might be working and give the staff there the chance to meet you.
After a week or so, give the company a call.Say, “Hi, I’m just calling to follow up on the application I submitted last week. I was wondering if you were still conducting interviews for the position? If so, I’d like to schedule one.” If they say they are no longer interviewing for that position, return to the job ads and apply for another job you’re interested in.

, Nail the interview by being honest, personable, and smart. Dress professionally -- a dress shirt and suit for men, and a tasteful dress or blazer for women. Choose muted earth tones like navy, brown, black, and dark green.


Prepare and ask questions of the employer about the position. For instance, “When would I start?”, “What departments would I be working with?”, and “How much variety does the position entail?”
After the interview, send a thank-you note or email to the person or persons you interviewed with.Be specific in your thank-yous by citing particular questions that were clarified or points of interest you learned during the interview.
If you are trying to get hired by a marketing firm, get ready for some hard work. Be prepared to start at the bottom and work your way up.
Once you get a position or land a client, give it everything you have. Put every ounce of creative energy you have into every job you do, even if it seems like a minor job. It will pay off in the end, in the form of recognition or more clients.
Don’t give up.If you don’t get a job right away, don’t worry. If you feel passionate about graphic design and have an artistic temperament, continue to pursue it even if it takes a long time to get an internship or job. Put in lots of applications, continue building your portfolio, and stay in touch with your peers in graphic design.

These are the entry-level positions in film and video production, and are where many start off when getting into production., Unfortunately, this is an almost inevitable part of starting out in film or video production. Almost everyone in the industry has to pay their dues and do unpaid work as assistants or runners. If a studio or company is interesting, fetching coffee may be worth it for the connections that you can make., You have already researched studios and companies in your area. Make a list of the ones that most interest you and call their production office . You will likely reach the Production Assistant on the phone. Ask them if there are any openings and if you can send a resume. Just because a studio doesn’t list jobs, it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Many studios hire through word of mouth or through references, which is why pursuing them is a good tactic.

, Create a LinkedIn profile and post your resume. Get in touch with any recruiters that you can find that are in the industry. LinkedIn is fast becoming one of the most vital ways to find jobs in the digital age., If you get an interview with a studio or company, do thorough research. Make sure you know things like their size, where they usually work and what projects they have been doing.


Their website is always a great place to start. You can also find information on them by doing a Google search.

, If you get an interview, do your best to communicate your own skills and assets. Bring each question back to your strengths and the ways that you can contribute effectively to the company or project.Stay positive and down to earth. The last thing any film crew needs is someone who will bring drama to the table. Present yourself as someone who is grounded and is willing to follow directions.

, After the interview, send an email thanking the interviewer for their time. It is a polite gesture that is almost standard interviewing procedure now. It will also make sure that the employer will keep you in mind as he or she is interviewing other candidates."

Practice with various mediums.,
Experiment with the above techniques and materials, or others, to see which is more enjoyable and productive to you, as an individual.

,
Look at classes offered in your area, or even online.,
Check for studio classes or private art teachers if no classes are available where you live.,
Practice your medium.,
Work with your talents and skills when you have opportunity.,
Watch for contests or art shows which feature the medium you work in.,
Don't be disappointed when every project is not a success.,
Look for inspiration everywhere you go.",How to Get Started As an Artist," Art is created with an almost limitless variety of mediums, from oil paints to clay, from stone to electricity. Here are a few popular media used by artists.


Pencils and paper. Drawing is a fundamental art form, probably first practiced with a piece of charcoal or some colored clay on a cave wall. It is now a refined technique using a variety of paper and pencils.
Pen and Ink. Pen and ink is another form of drawing, using heavy rag paper or scratch board, and usually a nib pen and ink. It can be used to create dramatic contrasts, and exquisite detail.
Pastels. Pastel sticks are pigment mixed with very little binder and rolled to form sticks that resemble colored chalks. Only the cheapest student grade ones are dyed chalk. They can be used for drawing or painting on pastel paper, heavy sketch paper, watercolor paper or sanded pastel papers.
Oil Pastels. These sticks resemble crayons and range from very inexpensive children's oil pastels to artist grade oil pastels made with expensive pigments. Much more opaque than crayons, they work on paper, boards, wood, canvas, metal or almost any surface.
Watercolors, oils, and acrylic paints. These are vastly different media, grouped together only because they are familiar to most people, and are all used in what we know as ""painting"".
Ceramics. This media is clay, which can be hand shaped, formed in a mold, thrown on a potter's wheel, or sculpted by other means.
Sculpting with stone. This is a challenging and physically demanding technique. Modern technology has created tools for removing stone to form a shape, but traditionally it is done with a hammer and chisels.
Photography. A technique which is constantly in a state of change, with new technologies emerging continuously, from digital cameras and editing, to special effects filters and lighting.
Carving. Usually done with chisels and knives, this is a traditional art form that has also benefited from technology, with the emergence of die grinding tools for shaping, saws and shapers to duplicate images and remove large amounts of wood quickly, and glues and resins for refitting or laminating the work piece as it is worked.

There are many other media and simply too many techniques to cover them all in one article.

;
,, Many school districts offer art classes for students from elementary school through high school. Often these are elective courses beyond elementary school level, and if you are interested in art, try to work your school schedule to take all the art classes possible. Community Colleges and Universities sometime offer adult education classes in many art techniques.

, In former times, almost all artists began as apprentices to ""Masters"", those who had completed their own apprenticeships and were tradesmen in their craft. Now, some artists will offer apprenticeships to talented individuals who learn from their teacher as they do other studio work as payment.

, Keep a record or a portfolio of your work, whether it is in a sketchbook, an album, or with photographs of sculptures or carvings. This will enable you to see improvements, and establish a personal technique.

, If you have talent and develop skill as a painter or in drawing, you may get a chance to do some commission work making posters or signs for neighborhood businesses or events.

, Shopping malls, community organizations, and other groups often sponsor ""juried"" showings of work, and invite members of the community to display, and sometimes sell, their work. This will be an opportunity to share ideas with other artists, and to see public reaction to your own work.

, This is especially true of sculpture or ceramic projects, which may literally fall apart in during the creative process.

, Be very observing and pay attention to the whole world around you! From the trees in your local park, to how their golden leaves glow in the natural light, the world is full of shapes, textures, images, colors, and forms, and many of what are regarded as masterpieces were created using a simple, not beautiful subject, and the talent of a dedicated artist.

First you will have to write either your article or your book about the hobby in which you are successful and know very well.,
If you have a book, self-publish it.

,
Use the proper tools.,
Get Traffic To Your Site- Search engines are just one way to get free traffic to your site.,
Learn about copy writing - It's always good to know a little sale language to describe the benefits of the product you are selling.,
Show what you are selling: Product Photos- as mentioned earlier, people want to see what you're selling.,
Webpage Editor- Use one of these to create your web pages.,
Learn FTP- This stands for File Transfer Protocol.,
Get a good Domain Name- Your domain name should state the product you're selling, or as close to it as possible.,
ZIP Utility- You can find lots of great zip tools on the net for free.,
Choose a Payment Script- This is optional.,
Choose on a Payment Processor- This is a service that works with your bank.",How to Make Money Writing About Your Favorite Hobby," All good writers write about what they know.;
,, Here is a list of tools, and things you will need to know to get started selling on the internet:


Keywords- Search engines find websites by relevant keywords. When someone visits a search engine and types in “car models”, it's results show all the sites that are most relevant to “car models”. It's free, yet most people do not properly use this powerful tool.
If you want to sell custom model car videos, include these keywords in your domain name, the title of your web page, in the site description, and one of the two keywords (yes, only two) you should put in your sites “meta tags”.
Put variations of this phrase in every 6th or 7th line your main page text, and at least once in your image alt tags. Just don't overdo it, or the search engines will penalize your site. Find the right balance, and your website will rank very well.

Note: The top three search engines: Google, Yahoo, and MSN scan the web automatically, so there is no need to submit your site to those engines.



, The second best is writing articles about your keywords, putting them ON YOUR SITE FIRST, and then making subtle changes to them and submitting them to article directories like:


Article Dashboard http://www.articledashboard.com/

Article City http://www.articlecity.com/


, If you get really good at this, you could write your own ticket for more than just videos. People will buy on emotion, not on the facts. If you focus on “what's in it for them” (your customer), you might be surprised with your results.

, If it's a video, selling without a photo of it could kill your sales. It's been proven by the experts that product photos have increased sales and visitor actions up to 300%. If it's videos you're selling, try searching for “DVD Cover Design”, and see what you come up with for starters.

, There are other alternatives like WordPress or Blogger, Minisite templates, and BlinkWeb. If you graduated from the School of the Technically Declined, your best bet is using a pre-made template. Those tools make it easy for you to make a website. If you have a little more creative savvy, consider a free webpage editor like Dreamweaver to create the pages yourself.

, It's just another name for getting your files from your hard drive, to your website directory. You'll need a domain name and a host before you get a:

, The search engines will like your site a lot better if you do this right, and it will look more appealing in the search results, when someone is trying to find your website via a search engine like Google, Yahoo, or MSN Search.


Note: If you're new to the web, you might want to get your domain & hosting with the same company to make things easier for you.

, You will need them so you can compress your video package before uploading it to your website.

, When you use a payment script, you automate the order placement process so you don't need to constantly monitor your email inbox, and manually send out download links to the people who bought your product. The payment script, like DLGuard, or LinkLok PayPal, works in-between the buy button on your website, and the payment processor:

, There is no need to get a full blown merchant account when you're just starting out. PayPal, 2CheckOut, and ClickBank do a great job without the hassles and expenses of a merchant account. Not only can you receive money, but you can send people money as well.

Research the event beforehand.,
Prepare your credentials.,
Make contact with the press office.,
Be persistent in getting a press pass.,
Get the badge and keep it.,
Join a journalist union.",How to Get a Press Pass1," Special events include concerts, sports events, and other ticket holding events. The press pass for these events grants you free entry and sometimes allows you to go backstage to access for further coverage. Usually concerts will have a promoter separate from the venue that is responsible for granting these passes.Research the event and contact the venue for help tracking down who is in charge.;
, In order to get a press pass you're going to need credentials, or records that prove you work for a media outlet. Use previous articles or coverage that relates to the event you're interested in. It will benefit the promoters to see your style of work and your demographic as it pertains to the event in question.One of the best ways to prove your affiliation with a news source is to make contact using a work email address.
On your work email address, make sure to include a signature that says your role for the company. For example: ""Gerald Straton / Photographer and Editor for L.A. Underground News""
An ID produced by either your newspaper or broadcasting outlet may be helpful as well.

, Try to contact them as early as possible. Let them know who you are and who you work for. Often a press office will go by the name, public affairs office, or public relations. You may need to sell them on why they want access to an event, and how you would provide them with positive coverage.


You’ll be required to offer information about your publication or blog's followers that will benefit from the coverage.
Craft a simple but professional email pitch. You could begin with, “Hello, My name is ________ and I am an avid photojournalist from ________. I am reaching out with an interest in applying for a photo pass for the Switchfoot Fest this coming July.”, Some pre-planned events will issue badges to certified members of the media. In these situations, the issuing authority can be pretty tough on credentials. Keep pushing that you are there to cover the story. Try to convince them it would be a good idea to give you a badge.


Whoever issues the badges at the event will have a record of all the names who get access to the event.
You should start applying for press passes as soon as possible!

, Some photographers keep all the little press badges they get for several reasons. Badges act as trophies for the journalist, and serve as a visual indication that you’re an experienced journalist. You may find that you can get preferential access to major events by using an old badge alone.

, You can become a member of a journalist union that protects and helps freelance photographers and writers cover events. Some of the unions require a fee from you and benefit you with paying jobs and less hassle acquiring press passes.


The application process is straightforward with most writing unions. They ask that you provide samples and writing proof."

Research species and breed.,
Decide on a food source.,
Create a breeding plan.,
Study farming practices.,
Invest in capital.,
Find a good source for animals.,
Research the local milk market.,
Contact the government.,
Create a business plan.,
Mark each individual animal.,
Control the spread of disease.,
Give the animals proper nutrition.,
Milk the animal frequently.,
Understand the breeding cycle.,
Plan for changes in your herd.",How to Start a Dairy Farm," The most common dairy animals are cows, goats (good for a small farm), or water buffalo (in south Asia). Each one has many dairy breeds, and local knowledge is your best way to choose between them. Contact government institutions, university agricultural extensions, and established dairy farms and ask for info to help you make the decision:


Rule out breeds that can't thrive in your climate.
For each breed, divide annual upkeep cost by annual milk production to find production cost per unit of milk.
Is there local demand for the breed's milk (based on species and milk fat %)? What about for butter and cheese (where a high fat % is useful)?
How much time and money does it take to raise a calf to milk-producing age? How much can you sell the male calves for?;
, Concentrated feed requires less labor but more money. New farms often save on costs by supplementing it with Management Intensive Rotational Grazing (MIRG).Look at land rental prices in your area and determine how many cattle per acre it can support.


Livestock need about 4% of their weight in forage each day. Ideally, your pasture should produce more than this at peak season, so you can stockpile the surplus for winter.Renting land is usually better than purchasing for a new farm. Wait until your farm is well-established and you no longer need the financial flexibility.

, Dairy bulls have a reputation for dangerous behavior, and in any case raising one year round gets expensive. The safer options are paying for a bull's service at breeding time, or practicing artificial insemination (AI). AI is almost always the cheapest option, and has equal or higher success rates when performed correctly (ideally by trained AI techs).Artificial insemination programs are now widespread in India and many African countries. The savings are not as significant and the programs vary in quality, but it is still usually worth it.Male:female herd ratio varies between species and with the male's age. A young bull can typically service 20–25 cows, while a healthy, mature bull may be able to handle up to 40., If you don't have dairy farm experience already, take some time to learn about breeding, calving, manure management, weaning, milking cows, and crop management. Farming requires a great deal of time, work, and knowledge, so walk into it with open eyes.


If this is all new to you, try to get some work experience on another dairy farm first.

, A farm requires a large one-time expenditure to get started. Buying an existing dairy farm makes the task simpler, and can save money if you're willing to do some repairs yourself. Whether you plan to buy or start it all yourself, make sure you'll have the following facilities:A sterile facility for storing milk, and for pasteurizing if required in your area
Dry, sunny sheds or barns protected from weather and temperature changes
Milking parlor with stanchions
Feed storage and manure storage
Separate living space for calves
Equipment (including tractors) and equipment storage area
Well for watering cattle, plus water transport system to tanks in pasture
Irrigation system for pasture (optional)Note — if possible, give yourself room to expand to a larger herd

, Inspect all dairy animals personally before buying, including several milking tests. The animal should be healthy and vaccinated against disease. Ideally, purchase the animals right after calving, on its second or third lactation (when milk production is highest).Wait to buy the second half the herd until the first group is about to go dry, so your farm can produce milk year round., If you're starting with just a few animals, talk to nearby dairy farmers for advice on selling to local stores and individuals. If you have a slightly larger herd, you can get a more stable income by selling the milk to a company that will handle distribution.

, Your local or regional government may require permits and paperwork to run a farm, sell milk, irrigate your land, and/or hire staff to help you.

, Put all your financial estimates into a plan that covers the first few years of your business. In addition to the necessary items above, remember to include the estimated cost of veterinary care per animal, and the cost of any labor you plan to hire. Also look into an additional source of profit: selling manure.


Contact government institutions about subsidies and loans for farmers before you take out a loan from a bank.
Use the average milk prices (or slightly lower) over the past few years when estimating future profits. You don't want your business to go under if milk prices drop.
As a rule of thumb, you'll need one laborer per 10 milk animals, and one per 20 ""dry"" animals.This includes you and your family.

, Assuming you have more than a few animals, you'll need to mark them to tell them apart. This will help you track individual milk production and illness. Tagging is a common method.

, Always buy disease-free animals, and keep them isolated from other animals during transportation to your farm. Quarantining new arrivals (and animals that fall sick) is recommended, especially if they do not have trustworthy, recent health records. Your local government or veterinarian can give you specific advice about diseases in your area.


Equipment shared between farms can spread disease. Try to confirm where the equipment has been used and whether the animals there were healthy.Disease-carrying ticks are a major problem for livestock.Inspect animals for ticks regularly, and keep the shed area clear of brush.

, Feeding cattle and other livestock can be a complicated business. There are many different kinds of fodder and forage plants, which provide different amounts of energy, protein, roughage, and various nutrients. A veterinarian or experienced farmer can help you work with the food you have available.


Mineral licks and/or mineral supplements are an important part of the animal's diet.
Moldy feed or feed stored in the same area as pesticides and other contaminants can transfer dangerous toxins to the milk.Dairy animals have high nutrition requirements compared to animals raised for meat. Improper nutrition can lead to lower milk production or lower quality milk.

, Milk-producing animals typically need milking two or three times a day. Move the animal to a clean location. Wash and dry your hands and the udder before milking.If you've never milked an animal before, learn how to milk a cow or goat.

, You will need to breed your female animals regularly to keep them lactating as often as possible. The cycle of breeding, calving, and weaning calves has implications for the animal's nutrition needs, health, and of course milk production. Our guide on cows gives you the basics, but this will vary based on species and age.


Unlike farms that raise livestock for meat, you will be calving all year round to keep milk production steady. Keeping track of where each animal is in the cycle is vital so you can stick to a plan that keeps your income as regular as possible.

, Whether to sell, slaughter, or keep an animal is one of the toughest questions for a dairy farmer. Culling allows you to replace a low-yield animal with a higher-quality replacement, and to increase the genetic quality of your herd. Both of these factors are important, but performing them without a plan can add massive costs for replacement animals.Take this into account in your business plan, and include the cost/profit of producing each male and female calf as well.

Differentiate yourself from others who sell similar items at a farmers market by promoting the aspects that set you apart.,
Be consistent with your market location and attendance when you sell items at a farmers market.",How to Sell Items at a Farmers Market," If you notice that people are asking if you have bagged, pre-washed lettuce leaves instead of whole heads, modify your selection to include more bagged lettuce. When you sell items at a farmers market, these items should reflect what the local community wants.;
, Nobody wants to purchase wilted produce. If you are selling fragile items such as greens, place them in open tubs and surround them with ice cubes to ensure that they don't wilt in the hot sun.

, Shoppers attend farmers markets because they want to meet the farmer who grows their food and know exactly how the food is produced. If you are selling items at a farmers market that are pesticide-free, be sure to include that fact in a large banner or flyer handout on your table. Create a tabletop display and include photos of your farm to give customers a better idea of who you are.

, Although you may not always get to pick where your display is located, if you can do so, remember that a corner booth in the middle of the market is best. Pick a place far from your competition and stand as much as possible so people can see your enthusiasm about your products.

, Tasting is believing; if food is an item you sell at a farmers market, keep samples available. If you produce handmade crafts, hold a drawing for a free item. Sharing bargains leaves customers feeling good about your product.

, Never undercut your competition since doing so hurts everyone in the long run, by prohibiting each other from making a good living. Remember that handmade and fresh items have more intrinsic value than items that have been sitting on store shelves. If your product is unique or rare it should also fetch a higher price than similar mass-produced items.

, If you are the only local grass-raised beef producer in the county, be sure to include that in your banner and your handout materials. If you can create an aura of scarcity about your product, you will likely have more sales.

Make sure you need a government press pass.,
File for a government press pass.,
Apply for a pass for freelancers.,
Get the pass from your news agency.",How to Get a Press Pass2," You only need a government press pass if you are covering stories dealing with crime scenes, exclusive press conferences, or another type of non emergency event with police barriers. Government issued press passes are typically reserved for officials in the media. These types of press passes vary in access and eligibility from state to state.If you’re eligible for a press pass working for your blog in Kansas, things might be different in Chicago.
Government press passes expire after an allotted amount of time. Check with your local agency once obtaining one.
You can interview members of the government or police without a press pass.

, Do a quick search online to find out if your local city or town issues press passes. Some smaller towns don’t have an office responsible for issuing out press passes. The passes are typically associated with your local police department. Only new agencies covering crime investigation or government press conferences need to do this.


New York, for example, requires you to submit one or more articles or commentaries that’s been published in a 24 month time period. You also need to prove that you’ve covered six or more in person stories.Most applications can be completed through the police’s website.

, If you are a freelance news correspondent working for multiple agencies, you can still get a government pass. Write to your contacts at the separate news sources asking for proof of your employment. Some cities require three separate letters of identification.Other city agencies will only hand out government passes to reporters employed by an official news source.


Your reference letters should include verification of completed assignments from a media outlet.
Every city’s police department has different rules for freelance reporters.

, Many cities won’t accept applications and will only issue press passes through official news agencies. If you begin working for a news outlet, you should discuss government press passes to your superiors. You might learn that you’ll receive one if you are assigned a story requiring one.


Your agency will only give these out if they pursue events that require government passes.

Understand homemade press identification cards.,
Get the supplies.,
Create the ID on the computer.,
Print off the ID.,
Assemble your lanyard.",How to Get a Press Pass3," Many photojournalist and reporters create their own press pass using Photoshop or other photo editing software. For several events, you are issued an official press pass. However, you sometimes need further information. This is why many in the journalism field create a photo ID indicating their role.These IDs do not guarantee you access to the Paul Simon show or an interview with Seth Curry. These are for further establishing your credibility in the field.

, The most common way to portray a press ID is with a lanyard ID holder. You can purchase lanyard ID holders from most office supplies stores. You’ll also need a high gloss paper to print your graphic onto. It is best to have access to a photo editing software like Photoshop on a decent computer.


If you don’t have a good photo of yourself, you’ll need someone to help you take a high quality photo.

, Open Photoshop or another photo editing software on your computer. Create the document to the size of 3-⅛” x 2,” which is the normal size of badges. Decide if you want to create your badge in the landscape or horizontal orientation. Insert your photo to the document and crop the picture so it is a clear image of your face only.Next, you should insert minimal text explaining you are “PRESS” and your affiliating organization. Make the “PRESS"" or ""MEDIA"" in red or black text. You could also include if you’re a photographer or a journalist.
If your media organization has a logo, insert the logo onto the corner of the ID, or place the faded logo in the background.
Keep it simple to make it look as professional as you can.

, It is best to print onto thick, high gloss paper. Print off the ID and carefully cut out the badge. Make clean cuts when cutting out the outline of the ID. Print off multiple IDs on the same page, in case you mess one up.


Be sure your printer can handle color printing before beginning the process.

, Once you have your final cutout of your ID badge, you are ready to finish everything up. Insert the badge into the lanyard holder. You are now ready to hit the streets with your press badge. You could also include some references of your superiors on the back of the card.


Things you could include on the back are phone numbers, addresses, and other information someone might request from you.

Follow the guidelines from the publisher.,
Choose a standard paper.,
Use a professional-looking, readable font.,
Format the manuscript text correctly.,
Print your manuscript cleanly.",How to Get a Manuscript Ready for Publication2," Publishers adopted their guidelines according to what formats would be easiest for them to work with in processing manuscripts. Following the guidelines shows you're willing to work with them.

, Use standard, white, 20-pound bond letter-sized paper (8.5 by 11 inches or 21.5 by 28 cm), the kind you would use for your computer printer, photocopier or typewriter. Your work should stand out, not the paper it's printed on.


Although most publishers still like to see a printed copy of the manuscript, many also like to see an electronic copy of the manuscript as well, so you have a decided advantage if you have written your manuscript on a computer. (You may want to ask what word-processing format the publisher prefers if their guidelines don't already state this.)

, Preferred fonts are Times New Roman and Courier (which resembles typewriter output). Again, it is your work that should stand out, not the font.

, Prepare your manuscript as double-spaced text, with 1 1/2-inch (3.8 cm) margins on each side, and each paragraph indented half an inch (1.25 cm). You should also do the following:


Put your real name and contact information (address, phone number and e-mail address) in the top left-hand corner of the first page.
Put the word count and the rights being offered in the upper-right-hand corner of the first page. Although your word processor counts word-for-word, it isn't necessary to use so precise a count, as the editor counts words by the space they occupy in the finished product. You can get this by estimating a count of 250 words per double-spaced page.
Put the manuscript's title four spaces (two double-spaces) below your contact information, centered, with the title in all capital letters. Double-space, type ""by,"" then double-space again and type either your name or the pseudonym you write under.
Begin the manuscript text four lines (two double-spaces) beneath the title.
Include your name, followed by a dash and the page number, on each subsequent page.

, Print on one side of the page, in black ink, using either a laser or inkjet printer.

, In the U.S., avoid ""commodity crops"" like roses, carnations and chrysanthemums, which are grown outside of the country in places with labor and production costs are too low to compete with.

, The key is to find a niche market. One example is flowers that don't ship well (e.g. zinnias, snapdragons) because then you won't compete with wholesalers who bring in flowers from all over the world. Another example is growing dahlias in greenhouses during the winter, as you may be the only one providing it at that time. Vicki Stamback, a successful cut flower business owner in Oklahoma, recommends: ""The harder a flower is to grow, the more money-making potential it has...If you really want to make a name for yourself in the market, do something no one else is doing.""

,


Look through the phone directory to see which florists have the biggest ads. Ask them what they have the hardest time getting at a good price.
Farmers' markets are a possibility if the clientele are supportive of local farmers, but not if they attract bargain-basement shoppers.

, You will need to have several heated greenhouses and in order to turn a net profit, you need to know exactly how much it's costing you and how the flowers you sell are going to cover that and then some.

, How much do you need per square foot to break even? You should be generating at least twice that. Don't bother trying to undercut the wholesale prices; instead focus on providing a better product. Consult a publication like the USDA Wholesale Cut Flower Price Reports for reference.

, To set yourself apart from the wholesalers, develop strong relationships with your customers. The key to that is consistency. Many florists might be skeptical because local growers tend to come and go. Make your deliveries reliably, get a good reputation, and your business will grow through word of mouth.


Be willing to make emergency trips on the weekends, but only if they buy enough to make it worthwhile.
Return phone calls right away.
Drop customers who don't pay or who don't buy enough.

, You will need more employees during peak season than in winter. Don't try to do it all alone; if you want the business to be profitable, you need to be reliable, and in order to be reliable, you need help.

, Use organic methods if you can, but you may decide to use chemical treatment if an issue threatens to ruin an entire crop.

Answer price questions.",How to Price Your Product at a Farmers' Market," Start out with some proactive methods of measuring what consumers in a given area will pay for their produce, meat, eggs or other food items, or anything else that you want to sell a farmers' market.;
, Well-crafted surveys are a vital part of figuring out what prices will be tolerated in a given farmers' market setting.

, When possible, conduct informal surveys at farmers' markets to see what other vendors are charging for different kinds of products.

, When pricing farmers' market products, make sure that what you charge covers all of the costs put into producing and transporting the goods. Otherwise, the fledgling business will not be able to continue offering products to customers.


Take fuel costs and other portions of your expenses into account. A critical part of pricing any merchandise is understanding what the producer pays out in order to bring the goods to market. Price in specific extras to get a profit margin and stay in business.

, For the most successful outcomes, produce and other farmers' market products should be priced in accordance with what others are selling. Excessively high prices will lead to extremely low sales of items, and prices that are too low may not cover operational costs.

, Some experts indicate that the best and most successful farmers' market stands list all prices for their products clearly, so that consumers can easily figure out what they have to pay and how much they can afford.

, Specific markets have their own rules and regulations about selling products.

, When selling farmers' market products by the pound, it's helpful to have a precise, working set of scales. Some farmers' markets require this, and some don't, but in any case, these tools can help with any kind of sale by weight.

, Be prepared to answer any questions from customers about how your merchandise is priced, and why. Farmers' market booth keepers who can come up with good responses to consumer questions will ultimately be able to sell more products and stay in business in a competitive environment.

Schedule your plowing just before planting.,
Check your equipment.,
Clear the field of obstructions.,
Plan out the plow route.",How to Plow a Field1," The purpose of plowing is to get the field ready for crops to be planted. For this reason, the best time to plow is generally right before you plan to plant your crops. Generally, this means the beginning of the growing season, which can vary based on your location.


Technically, you can plow any time after the previous year's harvest and before the spring planting period. However, leaving too much time between plowing and planting can lead to soil erosion.A good guide showing the approximate start of various growing seasons in the continental U.S. is available here.;
, This is important if using a tractor or other mechanized plowing machine. Make sure all parts are in good working order following winter storage. Top off any fluids or lubricants and make sure the tires have adequate pressure.


If plowing by hand or using animal plowing, make sure the blades are straight and that whoever/whatever is pulling the plow is healthy and strong.

, Take a walk through the field, looking for any obstacles (like rocks, pieces of wood, and loose foliage) that can be removed. Try to get the field as level as possible by filling in small holes or smoothing out raised patches. Take note of any obstacles that you cannot remove (like trees, boulders, etc.).


Before plowing, the field should be mowed so that any vegetation is short and low to the ground. Too much vegetation can clog mechanical plows and make the work harder for manual plowing methods.

, To make the best use of your time and effort, plan a route that's as efficient as possible. Know where you will need to stop and turn the plow. You'll also want to make sure you know where the edges of your field are so you don't plow into another person's field or into a field already plowed and planted. Finally, plan to plow around any obstacles that can't be removed.


For rectangular fields, the most efficient path is generally to plow in the direction of the long sides of the field, turning around when you reach either end. This minimizes the number of times you will need to turn around.
Note, however, that if you are using animals, you should use the opposite approach for fields more than 150 meters long.In other words, plow in the direction of the short sides of the field. This prevents fatigue by giving the animals many chances to rest.
For non-rectangular fields, you can plow efficiently by following the contours of the field and working your way towards the center.

, Choose the tastiest one to try to plant, since plum seeds often carry on the traits of a parent plant very well.

,, The seed inside the pit will dry and shrink away, and you will be able to save it more easily. The shell will also crack more easily when dried., Place the pit horizontally between the two ends. Crack it gently.


Take care not to crack too hard. A smashed seed can’t be planted.

, This is what you need to sprout and plant.

, Drop your seed into it. If it sinks, you can germinate it, and if it floats, you should continue cracking pits until you get a viable seed., Use room temperature water.

, Wet the soil so that it is moist, but not overly wet.

, Shake the container so that the seed moves deeper into the loose soil.

, Place the jar or bag in the refrigerator to start the stratification process. This cool, sprouting process germinates the seeds so that they can be planted and grown into a tree.

, It is recommended that you plant at least two trees so that cross-pollinating varieties will come to fruit.

, Choose a slightly sheltered place that you can mulch and cover to avoid frost—a killer of young plum trees. It will need to be in full sun.

, Adding soil will also help it drain better.

, It should be a deep pot with drainage holes.

, Take care not to break these roots when transplanting.

, Create a small mound of soil in the center. Place the seed atop it and spread the roots around the mound.

, Space your trees about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.6m) apart., Water deeply before the ground dries out. Your plum tree should start bearing fruit in three to five years.

Use a spade to turn the soil up in rows.,
Rake the ground.,
Leave furrows for good drainage.",How to Plow a Field2," Starting in the corner of your plot or garden, plunge your spade a few inches into the ground. Turn the dirt oil, keeping most of the topsoil on top (the topsoil will be richer, softer, and darker than the soil underneath it). Repeat this process, proceeding down the edge of your plot, then doubling back when you reach the end. Leave turned-over rows (or furrows) a foot or two apart from each other.


In most locations, the topsoil is about six inches to a foot thick (though this can vary).

, Once you've tilled your plot into rows, go back over your work with a rake. Use the rake to break up large soil clods, loosening the soil so that it can accept seeds. You'll want this loose, broken-up soil to extend about two inches deep.


For most crops, aim to break the soil into clumps smaller than the size of a dime.

, As you rake the soil, take care not to flatten your plot with your footsteps. A flat field will retain too much water in the event of rain, which can lead to crop failures. Try to preserve the highs and lows of your furrows so that excess water is directed to the edges of the field.

"
"
Pick an appropriate tiller for the job.,
Pick an appropriate tilling depth and speed.,
Till in straight rows.,
Re-till if needed to break down the soil.",How to Plow a Field3," Most modern tillers come in one of two varieties: ""front-line"" (driven by the front wheels) and ""rear-line"" (driven by the rear wheels). Both will work for gardens and small fields, but if you have the choice, pick the type that's most appropriate. See below:



Front-line tillers are typically easier to use and better for smaller gardening situations. They handle like a power lawnmower and, with a little care, can be used in tight spaces without damaging plants or property on either side.

Rear-line tillers are a little harder to use but are better for bigger plowing jobs. They are bulkier and don't allow for as precise of turns, so they should be used away from plants and property you want to protect.

, Almost all mechanical tillers allow you to adjust these settings with controls on the unit. As a general rule, harder, compacted soils require slower, shallower plowing. Tilling too deep or too fast in this soil can overwork the motor. For established beds, you can use deeper, faster tilling.

, Position the tiller in the corner of your field where you plan on starting. Start the tiller with the starting mechanism. This can vary from unit to unit but is often similar to the type of mechanism you might expect on a lawn mower. Use the tiller's controls to slowly work your way down the plot in a straight line, turning around and doubling back at the end.


Some tillers have a safety switch that prevents starting. If you can't get the tiller started, check for one of these.

, Be prepared to go over your work a second time with the tiller. Any clods of dirt should be broken into roughly dime-sized pieces or smaller. When you're finished, your plot should be tilled into a series of loose furrows so that water can drain to the edges.

Pick a draft animal that is broken to the plow.,
Harness your animal to the plow.,
Start plowing in straight rows.,
If you can, switch out plow blades to get good furrows.",How to Plow a Field4," Several different animals are suitable for plowing. Among the most common are mules, horses, and oxen. Whichever animal you use should be broken to the plow — that is, it should be calm, comfortable and obedient with this sort of work. Working with an unbroken animal can be dangerous. Losing control while plowing can lead to injury for you or the animal.

, The exact sort of harnessing necessary will vary by animal and by plow. Get an expert to help you if you are unsure how to proceed — harnessing the animal incorrectly can hurt it. Below are general instructions:Catch the animal and bridle it. Place the metal bit in its mouth and secure the leather straps on either side.
Harness the collar around the animal's neck. Connect the collar to the harness draped over the animal's back. Fasten the harness to the collar.
Attach the trace chains from the harries, through the loops in the back band and belly band, and to the plow's singletree.
Don't forget the belly band if you're using a horse — because of the way horses' shoulders are constructed, the animal can be choked by the weight of the plow if the harness slips without this safety measure.

, Lead the animal to the corner of the field to be plowed. Have the animal walk forward as you plunge the blade of the plow into the ground to break up the earth. Walk between the handles behind the animal, controlling its speed so that it moves at a manageable pace. Use the plow's handles to control the angle and depth of the blade. Have the animal turn around when it reaches either end of the field and double back.


As noted above, for extra-long fields, it's best to plow in the direction of the short sides to give your animal more breaks.

, There are a few different ways to get straight, properly-spaced furrows when you're working with an animal plow. Here is one versatile method that uses a type of plow called a ""turning plow"" as well as a different variety called a Georgia stock plow:


First, use the turning plow to make two furrows with about 12 inches of unplowed space in between.
Next, plow about 4 inches inside the balk (the unplowed space). Do the same on the other side so you are left with about 4 inches of unplowed space in the middle.
When your whole field is tilled this way, switch to a Georgia stock plow with a 20-inch sweep. Plow right through the middle of the balk. You will be left with neat, orderly trenches you can drop your seeds into.

"
"
Level the plowing rig.,
Set the depth for your plow.,
Plow in even rows.,
Plow your end rows perpendicular to the rest.",How to Plow a Field5," For best results, the plow pulled by the tractor must be level from side to side and from front to back. The more plow blades on the rig, the more important levelness is.


To level the plow, take it to a concrete pad in your driveway or some other place that is perfectly flat. One of the two lower bars will be made for angling the plow from side to side. There are normally levers for the two hydraulic arms. The first lifts both arms up and down. The second is for the plow draft, or side-to-side angle. Adjust this lever until the plow is flat from one side to the other on the concrete (you can lay a carpenter's level on it to check).
If there isn't a plow draft lever, there should at least be a manual crank on the one arm that you can turn to adjust the angle.
Next, adjust the third upper arm so that the plow is level front to back. It may need further adjusting when you start plowing, as the plow should be level when it is sunk into the dirt and plowing.

, When you're using a mechanical rig, you can use hydraulic controls to change the depth of the plows as you work. You want the plow blades deep enough that they turn over the top layer of soil. However, the plow shouldn't be so deep that it is causes the tractor to labor hard. The exact way to adjust the plow's depth will vary from rig to rig.


There is normally a depth stop on the up and down lever for the plow's hydraulic arms. Set it so your plow stops at the proper depth each time you get to the end of your row and need to turn around and drop the plow again.
If the tractor starts pulling to hard raise the plow up a little then let it back down while keeping going. If the ground is when and you start spinning your wheels, pull the plow up fast

, Position your tractor with the plowing rig hitched behind it in the corner of your field. Start plowing your field in rows, using the hydraulic controls to lower the plows into the dirt. When you reach the end of a row, raise the plows out of the ground as you turn, then lower them again for the next row.


When using a tractor, you want to space out your furrows carefully because these will be the low, wet spots in the field. After you plow each row, there will be a rut at the one side of where you just plowed. When you turn around, your tractor's tractor should go into this rut. The next swipe should plow the dirt from the next row over into that rut, covering it up.

, When you're using a tractor to plow a large field, you need to worry about soil erosion. One way to fight this is to plow the end rows (the rows along the shorter edges of the field) at 90 degrees to your main rows. This way, the raises and furrows act as a protective barrier from wind and rain, keeping the soil from washing away.If you're not dealing with a perfectly rectangular field, your end rows may not be perfectly 90 degrees. This is OK — just get the opposing edges of the field as perpendicular to the main rows as possible.

Pack the silage well.,
Cover the pile immediately.,

Allow at least 2 weeks to pass before feeding.,
Take only as much as you need.",How to Make Silage," You will need to know when the right time to start silaging so that you get the crop cut at the right stage for the best feed quality possible.


Timing is crucial to get the crop cut at the right stage, harvest soon after, and have someone packing the pit as the loads are coming in. The pit will need to also be covered as soon as possible to avoid losses with spoilage.
You must have the right equipment and enough silage plastic available ahead of time so that you are not scrambling and trying to beat a fast-closing window of opportunity to get your crop in.
If you have not yet found a site for and installed a concrete bunker, or dug into the ground an open three-sided pit designed for storing silage, you will need to have this arranged and completed well in advance of silage-making season. Or, if you do not have a bunker or pit dug out and prepared for proper ensiling, you need to find a place where you can create a silage pile that is well-drained and easily accessible during times when you need to access it without much trouble.





;
, For most cereal crops, the best time to cut is when they are at the soft-dough stage. The majority of the plant should still be green, but with a bit of yellowish tinge, especially on the heads of the plant.


To test crop stage, squeeze a random kernel between your fingers to see how soft it is. At the soft-dough stage you should get a white, soft paste-like substance coming out from the seeds. If it's more liquid than paste, the crop isn't quite ready yet, but getting very close.
Corn will be at the same stage when it is ready to be harvested for silage. However, to test if corn is ready, take an ear of corn, tear off the husks and break the cob in half. An old rule of thumb is to look for the ""milk line"" (the line made where the solid and liquid parts of the kernels divide, and tends to progress from the outer edge of the kernel in towards the cob). This milk line should be half to two-thirds of the way in to the cob (the kernels are 2/3 yellow and 1/3 white, for example).
Weeds are a bit of a non-issue with a silage crop. It's being made into feed, not being sold for grain, and the animals aren't going to judge if they find a tiny bit of wild buckwheat in with the rest of the feed.

, Unlike with making haylage, the best machine to use to cut a crop with is a swather, not a hay mower. A windrower may be all right, but when cutting a thicker and taller crop like barley or oats, a swather is built for the heavier tonnage you will be getting off cropland than you would a perennial forage stand, usually. Also, a swather will not shred seeds off of the crop like you may find happen more often with a windrower.


It will be a different story with corn and sorghum, or sorghum-sudan grass. This step will not be needed for this type of crop because the swaths will be to large and difficult for a forage harvester to get through. Instead, these crops will be straight-cut, with a header that is suited for large-stemmed crops like corn. Straight-cutting small-cereals like barley and oats for silage is not an issue and an option to consider. With swathing, though, it actually allows the crop to dry down a bit more than if left standing, allowing you to harvest it at a lower moisture than what you would get if harvesting it as a standing crop.
Straight-cutting small-cereals like barley and oats for silage is not an issue and an option to consider. With swathing, though, it actually allows the crop to dry down a bit more than if left standing, allowing you to harvest it at a lower moisture than what you would get if harvesting it as a standing crop.
Silage should be put up at around 60 to 70% moisture for best preservation activity. A higher moisture silage will be more prone to seepage or freezing, making things difficult for transport. Nutrients are also lost with the seepage, particularly nitrogen that has been broken down by microbes in the silage. Lower moisture may not guarantee the best fermentation activity, particularly if silage is put up at less than 40 to 45% moisture.

, The forage will need to be dried down to about 60 to 70% moisture before chopping for silage.


Silage can be put up at higher moisture, but as mentioned above seepage will be an issue. Also, the low temperature fermentation activity can provide a suitable environment for undesirable clostridial bacteria that are prone to cause maladies like listeriosis and botulism.

, Machines called ""forage harvesters"" like the one in the photo above (which is a ""self-propelled"" harvester) are used to chop up the swathed forage and feed it out through a long, tall spout that can literally ""spit"" out the feed at quite a distance.


The forage harvester's cutter blades will need to be set at the right setting so that the forage is cut at the right chop-length. For small grains, set the blades so that they are cutting up forage between 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm) and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Larger crops like corn and sorghum-sudan should be chopped at lengths from 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm).
Since the forage harvester does not have a storage compartment on it like combine harvesters do, a truck with a silage unit on it, a tractor with a silage wagon, or a large unit designed for collecting silage from the forage harvester–called a ""Jiffy wagon""–needs to be used to collect the freshly cut forage.

The Jiffy wagon, for example, acts as the storage compartment for the forage harvester. Once full, it can be dumped into a truck as shown in the sequence of photos here.



















, Once the truck or silage wagon is full, the unit will need to be taken to the designated pit or pile area to drop off the load. Make sure the loads are placed as close to each other as possible. When first starting the pile, the first several loads must be place where the pile is going to be. After that they are placed close to the built pile, and dumped in a way that is easy for the person in the ""packing unit"" to move into a pile; i.e., parallel to the pile, and/or in the same direction the pile will be built up as.


An exchange is made between the wagons and/or trucks so that the person operating the forage harvester doesn't need to stop and wait every so often. Once the first truck is full, the harvester stops briefly so that the truck can pull away and the second one moves into position. The first truck returns after dropping its load off to get another load, and so the process repeats.

, The silage pile must be packed very well, and should be packed down during and after each harvesting day. In a large operation where several people are employed, it would be beneficial to have one (a brave one that is not afraid of heights especially) stay behind to operate another tractor or large loader that will continuously gather and pack the pile well. Tractors with dual wheels are recommended to provide the best packing power possible.


Packing is what helps encourage fermentation activity and discourages spoilage. The more the pile is packed down, the less pockets of oxygen there are. Oxygen pockets create spoiled feed; aerobic-loving bacteria turn it into a brown to black slimy mess, that often smells like tobacco or burnt caramel. In other words, instead of fermenting the feed (which is producing a significant amount of acid as a means to preserve the feed), the presence of oxygen decomposes it into a substance equivalent to manure. You don't want feed that is messy and gross like manure (think cow poop). If you don't like the look, feel and smell of it, neither will your animals!
Silage piles must be longer and wider than they are tall. The higher the pile is built up, the wider the edges will need to be. A concrete bunker will control how wide you can make the pile, though you can pack several feet above, but only so much that the sides are not over-flowing.

A rule of thumb for pile-size is larger at the base than the top; no less than 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) wide at the top to prevent roll-overs or slippage from machinery; and silage piles should only be 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) tall, mainly for farm safety reasons.


The best way to tell if you have done a good packing job is when you try to sink your fingers into the pile. If you only get in so far as your second knuckles of your first three fingers, then the pile has been packed very well, and has potential for being good feed in the winter with minimal spoilage.

, Use the proper plastic recommended for covering silage. Often recommended and used is polyethylene plastic that may be black on both sides or white on one side and black on the other. The cheaper stuff is all black, but the better quality is the black and white plastic.

Use 6 to 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) plastic. This can be found at your local farm and ranch supply store. The heavier the plastic, the more effective it is at keeping oxygen out of the pile and reducing wastage with spoiling.

The rolls are very heavy. Use a tractor loader with bucket teeth to carry the plastic to the pit so that you can unroll and unfold it.
A trick to use is to insert a 6 feet (1.8 m) long, heavy iron bar into the roll (like you would hanging a roll of toilet paper on a toilet-paper holder), and fashion thick wire or heavy chain that hangs on the teeth of the bucket. Hang the bar onto this.
Important: White and black plastic must be used so that the white side is facing out, and the black against the fresh silage in the pit. The white side reflects sunlight and reduces excess heating from the sun, whereas the black side keeps heat inside.


Trim off extra plastic and use that to cover the edges and sides that the plastic has not covered.

, Use numerous old or recycled tires all over the top part of the pile. Hay bales can also be used to hold down plastic on the sides if the silage pile is not in a bunker.


Old tires are much more gentler on the plastic because they do not cause punctures. Punctures are a serious danger of feed spoilage.
All sides and all parts of the pile must be covered and held down well so to ensure the pile properly ensiles and spoilage is minimized.

, Holes in the plastic can cause massive spoilage problems over time.


Spoilage will not be localized, especially if the holes go from a tiny tear to a big rip, especially if wind is a problem.

, This will give the feed enough time to ferment and pickle, and develop that fermented sourish smell that is often associated with silaged feeds. If you wish to wait longer, then that's fine too.

, Only take so much off the face as you need to feed. It may take practice to understand how much of the face to scrape down and gather for feeding, but the mathematics with calculating how much face to remove to feed a certain number of animals per feeding can be done for more accuracy, and to obtain a good pit face for your pile. Good pit faces reduce excessive spoilage or secondary heating."

Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.
To protect your lungs, put on a respirator with an organic vapor-removing cartridge or canister approved for use with potent pesticides.
Protect your skin by wearing thick chemical-resistant gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, closed-toe shoes with socks, and a chemical-resistant apron.;
, You'll need to use a chemical spray tank approved for use with potent pesticides, and this spray tank must have a motorize agitator. Thoroughly clean all equipment using by flushing it out with hot water before use.









Verify that the tank and hose are both in proper working condition and free from cracks, holes, or other forms of damage.
Equip the sprayers with nozzles that provides accurate, uniform application, and make sure that the sprayer is accurately calibrated before you mix the chemical.

, When available, you should always check the instructions that come with the package of diazinon to verify the proper concentration and spray amount to prepare based on crop type.









If the instructions on the package of diazinon vary from those described here, follow the package instructions instead of following these.
If you do not have the instructions, the information provided here should apply to the vast majority of circumstances.

, Expect to apply a total of 300 to 400 gallons (1200 to 1600 L) of water per 1 acre (4000 square meters).









For most fruit and nut crops, you will need to add 1 to 1-1/2 pints (500 to 750 ml) of liquid Diazinon AG500 per 100 gallons (400 L) of water.Alternatively, add 1 to 1-1/2 lb (450 to 675 g) powdered Diazinon 50W per 100 gallons (400 L) of water.

, You will need to apply a minimum of 1 to 2 gallons (4 to 8 L) of prepared diazinon for every 1000 square feet (9.3 square meters) of ground.









For most vegetable crops, mix 2 to 4 qt (2 to 4 L) of liquid Diazinon AG500 per 2 gallons (8 L) of water.
Alternatively, mix 4 to 8 lbs (1800 to 3600 g) of powdered Diazinon 50W per 2 gallons (8 L) of water.

, The maximum amount of prepared pesticide you should use on ornamental crops should not exceed 200 gallons (800 L) per 1 acre (4000 square meters) of ground.









When using Diazinon AG500, mix 1/2 fl oz (15 ml) per 3 gallons (12 L) of water or 1 pt (1 L) per 100 gallons (400 L) of water.
When using Diazinon 50W, mix 1 lb (450 g) for every 100 gallons (400 L) of water.

, Place half of the total water you'll need in the mix tank. Turn on the tank agitator before proceeding any further.









Note that hydraulic and mechanical agitation works best. Air agitation is not recommended when mixing diazinon.

, With the agitator running, add the total amount of diazinon you need to the water already in the tank.









Diazinon comes individually packaged in 1 lb (450 g) packages. Open the outer bag, but do not open the inner bag. The inner bags are translucent and water-soluble.
Do not open the water-soluble bag when adding the diazinon. Instead, add the entire packet, and allow the bag to dissolve in the water. As the bag dissolves, the diazinon inside will be released into the water. This should happen within three to five minutes.
Note that you must also handle the water-soluble bags with care. Do not allow them to come into contact with moisture before you add them to the spray tank.

, After a few moments, add the remaining amount of water to the mix tank.









Try to direct the water directly over the water-soluble bags of diazinon. Doing so can help speed up the mixing process.
Watch the solution mix for a few minutes. The diazinon must dissolve and disperse completely into the water before you apply the pesticide.
Do not turn the agitator off while adding the water. You should not turn it off after the diazinon and water finish mixing, either.

, You should only prepare enough diazinon for your immediate needs. After the pesticide and water mix, you should apply the product immediately.









Do not allow the mixture to remain in the mix tank overnight.
Do not stop agitating the mixture at any point during the application process. Maintain the maximum amount of agitation until all of the mixture has been applied to the designated area.

, After applying the diazinon, you should thoroughly flush all of the spray equipment with clean, running water.









Collect the rinse water in chemical-resistant buckets and apply it to the area you just treated. Do not allow the rinse water to drain into the sewage system or into natural sources of water.

Familiarize yourself with the citrus plants and trees being grown.,
Make alternations in environmental quality.,
Supervise the health of the trees.,
Pay attention to changes in weather, especially extreme cold spells.,
Delegate tasks to other employees at the citrus tree nursery.,
Market to your customer base through appropriate channels.",How to Manage a Citrus Tree Nursery,"


Though citrus trees may seem to have a lot of common, significant differences between breeds and varieties do exist. Learn how much water, sunlight, and fertilizer is required to support the citrus trees under your care.;
,


If the citrus trees in your nursery require more water, fertilizer, or sun exposure than is currently being provided, it is up to you as the nursery manager to change this.
Increase the water supply of the citrus trees through automatic irrigation systems or additional manpower. Adjust soil pH by increasing or decreasing the amount of fertilizer provided to the trees. Finally, sunlight exposure can be managed through the addition or removal of overhead canopies.

, Walk through the citrus tree nursery at least once per week to examine the trees for signs of disease or damage.


Broken limbs, dry leaves, and discolorations are all possible signs of citrus tree illness or damage by weather or other environmental causes.

,


Citrus trees are typically fickle when it comes to cold weather. Watch the local weather predictions on a daily basis, and be prepared to cover the trees quickly when a freeze warning is issued. Covering citrus trees can be a time consuming task, so invoke the assistance of other employees when possible.

,


Though you as the manager of the citrus tree nursery, are in charge of the entire facility, it is impossible to perform all duties required to keep it operating. Determine which tasks are not manageable for you, and assign these tasks to employees. Make sure that each employee is familiar with the task assigned before he or she performs it on their own.

,


Without customers, your citrus tree nursery will go out of business quickly. Determine who your customers are, and advertise directly to them. If your main customers are individual community members, running television commercials, placing ads on the radio, and putting up billboards is ideal.
In contrast, if you are marketing to larger commercial organizations, such as schools, restaurants, and other retailers, making phone calls, sending emails, and scheduling interviews is appropriate.

This type of coverage will pay to repair your car after the crash.If you are the livestock owner, then you should check whether you have general farm insurance coverage.Take out your copy of the policy and check to see whether the policy covers collisions. It should also pay for the defense of any lawsuit.;
, Call your insurance agent and report the accident. You will probably have to provide certain information. Typically, insurers request the following:your policy number
your contact information (phone and address)
the date and location of the collision
a description of the collision

, You need to report the accident to the police. Since the livestock owner probably doesn’t know that the animal escaped, the person who collided with it should call the police as soon as possible. An officer will come out to write up a police report.


You should get a copy of this report. Your insurer will want a copy. You will also need a copy if you have a lawsuit.
The police report can also identify any witnesses to the collision.Read the report to identify these witnesses. You might need them to testify in a lawsuit.

, Most states should have laws on animal collisions with moving vehicles.You can find your law by checking online or by visiting your nearest law library, which could be at the courthouse.


In some states, there are “open range” laws. This means that cattle and other animals have the right of way on roads. If a driver hits the cattle, then the driver must pay for the loss of the animal and can’t sue for their injuries.If you are not in an “open range” state, then a driver can get compensated for their injuries if they can show that the livestock owner was “negligent” in keeping the livestock off the road., Negligence is the legal cause of action most people will sue under. Negligence exists whenever a person owes you a duty of reasonable care and fails to exercise that reasonable care. If you are injured because of that failure, then you have a case for negligence.In order to find negligence, the livestock owner must have intentionally let the animal walk on the highway or have been sufficiently careless keeping it penned in. For example, a livestock owner who doesn’t check or repair broken fences has probably been negligent. Also, an owner who leaves a barn door open or a gate unhitched has typically been negligent.

, You are an important witness, whether you were driving the vehicle or if you own the livestock. Write down relevant memories as best as you can. For example, note the following:


If you were the driver, then explain the crash. Describe how fast you were going and whether you had enough time to swerve. Also note if anyone was on the road with the animal.
If you were the livestock owner, then note what actions you took to keep your livestock from escaping. Write down how often you checked fences and whether you closed the gate to keep the livestock in. Also note whether you have had livestock escape before and what action you took to keep it from happening again., You have options for how to resolve the dispute. If you are covered by insurance, then your insurer will probably take the lead on reaching a settlement. However, if you don’t have insurance, then you might want to resolve the dispute using negotiation or by going to court. You can also go to court if the insurer won’t meet your demands. You should discuss your options with a qualified attorney.


You can find an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.Remember to request a personal injury attorney.
Once you have a referral, call up the attorney and ask to schedule a consultation. Check how much the attorney charges for the consultation.

, Settlement negotiations will focus on money. For that reason, you need to understand how much the injury is worth in a lawsuit. For example, if the value of the injury is $100,000, then you want to know that fact before heading into settlement discussions.


If the driver is injured, then they can be compensated for any damage to their vehicle, medical bills, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and lost wages.If you are in an open-range state, then the livestock owner can get compensation for the value of the livestock., Settlement is voluntary, and either side can get up and walk away if they can’t come to an agreement. You should figure out what your best alternative is to settlement. This is called your BATNA.For example, you might be the driver who has a strong case for negligence against the livestock owner. In this situation, going to trial might be your best alternative. For this reason, you can be aggressive in negotiations, and you might not want to settle unless the livestock owner can meet your demands.
However, you might not have strong proof that the livestock owner was negligent. In this situation, you might be less aggressive because your best alternative isn’t a slam dunk.

, Because negotiation is voluntary, you should identify the absolute minimum you are willing to settle for. This is your walkaway point. If the other side can’t meet it, then you end negotiations.Your walkaway point will largely depend on the attractiveness of your BATNA. As the driver, a stronger alternative means you can probably get close to the full value of the injury in a settlement.
However, as the livestock owner, you might be able to pay a lot less if you think the driver has a weak alternative.

, The person who was injured needs to send a demand letter to the other side. In this letter, you explain the incident. If you are the driver, then you will want to talk about the medical treatment you have received, as well as the repairs done to your car.Your claims agent or lawyer will probably handle negotiation for you. However, it is also possible that you are negotiating on your own. If so, then see Write a Demand Letter Instead of Hiring an Attorney for more information.

, Negotiation consists of back-and-forth, with one side making an offer and then the other making a counteroffer. The purpose of negotiation is to reach an agreement by slowly working towards a point you both can agree to.

, If you reach agreement, then the claims agent should memorialize the agreement in a document called a “settlement agreement.” The agreement should contain all of the necessary terms of the settlement.


If you are the person having to pay money to the other side, then make sure to get a “release” as part of the settlement agreement. This release is a promise not to sue you again based on the same incident.If you were negotiating on your own, then see Write a Settlement Agreement for tips on how to draft this document.

, Although you might have consulted with a lawyer soon after the collision, you should also think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. Lawsuits can be complicated, and you would benefit from an experienced lawyer’s expertise.


If costs are a concern, then ask the lawyer if they offer “discrete task representation,” also called “unbundled” legal services. Under this arrangement, the lawyer only does the work you give them while you handle the rest of the case.For example, you might want them only to represent you at trial, or to coach you. Using unbundled legal services is a good way to keep legal bills low.

, The person who has been injured will bring the lawsuit. Unless you are in an “open range” state, most lawsuits will be started by the person driving the car that hit the livestock. This person is the “plaintiff,” and they will file a “complaint” in court. The plaintiff then arranges for a copy of the complaint and a “summons” to be served on the defendant.If you are sued, then you will need to file a response to the complaint. Generally, you will file an “answer,” in which you respond to each allegation made in the complaint. You should admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each individual allegation.
A defendant can also raise certain affirmative defenses. For example, the plaintiff might have waited too long to sue. Each state has a “statute of limitations” for negligence, which will differ by state., Most lawsuits have a lengthy fact-finding period called “discovery.” Discovery is your chance to get information that will be helpful to your case. You can ask the other side to answer questions under oath and to produce documents.If you are suing the livestock owner, then you will want to figure out exactly what the owner did to keep the livestock off the road. You can ask to inspect the property and look at fences or barns to see if they are in disrepair. You can also ask the owner how often they checked the fence.
If you are the livestock owner in an “open range” state, then you might not need much information in discovery. For example, the police report will serve as proof that the driver hit your livestock. You don’t have to prove that the driver was negligent. However, if you are defending yourself in a state that isn’t open range, then you will want documents from the plaintiff, such as copies of all medical records and bills. You will also want to ask questions about whether the plaintiff was driving carefully or whether they carelessly slammed into your livestock.

, When discovery ends, most defendants will file a motion for summary judgment, which asks the court to end the litigation immediately and rule in their favor. To be successful, the defendant will have to argue that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that even if they made every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose.


To defend against this motion, you can file a response. Your response will include evidence and affidavits that persuade the judge that there are factual issues that need to be hashed out in court.Because summary judgment is available to end lawsuits that have no business being in court, you will defeat the defendant's motion so long as you convince the judge you have a chance of winning at trial.

, Trials are incredibly expensive and time consuming. As a final effort to avoid one, you should reach out to the defendant at this point in the litigation and try to resolve your dispute. This is a good time to negotiate because both parties have gathered facts through discovery and have a good idea of what the judge is thinking after going through summary judgment proceedings. Some courts may even require settlement discussions. Start by talking informally with the defendant. If no agreement is reached, try alternative dispute resolution tactics.


Ask the defendant if they will submit to mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with both parties, together, and attempt to find unique solutions. The mediator will not inject their own opinions and they will not take sides.
If mediation is unsuccessful, try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear evidence presented by both parties. After evidence has been presented, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion, which will lay out who has the stronger case and what an award might look like. The parties can then decide whether they want to agree to the terms of the arbitrator's opinion.

, At trial, you will present evidence in the form of documents and witness testimony. You should spend time carefully figuring out what evidence you want to present. If you are the driver, then you need to show that the other side was negligent. You also need to establish the full extent of your injuries. You might want to introduce the following evidence:


Your own testimony. You can testify about the collision and about how you are feeling.
The testimony of any passenger in your vehicle.
Medical records that show the extent of your injury.
Medical bills and receipts for treatment or prescription drugs.

, At a trial, the person suing presents evidence first and then the defendant goes second. Each side gets to cross-examine the other side’s witnesses.If you have a lawyer, then they can handle the entire trial.


If you are representing yourself, then see Represent Yourself in Court (U.S.) for more information about how to conduct a trial.

, After all evidence has been presented, the judge will read the jury its instructions and let them retire to deliberate.If you didn’t request a jury, then the judge can issue the ruling from the bench.

, If you lose, you might want to appeal. With an appeal, you ask a higher court to review the verdict. If the appeals court finds that the judge made serious errors, then they can set aside the verdict.Appeals are time-consuming and costly. For example, you will need to have transcripts of the trial created. This can cost thousands of dollars. You should discuss whether to appeal with an attorney.
Avoid delay. You generally get very little time to file your Notice of Appeal with the trial court. In many courts, you get only 30 days from the date final judgment is entered. In some states, you get even less time.

If you need a portable fence, purchase lightweight equipment such as polywire and tape, plastic posts, battery-powered energizers, and reels. If you need a permanent fence, purchase high-quality insulators, self-insulating electro-wood, or wooden posts. High-tensile wire should be used to fence livestock while electro-rope and tape work well for horses.





;
, Horses are best fenced with conductors that are highly visible, such as rope and tape. Slower-moving animals, such as cattle and sheep, can be fenced with steel wire or polywire. Regardless of the animals you are containing, the structure needs to be strong and stable because nocturnal, feral animals and other wildlife will fail to see the wires and run into the fence. If the fence is not strong, these frequent hits will knock the fence down.

, The type of energizer you choose depends upon the fence's length, the amount of vegetation that may grow on the conductors, the type of fencing material, the type of animals, and whether or not a 230-volt power source is readily available.


Use a mains-powered energizer whenever possible. This type of energizer is located inside a building and does not use batteries. The cost to operate a mains-powered energizer is low.






Use a dry battery-powered energizer if your electric fence is moved on a daily or frequent basis. You will need an internal battery, such as an ESB25 or ESB115. Dry battery-powered energizers are easy to relocate and require no maintenance. Although these type of energizers are not rechargeable, they usually last 4 to 6 months before they need to be replaced.






Use a wet battery-powered energizer if your electric fence will be permanent or moved infrequently. More specifically, a12v energizer with a 12v 80 ampere-hour (Ah) leisure battery will work. Wet battery-powered energizers are more powerful than the dry type and can operate longer electric fences.







, For the electric fence to work correctly, it needs to have optimal conditions for its operation. For example, electric current flows better in wet conditions than in dry conditions. Regardless of the battery system you are using, use at least a 3.3-foot (1 m) galvanized earth stake should be used. If you are using a mains energizer and must operate on poor soil conditions such as light or sandy soil, more than 1 earth stake could be necessary. If additional stakes are used, space them 9.8 feet (3.0 m). (3 m) apart, and connect them with a lead-out cable.

, For temporary or portable fencing, use a fence line tester. For permanent fencing, use an LED voltmeter. To operate either type of tester, push the probe into the ground, and touch the tester terminal to the fence. Be sure to test at the furthest end from the energizer to get an accurate measurement of the voltage. The fence should have a minimum of 3000 volts. If it is lower, the livestock will not get sufficient shock and will cause problems.

, Use a metal bar or earth stake at least 328 feet (100.0 m). (100 m) from the stakes, and short the electric fence to earth. One probe of the voltmeter must be connected to a stake. The other probe should be pushed into the ground as far away from the stake as possible. If the reading is 400 or 500 volts, the fence is fine. If it reads less than 400 or 500 volts, the condition of the earth needs to improve.

, (1 m) apart. Connect the top of each stake with lead out cable. Re-check the voltage. Remove the short from the fence by removing the metal bar or stake.

, Transfer power under the gate from 1 side to the other with an under-gate cable. Permanent and temporary gates should be wired identically.

, Connect your high tensile wire or electro-rope and tape with insulators, depending on which type of animal you are fencing in. Your wire or electro-rope will come with instructions on how to properly space it.

Curb or step hopping.",How to Use a Manual Wheelchair," Especially if you are learning, keep your fingernails trimmed short so they are less likely to tear. You may want to wear fingerless gloves, such as weightlifting gloves, to protect your hands from both dirt and injury.;
, A manual chair meant to be under the control of its occupant will have a metal rim intended for the hands, called a push rim. This rim does not touch the ground. It may be easier for you to grip the whole wheel (both the rim and the tire). Either way is fine.

, To go forwards, reach backwards and grip the the wheels as far back as you can. Push the wheels forward by keeping hold of the rims and moving them in a forwards direction.

, Reach forwards and grip the wheels, and push them backwards. Be careful, as the little wheels at the front will need to swivel round. Don't forget to look behind you!

, Hold the right wheel still, and push the left wheel forwards.

, Hold the left wheel still, and push the right wheel forwards.

, If in a tight corner, you may need to spin on the spot. Push one wheel forwards and the other one backwards simultaneously.

, Grip the rims and use friction to slow them down. Pinch the push rim between your thumb and the side of the first joint of your index finger. If the rims are wet, pinch the tire instead. Use caution, as this friction creates heat that can burn your hands if you are on a slope or stopping suddenly.

, If you will be staying still for some time - e.g. to sit at a table - or you will be using your hands for something - e.g. to take off your coat - then put the brakes on -- or else you might roll backwards!

, Avoid bumps where possible.

Go slowly at first. Hitting a bump (even one as small as 1cm) at speed can catapult you out of your chair and across the floor.






It is useful to practice popping a wheelie to lift front wheels off the ground long enough to go over a small bump.






Back over the bump. Larger obstacles such as curbs can be traversed by backing up them slowly and safely. Do not back down a large obstacle or you will tip over.







, With good balance, some people can go down a curb or step. This takes practice.

Stop before the curb and concentrate. Think with your wheels and your center of gravity. Be one with the chair.






Lean slightly forward during takeoff.






In mid air, you will need to correct by steadying yourself a little bit backwards, so that your back wheels hit very slightly before your front wheels. Be careful not to fall backwards.






Best practiced with a helmet, and start with a small step.

Plan ahead.,
Assess the forage crop.,
Cut the crop into swaths or windrows.",How to Make Haylage1," It's important to know when the right time to start producing haylage is so that you are going to take off the best quality feed AND avoid a huge, ugly, spoiled mess. Do not decide to make haylage when hay has been down and rained on for weeks because the risk of having moldy or pour-quality feed increases the longer the hay has been laying in the swath.


Timing is important for not only when the forage crop needs to be cut, but also to chop it up while the weather is good, have someone packing the pit as more fresh haylage is collected, and to cover it up as soon as possible to allow it to ferment.
If you have not yet found a site for and installed a concrete bunker, or dug into the ground an open three-sided pit designed for storing haylage, you will need to have this arranged and completed well in advance of haylage-making season. Or, if you do not have a bunker or pit dug out and prepared for proper ensiling, you need to find a place where you can create a haylage pile that is well-drained and easily accessible during times when you need to access it without much trouble.
When making baleage, it's doubly important to have the correct plastic and equipment set up so that bales can be wrapped up as soon as possible to avoid heating. You must have bales wrapped up as immediately as possible, and not let it go for longer than 12 hours after baling, regardless if you plan on individually-wrapping bales or putting them in a tube.;
, Haylage is best made when grass plants are pre-bloom or early flowering (late boot to early head) stage, or when legumes are at 10% bloom. Grasses should just start heading out.


Any perennial forage species or mix can be used for haylage. A good hay crop is generally weed-free if maintained as a thick stand, but if there are weeds in with crop take note of what they are and their potential issues with livestock.

Many weeds found in a perennial forage stand are not a danger to livestock when they do not take up the majority of the hay stand. If you only find a few weeds with the crop, and most of it is grass and/or legume mix, then not to worry, as they are very likely to not cause an issue in your animals.


Perennial forage species that can be used for haylage include (and not limited to) timothy, bermuda grass, alfalfa, red clover, smooth bromegrass, sainfoin, cicer milk vetch, tall fescue, Kentucky  bluegrass, orchardgrass, fenugreek, lespedeza, bahiagrass, other fescue and brome grasses, and many others.
A good rule of thumb to know is that the younger the plant, the higher the nutrient content. Most domesticated forage crops should be at least 8 inches tall before being cut or even grazed.

, Any hay mower will work, as long as they will cut in wide swaths. Conditioners may be necessary if you are planning on harvesting it as low-moisture (40 to 60% moisture) haylage, described below.


It may be good to avoid teddering or raking the mowed forage together because it fluffs up the plants into swaths and make them dry out more than you would want for haylage. Plus, they make the stems and leaves stick out at random intervals, reducing the effectiveness of a tight bale (if you are wanting to bale it up as baled silage).

However, teddering has its advantages. If the forage crop contains too much moisture and you want to put it up at a good moisture content where it's not going to be too wet, then tedders and/or rakes may be needed.


If you wish to have the forage cut into swaths, the next best machine to use is a swather or windrower. The swaths will be stacked higher and tighter than what a mower will make, making the process of gathering the swaths, especially if the crop is thick, a slow-moving process.

Make changes if necessary.",How to Make an Automatic Chicken Feeder," Because the feed holes will be placed near the bottom, a wheeled bin might get in the way of the feed holes you’ll want to make. A 30 gallon trash bin should be enough to hold 150 pounds of chicken feed.


While you’re at a hardware store, pick up six pipe elbows and six pipe end caps.;
, Make your marks equally spaced from one another. This will maximize the effectiveness of your feeder.









These holes should be located near the bottom of the bin.
The marks should denote where the saw should start., When you pick up a hole saw, you should make sure the diameter matches the pipe you’re using. There should be six holes made for a 30 gallon trash bin.









If you are using a smaller bin size, you should use a lesser amount of openings as best suits the bin.
It’s a good idea to spin the hole saw in reverse. This will result in a cleaner cut.

, These windows will allow the grain to pour in inside the bin.








, Once you've made the proper openings in the back of each pipe fitting, fit them to protrude out of the holes you made with the hole saw. Reach into the bin and fit them from the inside out. It's a good idea to do this immediately upon making the holes and modifying the pipes. If your holes aren't big enough, you can make the holes slightly bigger with a precision knife. Excess gaps can be covered over with caulking if need be.









The ""female"" end of the PVC pipe should fit on the inside of the feeder bin.

, Cut the top two thirds out of each of your pipe caps. When it comes time, you will place them on the feeder holes with the remaining third of the cap placed on the bottom.









This may be done with a precision knife.
It's good idea to sand down the edges you cut to prevent roughness.
Offering a “window” (rather than an open hole) will prevent the chickens from unnecessarily wasting the feed., Fix them onto the fronts of your PVC feeder holes. Try to make the bottom third as level to the ground as you can. Chickens will be sticking their heads in, and an uneven window can make it difficult for them to properly access the grain.








, Particularly if you're tending your chickens in a rainfall-heavy area, squeeze a caulking tube around the outside edge where the PVC tube and bin meet. This will waterproof the cracks, helping to ensure that moisture won't be able to get in when the feeder isn't in use., This is an optional step, as bigger bins should be secured naturally by the weight of the chicken grain., This also has the effect of keeping the grain away from ground level, where dirt and grime my risk getting mixed in with the grain.

, Securing your chicken feeder with a lid will make sure that nothing unwanted falls in. it’s also a good idea if there’s a risk of rainfall entering and damaging the grain. Most garbage bins will come with a pre-fitted lid., Place your feeder somewhere where your chickens will be able to access it easily. To load the feeder with grain, remove the lid and insert the grain by the bucketful. Because the grain's weight can be used to stabilize the feeder, you should make a habit of keeping the feeder at least half-full.








, Once the feeder is set up, you should watch how the chickens react to it. Make an effort to notice any potential problems that may arise, either with regards to the grain's accessibility or feeder's stability. If you spot something amiss, you can make your modifications as needed.

Let the swathed or mowed forage wilt for a time before harvesting.,
Harvest the crop.,
Drop off the loads to the haylage storage site.,
Pack the pile.,
Cover the pile immediately.,
Weigh the plastic down.,
Repair any holes immediately.",How to Make Haylage2," Depending on what type of forage you have and how wet you want to harvest it at, you have the options of letting it wilt for not at all, half a day, or for a full day (24 hours).


In environments where there is no opportunity to allow forage to wilt or dry down to a 40 to 60% moisture content, direct-cut haylage may be the best option. Forage cut without any opportunity to wilt will be at 75 to 85% moisture, the highest-moisture silage/haylage you can get. See Warnings below for the potential problems and risks with this type of haylage.

Wilted silage can be allowed to wilt down for half a day (4 to 6 hours) before harvest. Basically, cut forage in the morning, and harvest in mid-afternoon. Wilted hay-silage is typically at least 60 to 70% moisture.

A common problem can be allowing the crop to wilt down too much, creating forage that is too dry; this can cause silage to heat, reducing digestibility for livestock, and cause harvest and storage losses, via leaf loss or spoiling, respectively.



""Low-moisture"" haylage or what many would consider ""normal silage"" regardless the forage harvested is gathered at 40 to 60% moisture; compared with wilted silage, this haylage type often needs longer to wilt down, depending on weather conditions. Most recommend a day (24 hours) to wilt down; if the weather is hot enough, though, only half a day (4 to 6 hours) may be needed to get the forage down to that optimum level.

Grass tends to ""dry down"" faster than legumes like alfalfa or clover due to its hollow stems, and lower moisture content. However, because the recommended moisture range has a 20% difference, it's best to take a chance at harvesting a high-legume stand when it's at least 40 to 50% moisture to prevent leaf-loss during harvest or spontaneous heating.
Teddering and/or conditioning, as already mentioned, may be necessary to get low-moisture haylage, but this depends on what cutting equipment was used, and other conditions that may make the crop slower to dry than expected (such as rain, heavy dew, etc.).
If it happens to rain right after cutting the crop, there's plenty of argument out there that one rain shower won't hurt the crop so much as it will slow down the time needed to get the crop as dry as you want it to be. Conditioning and raking/teddering may necessary in this case to speed up the drying process before harvest.

In the next section below, this particular type of haylage is ideal for gathering into bales, as baleage or bale silage.





, Machinery known as ""forage harvesters"" that are self-propelled or pulled behind a tractor are needed for gathering and cutting up swaths into chopped haylage. Cut length is very important, especially for feeding to cattle. Set the cutter head blades so that they are chopping between 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm).


With grass silage (if the forage crop is 90 to 100% grass), you can get away with chopping it at 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) instead.
Forage harvesters do not come with a storage compartment like combine-harvesters do when harvesting annual crops for grain like with corn or wheat. Once the forage is chopped up, it is blown out of a long, tall spout; built similarly to a snow blower machine, except twice as big. A tractor with a silage wagon (a wagon with three sides built higher than the fourth), a silage truck with similar sides, or a pull-behind wagon (some farmers may call it a ""Jiffy wagon""), must be used to gather haylage.






An exchange is made between the wagons and/or trucks so that the person operating the forage harvester doesn't need to stop and wait every so often. Once the first truck is full, the harvester stops briefly so that the truck can pull away and the second one moves into position. The first truck returns after dropping its load off to get another load, and so the process repeats.



, Once the wagons or trucks are full they must travel to the site where the haylage feed is going to be stored. This may be a three-sided concrete bunker called a ""silage pit,"" or on a hill that promotes good drainage. The wagons or trucks dump the fresh haylage into piles situated close together, and in a manner that is easy to gather and pack into a silage/haylage pile.


Make sure the loads are placed as close to each other as possible. When first starting the pile, the first several loads must be place where the pile is going to be. After that they are placed close to the built pile, and dumped in a way that is easy for the person in the ""packing unit"" to move into a pile; i.e., parallel to the pile, and/or in the same direction the pile will be built up as.

, The haylage pile must be packed very well, and should be packed down during and after each harvesting day. In a large operation where several people are employed, it would be beneficial to have one (a brave one that is not afraid of heights especially) stay behind to operate another tractor or large loader that will continuously gather and pack the pile well. Tractors with dual wheels are recommended to provide the best packing power possible.


Packing is what helps encourage fermentation activity and discourages spoilage. The more the pile is packed down, the less pockets of oxygen there is. Oxygen pockets create spoiled feed; aerobic-loving bacteria turn it into a brown to black slimy mess, that often smells like tobacco or burnt caramel. In other words, instead of fermenting the feed (which is producing a significant amount of acid as a means to preserve the feed), the presence of oxygen decomposes it into a substance equivalent to manure. You don't want feed that is messy and gross like manure (think cow poop). If you don't like the look, feel and smell of it, neither will your animals!
Haylage/silage piles must be longer and wider than they are tall. The higher the pile is built up, the wider the edges will need to be. A concrete bunker will control how wide you can make the pile, though you can pack several feet above, but only so much that the sides are not over-flowing.

A rule of thumb for pile-size is larger at the base than the top; no less than 12 to 15 feet wide at the top to prevent roll-overs or slippage from machinery; and silage piles should only be 12 to 15 feet tall, mainly for farm safety reasons.


The best way to tell if you have done a good packing job is if you try to sink your fingers into the pile. If you only get in so far as your second knuckles of your first three fingers, then the pile has been packed very well, and has potential for being good feed in the winter with minimal spoilage.

, Use the proper plastic recommended for haylage and silage piles. Often recommended and used is polyethylene plastic that may be black on both sides or white on one side and black on the other. The cheaper stuff is all black, but the better quality is the black and white plastic.


Use 6 to 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) plastic. This can be found at your local farm and ranch supply store. The heavier the plastic, the more effective it is at keeping oxygen out of the pile and reducing wastage with spoiling.
The rolls are very heavy. Use a tractor loader with bucket teeth to carry the plastic to the pit so that you can unroll and unfold it.

A trick to use is to insert a 6 feet (1.8 m) long, heavy iron bar into the roll (like you would hanging a roll of toilet paper on a toilet-paper holder), and fashion thick wire or heavy chain that hangs on the teeth of the bucket. Hang the bar onto this.

Important: White and black plastic must be used so that the white side is facing out, and the black against the fresh haylage in the pit. The white side reflects sunlight and reduces excess heating from the sun, whereas the black side keeps heat inside.


Trim off extra plastic and use that to cover the edges and sides that the plastic has not covered.

, Use numerous old or recycled tires all over the top part of the pile. Hay bales can also be used to hold down plastic on the sides if the haylage pile is not in a bunker.


Tires are much more gentler on the plastic because they do not cause punctures. Punctures are a serious danger of feed spoilage.

, Holes in the plastic can cause massive spoilage problems over time. Spoilage will not be localized, especially if the holes go from a tiny tear to a big rip, especially if wind is a problem.

"
"
Follow the same steps for wilting forage as in step 1 of the Harvesting as Chopped Haylage section above.,
Gather the swaths into a bale with a baler.,
Wrap the bales or put them in a tube as soon as possible.",How to Make Haylage3," Note that there may be some discrepancies with best practices for producing baleage or baled silage based on moisture content; this is all depending on your location.


Most recommended moisture content to put baleage up at is 40 to 60% moisture, particularly in locations where winter and freezing is common. Bales that are wrapped up at a higher moisture content do not keep their heat for long and will freeze into fermented popsicles that are difficult to handle, feed out, and for livestock to eat.

Baleage at higher moisture (above 60% moisture) is best for locations where freezing temperatures are less common. Several days of temperatures below -10ºC or lower can freeze high-moisture-wrapped bales to literal popsicles.



, Doing this is no different than what you would do making hay, however, you should not let them get to full size. Instead, they should only be made to 2/3 to 3/4 their normal size. Bale silage bales are much heavier, if made to their full size, than normal hay bales (typically baled at 16 to 18% moisture), which can make it more difficult for a loader or tractor with a front-end loader to transport from feed yard to corral. The reduced size should make them easier to manage, plus wrap up.


Also, use a baler that is built to make very tight bales with tight centres, hence the name. A ""hard-core"" baler is ideal for this because it can pack the swaths into very tight bales with a tight center better than what are called ""soft-core"" balers.

, Once the bales are done, they must be wrapped or put in a tube no longer than 10 to 12 hours after baling; 5 hours or less is more preferable. This will prevent them from heating, which can cause spoilage and even spontaneous combustion, especially if they're baled at 40% or lower in warm conditions.


There are actually several options available to do this:

One, you can have a bale wrapping machine hitched behind your baler so that it catches the bale and wraps it up in plastic. This eliminates extra time and extra labour needed to get another machine out to wrap up bales behind you.
Two, you have another tractor unit that carries a wrapping unit to go in and wrap the bales after the baler has dropped them off.

For either method, the machine used spins the bale around--regardless if it's a round bale or a square bale--and wraps it in plastic to the desired thickness. Recommendations range from 4 to 8 milliliters (0.14 to 0.27  fl oz); higher values are recommended if you plan on carrying over these bales into spring and summer.


Three, gather up the bales after baling and put them through a tubing machine that wraps plastic around each bale, but bale faces are together in a long line. You can make bale tubes that are about 100 feet long. Plastic thickness recommendations range from 4 to 8 or 10 ml.

Square bales in a tube will need to be put together in a multi-bale system. Put them together so that you are putting them in as much of a square face configuration as possible. You will need to experiment to see what will fit best; the Ontario Agriculture link in the Sources and Citations section below has example pictures of what you can use for wrapping square-bale haylage.
Each bale exposed when the tube is opened up will only last for 1 to 2 weeks before spoiling. The bales further down in the tube will not take nearly as long to spoil as that exposed bale.


Stacking is a fourth option to use, and is best for large round or large square bales. Large round bales can be stacked in a pyramid formation (two on the ground and one at the top, and square bales should be stacked so they form a square-face configuration, as with wrapping. They must be covered immediately to avoid potential loss, and as with haylage piles above, the plastic weighed down with tires and other hay bales.

Use a double layer of 6 milliliters (0.20  fl oz) plastic for this system.
Small stacks makes covering with plastic easier, and will use up excess oxygen within the plastic--as long as the plastic is sealed well with no holes in it--quickly, creating an anaerobic void within that preserves the bales.
Stacks, once opened, will begin to deteriorate and develop mold and spoilage issues. They must be entirely fed out by 1 week in the summer, 2 weeks in the spring, and 4 weeks in the winter, generally.





"
"
Handle individual bales carefully for storage.,
Allow at least 2 weeks to pass before feeding.,
Take only as much as you need.,
Baled silage should be fed in feeders or on raised platforms to minimize waste.",How to Make Haylage4," You will need to use a different type of loader that is designed to handle wrapped bales without puncturing them, which is one that has smooth edges that hug the bale rather than pokes through it, like loader bucket with a grapple-fork, or a bale fork.


Careful handling may be less important with when they need to be fed out, but do note that even using a bale-fork or spear, mistakes can happen and you may puncture another bale you intended to leave intact.

, This will give the feed enough time to ferment and pickle, and develop that fermented sourish smell that is often associated with silaged feeds. If you wish to wait longer, then that's fine too., Especially with chopped haylage, only take so much off the face as you need to feed. It may take practice to understand how much of the face to scrape down and gather for feeding, but the mathematics with calculating how much face to remove to feed a certain number of animals per feeding can be done for more accuracy, and to obtain a good pit face for your pile. Good pit faces reduce excessive spoilage or secondary heating.This is just as important with baled silage. Remember, you are feeding animals a bale that is (or should be) at least 50% water, and you have so many animals to feed and so many bales to put out. Less can be more, because the more bales you put out, the more likely they will spoil faster than the animals can eat them. You do not what the latter to happen.

, Animals that drop, trample and defecate or urinate on the feed that's on the ground will not eat it."

Get a good container.,
Collect your rabbit's poop.,Every time you add more bunny poo (wet matter) add twice the amount of dry matter (dry leaves).,
Every two weeks, mix the compost pile up.,
When your bunny poo compost is a dark, earthy-smelling, crumbly dirt, it is ready.",How to Make Compost from Rabbit Manure,"  Garden stores often sell pre-made compost bins, which are nice because there is no pre-assembly needed.  However, you can make a free one with pallets, or use other materials.  It is best to have a light bin so that you can lift it up and scoop out the dirt when it is finished composting.  If it is too heavy, you will have to scoop the dirt out of it, which is difficult labor.  The container must be at least 3'x3'x3'.;
,  Simply use a tray under his or her hutch or cage, then bring the tray out to the compost bin.

Be sure that you can stomach uncomfortable medical situations.,
Understand that your path to being a medical assistant may take time.",How to Become a Medical Assistant1," A medical assistant is able to do multiple things at once. This means that you should to be a competent multi-tasker in order to produce a really good fit. The best MAs are fleet-footed, resourceful, and pick up things very quickly.;
, The essence of your job, aside from the occasional administrative duties, is helping other people. You should receive satisfaction from the idea that your help makes a difference in other people's lives. If you don't care about the impact your work has on other people's lives, you probably aren't an ideal fit.

, Although they aren't common, serious medical interventions do occur around medical assistants. MAs occasionally need to push past the discomfort of wounds, blood, and obvious patient pain in order to do their jobs effectively. Depending on what kind of clinic you work in, you may have to deal with blood, urine, and other bodily fluids daily. Not displaying disgust or dislike is important in making the patient feel comfortable.

, It's not uncommon for the process of becoming a medical assistant to take several years. If you want to become a medical assistant right away, it's possible — but difficult.

Decide what kind of nursing degree you would like to pursue.,
Train for general nursing during your degree program.,
Learn the specifics of maternity nursing by working in a hospital maternity ward or obstetric practice, or by observing a practicing midwife.,
Get a nursing license in your state or region.",How to Become a Maternity Nurse1," This will vary depending on what you would like to specialize in and how much time you want to spend in school. Options include:


Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) - A LPN program is 1 ½ years long. LPNs can become certified and licensed through community colleges or vocational schools. However, many LPNs are not used in a labor and delivery setting due to the specialty area that it is. Most LPNs are utilized in an office outside the hospital or medical surgical floor, rather than an ICU setting, Labor and Delivery, or pediatrics.Registered Nurse (RN) - The average registered nurse program is 2-4 years long, as it requires a bachelor's degree and 2 or 3 years of additional education. The RN’s role as a labor and delivery nurse can range depending on the hospital setting you work in. They can specialize in a wide variety of roles, including labor and delivery, antepartum, and postpartum care.Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) - A CNS is a master's degree program. A CSN is an advanced practice nurse, a Master’s degree program, that may prescribe medication and do other duties as a physician. Therefore, a CNS in labor and delivery may specialize in the management clinically of the woman during pregnancy and labor and delivery. The CNS is also a great resource for nurses on the division, specializing in education.
Nurse Practitioner (NP) - A NP is a master's degree program. Nurse practitioners do specialize in neonatal care and are utilized in NICU and normal newborn nurseries. They usually help to triage patients and do not perform deliveries.
Certified Nurse Midwife (CNW) - A CNW is a master’s degree program. Midwives were the original nurse professionals in the labor and delivery world. Midwives are trained over a graduate level and are trained to support women in their pregnancy and labor and delivery. They are not able to do surgery on their patients, therefore, if a C-Section is needed or a vacuum or forceps assisted delivery, a physician will have to help them.
Most major labor delivery centers are not using LPNs in labor and delivery and instead are using RNs. At community hospitals, LPNs can sometimes get hired in that role, but still RNs are more common. There is a big difference between being a midwife and being a labor and delivery nurse, so you have to decide if you want to be the one managing the labor and performing the delivery, or if you want to be supporting the laboring mom. Assuming you have the right degrees, it is possible for you to fulfill multiple roles.;
, Each nursing program has specific hours you will need to graduate, which are built into your nursing program. In addition to classroom learning, you will have to take hands-on courses, also known as clinicals. You will go through a short period of clinical experience in labor and delivery and postpartum care. This gives you a view into the world of a labor nurse to see if it is something you would be interested in pursuing.


However, this experience will not give you thorough training like you will get once you are on the job. , The variety of nursing jobs in the maternity ward vary from an antepartum nurse, triage nurse, labor nurse, delivery nurse, scrub nurse, circulating nurse (in the operating room), postpartum nurse, lactation nurse, and newborn nurse.


Start by contacting your local hospital’s volunteer program. The director can help guide you on a shadowing experience. This can be done during nursing school to see if it is a hospital you would like to work in.
Maternity wards are not the same everywhere. Touring and volunteering your time can be a great way to see if you feel like you would fit in at that particular facility.

, You will need to visit the website of the state board of nursing in your specific state to see the qualifications for each test.Before you begin a specialty in maternity nursing, you must be a licensed nurse.


Each state regulates its own license application procedure.
Becoming a midwife requires a Master’s degree in nursing and passing the midwifery certification.For all types of maternity nursing you need to enroll and pass a nursing program and apply to take and pass the NCLEX (the exam for licensure) before applying for a job.
The nursing licensing test is a combination of high comprehension questions to make you critically think about everything you learned in nursing school.

Massage therapists need to be concerned about other people's holistic wellbeing. Receiving a massage is a very intimate experience. A good massage therapist respects that the art of massage is both physical and emotional.;
, A great way to learn more about the massage arts is to talk with a massage therapist, and get a massage yourself. Ask plenty of questions about what the profession entails, and start thinking about what type of massage therapist you want to be.


Do some research. Look online for information about different types of massage, or check out massage books at your local library. You can learn a lot about massage therapy just by reading about it.
Practice on friends. Start getting a feel for what your ""bedside manner"" should be like, and how a typical session should go.

, There are many specialties in massage therapy and most massage therapists concentrate on one or more of these, especially when starting out. Different types of massage are used to different ends; some are geared toward healing muscles, some toward easing stress, and others toward helping with specific physical ailments. While you can, and probably will, learn more than one massage style, it's a good idea to think about what you're most interested in so that you can be sure to get appropriate training. Here are a few different types of massage to look into:

Sports massage. This form of massage is designed to help athletes recover from injuries and everyday play, allowing them to perform at their physical best at the next game.






Clinical massage. This focuses on using massage to heal physical ailments. A thorough understanding of anatomy is required.






Swedish massage. This is the most common type of massage, and is used for both healing and relaxation purposes.Deep tissue massage is a similar form of massage, but more pressure is exerted on the muscles.







Reflexology, reiki, acupressure, and hot stone massage are all special types of massage that serve specific purposes.







, Before you start training, it's a good idea to make sure that you understand how to satisfy your jurisdiction's licensing requirements so you'll know what kind of training will qualify you to be licensed.


In the U.S. most states have some form of licensing, so check with your state's licensing board to get more information. Keep in mind that even if your state does not have licensing requirements, your city or county may.
Some jurisdictions require licensing for some types of massage but not for others.

, There are plenty of massage schools out there. You may have seen their ads or even received advertising materials for some of them. Keep in mind that these schools are businesses that are trying to make money, so be sure to check out all their claims carefully. Look for a program that leads to certification and which satisfies your jurisdiction's licensing requirements, which may include accreditation.


Most massage schools teach basic Swedish massage and allow you to choose other specialties in addition to that. Look for a school that caters to any specialties you are most interested in.
You can research schools online, or you can ask massage therapists what schools they went to and what they thought of their experiences.
You'll also want to consider your budget. Massage schools can be quite expensive, with tuition ranging from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands. Most schools offer some kind of financial assistance, including federal student loans.

, In the U.S., many states require at least 500-600 hours of training, so you can expect to spend at least that much time in the classroom and practicing. You can find a range of course lengths. How long it takes you to complete the program will depend on how many classes you take at one time; how quickly you complete your ""practice"" massages, and what your specialty is. Depending on the program you take, you will graduate either with certification in a certain specialty or with a degree.

, Not all jurisdictions require certification, but becoming board certified can open a lot of doors for you. In the U.S. the National Certification Board of Massage Therapy administers an exam-based certification program. National Certification is not really needed unless it is required by your state for licensing.

, As mentioned before, you may need to become licensed in your jurisdiction. Your school should be able to assist you in understanding the licensing requirements and obtaining your license. National Certification is required by some states in the U.S., while others do not require it, and others require their own professional licensing exam.


Many states are now accepting another exam offered by the Federation of Massage State Boards, which could lead to National Certification becoming obsolete.
If you plan to start your own business, you will also most likely need to also get a business license from your state or municipality before you can practice.

, In the past, just about all massage therapists worked for themselves. Now there are a growing number of salaried jobs in massage therapy at massage parlors, spas, hotels, and other establishments, so you have a lot of options. Most jobs are low paying and start at $15 an hour, but you can find some jobs that pay much more than that.


While you can usually make more money starting your own business, it can be difficult to get clients at first, and business expenses can pile up. If you want to start your own business, you'll need to lease a space in a central location to pick up plenty of clients.Another option is to contract with a health care provider or group of massage therapists to share a space. You'd still be in charge of your own services and business, but you'd have more security operating out of an established.
Your massage school should be able to provide some counseling to help you make your choice.

, Setting up a massage business is similar to setting up other types of small businesses. In order to legally operate as a business, there are certain requirements you must follow:


Pick a business name and get it registered.

File incorporation documents with the state.

Apply for an Employer Identification Number with the IRS.

Get a small business loan to help you start your business.

Get insurance. Call an insurance agent and figure out what insurance you'll need to protect you from malpractice and liability in your state.

, If you're running your own business, you'll be in charge of setting up the space. It's important for it to be extremely clean as well as welcoming and warm, so your clients feel comfortable spending time there. Here's what you'll need to do:


Purchase equipment. You'll need a massage table, chair, pillows, sheets, lotions, oils, and any equipment you may need for the specialized type of massage services you're offering.
Create a relaxing atmosphere. Have candles, light dimmers, or soft natural lighting in your space. Paint the walls a soothing earth tone, and hang calming art on the walls.
You may want to offer a changing room and a place for clients to store their belongings during the session.
Make sure the bathroom area is also clean and calming.

, The field of massage arts is growing, so it's important to find ways to set yourself apart from other massage therapists. What is it about you or your business that makes you unique and appealing? Spread the word about your business in the following ways:


Use social media. Create a Facebook page and a Twitter account to announce deals and other news.
Take out a local advertisement. Put yourself on the map by advertising in a local weekly newspaper.
Have a grand opening event. Offer a tour of the facilities and a discount to people who come to the party. Don't forget to serve refreshments!
Provide excellent service. The best way to get more clients is to do a wonderful job with the first few, so people will start recommending you to their friends.

Evaluate if you are emotionally capable of being a critical care sitter.,
Ask for references from your current job.,
Obtain training.,
Develop and bring activities for your adult sitting jobs.,
Contact your state's Department of Health.,
Apply for your home care provider license.,
Apply for adult or senior sitting jobs with medical staffing companies, nursing homes, hospitals or hospice clinics.,
Ask for references from all of the families you work for.,
Become an independent contractor.,
Market yourself.,
Draw up a contract for each critical care sitting job you take.,
Reapply for your home health care provider license on an annual basis, unless otherwise specified.",How to Become a Licensed Adult Critical Care Sitter," Taking care of people who are in critical condition is an emotionally taxing job. Sitters should be able to manage end-of-life care and help the family to deal with emergencies.;
, Senior sitting requires that you are a trustworthy person with a long history of good references. Elder care agencies and individuals looking to hire someone for a family member will check references and criminal records thoroughly.

, Caregivers and critical care sitters do not need to be trained nurses; however, they should know CPR, be trained in seeking help and be trained in taking care of another person. The following are 2 ways that you can obtain training:


Apply for a job with a medical staffing company. Many home care and medical companies recruit people without a past history of nursing to become caregivers. Most companies provide at least a few weeks of training, job shadowing and per diem contracts. This is an excellent way to start a career in care giving, because you can be paid to train and your first jobs will be found through the agency.
Enroll independently in CPR and emergency care courses. You may also look for caregiving classes at your local Lifelong Learning center, at a local hospital or at a community college. You will be required to pay for these classes, but they will add to your qualifications when you are looking for work.
Some people learn the necessary skills of caregiving by taking care of their own sick or elderly family members. If you have over 1 year of experience taking care of a critical care patient at home, you may be able to seek employment without official training. However, it is a good idea to enroll in a CPR class if you have not already.

, After training, companionship is the next important element of being a good critical care sitter. You will need to bring books, puzzles, movies, crafts and any other activities that your patient may enjoy doing to pass the time pleasantly.

, Ask about obtaining a license to be a home care provider in your state. Request a list of requirements to obtain a license and a copy of the laws pertaining to home or hospice care.

, Take any applicable tests and submit to a criminal check. You will need to be licensed in most states, and it is also necessary in order to be considered by any family that wants to use Medicare to help pay for your services.

, Part or full-time work in an institution gives you opportunities to sit for patients with many different problems. Work for at least 1 year in an institutional setting and you will have the experience to look for work on your won.

, Outside of evaluations for the hospital, nursing home or clinic, ask the patient or the patient's family if potential employers can contact them to ask about your past work. Work for an agency until you can provide 3 or more references when you apply for a job.

, If you have worked as a critical care sitter for over a year, you can start to market yourself as a sitter for hire. This step is not necessary, if you prefer to work for an agency that provides you with work in your area.


Consider the number of hours you are willing to work and your pay range before you begin applying independently for adult sitting jobs. Your hourly wage will depend highly upon the services you are asked to perform. Keep a list of services in your repertoire to send potential clients.

, If you want to work independently as a critical care sitter, you will need to make flyers, business cards and, possibly, a website that shows your credentials. Tell past employers that you welcome referrals.


Put up flyers on community bulletin boards. State your qualifications and the types of critical care patients that you can care for. Include your phone number or email to encourage them to contact you.
Place classified ads on Craigslist, Angie's List or in your local paper. Include your years of experience, qualifications and license information.

, This should outline your responsibilities, the way in which you will be paid and any services that you will not perform. This contract will protect you, and it will usually be submitted to Medicare if the patient is trying to get home health care covered by their plan.

, The fees you pay to become licensed may depend upon your income from adult sitting in the previous year.

Be prepared for the commitment.Just like traditional doctors who earn MDs and DOs, homeopathic doctors must undergo a long and rigorous course of study to earn their NDs (Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine).,
Set your goals.,
Research homeopathic medical schools.To become a homeopathic doctor, you must complete a four-year course of education at an accredited school.,
Take the necessary pre-requisite courses.,
Apply to homeopathic medical schools.,
Study hard in medical school.,
Complete a residency for clinical experience.Residencies aren't required to get your license (except in Utah), but they can provide invaluable experience before you strike out on your own.During a one to two year residency, you will get hands-on experience in a clinical setting while under the supervision of seasoned homeopathic doctors.,
Consider shadowing a homeopathic doctor.,
Decide how you plan to get certified.,
Apply for a certification exam.,
Study for and pass the certification exam.,
Contact your state medical board to research licensing in your area.Homeopathic drugs are not prescription, and can be bought by anyone over the counter.,
Join local and national homeopathy associations.,
Fulfill your continuing education requirements.",How to Become a Homeopathic Doctor," It will take four years of intense training to become a fully qualified and licensed homeopathic doctor. This isn't a journey you should embark on without seriously examining if you're up to the challenge.


Make sure you can afford the cost of tuition and supplies for medical school, as well as loss of income from your time in school. Contact individual schools for cost estimates.
You will need a strong support system of family and friends to help you get through this process. Make sure you have one in place!;
, What kind of a homeopathic/naturopathetic practice do you want to have? Depending on your goals, your path might look different. Some career paths in homeopathy include:Homeopathic doctor (the subject of this article)
Homeopathic nurse: you still need education and certification, but don’t need to attend an accredited four-year medical school
A traditional doctor who incorporates homeopathic techniques
An other healthcare provider (acupuncturist or massage therapist) who incorporates homeopathic techniques: many homeopathic medical schools offer courses in related naturopathic practices
Independent practice
Affiliation with a hospital or other medical institution (clinic, community health center, etc.), There are seven accredited homeopathic medical schools in the United States and Canada, located in Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Connecticut, Toronto, and British Columbia.You can also find non-accredited schools and training programs where you can get a homeopathic education. However, you may not be able to get certified and/or licensed as a doctor with degrees from those programs.
Make sure that the school you choose will allow you to follow the path that leads to your goals.

, Though not all homeopathic medical schools will require a bachelor's degree, all will call for at least some scientific background.Contact the school you wish to attend and see what their pre-requisites are. Whether you're enrolled in college full-time as an undergraduate or are taking continuing education courses, focus your credits in the right subjects. A promising applicant to a homeopathic medical school should have credits in the following subjects:


Anatomy
Biochemistry
Botany
Developmental psychology
Physiology
Any other courses or majors your specific homeopathic medical school requests.

, Make sure the schools you apply to offer coursework that will best suit your individual interests. For example, you may want to focus your practice on women, children, or environmental medicine, or get a dual degree in a second area like acupuncture.Don't restrict yourself to a single school — applying to multiple programs that fit your interests raises your chances of being accepted.

, Don't think of school as a means to an end. Instead, think of school as the most important, foundational part of your journey. This is where you will meet the instructors who will teach you your craft and help you learn how to become a healer. The first two years of the ND degree focus on scientific background, while the third and fourth years branch into clinical experience.Though you can take elective courses in your specific naturopathic interests, all ND curricula prepare you to be a general practitioner:Botanical medicine
Emergency and physical medicine
Laboratory diagnosis
Diagnostic imaging
Physical and clinical diagnosis
Homeopathy
Minor surgery
Nutrition
Pharmacology
Psychology

, You may be able to complete a residency during the third and fourth years of school, or after graduation.


Submit your residency preferences to the Naturopathic Post-Graduate Association. If they find a match for you, you will be able to pursue and complete your residency.
Be aware that there are very few residencies available in homeopathic medicine. Positions are highly competitive.

, As much as you may want the experience of a residency, you might find one hard to come by. MDs are required to complete residencies before they can practice, so there are many residency opportunities available to them. But ND residencies aren't required, so there are far fewer options available. Only about 5-10% of NDs complete a residency.If a residency isn't an option, look for a homeopathic doctor in your area who will allow you to shadow his or her practice.
Though you won't have the rigorous educational structure of the residency, you will still get supervised clinical experience before you're on your own.

, Organizations that offer certification include The Council for Homeopathic Certification, The American Board of Homeotherapeutics, and the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians.Once you’ve decided which certifications you want to get, research their websites to find out what kind of education you need to complete the certification process.


Note that certification is not the same as licensure, though it may be required to get a license to practice in your area.

, Depending on which certification you plan to seek, your requirements will differ. If you meet the qualifications to apply for the exam, you will have to study for and pass it.


Application for The Council for Homeopathic certification exam requires US or Canadian residency; knowledge of classical homeopathy; 500 hours of homeopathic training; 33 hours of training in anatomy, physiology, pathology, and disease; and 250 hours of clinical experience.Certification through the American Institute of Homeopathy requires either an M.D. or a D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathy) in addition to your ND., Order and study from the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX) Blueprint and Study Guide. Make sure to buy an updated, current copy of the guide, as older versions — while cheaper — may provide outdated information.


Certification organizations usually provide suggestions for how to properly prepare for the exam, as well., But the legal regulation of who can recommend these treatments in a medical context is murky, and varies from state to state. Homeopathy is legal throughout the U.S., but you need to find out how to protect your practice in your state. Though prosecution of unlicensed homeopathic doctors is rare, it is still a possibility. Do not start a practice until you have registered with the appropriate authority in your state — whether the medical board or the attorney general.


Connecticut, Arizona, and Nevada are the only states that have boards of homeopathic medicine. Contact the homeopathic board if you live in one of those areas.
Acupuncturists and chiropractors should contact their own state boards for legal guidance on homeopathy.
Practitioners in Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Alaska, Utah, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Washington D.C. should contact their state attorney general's office.

, Once you have the necessary degrees and licenses to be able to practice homeopathy, you should join professional organizations. These organizations will keep you up to date on the latest information and practices in the field. They’ll also give you an opportunity to network with other practitioners and learn more about the homeopathic community. Furthermore, patients may feel uncomfortable working with an unaffiliated doctor who doesn’t belong to a broader medical community. Examples include of national associations include:


North American Society of HomeopathsNational Center for HomeopathyAmerican Institute of HomeopathyBritish Homeopathic AssociationHomeopathic Medical Association (UK)Look for local associations in your region, as well.

, The practice of medicine is an ever-evolving body of knowledge. It's not enough to pass a certification exam once, then stop learning. The Council for Homeopathic Certification requires homeopathic doctors to take at least 20 hours of continuing education every year to maintain certification.This ensures that all practicing, certified doctors are up to date on the newest breakthroughs, innovations, and trends in the field. These hours can be obtained in a number of ways, including:


Attending homeopathic conferences and seminars
Teaching homeopathic classes
Mentoring or supervising a homeopathic student
Publishing scholarly work in the field of homeopathy

Earn your bachelor’s degree.,
Get your master’s degree.,
Think about earning your doctorate.",How to Become a Licensed Mental Health Counselor1,"

The first step in becoming a licensed mental health counselor is to obtain your bachelor’s degree.Most likely your degree would be a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS) in psychology or a related field.

Once accepted and in school, take opportunities to join student organizations and do research. These activities can give valuable experience and allow you to meet people for future networking and professional growth.
As part of the four year BA or BS program of study, you'll need to take upper-division credit hours in social sciences (psychology and sociology). Research methods and statistics can be helpful too, and may be required.
Do your best to keep your GPA up. Making good grades will make it much easier to get into graduate school.
Look into internships that you can do during your BA program as well. This can help you to figure out what you might like to specialize in later on or if you actually want to pursue a career as a counselor. For example, you might intern at a women’s shelter or for a crisis line.;
,

Obtaining a Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS) or equivalent degree is the next step in becoming a licensed mental health counselor.Some states require that the degree program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs.Check with your state licensing board to determine what their requirements are.

Take the Graduate Record Exam. This test measures your critical thinking skills and is required in order to be admitted into graduate school.Study for it well in advance, but don’t worry if you have to take it more than once. Many people do.Many programs have a multi-part application process. It often includes submitting essays, undergraduate records, letters of recommendation, and an interview process. Begin the process early so you have enough time to complete the process and meet all deadlines.
Make the most of opportunities to participate in research and in student and national organizations in the field of mental health counseling like the American Mental Health Counselors Association.,

Some licensed mental health counselors go on to earn their PhD in order to make themselves more marketable and to gain more experience and knowledge.However, this is optional. You need a Master's degree to be a licensed counselor, but you do not need a PhD.

Use resources like the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine if the additional years of school are worth the increase in income.

Decide whether you have the physical ability for the job.,
Determine if you have the mental capacity for the job.,
Coping with the working environment.",How to Become a Home Health Aide1," As much as you may enjoy helping others, you should be aware that the job duties require physical strength and good health. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Labor notes that home health aides suffer job related injuries and sickness more frequently than people in other occupations.Imagine lifting another person who has limited physical strength and the inability to assist you in moving them from place to place. A home health aide must be able to maneuver their patients in and out of wheelchairs, cars, and ambulances.
Taking a shower, using the toilet, sitting up to eat, and changing clothes are things we do every day without thinking about it. As a home health aide, you will have to help others do these tasks multiple times a day.;
, Home health aides work under the direction of a nurse who is not always available. Therefore, as a home health aide, you will be responsible for many of the basic medical needs of your patient.You must be competent in observing and recording any changes in your patients and report it immediately to your supervisor. Both sudden and gradual changes in a person’s daily routine and liveliness could signal a major health issue that needs immediate medical attention.
You should be knowledgeable in taking vital signs, blood pressure, administering medication, oxygen equipment, and other life-supporting duties such as CPR.

, A home health aide must have patience, interpersonal skills, dependability, and good time management skills. A good balance in these characteristics will help with the high levels of stress that can sometimes be a part of the job.Since home house aides enable the elderly, convalescent, and disabled persons to live in their own homes, responsibilities include maintaining the patient’s personal hygiene. Bathing, dressing, grooming, and assisting with toileting or cleaning bedpans is not a pleasant task. Therefore, you should be aware of how personal and private your responsibilities will be.
In some cases, the working environment can be stressful from the demanding nature of the job, so it is important to relax, eat properly, exercise, and get enough sleep.
You can be exposed to environmental hazards such as second hand smoke, pest infestations and unsafe neighborhoods.

Take your NCE exam.,
Send your passing NCE scores and proof of your practicum to the state board.,
Find a job or internship.,
Submit proof of completion.",How to Become a Licensed Mental Health Counselor2," While you are completing your Master’s degree, you will need to complete a practicum. The practicum is an important part of getting a counseling degree. The practicum gives you supervised counseling experience and helps you to develop your counseling skills.You may be required to participate in a group practicum, individual practicum, and an externship. The externship may take place at a clinic or hospital while you are still in school, such as during the last two semesters of your program. A supervisor from your program will likely need to be on site for an externship as well.
You usually need about 600 hours of practicum to meet your requirement.
Keep in mind that practicum and externships are not something that you can just go out and get. They must be approved by your program director.

, After your practicum and your coursework is complete, you will need to sit for your NCE exam. You can usually do this towards the end of your last semester or after it is over. Some states also require an additional state exam, and all states have a jurisprudence exam. Find out about licensing requirements in your state to determine what tests you need to take.

, After you pass your NCE exam, you will need to send your passing scores and proof that you have completed your practicum (in-school clinical hours) to the state board to receive your provisional license.


This license usually has a special term in it to indicate that it's provisional, such as ""LPC-Intern"" or ""Licensed ASSOCIATE Counselor.""

, Next, you will need to get an entry level counseling job that requires a provisional license. It is usually something like an intake employee at a hospital, a case worker, or working for a non-profit. You can use this job or internship to obtain your required post-master's degree supervised clinical hours.


During the years that you are working in this capacity, you will need to keep track of all your face-to-face contact hours and meet once weekly with a clinical supervisor to review your cases.

, Once you have completed all of the required hours at your job or internship, you will need to submit documentation to show that you have completed the required post-master's hours. You will need to submit this proof to the state board to receive a full license.

Apply for a position.",How to Become a Licensed Mental Health Counselor3,"

Because mental health counseling covers a range of areas (like marriage and family counseling, psychotherapy, or substance abuse treatment) you will need to decide exactly which area or areas you want to specialize in.Some careers require additional training or experience in that area before you can begin practicing.
Think about things like what setting you want to work in (a hospital, clinic, treatment center, etc.) and the types of clients you want to help.

Consider joining an existing practice to gain experience and then opening your own practice.
Research all of your options on sites the U.S. Department of Labor.
Think about issues like liability and the opportunity to select your own clients rather than have them assigned to you.

These may be more cost effective ways to get specific HIPAA training., Your training will include coursework focusing on how HIPAA requirements have a direct effect on policies, procedures and processes within the health care organization that administers and maintains a patient's medical records. Training should also encompass and provide an overview of how HIPAA affects how health care organizations maintain and monitor compliance relative to their patients' privacy and confidentiality.You will learn all the various components of HIPAA, including what information is protected, authorized uses and disclosures, administrative requirements. and organizational options.
HIPAA statutory and regulatory background training should include coursework focusing on the general principle for uses and disclosures, enforcement and penalties for non-compliance and state law.

Sign on as an independent agent.",How to Become a Health Insurance Agent," Ask your state's Department of Insurance (DoI) if they have information on completing the background check. If they don't have the direct information, they should provide you with a website and/or contact information of someone at the state government level.


For example, in California, you need to complete a form about your background and get fingerprinted. Your fingerprints will be sent to the FBI, and the form will be sent to the state Department of Justice. The DoI also checks with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, State Producer's Licensing Database, and Special Activites Database for possible offenses.;
, Before you sign off or remit payment, you should always know exactly what you're getting into. Review the policies for refunds and rescheduling your appointment. Also, if you have an arrest record, read carefully whether you can still qualify for licensing.


For example, in Connecticut, a criminal record may disqualify you from getting a health insurance license. Felonies, drug offenses, fraud, or other financial crimes within the past 5 to 10 years will often disqualify you.Check with your state DoI if you have any reason to fear your background will be a problem.

, Each state has a different procedure for completing the criminal background check. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Some states give you the option of scheduling your appointment online or on paper.Others have moved to a strictly online format.


For example, in Ohio, you have to request your background check through a registered WebCheck vendor. Specify that your background check is to become a licensed health insurance agent. You must then have the results sent directly to the state DoI., Your state government should have a website detailing how to pay. Depending on your state's regulations, you'll either have to pay in advance or during your appointment. Fees also vary from state to state. Make sure you have a valid credit card or access to a certified check/money order. Some states don't allow payment by cash or personal check.


For example, Ohio applicants pay the WebCheck vendor directly. The vendor only accepts MasterCard, Visa, or American Express. You cannot pay in cash, check, or money order., Check your state government's website for all the materials you'll need. Specifics vary in each state. However, you should have your government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Expect to be fingerprinted and answer yes/no questions about your history.


For example, in New Jersey, you must have a government-issued photo identification. This can be a valid passport or a driver's license. Your ID must include your full name, date of birth, and street address. You also need to bring a completed Universal Form identifying you as a prospective adjuster or producer., Depending on your state's laws, the results of your background check might be sent to you or directly to your state's DoI. Some states require organizations like the FBI to send the results directly to the DoI to be considered valid.Always double check your state DoI website for specific instructions and follow them to the letter.


For example, in Florida, the private vendor sends your fingerprints directly to state law enforcement. After they run the criminal check, they forward the results to the Florida Department of Financial Services. You will have to wait up to 45 days for the results. The Department of Financial Services will notify you via email., In nearly all states, health insurance agent licenses come in a package with life insurance qualifications. Ask your DoI about the exact requirements for an insurance license in your state. You should also ask for a list of providers for the education and testing requirements. If the board doesn't have this information, they should be able to refer you to the appropriate sources., Find out your state's required courses to take for licensing. When you enroll, you'll have to pay a fee for your license application. The exact amount varies between states. You can opt for traditional on-site classroom instruction or self-guided distance learning., State DoIs require documentation of successful course completion. In most cases, you need to complete at least 40 hours of training before you can take the exam. Check your state's guidelines for study time caps.


For example, Florida requires licensing students to either complete their studies within six months or re-apply for licensing. As a prospective agent, you'll have to take at least five credit hours of Law and Ethics Update.If you live in Florida and want to combine life insurance into your business, register for CE 5-215. If you just want to sell health insurance, register for CE 5-240. Regardless of what exactly you want to sell, you'll also have to register for 19 credit hours of related electives from the Course Authority drop-down list., You'll have to pay a fee to take the exam. Some states require proof of course completion before you can register. Others require you to take the certificate with you to the testing center on exam day. Check with your state DoI for specific instructions.


For example in California, you have to schedule your exam online with PSI Exams. Click “Government/State Licensing Agencies.” Select California from the first drop-down list on the next page. From the list that appears, select “Department of Insurance.” Then, select the correct classification in the next list. There are four categories that contain health insurance.California applicants have to pay a $50 fee for the exam. Pay online with a major credit card. When you report to the testing site, bring a valid photo ID (California driver's license, military ID, or passport). Since you should have nothing else at the testing site, except a pencil and a sheet of scratch paper, you'll need to show proof of course completion before the exam day., Use standard test-taking strategies (such as process of elimination and reading carefully) to maximize your performance. Check your state's DoI website for study materials and testing information. A passing score is usually 70 percent or higher.For example, Florida provides an outline of the examination contents online. You'll have two hours to take the test, which consists of 15 pretest questions and 85 scored questions. The test covers the types of insurance policies; their provisions, clauses, and riders; social insurance; other miscellaneous concepts; underwriting procedures; and how these concepts relate to state laws and regulations., Most licensing tests are scored on-site. If you pass, you'll receive a temporary license so that you can immediately seek employment. Ask your state DoI if you'll automatically receive a formal license or if you need to apply for one.If you fail the exam, check state's regulations regarding retesting. Look into how many times you can retake the test. You should also check on how long you have to wait between retesting sessions. Ask about appealing your results if you believe your test was scored unfairly., Organizations like the Association of Health Insurance Advisers (AHIA) require members to pay dues. However, they also provide benefits to their members that could give you an edge in the industry. Examples include further training and networking opportunities. If you don't have a job yet, networking events could help you out. If you have a job with an agency or if you've decided to go independent, you could begin to grow your customer base through these organizations., In this kind of employment, you'll sign a contract binding you to one agency. You'll have access to office space and assistants who can process your paperwork. If this option is for you, check with prospective employers before you begin the licensing process. Many companies will keep a spot open for you while you train. Some might even provide help with exam prep.In addition to networking through associations and finding prospective employers before you're licensed, you can try the standard job-hunting method of checking with employment websites like Monster or Indeed. Keep your résumé and licensing information updated in the database. Make your résumé available for prospective employers to view.

, In this capacity, you may represent multiple companies simultaneously. You'll also get a higher commission than a captive agent. On the other hand, you'll have to process your own paperwork. This could consume time that you'd otherwise spend seeking new clients as a captive agent. You'll also have to furnish your own workspace.Some states require additional training to become an independent agent. Check with your DoI for specific guidelines.To get started, you'll have to register your business with a certified lawyer and hire an accountant for tax planning. Next, you'll have to buy insurance policies that cover errors and omissions, workers' compensation, and business owner policy.
To grow your sales, you'll need an online presence at a variety of social media sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. You should also join a cluster group that will help you find contacts and potential clients. It also helps to check with established agents for lists of their customers that they'd be willing to transfer to your name."

Expect most programs to require that you be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or the equivalent, such as a GED.Take high school classes in English, biology, algebra, chemistry and other math and science courses in high school. These classes will prepare you for nursing school by providing you with a necessary base of knowledge.
Further, the completion of high school courses and the understanding of the material they cover will prepare you for the entrance exam that some programs will ask you to take.;
, The atmosphere you will be working in as a nurse is dependent on a environment that is unique to the world of medicine. Try to gain some exposure to the medical environment by getting an entry-level job or volunteer position at a hospital, nursing home, or doctor’s office. Not only will this help you become comfortable with these environments, it will strengthen your application to whatever training program you wish to enroll in., Ask one of your teachers that you get along with well to write you a letter of recommendation, as some programs will ask for one. Tell whoever is writing your letter about your experiences and interests that have relevance to the medical field, let them know what types of programs you’ll be applying for, and let them know you may use their letter in more than one application., There are several different options in terms of types of LVN programs. That said, each will address certain common criteria to ensure you’re adequately prepared for the profession. Specifically, know you’ll be required to take courses covering basic nursing practice, the ethics and legality of nursing, pharmacology, geriatric nursing, nutrition, microbiology, physiology, psychology, and anatomy.Be aware that many programs will offer further elective coursework on specializations including surgical nursing and other specific types of nursing.

Namely, make sure the program you’re considering has been reviewed and approved by The Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing.

, If you intend to work in other states, or to progress into higher ranks of the nursing profession, non-accredited programs will make it much less feasible to do so. Accreditation increases the probably that your program will prepare you to become licensed in other states, and will ensure that your program will be recognized by other accredited schools if you decide to earn further degrees.Your state’s nursing board will also approve programs, which allows students who complete them to proceed with the licensing process. Know that a state’s nursing board approval does not necessarily indicate national accreditation.

, One of these options will likely be sufficient if you do not intend to pursue a higher level of education in the future. Coursework still covers everything needed to be a successful LVN, and you’ll still get clinical experience and instruction. Many of these programs will offer some of the coursework via online courses.Credits earned in these programs will usually not be transferable to programs that offer more advanced degrees.

Completion of these programs allows you to proceed with the national licensing process by taking the National Council Licensure Examination.

, Obtaining a degree, including an associate's degree from a community college, will offer you much more career flexibility as you gain experience and knowledge in the nursing field. Degree programs will likely offer more in-depth coverage of specific topics, additional elective courses, and even more opportunities for hands-on experience.

If you intend to become an RN later in your career, consider choosing a degree program specifically designed to train people on an LVN-to-RN career path.
While associate degrees at community colleges can still be quite affordable and will often offer online coursework, know that on-campus degree programs will cost considerably more.

, Most importantly, you’ll need to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-PN). This exam is administered by individual states, and the requirements and application process varies. To find out what the state in which you hope to work requires, contact the state’s Board of Nursing, which will also need to grant you a nursing license that will allow you to take the NCLEX-PN.Get a state-specific study guide and plan a study schedule to help you prepare the the exam.
Be prepared for testing in four broad categories, including questions on managing patients’ safety and preventing infection, coping and adapting to the medical environment, familiarity with human growth and development, as well as disease prevention and detection, and familiarity with basic care, therapies, risk reduction, and and other physiological concepts.

, Before you take the national licensing exam, you need to apply for a nursing license from your state’s board of nursing. Your state’s board of nursing will also provide the eligibility criteria required to the take the exam in your state. Begin this application process before you graduate your LVN program — which will likely help facilitate the process.Be aware that you may need to have your fingerprints taken, as well as acquire a notary signature in order to be granted access to the exam.

, Register for the exam in advance, and pay the examination fee of about $200. The test will include anywhere from 85 to 205 multiple choice questions and requires completion in under 5 hours. If you fail the exam the first time you attempt it, you can take it again after 45 days for an additional fee.Know that some states allow you work as an LPN after completion of your program while waiting to complete the test to be fully licensed .

, If you have partially completed a bachelor’s degree program in nursing, you may qualify to take the exam and apply for nursing in certain states. Similarly, some states consider certain levels of military training to be equivalent to an LVN training. If you have received military medical training, you may also be eligible to take the exam and apply for licensing. Check with a specific state’s board of nursing to more., You’ll be tasked with basic, but meaningful medical responsibilities as an LVN, and other people’s health will depend on your ability to complete them effectively. Specifically, you’ll need to accurately compile patients’ health information, take and record vital signs, administer medication and monitor dosages, provide hygiene assistance, take blood pressure readings, supervise nursing aides, and set up and maintain equipment used to treat people from infancy to old-age., Stated most directly, to be a successful LVN, you’ll need to be compassionate about working with sick and injured people and their loved ones, highly organized, and reasonably physically fit. Further, you need excellent communication skills, high stress tolerance, a strong stomach, extreme attention to detail, effective time management and problem-solving skills, and the ability to work as part of a team.The positions you apply to will be looking for evidence of these characteristics, and some will even require a background check to ensure you do not have a history of criminal behavior.

, The most likely employers of newly licensed LPNs include nursing homes, hospitals, private medical clinics of various sorts, and individuals in need of home health care. Apply for positions at any of these places, or choose a particular type of place you'd like to work and submit your applications accordingly. The expectations of LVNs in each of these environments will vary slightly, and may help inform your decision about where to apply for a job.As an LPN in a nursing home, expect to assist physicians, monitor resident care, supervise other nursing staff, perform assessments of residents' health, and explain potential treatment options to residents and family members.
At a hospital or clinic, LPNs are usually expected to interview patients and assemble medical histories, record vital signs, administer injections and medications, verify charts, and more.
As a home health LPN, you would be expected to work in a patient's home, with specific job duties depending on the individual you would be caring for.

Make sure to include all of the following information in your application.Your personal information. Just like any job application, include all of your personal and contact information. Since you're applying for a job in the highly regulated medical profession, be sure to include legal information as well, such as any arrest or conviction history.
Any education you've completed or are in the process of completing. This should include everything from the high school you attended through the specific LPN programs you completed.
A resume with employment history and references.
Certification and license specifics. Include all professional certifications and licenses you've obtained, as well as license numbers, dates issued, and expiration dates.

, You should write and submit a position-specific cover letter for each job that you apply for. In each letter, express the reasons for your interest in the position you're applying for, and the experience and qualifications that indicate your ability to fulfill the position's requirements."

Depending upon your higher education focus, you may choose to intern in an administrative assistant role or a clinical role. If you are pursuing a degree as a certified nursing assistant (CNA), registered nurse (RN), psychologist or counselor, you will be required to do a practicum as part of your degree.

, Before becoming a consultant, you should gain at least 4 years of experience working directly with the elderly. The length of the work required to teach you about all the practical aspects of working with seniors and their families will depend upon the position itself.


You may choose to dedicate this time to a single role or to seek jobs that broaden your expertise. For example, after working as an RN in a hospital, you may choose to work at a nursing home or try home health care.

, Many care managers pursue specialized degrees in order to improve their expertise, gain a higher salary and seek promotions. Applicable degrees include a master's degree as a gerontology nurse practitioner, care manager, nurse administrator, health care management, gerontology health care administration or geriatric nursing.


Degrees with a focus in gerontology or geriatrics are highly specialized and only available at certain universities. Choosing a program will require research and possible travel. You may be able to find a degree that will allow you to complete some of the classes online.

You may be used in a criminal case to narrow down a suspect list or uncover evidence of a crime. You may also prevent crime by participating in the rehabilitation of criminals and conduct research on methods to reduce criminal activity.You will need to have solid knowledge of psychological theory and practice as well as knowledge of the criminal justice system. You may be required to offer testimony in a court case as an expert witness and you may also offer expertise on issues in the private sphere, such as advice on personal injury, liability, disability, or guardianship.
You may also evaluate and treat criminals, as well as families that are involved in abuse or neglect cases. You may work with victims as well as potential offenders and past offenders. Keep in mind that though you will be expected to analyze and assess criminals, you will not be expected to do criminal profiling. Many forensic psychologists do some form of profiling, but it is often more broad and general.;
, Though you will need to be able to fulfill all the professional expectations of the role, you will also need to display certain traits to become successful as a forensic psychologist. In addition to maintaining a professional demeanor while working, you should also be able to perform certain intrapersonal skills, such as:Problem solving: You should be proactive about coming up with solutions to a problem quickly and efficiently. You may need to change tactics mid-conversation as you talk to criminal suspects or testify in a courtroom and should be able to do this fluidly and easily.
Patience and diligence: Forensic psychology research can be time consuming and may require more than one approach or attempt at a solution. You will also need to be diligent about talking to suspects multiple times or in different ways. In these situations, you will need to demonstrate patience and resolve in your role as you interview suspects and analyze your research.
Strong observational skills: As a forensic psychologist, you will need to be observant of suspects as you question them so you can quickly deduce their motivation and their demeanor. You should also watch them closely as they respond to your questions and focus on key aspects that will help you build a better profile of them.
People skills: In this role, you will be forced to work with many different individuals, from law enforcement officials like police to legal representatives like attorneys and judges. You will also need to engage with victims and criminals on an almost daily basis. Maintaining strong communication skills will allow you to navigate these relationships successfully.

, As a forensic psychologist, you may work in a variety of settings, such as police stations, courthouses, law firms, prisons, and juvenile detention centers. You may also work as a consultant and work from home or from an office.Forensic psychology is considered a growing field and has risen in popularity due to television and film depictions of forensic psychologists. Salaries for forensic psychologist are often similar to traditional psychologist, who can earn around $86,000. A forensic psychologist salary can range from $68,000 to $90,000, depending on what area you work in and your level of expertise. If you become a consultant and are self-employed, you may earn a higher pay grade., You can major in psychology or you can major in criminal justice or neuroscience if it is offered at your chosen university. Your undergraduate education should focus on classes in psychology, criminology and forensics. Most undergraduate forensics psychology degrees take four years to complete.Most psychology bachelor’s degrees cover a number of core psychology subjects such as the history of psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, abnormal or clinical psychology, and psychology statistics and research methods.
You may also take psychology electives that focus on personality psychology, educational psychology, and evolutionary psychology. You will also be required to take general coursework like math, science, art, composition, and literature.

, Forensic psychologists are expected to have a master’s degree and a doctorate degree. Some doctoral programs will accept applicants with only a bachelor’s degree in psychology, but most doctoral degrees will require a master’s degree as well. A master’s degree in forensic psychology will allow you to delve into applying forensic psychology in a mental health setting and in the community, plan programs and learn how to conduct evaluations in the field, and get a better sense of the relationship between psychology and the legal system.Most master’s degree programs take two years of full-time study or longer if you are a part-time student. Unlike your undergraduate degree, your master’s degree studies will be very concentrated and you will only be required to take courses in your focus area. You will do coursework in psychology and law, psychological profiling, psychology and conflict management, social and behavioral psychology, criminal behavior, and diversity and psychology.

, At the doctoral level, you can decide if you are going to work toward a Ph.D degree or a Psy.D (Doctor of Psychology) degree. Students usually enroll in a Ph.D. in psychology if they intend to do more research in the field. A Psy.D. degree is more geared towards students interested in working as practicing psychologists. Some universities offer doctorates in forensic psychology, but more universities offer doctorates in psychology or clinical psychology. It is then recommended that you take a forensic psychology specialization after you have completed the doctorate program.Most doctorate programs take five to seven years to complete, and usually include a one year internship in a criminal justice or forensic facility. You will also need to select a course of study for your dissertation, which will likely focus on a topic in the forensic psychology field.

, All states require licensing in order to practice as a forensic psychologist. The requirements will vary from state to state but all candidates should pass a licensure exam.Talk to your doctorate program advisor about the licensure exam in your state and the contents of the licensure exam so you are prepared to take it when you complete your doctorate degree.

, It is strongly recommended that you become board certified as a forensic psychologist through the American Board of Forensic Psychology (ABFP), which is overseen by the American Board of Professional Psychology. To qualify for the ABFP certification, you must have a doctoral degree from a professional psychology program and be licensed to practice in your state. You must also complete at least 100 hours of formal education and 1,000 hours of practical experience in the field.To become board certified, you must take certification examination that consists of a written section, two practice samples, and an oral section. The written section contains 197 multiple choice questions that test the depth and breadth of your forensic knowledge. You will then need to submit two practice samples that will be reviewed and used for the oral section of the exam. The oral section will require you discuss and analyze the two practice samples to demonstrate your understanding of forensic ethics and the relationship between the law and forensics.
More detailed information about the board certification exam can be found on the ABFP website: http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3443.

, The job market for psychology can be competitive, so a postdoctoral position, or a “postdoc”, can help to boost your credentials and make you more appealing to employers. If you are more research focused in your forensic psychology studies, you may apply for postdocs available at major universities in your area and across the country.Most postdoctoral fellowships last for one to two years and require you to work on grant-funded research at a large university.

, If you completed an internship at an educational facility or a legal facility during your doctoral degree, you may consider using your connections there to try to land a paid position. Creating strong professional ties with your supervisors and contacts during your internship could help to expose you to career opportunities once you complete your doctorate degree.

, If you hoping to work in the legal system, you may want to apply for positions in settings like prisons, rehabilitation facilities, law firms, police departments, and local and state government agencies. Often, as a newly hired psychologist, you will need to complete on the job training under a supervisor before you can go out into the field.When applying for positions in the legal system, you should stress your intrapersonal skills, such as your observational skills, your communication skills, your problem solving skills, and your ability to analyze forensic information. You should also list your complete educational background and any internships or postdoc fellowships you have completed. You should include your dissertation topic in your resume, especially if it relates to forensic psychology in a legal setting.

You'll also need to make sure that the needs of the rest of the family are being met.In some cases, you may be working with other health visitors to serve the same family. This way, one of you can focus on the child with special needs while the other can meet the needs of the family.

, As a health visitor, you might need to work with people who struggle in the community (such as homeless people or people with addictions). You should have good communication skills in order to help people who may have trouble interacting with members of the community.


You will also be required to watch for cases of abuse or neglect within the community, especially when visiting with children."
"
Meet the basic requirements.,
Keep your record clean.,
Get in shape.,
Learn a second (or third, or fourth) language.,
Pursue higher education.,
Tour each department personally.",How to Become a Firefighter Paramedic2," Although prerequisites vary by department, expect these three to be nearly universal:Be 18 years old or older.
Have a high school degree or general education degree (GED).
Have a valid driver’s license.

, Refrain from criminal behavior. Avoid being immediately rejected due to a prior felony or misdemeanor. Also keep in mind that your fire department may expect members to uphold a certain code of conduct in their personal lives. Be discerning when posting anything online, since they may check your social media accounts for any offensive material that would reflect poorly on the department as a whole., Expect the job itself to be physically demanding, requiring long hours and heavy lifting. Anticipate having your fitness and endurance tested as part of the hiring process. Adopt a regular exercise program and stick to it.A key standard used to judge applicants’ fitness is their ability to carry, with a partner, a stretcher with a person weighing 180 pounds (82 kg). Together, they must transport the patient up or down a minimum of three flights of stairs and then load them safely into an ambulance.

, Although this may not be a requirement, boost your value to the department by being able to communicate with various language speakers. Research the community that it serves to find out which languages are spoken within it. Learn the basics as well as medical-specific terms., Expect some departments to demand that paramedics have earned an associate’s degree.Even if this isn’t specifically required, consider enrolling at a local community college or higher. Set yourself apart from other candidates by obtaining a relevant degree. Stand out as an applicant who will start in-house training with a fundamental understanding of the concepts to be taught, right from the get-go.Since you are pursuing a career as a paramedic with a fire department, relevant degrees include Fire Science, Firefighter-Paramedic, and Firefighter-Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
Before enrolling, research the fire departments that you intend to apply to. Remember that some departments may pay for your education if you commit to x-amount of time as a volunteer EMT.

, Become familiar with your potential employer by visiting the station and speaking directly with paramedics on hand. Take advantage of any outreach or ride-along programs that they may offer for an inside view of what the job actually entails. Ask for any tips, advice, or considerations that may not be included on their website or other recruitment materials.Find out such info as:


Whether you will be expected to live part-time at the station house.Whether paramedics double as firefighters in this department.
What skillsets they require and which they are lacking (for instance, a foreign language that would be useful in serving an immigrant population within city limits).

"
"
Obtain all mandatory certifications.,
Present an application.,
Sit in for an interview.,
Submit to a background check.,
Pass the physical exam.,
Complete other mandated exams.,
Continue training.",How to Become a Firefighter Paramedic3," Whether you are applying to become an EMT or paramedic, become certified before applying, if required. First, research the department’s guidelines to be sure you receive certification from the specified source.Expect some to demand certification from state and/or local governments, while others accept it from private entities, such as universities and privately-run programs.If they accept certification from private entities, be discerning about which you seek out. Although certification from Source A and Source B are both legally valid, the department may value Source A if their reputation is more reputable., Visit the department's recruitment page online or contact them directly to find how when and how applications are accepted. Expect some departments to only accept applications when a position becomes available, while others accept them at all times. Follow each department's guidelines and include any required documentation that they might request.If paramedics are hired from within the current ranks of EMTs, inform your supervisor of your interest in promotion as soon as possible, whether or not there are any open positions. Once one opens, you will be contacted and considered., Research the department's hiring process beforehand. Find out if the first interview is conducted immediately upon submitting your application or afterward. Bring all necessary documents (such as your driver’s license, degrees, and certifications) for inspection.Anticipate questions regarding:Personal questions, such as your interest in the field and your goals for the future.
Job-related questions, like the proper procedure in treating specific medical emergencies.
Character-based questions, such as dealing with coworkers' dangerous and/or illegal behavior.

, Allow the department to fingerprint you so they can have a law enforcement agency run your prints and ID. Also expect them to research your online presence, credit history, and driving record.If you have any felonies or misdemeanors on your record, research the department’s policy regarding these before you apply.


Although some departments may immediately reject applicants with a criminal history, others may still allow you to apply after being interviewed and cleared by a designated office. However, they will not consider any application that does not include documentation of this clearance.Background checks may also include drug tests and psychological exams., Expect the nature of this test to differ from one department to the next. Some may only require you to pass the Candidate Physical Agility Test (CPAT) or similar physical challenge. Others may include such tests as part of their academy, which you may have to attend along with firefighter-applicants.Either way, anticipate having to prove your physical fitness and endurance by successfully completing simulated examples of real-world challenges, such as:


Hauling heavy firefighting and/or medical equipment.
Climbing up and down fire ladders that are extended two stories high or more.
Personally lifting and carrying “victims” who are unable to walk.
Partnering with another applicant to carry patients on stretchers up and down multiple flights of stairs.

, Again, expect the exact nature of these to vary depending on where you are applying. As a paramedic with the fire department, you may be expected to attend their academy and complete the same coursework as firefighter-applicants.If not, you may have to complete a basic aptitude test, which may focus primarily on firefighting or test your medical knowledge as well.You may also need to pass a civil service exam.The discrepancy between departments regarding testing is an important reason to research and visit each department before applying. Learn exactly what you need to prepare for in order to ensure success.

, Once hired, expect your employment to be considered probationary.If you were hired on condition of earning certification after the fact, do so. Even if you did obtain all necessary certification before applying, anticipate having to complete further coursework, training, and exams once hired.Although the length of probation may vary from department to department, expect it to last approximately one year after your date of hire.


Additionally, the evolving nature of medicine means that you will be expected to undergo new training throughout your career. Also, you will need to seek recertification continually.

Delete any accounts associated with pro ana/pro mia websites, forums or tips sites.,
Take 50 (or another fairly high number) of sticky notes, and on each one write a compliment to yourself.,
Burn any physical pro ana/pro mia memories you have, such as photographs of very underweight people, a diary of what you ate during your pro ana/pro mia phase or clothes that you bought that were intentionally too small to try to lose weight to get into them.,
If you haven't already, let someone know that you used pro ana/mia resources and you may struggle without them.,
Take full part in any eating disorder recovery programs you are put on.,
If you feel like you might be triggered or might re-visit pro ana/mia, separate yourself from however you may access it.,

, It could be anything from 'You have beautiful eyes' to 'You won the poetry cup in sixth grade'. Once you have completed them all, fold them into quarters and put them into something like an empty matchbox or a jar.

, Then, whenever you are triggered or feel inclined to go back to pro ana/mia, you will have someone to tell and someone who may be able to stop you.

, Engage in counselling and group discussions. The aids which help normal eating disorder sufferers may be especially helpful to those who relied on pro ana/mia as they are good at getting people to accept that their illness was just that - an illness.

, Turn off your computer and phone and ask someone to hide them, or if you used pro ana/mia through books, give them to someone else to look after. If you remove the possibility of reaching pro ana/mia, you will slowly become less dependent.

, Reading the symptoms during recovery may be triggering to some post-pro ana/mia users, but may be useful to others as they read about how anorexia and bulimia are illnesses and the negative affects on the body.

, If you did so, treat these two girls (or characters, however you saw them) as enemies in your head. Avoid them, and if you do end up running into them, think about them with dislike and a clear head. Don't allow them to charm themselves back into your life.

, On the anniversary of your first day, week, month and year without using pro ana/mia, buy yourself a little treat like a book or a CD. This may encourage you to go longer without using them, which would gradually force the habit to break.

Eat only when you're really hungry.,
Avoid bored eating.,
Manage your portions.,
Schedule meal times.Eating on a regular schedule at normal mealtimes will help your prevent binges.,
Be a mindful eater.Binge eating is often done quickly with little to no attention paid to what you are eating.,
Eat in the right places.,
Use the right dishware.,
Avoid trigger foods or situations.,
Consult a registered dietician.",How to Stop Binge Eating2," One of the main problems with binge eating is mindlessly eating when you are not hungry. This can lead you to overeat because you are already eating when you aren't hungry. Instead of eating whenever the feeling strikes, when you are stressed, or for any other reason, only eat when you are hungry.You can prevent this by only eating when you notice you are hungry. Take an assessment of how your body feels and see if you are hungry.
You should also eat a meal or snack as soon as you realize you are hungry. If you wait until you are starving, you may be tempted to binge eat as much as possible., You may start mindlessly eating because you are bored.If you aren't hungry but have the compulsion to binge eat, ask yourself if you're eating just because you're bored. Are you peering into the fridge just because you're looking for something to do? If so, avoid eating.


Instead, drink a glass of water or find a way to stay active. Take a walk, call your best friend, or pick up a new hobby instead of eating., One way to lessen the chance of binge eating is to maintain portion control. Don't ever eat anything right out of a bag or box because you won't know how much you're eating. Measure out your meals and snacks, putting them in bowls or on plates. This will keep your eating habits within a normal range instead of pushing you to overeat or binge.Instead of deprivation, focus on moderation.If you're having a craving for peanut butter, have a spoonful of peanut butter with a banana. This will keep you from reaching your breaking point five days later and eating an entire jar of peanut butter.

, If you go for half a day without eating, you will be much more likely to indulge in a binge. This may look like three meals or five to six smaller meals — consider talking to a nutritionist to figure out the best meal plan for your lifestyle. Find a way to eat healthy foods that you do love so your meals are nourishing and delicious.


This will help your not feel like you're just making your way through a boring tasteless meal instead of eating what you really want.Keep healthy snacks around the house to eat in between meals. You should eat three distinct meals, but keep around healthy options like fruits, nuts, and veggies to snack on in between meals.

, If you pay attention to everything you eat, you will be less likely to get lost and not know what you are eating. Take time to consider what your food looks like, feel the food in your mouth, smell what it smells like, and taste what it tastes like. This will help you be aware of what you're eating.Each meal should have a distinct start and stop. Don't graze for twenty minutes while you're cooking your dinner, or snack while you're cleaning up after a meal.

, Make sure you eat your meals at the kitchen table or another place designated for eating. Don't eat in front of the TV or your computer, or even when you're on the phone, or you won't be focused on what you're eating and will be less likely to enjoy what you're eating or to truly feel full.


Those who while distracted — watching TV or while working — tend to eat more than those who focus on their meal.You should also not eat standing up, since this will make the act feel disconnected from the eating process.

, Eat your meals and snacks on smaller plates with smaller forks or spoons. The smaller plates and bowls will make you feel like you're eating more food, and the smaller forks or spoons will make you take more time to digest your food.


This will help you avoid overfilling your plate, which may make you more likely to eat more.

, Another way to avoid binging is to keep yourself away from situations or foods that could lead to a binge.Taking measures to prevent binges in and out of your home will have a big impact on how you address your cravings. Avoiding triggers means recognizing a high-risk situation and creating a game plan to deal with it.


Try to spend more of your social time doing activities that don't involve food. Take a friend for a hike or a walk, or meet your friends at a bar that you know doesn't serve food.
If you're going to a family party or a potluck that you know will be filled with delicious foods and desserts, set out food limits for yourself. Tell yourself you can only have one plate of food and stick to it.
Bring your own snacks to places with tempting snacks. If you know you'll be tempted to binge eat popcorn at your local theater, sneak in your own portion controlled snacks, such as trail mix or microwave popcorn.

, Many individuals with eating disorders consider getting help from a dietician. She can help you make a meal plan, decide what you need to eat every day, what portions you should eat, and how to change your relationship to the food. Your dietician can help you come up with sample menus, food lists, and portions to each per meal.This will help prevent you from binge eating because your food will be preset for each meal.
Your dietician can also help you get back to listening to your body's natural cues on when to eat and when to stop eating, which is important for BED.Be aware that the term ""nutritionist"" is vague and could refer to someone with a PhD, or someone who has just done a quick course on nutrition — that is, she may not be qualified to give you sound nutritional advice. A registered dietician is considered a health professional with the requisite education and certifications, and is legally allowed to ""prescribe"" a meal plan or treatment."

Manage your stress.,
Keep a journal.Keeping a journal where you can write down your thoughts, discuss your cravings, and reflect after an episode of binge eating can help you feel more in touch with your feelings.,
Listen to your body.",How to Stop Binge Eating3," Binge eating may be in response to other areas of your life. If you feel out of control in other areas of your life, you may binge eat to feel in control of the situations. This may be because you're worried about another aspect of your life, such as your job, personal relationships, or the health of a loved one. One way to help change your binge eating is to manage the stress in your life.Reflect on your situation to help with stress. Are there multiple factors in your life that are leading to your stress? How can you minimize these factors? For example, if a major source of stress in your life is living with an unbearable roommate, it may be time to get out of the situation so you feel more mentally sound.
Do activities that can help you feel at ease. Try yoga, meditation, or going for long walks.Listen to jazz or classical music. Do what you need to do to feel more in control of your life.

, It may also help you identify your triggers.Taking the time out of your day to think about your actions and feelings can have a big impact on how you approach your life.


Be honest with yourself. Write down how you're feeling about all aspects of your life, from your relationships to your relationship with food. You may even surprise yourself.
Keep a log of the food you've eaten, but don't let it lead you to obsess over every little thing you eat (logging your food may not be productive for someone with obsessive tendencies). Sometimes knowing that you have to write down everything you eat will keep you from overindulging. If you start to feel a lot of anxiety around logging your food or find that you are being extremely rigid, try taking a step back and a break from logging.
You should also write down what you wanted to — but didn't — eat. This will help you notice trigger foods.This will also help you discuss your binge eating habits with your doctor and therapist so you they can help you change this behavior and notice warning signs., Take the time to connect your mind and your body. If you know what your body is really telling you, it will be easier to understand what leads to your binge eating episodes and to manage your eating. If you feel the urge to binge eat, try doing something else, such as take a walk, read a book, or some other diverting exercise until your craving passes.If you have a craving, don't give into it instantly. Decide if you are really hungry or if you just want to compulsively eat. If you have eaten recently or if your stomach is not growling, you may not actually be hungry. Try to ride it out — allow time to let the craving pass."
"
Notice recurrent episodes of excessive eating.,
Assess your feelings during and after eating.,
Look for other characteristic behaviors.,
Differentiate between other eating disorders.",How to Stop Binge Eating4," The first symptom of binge eating disorder is frequent instances of excessive, or binge, eating. Eating is considered binge if, over a short period of time (a two-hour period), you eat way more than is considered normal.There will also be a feeling of a loss of control over what you are eating and over the ability to stop eating.To be considered binge eating disorder, these episodes must occur at least once a week for three months., There are certain feelings associated with binge eating, both during and after. If you have binge eating disorder, you will feel uncomfortable and unhappy during your binge eating. You will also feel overwhelmingly distressed following your binge eating episodes. These can include physical feelings as well as mental feelings. If you have binge eating disorder, you will experience at least three of the following:

An urge to continue to eat even though you are not physically hungry
Eating much faster than normal
Needing to eat past the point of being full, causing discomfort
Being embarrassed about how much you are eating, causing you to eat alone
Being disgusted with yourself, depressed, or extremely guilty after a binge

, Binge eating disorder manifests itself in additional behavioral issues within your life. When you are trying to decide if you have BED, you can look for other behaviors in addition to binge eating. These behaviors include:Secretive eating behaviors, such as eating behind closed doors, in your car, or away from others
Stealing, hoarding, or hiding food
Cyclical bouts of strict, extreme dieting or fasting in between binges
Obsessive food behavior, such as eating only one type of food, not allowing different food types to touch, or excessive chewing
Making lifestyle and schedule changes to make time for binge eating
Eating constantly throughout the day with no strict meal times
Skipping normal meal times or limiting portions of foods at meal times
Feeling depressed often or being clinically diagnosed with depression
Being disgusted with your body size

, Binge eating disorder may be confused with some other eating disorders. Bulimia is often confused with binge eating disorder, but there is a major difference between the two disorders: If you have binge eating disorder, you never try to purge the food you eat after an episode of binge eating. With bulimia, you do purge after you eat, even when you eat small meals.Purging includes forced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, or other unnatural ways to get rid of food."
"
Identify unhealthy eating patterns.,
Look for significant weight loss.,
Listen for a preoccupation with being thin.,
Note a preoccupation with body image.,
Watch for excessive exercising.,
Identify the use of illegal or prescription drugs.",How to Spot Eating Disorders in Men1," The first thing that might indicate that someone has an eating disorder is the way that they eat. This includes the types of foods they will and will not eat, the amount of food that they eat, and how they eat their food. Pay attention to the person’s eating behaviors to determine if he may have an eating disorder.For example, a man with anorexia may only eat low-calorie foods, such as lettuce, celery, and carrots. He may also limit his food intake by eating extremely small servings, or by staying within a rigid calorie limit, such as 800 calories per day. You might also notice that he avoids eating around people.
Someone who is bulimic might exhibit unhealthy eating patterns by eating large amounts of food, but never seeming to gain weight. However, people with bulimia are more likely to binge in secret than in front of other people, so you might never see this behavior. Pay attention to whether or not he goes to the bathroom immediately after eating.
Watch for excessive overeating in men with binge-eating disorder. Men who have binge-eating disorder may eat to excess on a regular basis. They may eat this way even if they are not hungry.;
, If you notice that a man has recently lost a significant amount of weight in a short space of time, then this can also indicate a problem. Watch for a significant drop in weight as a sign of an eating disorder.For example, if a man who is a healthy weight drops 20 pounds in one month, then this would be cause for concern.
Pay attention to signs of weight loss, such as looser fitting clothing, a more pronounced bone structure, or claims of significant weight loss.

, Someone who has an eating disorder desires to be thin so much that it will dominate his life. You might notice that the person talks constantly about dieting, calories, food, exercise, and other weight loss topics. This is common in people with eating disorders.Reflect on how often the person talks about weight loss, nutrition, and exercise. Do the person’s comments seem healthy or obsessive? How much of his time do these topics seem to occupy?
For example, you might have a friend who tells you about a new diet or exercise program he learned about every time you see him. He might talk about nothing but dieting and exercise when you are together.

, People who have eating disorders are overly focused on their bodies and the often have distorted perceptions of themselves. Therefore, someone with an eating disorder may look at himself in the mirror constantly, criticize his body, and compare himself to others.Pay attention to how often this may talks about or seems focused on his body. Does this preoccupation interfere with his life or relationships? Has he stopped engaging in other interests because of his preoccupation with his body? If so, then he may have an eating disorder.

, Men with eating disorders are more likely than women with eating disorders to engage in excessive exercise behaviors. This may include exercising to excess to offset calories after eating, or spending hours at the gym on a daily basis.Consider how much time he devotes to exercise. If he is devoting an unreasonable amount of time to exercise every day, then this can be a good indication that he may have an eating disorder.

, It is common for people with eating disorders to use illicit or prescription drugs to help reduce appetite and increase metabolism. For example, he might use cocaine, amphetamines, or diet pills to help reduce his appetite and speed up his metabolism.Consider any drug use that you have noticed in the person.

However, if your anorexia is controlling your daily life or if you are severely underweight or malnourished, then you may want to consider seeking help from an in-patient facility., Emotional problems are typically at the root of disordered eating. You may try to restrict your eating to feel more in control of other stressors in life. A mental health therapist can help you learn to acknowledge and cope with these emotional problems so that you can return to healthier eating habits.

See a therapist who has experience treating individuals with eating disorders. Common treatments include talk therapy, which may include family therapy or individual therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy has proven effective at helping individuals with anorexia modify negative thought patterns that contribute to their disorder., Treatment for anorexia generally involves an interdisciplinary approach in which you count on the advice of various professionals. A registered dietitian can help you figure out what calories and nutrients your body needs to restore health and return to an appropriate body weight. A dietitian will also work with you to improve your relationship with food., You will need to meet with your doctor regularly for medical monitoring. These visits may consist of weigh-ins and tests to check important health indicators. Medical monitoring is especially important if anorexia led to malnourishment., In addition to medical monitoring, your doctor may also prescribe you medications to cope with any underlying symptoms affecting your condition. People with anorexia may struggle with other conditions, such as anxiety and depression that require pharmacological intervention.

Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants to relieve depressive symptoms and promote weight gain. In addition, you might benefit from taking anxiolytic medications that reduce anxiety associated with eating.Be sure to take your medications as prescribed by your doctor. It may take several weeks for medications to produce effects. Never stop taking your medications without consulting with your doctor first.

, Being in a support group can help you to see that you are viewing yourself in an unrealistic way. Support groups for eating disorders are often facilitated by mental health counselors or therapists. However, some support groups are run by trained volunteers who have overcome their own battles with eating disorders.

In these groups, you can seek out the company and support of those who understand your recovery journey, and who can offer you valuable tips for coping.
Ask your treatment team for recommendations about eating disorder support groups in your area."

Reflect on the person’s family history.,
Note any psychological factors.,
Watch for eating disorder symptoms in professional athletes.,
Be aware that sexual orientation does not matter.",How to Spot Eating Disorders in Men2," People with eating disorder may come from families where eating disorders are common or where other types of mental illness are prevalent. Think about whether or not other family members have dealt with eating disorders or other mental health issues.For example, if he has a parent or sibling who had an eating disorder, then he is at a higher risk of developing one himself. Likewise, having a parent or sibling who suffered from depression or an anxiety disorder may also put him at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder.

, People who have eating disorders often have other mental health issues that put them at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder. Consider whether this man has dealt with any mental health issues himself.For example, a man who has an anxiety disorder or depression may be more likely to develop and eating disorder.
High stress levels can increase a man’s risk of developing an eating disorder as well. Pay attention to stressors such as a difficult job, financial troubles, and relationship issues.
A history of abuse or alcoholism can also increase the risk of developing an eating disorder in some men, so consider these factors as well., Professional athletes have a higher incidence of eating disorders, especially those who participate in sports that require lots of jumping.For example, someone who is a pole vaulter may be more likely to develop an eating disorder. Ballet dancers, models, and actors are also more prone to eating disorders because of the pressure to stay thin for the job.If he is involved in a sport, then consider whether this may be putting pressure on him and increasing his desire to be thin.

, Anyone can develop an eating disorder whether they are gay or straight, male or female. Among men with eating disorders, about half are gay and half are straight.However, there is some evidence that gay men may be at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder due to peer pressure and media influence.Do not use sexual orientation as evidence that a man may have an eating disorder, but recognize that there may be a higher risk for a man to develop an eating disorder if he is gay.

Identify signs of anorexia.,
Look for signs of bulimia.,
Watch for signs of binge-eating disorder.,
Encourage the person to seek help.",How to Spot Eating Disorders in Men3," Anorexia causes people to restrict food to an unhealthy level and to try to lose as much weight as possible.

Learn to identify and accept your emotions.,
Develop a self-care plan to cope with negative emotions.,
Challenge unhealthy self-talk.,
Focus on your positive traits.,
Build a strong support system.,
Pursue fulfilling hobbies and passions.",How to Recover from Anorexia2," An attempt to avoid negative feelings may be one of the reasons you fell into disordered eating patterns. You can learn to recognize and tolerate your feelings with mindfulness.The next time you are overcome by strong emotions, pause. Breathe deeply. Take some time to sit with these feelings. Try to label what they are (e.g. sadness, guilt, etc.).
Identify any thoughts that are associated with these feelings. Pay attention to how these feelings manifest in your body (e.g. tightness in your chest). Continue to sit with these feelings without judging yourself or trying to make them go away.

, It can help to create a soothing care plan that helps you be good to yourself when negative emotions arise. Anorexia has caused you to develop destructive habits that harm your body, so create a list of nurturing habits that allow you to pour love back into yourself.For instance, when you feel sad, you might call a friend for support. Other suggestions include performing self-massage, taking a bubble bath, eating a balanced meal, lighting a scented candle, or taking a walk by the riverside.
Turn to these activities instead of over-exercising or restricting your foods in response to uncomfortable feelings.

, Unrealistic, self-defeating thought patterns are at the core of eating disorders like anorexia. You may only focus on the negatives of a situation, place pressure on yourself to be perfect, or always jump to conclusions. Learn to cross-examine your thought patterns, tearing them apart to reveal how weak and unrealistic they are. Then, you can replace them with adaptive thoughts.For instance, you might look at yourself in the mirror and say “I look disgusting.” Ask yourself how would you respond if you heard a friend say this to themselves. Can you rephrase this harmful statement?
You might change “I look disgusting” into “I am unhappy with how I look. But the doctor says I am at a healthy weight and I am healing. This is a good thing.”

, When you’re only focusing on what you don’t like, you discount all the wonderful things about yourself. Train your mind’s eye to view the positives. To do this, start a list of your positive qualities. Read the list aloud every day while looking in the mirror. Pull out the list when you start to give into negative thought patterns.You might write, “I am…funny, compassionate, intelligent, and artistic.”
Include any positive qualities others have made about you.

, Being around positive and healthy people can help you feel supported as you recover from anorexia. Identify the people in your life who have positive viewpoints about their bodies and healthy relationships with food. Also, look for people who have an optimistic outlook on life. Make an effort to spend more time with these people., Keep yourself preoccupied with positive activities. Doing so can help you cope with negative emotions that trigger unhealthy eating. If you are in high school or college, join a few clubs, organizations, or sports teams at your school. If you are not in school, pick up a hobby you once enjoyed or commit to volunteering in the local community.Examples of positive hobbies may include joining political activist organizations, joining an intramural sports team, or participating in a writing group.

Consume a regular, balanced diet.,
Remove your scale.,
Don’t overdo it in the gym.,
Avoid negative media.",How to Recover from Anorexia3," Working with a registered dietitian is the best way to develop a customized eating plan to help overcome anorexia. The primary focus, however, is to stop dieting. Dieting builds an attitude of restriction. Avoid this and focus on nourishing your body with healthy foods.Learn to listen to your body and eat when you are hungry. Choose whole foods that provide essential vitamins and nutrients like fruits, vegetables, lean sources of protein, healthy fats, and whole grains.
Ensure that you are eating several small meals throughout the day and getting the necessary calories as suggested by your dietitian.

, Many people associate health with a number on the scale. However, every body is different and the scale doesn’t really tell you anything about health. If you have an obsession with weighing yourself—which leads to unhealthy behaviors like restricting calories or over-exercising—get rid of your scale., Physical activity is an important ingredient to a healthy body and lifestyle. However, if you tend to overdo it to control your weight, you will need to find a healthy medium. Work with your treatment team to determine the right amount of exercise for you.This may involve doing gentle restorative exercises like yoga, walking, or physical chores like gardening. Take your workouts outside to reap the mental health benefits of nature.
Be wary of guilt-inducing behaviors that can trigger a relapse like punishing yourself for missing a workout by skipping meals. If this happens, seek out your therapist for help.

, Fashion magazines and beauty blogs can be ripe with unrealistic ideals of the human body. Exposure to such negative media can further distort your body image and compromise anorexia recovery. End your subscriptions to such media sources and become a critical observer of other forms of media.Remind yourself that human bodies come in all shapes and sizes. The bodied features on TV and in magazines have often been retouched to appear thinner and flawless.
Embrace media sources that emphasize a variety of bodies like the Project HEAL campaign, #WhatMakesMeBeautiful.You might also look into the “Embrace” campaign, which is aimed at helping people accept their body image."

See if you meet basic requirements.,
Think about how the career fits your lifestyle.",How to Become a Doula in Wisconsin," There are two types of work a doula does: birth support and postpartum assistance. You can choose to specialize in either option or get training and work in both fields.

Having a formal education, which is the first step to getting a certification, has the added benefit of making you appear more professional and introducing you to other doulas.Signing up for a certification program will put you on the path to getting certification as a doula through education and practical experience.
Consider the different program options. There are certification programs from organizations such as DONA International, Cappa, and Childbirth International. Although each program has different requirements for obtaining certification, they have the same basic components of education, practical experience, and an examination. Review the features of each program and see which best suits your needs for being a birth or postpartum doula, or both. Think about other factors such as cost, time frame for obtaining certification, ability to take courses and attend births, as well as local support from the organization.

In general, these include elements such as attending a postpartum doula workshop; reading and being familiar with the codes of ethics and standards of practice for postpartum doulas; completing any required reading on subjects such as becoming a mother and postpartum care, newborn care and development, breastfeeding, family dynamics, and business practices., Most doula certification programs have a clinical or practical component as a part of their education. This step requires that you attend a specific number of births and/ or postpartum visits. Clinical experience can give you valuable practical experience, expose you to the job of being a doula, and further prepare you for taking any required exams.Provide birth or postpartum support to several families to reinforce your coursework. Get as much experience as you can so that you can build a strong portfolio towards certification.

Consider recertification requirements when you start your course. For example, you may only need to attend a certain number of births to recertify. However, recertification may also require further coursework or attending workshops., As a birth or postpartum doula, you can work in several different types of environments. Depending on your preferences and experience, you might find work at a birthing center, hospital, doctor’s office, or in private homes.


Send letters of intent to local facilities about the possibility of working for them or consulting with their clients. For example, you could let a local OB/GYN know that you’re recently certified as a doula and keen to gain experience. Then inquire if the doctor would be interested in working with you or even advertising your services.
Ask fellow doulas in your local area if they know about job opportunities. For example, if you are in the greater Madison area, the South Central Wisconsin Doula Network can point you to job opportunities.
Check the websites of professional organizations such as CAPPA, Dona International and Childbirth International for possible job opportunities.
Register yourself with a local placement agency to help you find a job as a doula.

, If you prefer to be slightly more flexible with your time or choose your specific clients, consider working on your own as an independent doula or by setting up your own practice. You can advertise your skills at local hospitals, doctor’s offices or even in the local media.

Remember that an 8-hour labor is considered quick and you’ll need to spend time in prenatal and postpartum care, too. You could spend a full day or longer attending a birth, which takes a physical and emotional toll on you, too.
How many clients per week and per year you can see. If you want to make sure you attend each client’s birth, you may have to limit the total number of clients you see in a given week or year.
What you want to charge. You’ll need to account for your time spent giving any case and consider expenses for items such as equipment, self-employment taxes, and insurance.

Consider hosting occasional events in your home, which can help you get to know other doulas and may bring work your way.

, Supporting laboring women and new mothers and babies can be extremely rewarding. It won’t be smoothing sailing at all times because any woman can experience complications, but there are many advantages to being a doula.Consider being a doula if you want to work in the medical profession without becoming an OB/GYN or labor and delivery nurse. Providing assistance and support to laboring woman and new mothers can be rewarding no only for you, but also the families you support.
Be aware that attending a delivery may have emotional demands. You may be dealing with birth complications or a sick mother or baby. These situations can upset you. You may also have to positively maneuver interpersonal dynamics or situations involving patients and their family members or medical professionals. If you like working with and helping people, then a career as a doula might be just right for you.

, You’ll need special education and training to be a certified doula. Making sure you meet the basic requirements and taking an honest look at your personality can help you decide the best way to become a doula in Wisconsin.


Consider meeting with a doula to ask any questions you have about the career, including what education and certifications you may need. You could also ask her if you could shadow her for a day so that you can get a better sense of what a typical working day entails.
Be aware that there are currently no educational requirements to become a doula. However, having a high school diploma, GED, or even a college degree might give you some foundational information that can assist your training and work as a doula., Being a doula can be very rewarding, but also comes certain time and place demands. Figuring out if you can pursue your dream and maintain your lifestyle may help you decided on your specific path as a doula. Ask yourself some of the following questions:Can I keep up with possible physical demands? You might be awake for long hours and have to be on your feet during this time, too. You may also get a woman who squeezes your hand hard or thrashes around during delivery, both of which could injure you.
Does my personality fit being a doula? Working with expectant or new mothers, their families, and medical professional is a big part of being a doula. A career as a doula might be great if you’re outgoing and/ or enjoy helping others.
How does it fit in my lifestyle? Doulas are often at the whim of a baby, so you’ll need to be available at basically any time of the day or night and during the week or on weekends.
Will I make enough money as a doula? In Wisconsin, doulas earn on average $33,000. Depending on where in Wisconsin you work and your client base, you could make more or less. If you work as a consultant, you may also have to pay taxes and for health benefits, vacation, and sick time.Be aware that because doulas are increasingly popular, your job prospects look very good.

Look for signs of eating in secret.,
Consider how preoccupied they are with food.,
Observe whether they count calories.,
Fearing becoming “fat”.,
Beware of binge eating.,
Look for signs of purging.,
Consider whether they have food phobias.,
Think about whether they avoid people.",How to Recognize Eating Disorders in Teenagers," For example, Patients suffering with bulimia nervosa are driven by the compulsion to hoard and eat copious amounts of food in secrecy.;
, For example, anorexic patients often spend substantial time watching television cooking programs, looking up recipes, grocery shopping, packing lunches for siblings and parents, planning and preparing menus for their families. Many patients will hoard food, but won’t eat it. They also may be overly critical of the eating habits of their friends or family members. Food is always the main topic of conversation, reading, dreams, and papers. Patients commonly will seek occupations that put them in contact with food.


A common symptom of starvation is hoarding of food. In the Minnesota starvation study, it was observed that subjects continued to be overwhelmed by persistent thoughts of food and eating. Food became a primary topic of conversation, reading, and daydreams. Patients suffering with bulimia nervosa are driven by the compulsion to hoard and eat copious amounts of food in secrecy.

, Repetitively counting calories suggests increasing preoccupation with food and eating. Most patients will continuously read recipes, food labels, count fat grams, weigh and measure food, and eventually advance to controlling the “acceptable” amount of food to be consumed. For some adolescents, when the set number is exceeded, they participate in compensatory behaviors such as purging, excessive exercise, and restriction to ""un-do"" the amounts consumed.

, Persistently expressing feelings of fear and distress about getting “fat” or gaining weight.

, For example, repeatedly engaging in binge eating episodes where they eat a large amount of food in a short period of time. During these episodes they will feel a loss of control over their eating and may not be able to stop even if they want to. They will also have a range of detectable eating habits. These habits can include eating very quickly, eating when they are not actually hungry and continuing to eat even when they are full, to the point where they feel uncomfortable.

, Adolescents with purging symptoms consistently use self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics or other dangerous ways to control their weight or shape. They are also not significantly underweight. They typically fall within a normal weight range.

, For example, fear of certain foods may be an indicative sign of an eating disorder. As, high-fat foods may increase anxiety levels in some teens with eating disorders. When avoiding these foods, they feel that they can momentarily keep their anxiety under control. This is also known as “negative reinforcement”.

, Eating disorder behaviors come along with increased social isolation and social withdrawal, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities and a negative impact on self-esteem. They develop a primary relationship and identity with the actual eating disorder. Consequently, making their world much smaller and not having time or energy for people or activities. Usually, as the illness progresses and symptoms deepen they tend to withdraw more. Adolescents with eating disorders will always seek to avoid eating and this includes avoiding situations where it would be expected that they eat.

Educate yourself.,
Recognize the symptoms of eating disorders.,
Be receptive.,
Use the right language.,
Avoid shaming, blaming, or guilting.",How to Speak Supportively to Someone With an Eating Disorder1," Research what it means to suffer from an eating disorder, how people cope with it, and what steps can be taken to overcome the problem. It is important that you have at least a little bit of background knowledge so the person will listen to you and think that you are someone they can talk to about their problem.The more you learn about their condition, the better equipped you’ll be to approach them with your concern. They may be suffering from extreme levels of anxiety or depression that you are unaware of. But learning about the condition might make you realize that these factors could be affecting them too.;
, If you suspect someone you care about is suffering from an eating disorder, make sure you do a little checking before you broach the subject with them. It is important to recognize the symptoms so you don’t make any false accusations or unnecessarily bring up a tough subject.Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include abnormally low body weight, taking extreme measures to control body weight (including laxatives, diet pills, or intense exercising), and a distorted perception of one’s own body.
Symptoms of bulimia nervosa include episodes of binge eating (eating more than you should or more than you feel comfortable consuming) followed by episodes of purging the excess calories – usually through vomiting, but sometimes through extreme exercise or laxatives. There is usually an intense feeling of shame or guilt associated with the binging.

, Be supportive, but be receptive to what you think that they really need. Don't make false promises and try to convince them that everything will be okay if it seems like that isn’t what they need to hear.Some people just want a sympathetic shoulder to cry on, not someone to tell them how to fix things. You need to comfort them with love and support no matter what.

, Make sure you explicitly state your support of the person so they don’t feel like you are attacking them. Choose your words carefully so that you don’t alienate or upset the person. You want to make them feel safe and comfortable talking to you.Try to avoid the topic of food. Focus on the person and your own feelings instead.
Never tell someone that they are looking “healthier.” The individual will only hear that they've gained weight and it could be possibly triggering.
Consider using externalizing language to talk about the person’s eating disorder. Some people have found that speaking about the eating disorder as if it is an outside entity can help them to fight back against it. If the person is open to it, consider referring to the eating disorder as “Ed” or choosing another name to describe the eating disorder rather than linking it with the person., These kinds of negative statements are just attempts at manipulation on your part. You want them to change their behavior, so it is tempting to try to convince them in whatever way possible. However, these methods won’t work because they have to change for themselves, not for you.Avoid accusatory “you” statements like “you need to eat something” or “you have to stop making yourself sick.” They will not be influenced solely by words if it is a serious eating disorder. This will just upset them and make them feel more frustrated because they will feel that no one understands them.
Instead, use “I” statements like “I feel scared when I hear you vomiting” or “I’m concerned about your health.”

Do your research.,
Go to eating disorder events.,
Have materials to pass out.,
Talk to people in your day-to-day life.,
Tell your story.",How to Raise Eating Disorder Awareness1," To be really be effective at raising awareness, it helps to know your material first. Even if you have experience with an eating disorder, reading up on how it affects other people can be helpful. Put in some time reading up on eating disorders so you can help educate others.Pick a good site, such as the NEDA's site for more reliable information. Look for .gov, .edu, and .org sites for the best information. There are lots of eating disorder resources available at: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/resource-links
;
, You'll find there are conferences, seminars, and other events across the country that provide information on eating disorders. You can become informed yourself, as well as meet other people who want to raise awareness about the problem.Attending support groups as a participant or as an observer can help you to gain great first-hand knowledge about eating disorders.
Ask around at your local colleges about events. You can also check with local counseling centers.
Some national organizations organize information on events, such as Eating Disorder Hope., If you do want to talk to people about eating disorders, it can be helpful to be prepared with something the person can read. The NEDA provides handouts that you can print out and have on hand, so that you're ready if someone asks for more information., If you can, try to incorporate information about eating disorders in your everyday life by identifying times where it makes sense. For example, if someone makes an ignorant comment, such as, ""I wish I had anorexia. Then I'd be skinny,"" you can respond with a kind, but informative comment, such as, ""Anorexia is actually a terrible disease. It causes X number of deaths a year. Please don't make light of it.""

, Sharing your experiences can help to normalize it, and it may also help other people to recognize that they might have a problem. If you have a personal story to tell, that's a great way to help people understand where you're coming from. Of course, that can make you feel a bit vulnerable, so it's a good idea to get what you want to say straight ahead of time.


Try writing out your story. Once you've gotten the raw story out, spend a little time editing it. Try to make sure it's short enough to connect with people. Anything more than a couple of paragraphs (or five minutes spoken) will likely be too long for most situations.
Use your story by sharing it with people and on platforms like social media.

Walk for awareness.,
Work with a nonprofit or other organization.,
Talk to your government representatives.,
Consider starting a blog.",How to Raise Eating Disorder Awareness2," Many causes use walks to raise awareness, including raising awareness for eating disorders. The NEDA has walks to raise awareness across the country, so use their website to find one near you. If there's not one near you, you can work to bring one to your area.Walking for a cause raises awareness in several ways. It garners media attention because so many people are gathered together for a cause. It also raises awareness because you are asked to help raise money by getting people you know to sponsor you.
When approaching friends, family, and co-workers, keep your spiel short and sweet. You could say, ""I'm participating in the NEDA's walk to raise awareness for eating disorders. This cause is important to me because I have family members who have been affected by eating disorders. The walk is next month. Would you be willing to sponsor me?""

, Many communities have organizations that raise awareness for eating disorders. By working with those organizations, you can help the cause. Volunteering your time at one of these organizations is a great way to contribute to raising awareness.Contact your local organization for nonprofits to see if there's a group like that in your area. You can also use a national directory, such as the one put together by Eating Disorder Hope.These organizations likely need a wide variety of volunteers with a wide variety of skills, so don't worry that you won't have anything to offer.

, One way you can raise awareness is to talk to your government officials. They have the power to enact laws that can make a difference for those with eating disorders, and it's especially important to call or write when you know a piece of related legislation is up for a vote.Stay in touch with advocacy organizations to find out what legislation is up for a vote. For instance, you can get on a mailing list for an advocacy organization.

Discuss why you're calling (eating disorders), and add why it's important to you. The staff member will pass your information on to the representative.
Another option is to write an email or letter. Once again, state why you're writing, and give a short anecdote about why it's important to you. You can find the addresses for your representatives online.

, One way you can help raise awareness is to start a blog. A blog is a series of posts that you share with the internet in a dedicated space. Blogs are free to start, and all you need to do is put together what you want to say.


It's a good idea to have a focus for your blog. For example, you could focus on sharing your personal journey with an eating disorder or you could focus on ways eating disorders affect a certain population, such as high school students.
If you would rather make videos, then you can start a video blog, or ""vlog,"" on a site such as Youtube. You can use your vlog as a platform to raise awareness and connect with other people.

Seek out psychotherapy.,
Join a support group for people with BED.,
Consider supplementing psychotherapy and behavioral interventions with appropriate medication.,
Read as much as you can.,
Understand the process of recovery is lifelong and expect setbacks.",How to Recover from Habitual Binge Eating2," For many, psychotherapy is the most effective means to treat BED. This can include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which addresses thought processes that trigger binge eating episodes. Self-awareness is the ultimate goal of this type of therapy, helping people with BED identify their triggers and devise strategies for how to steer clear of triggers or what to do when they encounter them. CBT also often includes psychoeducation about healthy habits.Interpersonal psychotherapy may help sufferers of BED to communicate better with friends, associates, and family. This can help people with BED establish healthy relationships to ensure needed emotional support and treat any underlying social issues., This may help you to learn to manage urges and feel less isolated. Support groups allow people to connect with others with similar problems, providing education and emotional support.


Overeaters Anonymous has groups in many cities across the U.S., Topamax and various antidepressant drugs can help control BED episodes; however, these drugs are should be used in conjunction with therapy and participation in support groups. Discuss the possible benefits and side effects with your doctor when deciding if medication is right for you.In order to be on medication, you'll need to have a prescription from your doctor or psychiatrist.

, Reading is a good way to better understand BED and gain insight into your experiences. Reading success stories may also provide hope and keep you motivated.


While reading, keep in mind your experience is unique. Pay attention to similarities, but avoid comparing yourself and your progress to others.

, Challenges are bound to crop up now and then. It is very important to continue to stick to the treatment plan, regardless of periodic relapses.Don't beat yourself up if you have a setback. Focus on overall progress rather than small failures. In the event of large setbacks, focus on future progress.

Know the symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder.,
Understand the emotional experiences of BED.,
Understand the causes of BED.",How to Recover from Habitual Binge Eating3," Any person can be guilty of eating too much food for the day, or overdoing it at holidays or special events, but BED is chronic and causes significant distress. BED is characterized by:Rapid eating (finishing a lot of food in just two hours or less).
The urge to keep on eating until feeling uncomfortable or sick.
The urge to eat even if the feeling of hunger is not there.
The preference to eat alone because of embarrassment from eating abnormally large amounts of food.
Feeling of shame, guilt, or disgust after the binge eating episode.

, Binge eating is often done in secret and will cause shame and guilt.To cope with these negative emotions, the sufferer may engage in further binging. This starts a vicious cycle that will continue until healthier coping strategies are developed.Eating may distract from or reduce negative emotions, but these benefits are temporary.

, Many people believe BED is a simple behavioral problem, but the causes are complex. Biology, culture and psychology all contribute to the development of BED.Critical comments about one's body and eating habits while young can set the stage for the onset of BED. People who struggle with bouts of depression may be more prone to developing BED. Self-esteem issues and loneliness can also be contributing factors."

Focus on your whole person.,
Highlight the positives about your body.,
Be critical of how bodies are portrayed in the media.,
Correct friends or family members who bad-mouth their bodies.,
Remind yourself that a certain body weight cannot bring you happiness.,
Say goodbye to perfectionism.",How to Prevent Anorexia1," Society often places a great deal of emphasis on outward appearance to the point of overlooking other wonderful features about a person. One way to develop better self-esteem is to think about all of your strengths. Make a list of all the qualities you feel describe you as a person. Also, think about ways others have spoken highly of your personal traits in the past. Include these compliments on the list as well.Tape this list on your bathroom mirror so whenever you find yourself judging your physical appearance, you can immediately correct these judgments by focusing on positive strengths you have in other areas of life.;
, This method is not suggesting that you point out specific aspects of your appearance like a slim nose or thighs. Instead, you need to direct your attention on how awesome the human body is without regard to appearance. For instance, you can pinpoint amazing abilities and functions that you are able to carry out because of your body.


Whenever you catch yourself being nit-picky about any perceived flaws on your body, try to correct yourself and declare positive affirmations like ""My legs and arms allow me to do cartwheels."", ""My heart is so strong it delivers blood to my entire body."" or ""My nose helps me to smell these beautiful flowers.""
Your body image may be poor if you are always directing your attention on what you think it is lacking. You can develop higher self-esteem and confidence if you uplift the wonderful things your body helps you to do.

, Socio-cultural factors present through media, the Western perception of thinness as a beauty ideal, and opinions formed in local communities or cultures may strongly influence young people who develop unhealthy views of their bodies.Be a rebel and admonish images on TV, the internet, or in magazines of females who are significantly underweight and males who are idolized for having perfectly muscular bodies. Make a point of reminding yourself that these are not real portrayals of the true range of human bodies.

, When you hear your mother, sisters, brothers, or friends down certain parts of their bodies for being too large or not good enough, stop them in their tracks. Tell them that speaking bad about their bodies is an unhealthy behavior and immediately compliment them on something that is not related to appearance such as them being awesome at soccer or having the highest GPA in their class.


Dissatisfaction with one's physical appearance is a warning sign for anorexia and other eating disorders.Reminding your friends of this may help to promote awareness and also help you to reinforce thinking about your body in a more positive manner.

, When you spend so much time idealizing a certain body weight you begin to view this as a key to happiness and feeling good about yourself. This is an unhealthy viewpoint and can lead to developing anorexia.


Despite what may be uplifted in the media, there is no ideal body types. Healthy human bodies come in all shapes and sizes. Furthermore, no amount of weight loss or change will suddenly make your life more exciting or enjoyable.If you have formed an association between happiness in life and your appearance, it may be necessary to visit with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. This type of treatment may be helpful for individuals at risk of eating disorders because it helps them identify and alter irrational or inaccurate thoughts and beliefs., Researchers have found a link between perfectionism and body dissatisfaction - a common problem for individuals with eating disorders.Therefore, you will need to do away with perfectionist tendencies and your need to control every situation if you want to avoid developing anorexia.Perfectionism is demonstrated when you often have trouble meeting your own standards. You may be very critical of yourself and your abilities. You may also procrastinate on tasks or do them over and over again until they meet your standards.
You can speak see a therapist for help with overcoming perfectionism. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be helpful in pinpointing perfectionist beliefs and finding ways of developing healthier expectations for yourself.

Observe signs of abnormal eating.,
Look for binge eating.,
Notice compensatory behaviors.",How to Spot an Eating Disorder in Someone You Know1," One way to spot symptoms is to simply be aware of the person’s behaviors when he eats. Try to understand your friend’s relationship with food.


Notice if the person eats large quantities of food even when he is not hungry.
Observe if your friend complains of a stomach ache or having eaten too much on a regular basis. This can be a sign of binge-eating.
See if the person self-medicates with food. People with eating issues may often use food as a way to feel better. Does your friend want to eat unhealthy when he is feeling sad or angry?
Notice if your friend never wants to eat around other people, or eats secretively. Does your friend hide food that he is eating so that others won’t see?
There may be a problem if your friend repeatedly makes excuses for not eating such as saying, “I’m not hungry,” very often.
Look for food hoarding. Individuals with eating disorders may hoard food out of embarrassment. They may stash food in a secret place to use for future binging.;
, Binge eating is one of the major symptoms associated with various eating disorders.While it is not necessary to diagnose certain eating disorders, it is very common.


Binge eating involves:

eating, in a discrete period of time (for example, within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances, and
a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (for example, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).


To be classified as binge-eating, the person will experience at least 3 of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating, or feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterwards.
Binge eating also causes emotional distress, and occurs at least once per week.

, When individuals binge, sometimes they may engage in behaviors that help them feel better about the binge, or reduce the weight gain that might occur.


Purging is one type of compensatory behavior that is used to deal with the effects of a binge. This means the person purposely vomits in order to release the food out of his system. Notice if your friend goes to the bathroom repeatedly during or right after a meal. Listen for sounds of throwing up, using mouthwash, or brushing of the teeth (which will often occur after a purge).
Other compensatory behaviors include taking laxatives, diet pills, or diuretics as well as fasting or exercising excessively (several times or many hours per day)."
"
Notice if you think about food all the time.,
Decide if you use food to control part of your life.,
Evaluate your feelings about food.,
Think about how you talk about food.",How to Recognize an Unhealthy Relationship with Food1," If you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you may think about it all the time. You may obsess about it, whether it’s what you are going to eat, when you are going to eat, what you can’t eat, how you’re going to prepare it, or anything else. Thinking about food all the time and feeling upset about it can point to a problem.For example, you may think about how you want chocolate cake, but you can’t allow yourself to have it. You may think about the fact that there is another two hours before you eat, or that if you eat the chips you really want then you will be a failure.;
, Many people who don’t feel in control of their life may find any way to gain control. For some, this could be through food. You may become obsessed with controlling what goes in your mouth, which can lead to unhealthy perceptions of food.For example, you may eat less or more food to gain control, which can lead to eating disorders.

, Food is fuel for our bodies and nourishes us. You can live a healthy lifestyle and eat three meals with snacks throughout the day. You should be honest about your feelings concerning food. This can help you determine if your relationship with food is healthy or not.For example, if you think of any food, no matter how healthy or good for you, as bad, you may have a problem with food.

, The way we refer to food can be telling about our relationship with food. Do you think of food in “bad” and “good” categories? This can be the start of an unhealthy relationship. Thinking that you can earn a certain food, making a list of “approved” or “guilt-free” foods, and thinking of “cheat” meals may also point to problems.For example, you may say, “I can’t eat that. It’s a bad food,” or, “I guess I could eat that, but only because it’s a cheat meal.”

Stop demonizing certain foods.,
Stay away from ""diets"".,
See a registered dietitian for education on a healthy, balanced eating plan.,
Reflect on childhood experiences that influenced your eating habits.",How to Prevent Anorexia2," This may come as a surprise, but no food is bad. Yes, there are foods that nurture your body with essential vitamins and minerals. On the contrary, there are foods that provide only empty calories. These tend to be foods high in carbohydrates, fat, and sugar. Still, labeling these foods as bad puts young people at risk of constantly denying themselves tasty foods that they enjoy with the high likelihood of overeating them later.


All carbohydrates are not bad as many fad diets like to declare.Carbohydrates are a necessary macronutrient in the body. In fact, complex carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains offer an abundance of energy and fiber without the surplus calories. Simple carbohydrates like white bread, rice, and potatoes are processed in the body faster and leave you with sugar cravings shortly after. These foods should be enjoyed only in moderation.
When you deny yourself something, you are draining yourself of willpower. Willpower is a limited resource, and, over time, it will become difficult to stay away from whatever you have labeled as off-limits. The trick to stopping endless cravings while still keeping your eating plan relatively healthy is to allow yourself a small portion of foods you have labeled as off-limits. This prevents the necessity to overeat these foods later.A less common type of anorexia is the binge-eating/purging type. These sufferers may place extreme restriction on their eating habits, only having very small portions of food at a time. After bouts of denial, they may give in to a small portion of cake, a regular-sized meal or a complete binge. Afterwards, they punish themselves by working out vigorously or by purging (vomiting) what they have eaten. The most common form of this disorder is characterized by extreme restricting without bingeing or purging., Only 10 to 15% of eating disorder sufferers are male.These disorders are overwhelmingly within the female population. Dieting is also a big trend with females. Dieting can be dangerous, impact mental health, and ultimately lead to an eating disorder like anorexia. So, steer clear of diets.


The bad news: diets often fail. Removing certain food groups and eating below nutritional guidelines can lead to numerous health problems. Statistics show that 95% of all dieters will regain lost weight within 1 to 5 years.As described above, two primary reasons why diets fail are because individuals often restrict their calories too low to maintain over a long period of time, or they deny themselves foods they really like. When they began eating normally again, they gain all the weight back.
Individuals who are constantly, or yo-yo, dieting are at risk of diminished muscle mass, bone deficiencies, heart disease, and negatively affecting the metabolism.

, Wondering how you will maintain a healthy weight without dieting? Visit a professional who can help you develop a lifestyle-based eating plan that focuses on health not weight.A dietitian will determine the dietary needs you require based on your medical history and any allergies you may have. In general, Americans should eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources like poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts, fat-free or low-fat dairy, and whole grains.Your dietitian might also suggest that you get with your primary care physician to determine a regular exercise plan. Along with a balanced diet, exercise can help you control weight, prevent disease, improve your mood, and live a longer life.]

, Long-standing beliefs about food often promote unhealthy eating patterns. Think back to when you were younger and try to remember the rules you followed about eating. For example, maybe you were rewarded with sweets and currently view these types of foods as ways to make yourself feel better. Some of these rules may have taken root and begun to affect your current way of viewing food.Talk to a therapist about any disordered patterns of eating behavior from your childhood that may have influenced your current habits.

Check for mood issues.,
Explore body-image ideas.,
Take an account of health issues.",How to Spot an Eating Disorder in Someone You Know2," Sometimes people with eating disorders experience additional symptoms and warning signs which are not captured by the clinical diagnosis. Control issues are one of these warning signs. Eating disorders are not solely about food, they are sometimes about control.People with eating disorders may experience a sense of lack of control over their eating. Notice if your friend says things like, “I just can’t help myself. I don’t think I can control what I eat.”
On the flip-side, the person may show extreme care and control over his eating. Observe if there is a noticeable preoccupation with weight, calories, or food. Also look for food rituals such as needing to eat a certain way or a certain type of food regularly.

, People who suffer from eating disorders will often have feelings of shame, guilt, depression, and anxiety. Sometimes they may even experience dramatic mood swings.


Does your friend often feel guilty after he eats? He may verbalize his guilt by saying things like, “Ugh, I wish I hadn’t eaten that.”
Identify self-esteem issues such as feelings of worthlessness or inferiority.

, Another common issue in some eating disorders is a disruption in body image. Ask questions and be curious about your friend’s concept of his body.


This may mean that the person is very fearful of gaining weight.
Notice if your friend says he is overweight or fat, when he clearly is not. Denial of low weight can be a symptom of Anorexia.

, Eating disorders can often cause medical complications as well as visible health signs.


Some specific health-related symptoms include:

Pale or yellow skin tone.
Thin, dull, and dry hair, skin, and nails.
Intolerance for cold.
Recurrent fatigue or feeling of lethargy.
Fainting.
Looking very frail or underweight (abnormally thin arms, legs, or face).

The individual will also have a distorted body-image, and an intense fear of becoming overweight.Anorexia nervosa primarily affects adolescent girls and young women (although can also be present in older women and men).
People with Anorexia severely restrict their calorie intake.
Low body weight means the person is underweight in terms of her height, age, and gender. This can be calculated by using the Body Mass Index (BMI).
Even though the individual is not overweight she will be very fearful of gaining weight or becoming fat.
Look for body image issues such as concern with weight, body shape, or body type. Someone with Anorexia will have a disturbance in body-image, meaning she could be in denial about the seriousness of her low weight, or believe that she is overweight.There are two subtypes of Anorexia - Restricting type (not eating enough food), and Binge-eating/purging type.

, Binge-Eating Disorder is a relatively new diagnosis and it has been added to better encompass the presence of binge-eating without compensatory behaviors (such as vomiting). Individuals with this disorder binge eat at least once per week for more than 3 months (in order to meet the requirements for a diagnosis).


Binge eating is eating significantly more food than normal in a short period of time. Normal is defined in terms of what most people would eat under normal circumstances.
People who binge will feel out of control, like they cannot stop themselves from binging.
Someone with binge eating disorder may eat too quickly, even when he is not hungry.
After binging, the individual may feel guilty, embarrassed, or disgusted.
Some individuals may binge eat only when alone in order to conceal the issue from others.

, Pica is a less well-known eating disorder. Many people may have not even heard of it. However, it can cause significant distress.


Pica is when someone eats non-nutritive substances (objects, not food-related) for a period of at least one month. The eating of non-nutritive substances is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual (you would not diagnose a young child for eating crayons).
The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice (such as eating something non-harmful as part of a religious practice).
Pica often occurs along with other mental health disorders. However, Pica may be severe enough to require specific clinical attention and treatment planning.

, Rumination Disorder is when people repeatedly regurgitate their food for at least one month. The food is either spit out, re-chewed, or swallowed.Rumination Disorder is not due to a medical issue (such as a stomach flu that causes you to vomit).

, ARFID is an eating disorder where someone has a feeding issue which results in an inability to meet nutritional or energy needs.This eating disorder includes one or more of the following: significant loss of weight, nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, and marked interference with psychosocial functioning.
This diagnosis cannot be made if the person does not have enough food available to eat (such as being homeless or having low income).
The person will not have a body image disturbance.
Some individuals who are vegan or vegetarian may meet this diagnosis if they do not have adequate nutrition.

, This is the eating disorder diagnosis that is made when a person has significant feeding issues which cause distress and impairment, but do not meet the full requirements for any other eating disorder.For example, a person may not meet the full criteria for Binge Eating Disorder because he binges at a lower frequency (such as once every few weeks), or has been doing it for less than 3 months. This still means there is a problem, however, and that it might turn into a full Binge Eating Disorder.
Another example is if the person meets most of the criteria for Anorexia Nervosa, but is within the normal weight range for her height.
Remember that just because your friend doesn’t meet the full criteria for Anorexia or Bulimia, this doesn’t mean there is not a problem. Seek out help from a professional for a proper diagnosis.

, This diagnosis applies when the individual has significant eating issues, but the symptoms do not fulfill the criteria for another disorder. Therefore, if your loved one has eating symptoms that do not fit neatly into another diagnosis, it does not mean there isn't a problem. Sometimes this diagnosis is used when a psychologist does not have enough information to make another diagnosis."

Consider encouraging your friend to seek help.,
Help your friend find treatment.,
Motivate your friend.",How to Spot an Eating Disorder in Someone You Know4," If you have identified that your friend might have an eating disorder, you may want to consider talking to him about it. Be there for your friend and listen to his struggle. Although your support can be helpful, chances are one person alone will not get your friend to realize something is wrong.


You can begin by saying something like, ""I care about you very much and I'm concerned about your eating habits and that they might be hurting you. Have you every thought about getting help?""
Be careful not to diagnose your friend by saying, ""I think you are Bulimic.""

, This may be too big a problem for anyone to handle on their own. Direct your friend to a therapist or psychologist.


Offer your assistance by saying something like, ""I can help you find someone to talk to if you'd like me to.""
You can search the American Psychological Association (APA) database for therapists in your area.Tell your friend to contact his insurance company to find out more information about services and possible therapists.

, Positive reinforcement can be a very helpful way to increase good behaviors such as eating healthy.


When you notice your friend eating in a healthy way, tell him, ""I noticed you are eating a normal amount lately. Good job!""

Ask yourself if you stop eating when you are satisfied.,
Decide if you stick to rigid food rules.,
Figure out if you can eat without specifically structured meals.,
Notice if you go to extreme lengths to avoid certain foods.",How to Recognize an Unhealthy Relationship with Food2," An unhealthy relationship with food is not just restricting calories. You can also develop an unhealthy relationship with food by overeating. Some people may think that they are never going to get the food again, some people may need to clean their plate of everything, or some people continue eating out of habit or anxiety.Continuing eating after you are satisfied or full and ending up feeling stuffed or sick is a sign there may be a problem.
For example, if you are satisfied, but there is food in front of you, you may eat it. You may go for a second bowl of ice cream even if you know it’s too much just because you feel you need it.

, One symptom of an unhealthy relationship with food is sticking to strict and rigid rules about eating. These rules may seem healthy, but eliminating food groups or not allowing yourself any flexibility can result in problems and unhealthy relationships.For example, rigid rules may include never eating sugar, pasta, or grains. You may go out of your way to carry food with you to avoid eating certain foods while travelling.
Due to these rigid rules, you may never allow yourself a treat or the flexibility to enjoy food in special circumstances, like while on vacation or at a special occasion dinner.

, Some people don’t feel like they are in control if they do not stick to a strict food structure each day. This may be a food schedule where you eat at the same time every day, eating only certain foods, eating within a certain amount of calories, or some other meal structure.For example, you may not be able to go out to eat without knowing exactly how many calories are in the meals or how many ounces of food you are eating.

, If you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you may do anything to avoid foods that you cannot control yourself around. You may avoid certain restaurants or social gatherings, you may have rituals or rules about eating a food, or you may do extreme things to destroy the food so you can’t eat it. These extreme actions point to a problematic relationship with food.For example, you may pour something unappetizing on cake to make sure you don’t eat it or ask a friend to not let you have more than a few bites of a certain food.

Determine if you base your worth on what you eat.,
Decide if you are unhappy with your weight or size.,
Figure out if you try every fad diet you hear about.,
Check how many times you weigh yourself.,
Take a look at your exercise habits.",How to Recognize an Unhealthy Relationship with Food3," Many people with unhealthy relationships with food let the foods they eat influence how they feel. If they get off their eating plan, eat more calories than they think they are allowed, or splurge on food, they get upset and think they are bad people. It may also negatively affect their self-worth.If you splurge on a cheat food or if you eat more calories than you usually do, you may think that you are a bad person. You may beat yourself up about it and think that you are not worthy due to deviating from your eating structure.
You may call yourself a failure or think you are fat if you don’t stick to your food structure.

, Not liking how much you weigh or what size you wear can lead to food restriction and unhealthy choices. Many people base what they eat on what they look like, so they cut out food groups, skip meals, and fast, all of which robs your body of essential vitamins and nutrients.For example, do you want to ""be skinny"" or lose weight, and cut calories or avoid eating certain foods to accomplish this? If you are unhappy with your body, it could result in an unhealthy relationship with food.

, People who do not look at food as fuel and a way to nourish their body may see food as the enemy. Because of this, they may try fad diets. Yo-yo dieting can lead to a lack of essential nutrients and even more weight gain.Ask yourself how many times you have tried a new ""guaranteed"" diet. Evaluate your reactions when someone says they have a new diet to lose weight quickly. If you immediately think that you should try it, it could point to an unhealthy relationship with food.

, Constantly obsessing about your weight and getting on the scale can point to a problem with food. You connect your self-worth to your weight, and if you gain weight or haven’t lost weight, you feel terrible.


If you can’t weigh yourself, you may get anxious. If the scale moves upwards, you have a meltdown. These indicate an unhealthy relationship with food.

, Exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle, but connecting exercise directly to food may indicate an unhealthy relationship with food. Many people punish themselves for splurging or eating foods they think are “bad” with extra exercise. Look at the way you exercise and if you have to exercise more if you eat something you think you shouldn't.For example, if you go eat ice cream with friends, you have to go run or get on the elliptical for hours to compensate.

Not only does it help to know what foods do your body good and how much you should be eating per day to stay healthy, but the right foods can actually affect your mood and sense of well-being.A good place to start is to avoid skipping meals. Skipping meals can trigger you to binge eat because you are hungry, which can lead to feeling guilty and the desire to purge.Carry snacks with you that are high in protein and low in processed sugars, like carrots or celery with peanut butter, trail mix, nuts, cheese sticks, and so on.

Eat a balanced diet for each meal consisting of lean protein (fish, nuts), fruit (apples), and whole grains (oats, barley), as well as getting plenty of water.;
, Seeing your body as beautiful is important for preventing an eating disorder like bulimia. It is important to understand that your body is beautiful no matter what, and that you are valuable enough to eat good food. Cultivate a positive view of yourself by repeating the truth about your body.Write down a list of things you like about your body. Write each thing on a post it note and stick it around your house where you can see it every day, repeating each one out loud when you see it.
Give yourself credit and encouragement on a daily basis, such as forgiving yourself when you make mistakes or have negative thoughts about your body.When you do a good job, reward yourself by doing something you enjoy; however, you should not use food as a reward because it reinforces a false belief that food leads to either acceptance or rejection.Pay close attention to your hygiene and wear clothes that make you feel good when you look in the mirror.Develop a mantra such as, “I am worth it,” or “I am beautiful.” Repeat these mantras to yourself in order to boost your self esteem.

, To help ensure that you have high self-esteem, first understand that low self-esteem often comes from experiencing a childhood trauma and that people with low self-esteem tend to see the world as a hostile place. To combat low self-esteem, there are many things you can do. Do things to think positively, such as making lists of your strengths, achievements, and things you admire about yourself. Read over these lists on a regular basis.
Do more things that you enjoy.

, Look for people in your life who can contribute to raising your self-esteem, such as others who have conquered a difficulty with their body image. Such people can give you encouragement when you are tempted to feel bad about yourself.Look for people in your community to build relationships with, or start following celebrities with positive messages on social media, like Jessica Alba or Jennifer Lawrence.

, Finding a balance among school, work, rest, exercise, and social activities is important for feeling happy and maintaining a positive view of yourself. After all, if you are stressed and driving yourself to catch up with different activities, you’re probably not being very nice to yourself. Take a moment to rework your schedule. For example, if you work long hours and don’t get to do things you enjoy very often, talk to your boss or find a job with a better schedule.
If school is stressing you out, take more breaks. Start by dedicating one day a week (like Saturday) to not studying or thinking about your studies.
Make sure you get enough sleep each night. For teenagers ages 14 to 17, eight to 10 hours are needed; for adults 18 and up, seven to nine hours are necessary., Knowing what to look for in yourself can help you determine if you need to seek help. For example, ask yourself questions to determine what your attitude towards food is. If it is a negative attitude that centers on guilt and shame for eating, you may be experiencing the beginnings of bulimia.Ask yourself:


Do I feel guilty after I eat?
Do I throw up or take laxatives to keep from gaining weight?
Do I eat until I feel ill on purpose?
Am I obsessed with losing weight and with what I eat?
Am I afraid I won’t be able to stop eating after I start?

, Demonstrate what a healthy and balanced lifestyle looks like. Show anyone in your life who may have bulimic tendencies that it’s ok to look different from the images the media pushes. Show them how to have a balanced lifestyle and a balanced diet, as well as be available for them to talk to.Talk about yourself in positive ways to teach others how to do the same.Try saying something like, ""I have a lot of really great friends who tell me how much they like my personality.""
Challenge the media’s messages about body image by ripping pages out of magazines that make you feel bad about your body, or talking out loud to ads on TV and the internet that do the same.

, In order to be a strong role model, you need to stay approachable. One way to do this is to not be judgmental of others. If someone is struggling with bulimia, they will not respond well to being judged. Instead, be encouraging and open to people discussing negative things in their lives.


To avoid judging those who might have bulimia, offer a compliment before and after you express concern for their well being. In other words, accompany any criticism with 2 compliments.

, Do your part to teach others how to respect themselves. For example, demonstrate self-respect by showing self-care and talking about yourself with respect.Parents are often the best role models because children look up to them from childhood, so if you are a parent, try to demonstrate love of yourself to your children.For example, setting boundaries with your kids can teach them to respect you, which in turn teaches them to respect themselves.
You can also teach self-respect by displaying respect to yourself. When someone asks you to do something that you don't want to do, refuse to give in to peer pressure by saying no.

, You can help prevent full-blown bulimia by recognizing the signs of it in others. You will see someone with warning signs of bulimia eating a large amount of food in one sitting, going to the bathroom frequently after meals, wanting to take laxatives, and so on.Other things to look for include a lot of talking about food and their body, expressing a desire to lose weight right after a meal, withdrawal from friends and events, and scheduling life around trips to the bathroom. Someone who is bulimic may have deteriorating oral health due to the acid in their vomit, which affects their teeth and gums.

, If you see symptoms of bulimia in someone, including evidence of binging like an excessive amount of food wrappers lying around, ask that person to sit down and talk with you. Be very gentle and approachable so that they don’t feel judged. Be concerned yet direct.Encourage the person to seek professional help, and offer to assist them in this endeavor.
Say something to the effect of, ""I love you so much, and I want to make sure your body stays healthy. Why don't we go get a checkup to see what the doctor says about your health?""

, Whether you feel like you might be struggling with an eating disorder or you spot someone with an eating disorder, talking to someone else can help you decide what to do. Choose an adult from your community who either knows you or the person, and ask them for advice.


This person may be your mother or father, a teacher, a school counselor, a peer if you are an adult, even just someone you look up to who has a reputation for being a good role model.
Be open to them suggesting that you (or the person you are trying to help) seek professional counseling.

, One you have identified the beginnings of bulimia in yourself or someone you know, finding a reliable and professional therapist can be a lot of help. It is good to talk about your struggle so that you don’t feel alone, and so that you can find practical things to do to overcome the bulimic mindset.Therapists can also offer strategies for battling the symptoms of bulimia. You can see a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) or psychologist and they will be able to help. Look for therapists that have experience with eating disorders.

, You can help prevent bulimia by supporting organizations who work to eradicate the mindset that causes bulimia in society. Find local organizations you can donate money to, or volunteer your time at a local center.The National Eating Disorders Association is an organization you could support., Another way to figure out what to do if you might have bulimia or to help someone with an eating disorder is to talk to others who have struggled with bulimia and overcome it. Many people who have overcome an eating disorder are willing to talk to those struggling.


Talk to people in your place of business, church, or other social gatherings, or look online to find people among your social media friends and followers.
Remember to be sensitive and respectful. If someone has struggled but does not want to share from their experience for personal reasons, be prepared for this and respect their wishes.

Build a support group.",How to Get Slim Naturally," Your body has its own ability to ""count calories"" and manage portion sizes. Eating only until you're satisfied can help you cut out extra calories and stick to smaller portion sizes.Many fad or commercial diet programs will have you count calories, points or carbs. This might not be easy. It can also be frustrating to do long-term. Learning to pay attention to your body’s signals and allowing your body to dictate your portions and calories is a much more natural method of weight loss.
Stop eating when you feel that you're satisfied. That means you should no longer feel hungry. In addition you may lose interest in your food and know that your meal will keep you satisfied for a few hours.If you stop eating when you're full, then you've had too much. You might feel a stretching sensation in your stomach, a ""full feeling"" or feel somewhat tired. Stop before you get to this feeling.;
, Changing the way you eat can also help you lose weight. Mindful eating may help you eat less and feel satisfied with less food.Mindful eating is something that will take practice, patience and time.
Start your mindful eating practice by eliminating all distractions around you when you eat. Turn off the TV, cell phone or laptops. These extra distractions can prevent you from fully concentrating on your meal.
Take about 20 or 30 minutes to eat your entire meal. Put your fork down in between bites, take a sip of water or chat with your family or friends. When you eat more slowly, you may become more aware of how much you eat and have an easier time stopping when you're satisfied.Also take the time to pay attention to your food and meal. How does it taste? What are the textures? Is it a colorful meal? Really paying attention and focusing on your food can help slow you down and become more satisfied with your foods.

, In addition to eating smaller portions, you want to choose foods that are healthy and low in calories. Choose leaner protein sources to minimize the amount of calories you eat.


Lean protein foods are lower in fat, calories and higher in protein. In addition, they can help keep you satisfied longer and make it less likely you'll snack throughout the day.Lean protein foods to choose include: low-fat dairy products, eggs, poultry, pork, lean beef, seafood, legumes and tofu.
Aim to include a source of lean protein at each meal or snack. This will help you meet your daily requirement and assist in making your meals more balanced.

, There are two types of grains that you can choose from - whole grains or refined grains. Choose 100% whole grains as often as you can for the biggest nutrition benefit.100% whole grains are less processed and contain each of the parts of the grain. They are higher in fiber, protein and other beneficial nutrients.Whole grain foods to try include: oats, quinoa, brown rice, millet and whole grain bread and pasta.
Refined grains are more processed and contain much fewer nutrients compared to whole grains. These are OK to have on occasion, but most of your choices should be whole grain.

, A great tip to help you manage calories and increase the nutrition of your overall diet is to make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable.


Both fruits and vegetables are low in calories, but high in nutrients. Making half of your meals or snacks a very low calorie food can help cut down on the overall amount of calories you consume each day.In addition, both fruits and vegetables are great sources of fiber. In addition to protein, fiber can help you feel more satisfied and stay satisfied longer. This may help you eat less each meal and cut down on excess snacking., Regardless if you're following a commercial diet or a more natural plan, you'll want to limit higher calorie, higher fat processed foods. These types of foods do not aid in your weight loss.Processed foods are typically higher in calories and lower in nutrients. During their processing, they are frequently stripped of all the beneficial nutrition.Processed foods can encompass a wide variety of foods including nutritious and healthful choices. For example, pre-washed lettuce is considered a processed food however is a nutritious choice.
Aim to avoid foods like: pastries, cookies, cakes, processed meats, frozen meals and TV dinners, canned foods with added sugars, chips and crackers.

, Adequate hydration is important for overall health, but can also help you lose weight naturally.


It's typically recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, but it may be beneficial to drink even up to 13 glasses. This will depend on your age, gender and activity level.When you're chronically dehydrated you're more likely to feel hungrier throughout the day. This may cause you to overeat or snack more often than necessary.Also, drinking a big glass of water right before your meal can help decrease your overall hungry and fill you up so you eat less at your meal.

, Exercise and activity is very important for weight loss. It's a natural way to help increase your calorie burn and lose weight.


Baseline activity is the types of exercises you already do on a regular basis. This could be walking to and from your car or doing household chores.Increasing your baseline activity is a great, simple way to help your body burn extra calories.Think about your entire day or week. Where can you add more movement? Can you walk further or more often? Can you take the stairs instead of the elevator? Can you stand at your desk or stand during your favorite TV show?

, In addition to baseline activity, it's important for you to include regular, planned and structured physical activity. This helps support your weight loss.


Health professionals typically recommend that you do about 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. This also equates to about 2 1/2 hours weekly.Aim for a moderate intensity activity like: walking/jogging/running, swimming, dancing, aerobics classes, or using the elliptical.
Also include 2 to 3 days of strength training. Regular resistance training will help you build lean muscle mass and increase your body's ability to burn calories even at rest., Getting regular and restful sleep is very important to your health. This is the time where your body rests, recovers and repairs itself.


Studies show that those people who do not sleep enough or do not sleep well typically weigh more than those who do.In addition, those same studies mention that when you do not get adequate sleep each night you have increased levels of ghrelin or your hunger hormone. This makes it harder to stick to appropriate portion sizes or stay away from excess snacks.
Aim for at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Also try to turn off or remove distractions like TVs or cellphone prior to going to sleep., Low grade, chronic stress is common and hard to avoid. However, continuous stress can make it difficult to lose weight.Stress is a natural emotion that can affect everyone. However, when it's not managed well, stress can cause increased release of cortisol. This may increase your feelings of hunger, make you more tired and make your body ""hang on to weight"" more easily.Try to de-stress and relax regularly. It's important to find activities that you can do to help you cope with stress. Try: listening to music, meditating, going for a walk, reading a good book or talking to a friend.
If you're having continued difficulty managing your stress levels, consider seeing a therapist. These health professionals will be able to give you more specific guidance on stress management.

, When you're trying to get slim naturally and lose some weight, it'll be helpful to track your progress.When you track your progress you can tell whether or not your current diet and exercise plan are working. For example, if you're not losing weight you may need to eat less or exercise more.
Be sure to track your weight. Ideally, weigh yourself about one or two times a week. This will give you an accurate look at your progress.Also track measurements. When you want to get slim, you most likely want to get smaller in addition to seeing weight loss. Track your bust or chest measurements, hip, waist and thigh measurements. Re-measure yourself once a month for an accurate view of your progress.

, Whenever you're attempting to lose weight, change your diet or lifestyle, starting a journal can be helpful.Take notes on your weight loss goals. This means noting your current weight, weekly weigh-ins and how much more you need to lose. This can be a motivating factor for you to stay on track.
Also, tracking your food regularly has been shown to help you lose weight as well. This is a form of accountability that can keep you on track.

, A support group is an essential part of your weight loss plan. Studies have shown that people who have a support group when they're trying to lose weight, are more successful than those who don't.Talk to friends, family members or co-workers about your weight loss plan and desire to get slim naturally. There are most likely other people who would be interested in joining you. It's more fun and can be more motivating to do this with a friend.
Also, consider looking for online support groups or forums. You can reach out to multiple people any time of day for additional help and support.

There are a variety of popular diets out there. It's important review a few before making any decisions. Make sure that the diet is reasonable and something you can easily do for long periods of time.
Low-carb diets are very popular. These diets typically focus on protein, healthy fats and limited amounts of carbohydrates. Studies have shown that these diets show faster initial weight loss.Low-calorie and portion control diets are also popular. They focus on small portions and monitoring or counting calories daily. These diets may not result in as much weight loss compared to low-carb diets, but are much more balanced and easier to follow long-term.;
, If you are the main grocery shopper in your household, help your husband by stocking your home with healthier foods.


When there isn't junk food or treats around, your husband is more likely to skip eating at all or choose a healthy choice that's available.Keep healthy snacks for you and your husband. Ideas include: individual low-fat yogurts or cottage cheese, low-fat cheese sticks, fruits, sliced raw vegetables, hard boiled eggs, hummus, all natural nut butters or nuts.
Ditch the sweetened beverages and fill your fridge with calorie-free, hydrating fluids. Keep a pitcher of cold water, flavored waters, decaf coffee or decaf iced tea in the fridge for easy access.

, With busy work schedules or long commutes, many people are choosing to eat out or order in take out for lunch. However, studies show that when you brown bag lunch you save money and calories.Try packing lunch for your husband each day. This may help prevent him from going out and getting something that might be higher in calories.
If you're rushed in the morning, pack lunch the night before. You can pack leftovers from dinner, salads with lean protein (dressing on the side), whole wheat wraps with lean deli meat and cheese or a thermos with soup.
You may need to purchase a lunch box, tupperware containers or ice packs to help keep his lunch at the appropriate temperature throughout the day.

, Even if you're watching calories or following a particular diet, it's important to cook healthy, well balanced meals. This will help support your husband's weight loss and ensure he's getting a variety of nutrients each day.Include lean protein at all of his meals. Talk to your husband about the importance of lean protein at each meal. It will help him stay satisfied longer and manage his hunger throughout the day.Lean protein includes: seafood, poultry, eggs, lean beef, legumes, tofu and low-fat dairy foods.
Cook with a lot of fruits and vegetables as well. Having a variety of these as options can help your husband lose weight. Both fruits and vegetables are very low in calories and contain a lot of essential nutrients.Pack these foods in his lunch, keep them available as snacks and have 2-3 servings at dinners.
Use whole grains when you prepare meals. These types of grains contain more fiber, protein and other nutrients that will support weight loss.Choose 100% whole wheat bread or pasta, brown rice, quinoa or whole grain oats.

, If you have time, pick a few nights for both you and your husband to cook together. Not only does this help you bond, but can get your husband interested in preparing healthy foods.


Cooking with your husband will give him some hands on time with his food. This may spark his interest in healthy cooking and motivate him to eat healthy.
If your husband is changing his diet, you should too. Eating what he eats may help him feel supported. If you haven't made any changes or are eating tempting foods while he's eating healthy, this could side track him from his diet.

, When you prepare dinner for your husband, pack his lunch or set out his breakfast, use smaller plates. Studies have shown that when you eat off of smaller plates, you end up consuming less food.Swap out your typical dinner plate with salad plates or appetizer plates. Use smaller bowls, small utensils and glasses as well.
If your husband prepares his own meals, move the larger plates and bowls to a cabinet out of the way. Place small plates, bowls and cups within reach so he's steered towards these portion controlled dishes.

, Drinking adequate fluids daily is an essential part of a healthy diet and can help your husband stay hydrated and satisfied throughout the day.


Your husband's water goal each day may be slightly different from yours. But encourage him to drink about 10-13 glasses of hydrating fluids each day.
Tell him to use his reusable water each day - filling up as many times as he needs. You can also fill it up for him and send him off to work with a nice cold bottle of water.

, Going to the doctor prior to weight loss is important for anyone. If you can, set up a appointment for your husband to speak with his doctor regarding weight loss.


Go with your husband so you can be a support system to him and be able to ask questions of the doctor.
It's also good to have another set of ears when you're at the doctors. You can incorporate some of the tips the doctor gives regarding weight loss.

, Studies have shown that if you work out together, you're more likely to stay on track with your workouts.If you're husband is feeling reluctant to exercise, ask if you can do something together. You can connect, chat and exercise all at once.
If your husband isn't interested in more traditional exercises like going to the gym or running, find activities that are more enjoyable for him. For example, you might go hiking together on the weekend, or take a walk in the evenings.
Try to motivate your husband to be active regularly. Together, you should both aim for about 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week., Getting adequate rest is incredibly important for weight loss. If your husband is someone who stays up late or gets up early in the morning, try to encourage him to get more rest.It's recommended for both men and women to get about 7-9 hours of sleep each night. It helps manage your hunger and ability to use insulin.Help your husband get a restful night's sleep by turning off the TV, leaving cell phones or computers out of the bedroom and turning off lights when you're ready for bed.
Ask your husband to come to bed earlier with you. He might be more tempted to hop in bed if you're there with him. You can read together, talk or listen to music as you wind down from your day.

, The last thing anyone wants to hear when they're are losing weight is ""don't eat that"" or ""are you supposed to be eating that?"" Being the food police can be discouraging and annoying to your husband as he tries to lose weight.


If your husband reaches for an unhealthy choice, he's most likely aware of what he's doing. Instead of pointing out his mistakes, suggest a healthier option or ask if he'd like to get out for a walk.
Some examples include: If your husband sits down to watch TV, ask to go for a quick walk together. If you're out to eat and he orders something less healthy, ask if he'd like to split the entree with you to limit his portion size. If he's not up for a gym session, ask if he'd like to do a fun activity like hiking or a scenic bike ride.
Remember, it's ok for anyone to indulge in a favorite treat occasionally.

, Setting goals for his weight loss can help your husband stay focused and stay on track.Together, come up with goals for your husband's weight loss.


If your husband needs to lose a large amount of weight, set up multiple smaller goals. This can help him feel successful along the way to a larger goal.
Include goals regarding weight, pants size, fitness level or health markers (like blood sugar). The more goals he meets, the more excited and motivated he'll be to stay on track.

, Having a fun reward waiting at the end of a weight loss plan can be exciting and motivating for anyone. Help your husband stay on track with his diet by planning something fun as he makes progress.Set up a goal timeline with your husband. For every goal he meets, plan a reward for him. Try: a round of golf, a night out at the movies, a new shirt or new gym outfit or a gift card for online music.
Try to avoid food related rewards. This might be counterproductive for those who are trying to lose weight."

Boost your self-esteem.,
Open yourself up.,
Show confidence.",How to Pursue Romance if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder1," People with eating disorders may also have low self-esteem.In order to battle your eating disorder and feel confident enough to pursue romance, you need to feel good about yourself.


Make a list of your positive personality traits, skills, hobbies, and interests.
Pick two or three words off the list that really define you and write them on a sticky note. Post the note somewhere you can see it frequently or carry it with you.
Use positive self-talk with yourself. Look in the mirror and compliment yourself using some of the words from your list.
For instance, tell yourself, “I’m brave, kind, good at playing the sax, and romantic.”;
, One of the hard parts about eating disorders is that they can leave you feeling isolated or cause you to avoid social situations.You can’t pursue romance, though, if you are isolating yourself. If you suffer from an eating disorder and want to pursue romance then you have to open yourself up socially.


Accept the invitations that family and friends give you. You never know who you might meet at the event.
For example, if your sister invites you to her softball game, then go. Your future romantic interest could be there in the stands.
Volunteer or participate for a community organization. You’ll be giving back to the community, supporting your recovery, and possibly meeting a new romantic interest.
If you already have a romantic interest, spend time with them one-on-one. For example, invite them to a football game or out skating.

, Sometimes people with eating disorders can show signs of low confidence by being insecure or jealous.Whether it’s when you’re first meeting your romantic interest or after you are in a relationship, being confident will help you successfully pursue romance.


When you introduce yourself to a romantic interest, hold your head up, look them in the eyes, and smile.
For instance, if you see someone that catches your eye, stand up straight, walk up to them, smile, and say, “Hi! How are you doing?”
If you are in a relationship, give your romantic partner some space. It’s great to spend time together, but don’t be clingy or needy.
Instead of being jealous when your partner spends time with someone else, be confident that your relationship is secure.

Bicep curls. Stand straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Keep elbows close to your body and keep your palms facing forward. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lift the weights towards your body while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Slowly release your arms back down until hands are by your sides.
Push-ups. Get down into a plank position, with arms straightened underneath your shoulders. Lower your body until your chest is a few inches from the floor.

Tricep push ups. This exercise is similar to a regular push up except for the position of the elbows. Start by getting down into a plank position, with arms straightened underneath your shoulders. Lower your body until your chest is a few inches from the floor. Your elbows and arms should be flush with the side of your body. Push your body back up towards the starting position in a quick motion. Keep your abs and back muscles tight throughout this exercise.

Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.
Do push ups

, Since your goal is to lose fat without bulking up your arm muscles too much, it's best to start with fairly light weights. You should be able to perform an exercise for at least 15 to 20 reps without gasping for air or feeling your muscles burn excessively.This trains your endurance, so you stay fit but do not develop large muscles., Your goal is strong but skinny, so you shouldn't be pushing your limits. If you feel the need to rest for more than a minute, move down to lighter weights., For pure endurance training, you could do 2 sets of 20 bicep curls, then move on to 2 sets of 20 tricep dips. If you wouldn't mind building up a little arm muscle, try 2 sets of 15 or 3 sets of 12 with somewhat heavier weights., For best results, exercise each muscle group in two different sessions per week.For example, exercise your biceps and triceps on Monday; your triceps and deltoids on Wednesday; and your deltoids and biceps on Friday., Learning proper form is essential to lifting weights. If you're unsure of the proper form or exercises to help build and tone muscle, learning from an expert may be helpful.


Many gyms offer free classes to members. Try attending an intro to weight lifting class. These classes are geared towards beginners and will have a fitness professional there to provide hands on coaching.
Your gym may also offer sessions with a personal trainer. You may even be able to get a few free when you first sign up for a gym membership. However, there are many personal trainers that work on a consultant basis and can offer individual help at a local gym, your home or other facility.

, Spot-training or losing weight in one specific area of your body is impossible. However, including regular cardio can help you lose weight, decrease body fat and achieve thinner or smaller arms.


It's recommended to include at least 150 minutes or 2.5 hours of cardiovascular activity each week.To burn more fat or to lose more weight include more exercise or increase the intensity.Include exercises such as: walking, jogging/running, using the elliptical, swimming or aerobic classes.
Including cardio and taking a day off from weight lifting is essential for proper recovery., Intervals with dynamic exercises that work your entire body can reduce inches on arms, waist, hips, legs and more.In addition, intervals help burn calories which can decrease body fat and support the look of smaller arms.The following are good exercises to do in intervals of 1 to 2 minutes with 15 to 30 seconds of rest in between:


Jump rope. High impact exercise like jumping and using your arms to turn the jump rope mean that this exercise burns a lot of calories. Start with 20 seconds and work your way up to 1 minute or more. Rest and repeat 3 times.
Do burpees. Stand with your arms high in the air. Place your arms by your feet and jump back into a plank position. Jump back to a squat and stand, raising your arms. Do this for 30 seconds, rest and repeat 3 times. For added benefit, do a push up when you land in the plank position.

, If you feel that weight loss will help aid in toning your arms and helping them get smaller, you will need to watch calories or portion sizes of foods to help you reach your goal.


Losing weight will require eating a little less or watching your total calorie intake each day.
Safe weight loss is considered 1-2 pounds per week. You'll need to cut out or burn off about 500 calories a day to reach this goal.To cut back on portions, try using smaller plates, bowls or serving utensils. You may also find it handy to purchase measuring cups or a food scale to help make sure your portions are accurate.

, Healthy weight loss depends on a well-balanced diet.Including all five food groups into most of your meals throughout the week is a key component of a healthy and well-balanced diet.


Consume lean protein at each meal and snack. One serving of lean protein (like poultry, pork, seafood, dairy or tofu) is about 3-4 ounces or 1/2 cup.Include a 5-9 servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables. One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup or 1 small piece of fruit and one serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy green vegetables.Also try to consume whole grains when choosing a grain food in your diet. All grains can be part of a healthy diet, but whole grains provide more nutrients than refined grains. Include 2-3 1 ounce or 1/2 cup portions each day., Snacks can be a part of a healthy diet, but should be monitored - especially when your goal is weight loss.


Snacks should be between 100-150 calories per snack if your ultimate goal is weight loss.Snack only if you need to. For example, it's before a workout or you're starving and your next meal isn't for another 3 hours.
Examples of healthy snacks include: 1/4 cup of nuts, 1 ounce whole grain crackers and peanut butter or 1/2 cup cottage cheese and fruit.

, Fluids are important for a healthy diet, weight loss and exercise. Being dehydrated can lead to weight gain and impede athletic performance.Everyone's fluid needs are different, but a good rule of thumb to follow is 64 oz or 8 glasses of water daily. Ideally you shouldn't feel thirsty throughout the day and your urine should be clear by late afternoon or evening."

Monitor your total fat intake.,
Consume heart-healthy fats.,
Limit your carbohydrate intake.,
Consume adequate fiber daily.,
Monitor your total calorie intake.",How to Get Rid of Visceral Fat1," Limit dietary fat to about 20–30% of your total caloric intake. This is equal to about 40–70 g of fat daily (based on a 2,000 calorie diet).Higher levels of fat may increase your risk of weight gain or levels of visceral fat.


Eliminate trans-fats completely. Trans-fats are a type of fat that's man made and has been shown to cause hardening of the coronary arteries and increase visceral fat.Reduce saturated fat intake to less than 7% of your total caloric intake. Although saturated fat is not as unhealthy as trans fat, it's important to moderate your intake to an appropriate level. In general, limit your intake to 15–20 g daily (this is based on a 2,000 calorie diet).;
, Although it's important to monitor your overall fat intake, it's also important to make sure you're consuming the types of dietary fat will improve your health and help support your desire to decrease visceral fat. Some dietary fat — monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) — have been shown to help decrease visceral fat levels.MUFAs are found in foods like: olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil and sesame oil. They can also be found in avocados, nuts and seeds. Incorporate one to two servings of these foods daily., A low carbohydrate diet has been shown to be an effective eating pattern to help reduce levels of visceral fat.Reduce the amount of carbohydrate rich foods in your diet to help promote the reduction of visceral fat.


Carbohydrate rich foods include: bread, rice, pasta, crackers, tortillas, bagels, sweets and sugary beverages. Limit these foods to one to two servings maximum each day.Foods like dairy, fruit and starchy vegetables also contain carbs, but have other beneficial nutrients like protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals.
Keep carbohydrates from sweets or sweetened beverages to an absolute minimum if possible.

, Studies have shown that those who consumed adequate fiber daily had lower (and had an easier time lowering) visceral fat levels.Women should consume 25 g of fiber daily and men should consume 38 g of fiber daily.Outside of grains (like bread, rice or quinoa), you can consume a significant amount of fiber from fruits and vegetables.
Fruits that are high in fiber include: apples, blackberries, raspberries and pears.Vegetables that are high in fiber include: beans, artichokes, spinach, broccoli and cabbage., Consuming a moderate- to low-calorie diet has been shown to support the loss of visceral fat.In general, men should consume around 2,000-2,500 calories daily and women should consume 1,600-2,000 calories daily.Your total calorie level can vary greatly based on your metabolism, muscle mass, gender, age and activity level.
Note that a low-calorie diet alone has shown to have little effect on visceral fat levels. However, a low-calorie, moderate-carbohydrate diet along with exercise showed the best reduction in visceral fat levels."

Be yourself.,
Set and stick to your boundaries.,
Disclose your disorder when you’re ready.",How to Pursue Romance if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder2," You can pursue romance if you suffer from an eating disorder if you make sure you don’t try to change yourself for romance. Don’t use romance as a reason to continue your eating disorder. Instead, trust that you are fine just the way you are.


Remind yourself that you have a lot of great qualities and you don’t have to be a certain size or look a certain way to have romance.
For instance, you might say to yourself, “I can have romance without changing myself. I don’t have to lose weight to find love.”
Tell yourself that you want someone to love you for all of your great qualities. Try saying, “I want a romance where all of me matters – not just my weight or size.”

, Research indicates that people with eating disorders may have had difficulty with other people overstepping their boundaries.This lack of boundaries in your relationships may leave you feeling like you don’t have control over your life. Establishing boundaries upfront will eliminate your romantic interest from overstepping them.


Tell your romantic interest what boundaries you have in intimacy. Remember that just because you are pursuing romance, doesn’t mean you have to be sexual.
For example, if you’re on a date and the conversation turns sexual, establish your limits upfront. You might say, “I’m okay with hugging and cuddling, but that’s it.”
Set boundaries in terms of conversation topics and other things as well.
You could say, “I like when you make suggestions, but not when you demand that I do something.”

, While you want to be honest with any romantic interest you may have, you also have the right to choose when you tell them about your eating disorder.You can also decide how much you tell your romantic interest. Be honest and don’t put off telling them if things are getting serious, but you don’t have to tell your crush your life story on the first date.


After you two have hung out a couple of times, you could say, “I want to let you know I have an eating disorder.”
Be prepared to answer questions and explain as much as you can about your disorder and your recovery.
For instance, your romantic partner may want to know how long you’ve had the disorder. Answer honestly, but remember it’s okay not to answer as well.
You might say, “That’s a little too personal. How about we talk about a more neutral topic for a little while?”

Take it slow.,
Stay focused on recovery.,
Practice coping techniques.",How to Pursue Romance if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder3," Being honest with yourself about how well you are battling your eating disorder will help you know if you are ready to pursue romance.Assess whether you are doing the things that you need to do to take care of yourself. If you aren’t then romance might not be a good idea right now. But, if you are, then pursuing romance might work out well.


Are you seeking or receiving treatment for your eating disorder? If not, you should do this before you pursue romance.
Are you sticking to your meal and exercise plans? Commitment to your plan shows that you may be ready to pursue romance.
How are you feeling emotionally? Pursuing romance when you feel depressed, anxious, or over-stressed may hinder your recovery.

, One of the reasons people with an eating disorder relapse is because they start romantic relationships too soon into their recovery process.By starting a romance too fast you may be replacing one addiction (food, eating, dieting, exercising) for another (romance).


Romance, relationships, and intimacy can become a substitute for your eating disorder in the early stages of recovery.
Work on re-establishing relationships and building new supportive relationships in general before you look for romance.
If your romantic interest really likes you, they’ll be okay with taking it slow and getting to know you as a friend.

, One reason people with an eating disorder are discouraged from pursuing romance during the first year of recovery is because it can become a distraction from treatment.If you want to pursue romance, make sure that you keep your focus on recovering from you eating disorder.


Attend your therapy sessions. Don’t skip sessions to pursue romance. For example, don’t skip your group meeting in order to hang out with your crush.
Stick to your routines. They are an important part of recovering from your eating disorder.
For instance, continue with your same sleep schedule – don’t stay up late to talk to your romantic interest.

, As you address your eating disorder and pursue romance there will be times that you feel anxious or stressed.You may have a hard time sticking to your recovery plan or you may not know how to approach a romantic interest. If you practice coping strategies you’ll be able to handle the stress of pursuing romance and dealing with an eating disorder.


Meditate on a regular basis. Calming your mind and body can help you cope with stress in general and reduce your anxiety.
Practice deep breathing. Techniques such as breathing slowly while you count can help you relieve tension in your body and relax you.

Engage in cardio exercises.,
Incorporate strength training.,
Try different types of exercise.,
Go to bed early.,
Give up smoking and alcohol.",How to Get Rid of Visceral Fat2," Cardio exercises have been shown to be one of the most effective methods at reducing visceral fat. It's recommended to include 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week to help reduce visceral fat levels.Aerobic activities can include exercises like: walking, jogging, swimming, biking or hiking.
If you can do more than the recommended 150 minutes weekly, that may help you reach your goal faster., Weight lifting or resistance training is another important part of your exercise routine. It's recommended to include one to two days of strength training each week.Strength training includes activities like: weight lifting, Pilates or isometric exercises like push-ups or crunches.
Note that spot training (trying to reduce fat in a specific area) does not rid the body of visceral fat. To lose fat, diet and cardio are key. However, the more muscle you build with strength training, the more calories you will burn.

, Keep your exercise routine fun and exciting by engaging in a variety of different exercises. This can also help prevent over-training or over-using certain muscle groups.If exercising in a gym is not your thing, try a dance class or team sport instead. You will be more willing to stick to it if it is enjoyable for you.
Try incorporating some outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking or biking.
Keep your end goal in mind to help motivate you to stick to your exercise routine.

, It's recommended adults sleep at least seven to nine hours each night. Sleep is essential to your overall health and wellness. Studies have shown that those who slept less than six hours nightly had higher levels of visceral fat.Make sure you go to bed early enough that you can get a full night's sleep.


Turn off all electronics — your TV, cell phone and computer — at least 30 minutes prior to going to sleep.Turn off all lights in your room prior to sleeping. Even minimal light can interrupt sleep patterns., Both smoking (or consuming any type of tobacco product) and drinking alcohol have been linked to higher amounts of visceral fat.Give up both to help reduce your levels of visceral fat, decrease your weight and improve your overall health.


If you need help giving up nicotine, speak to your primary care physician for further help. She may be able to prescribe you a medication or provide you with additional resources to help quit.
Limiting alcohol is recommended. At a maximum, women should have one alcoholic beverage daily and men may have up to two alcoholic beverages daily.However, it's ideal to discontinue consumption while trying to reduce visceral fat.

"
Measure your waist circumference.,
Weigh yourself weekly.",How to Get Rid of Visceral Fat3," Waist circumference is a measure that indicates your risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome and other chronic health conditions.High waist circumference numbers may indicate an increased amount of visceral fat present.To minimize risk, women's waist circumference should be 40"" or less and men's waist circumference should be 35"" or less.To accurately measure your waist circumference, place a non-elastic tape measure around your waist — right above your hip bones. Measure as you breathe out, not as you inhale., Although your main target goal is to reduce the amount of visceral fat, you will need to monitor the changes in your weight over time. Weight loss while modifying your diet and incorporating exercise can indicate your levels of visceral fat are decreasing.Weigh yourself about one to two times weekly, and always at the same time (and nude, if possible) for the most accurate reflection of your progress over time.
Safe weight loss (even when aiming to reduce visceral fat levels) is about one to two pounds weekly. Any more weight loss can result in nutrient deficiencies or may not be sustainable long-term."

Choose someone who has always been supportive of you without casting judgment, maybe a best friend, a coach, a religious leader, a parent, or a school counselor.Set aside a time when you can talk to this person in private without interruptions. Try to be patient. Your loved one may be shocked, confused, or hurt that you have been suffering on your own all this time.

Make a plan and write it down.,
Find your motivation.",How to Get Super Skinny1," Start to take note of your daily activity and diet. Learn your starting weight and begin to think of a goal weight.


Talk to a doctor. You shouldn’t make any drastic changes before you check with your health care provider. Along with a doctor, you can find a dietician or trainer to help you in this process. Any of these people can run tests to make sure you’re healthy enough to begin a new diet change or new workout regimen.
Learn how many calories you’re consuming per day. There are many helpful sites to get you started: SparkPeople is free and easy for beginners.

, After seeing your doctor, sit down and make a plan to fit your lifestyle that will help you lose weight. Buy a journal and rediscover the diet changes and exercise goals you discussed with you doctor. Make sure your goals are tangible, and fill the journal with anything that will help you reach them.


Know how many calories you need to burn. In order to lose a pound a week, you need to burn 3,500 more calories than you take in during the week. Therefore, you need to either burn or cut out 500 calories a day. This can come from simple changes, such as smaller portions, or cutting sugary drinks out of your diet. Calories are listed on the side of everything that you buy at the grocery store. Start with some simple changes. Choosing the stairs over the elevator is an easy fix to help you burn calories during the day. If you find yourself sitting for hours on end, take a break and take a walk around the office or house. This will help you burn calories and keep your metabolism awake without breaking a sweat and are key in getting super skinny.
Wearing a fitness tracker can help you keep track of how many calories you burn throughout the day. Fitbit, Garmin, and Jawbone are some of the best and easiest fitness trackers available. , Come up with some kind of reward system to help keep you motivated.


Reward yourself. For every pound lost, place a dollar amount (that you thought of ahead of time) in a jar. Once you reach a goal, spend the money on something you’ve been wanting—maybe a new shirt to show off your progress.
Give yourself a cheat. Don’t go overboard, but once you reach a goal, enjoy a bit of “forbidden food” or take a day off of working out.
Create a positive body image. Even though you have goals of becoming super skinny, you should love the body that you’re in the entire time. Give yourself daily body image compliments. Even if you have to start small, you’ll gain confidence in your body. This will help you stay strong through the process.

Challenge negative thoughts about your body.,
Learn how to effectively fight stress.,
Develop a balanced diet and exercise plan.,
Wear clothing that makes you feel comfortable.,
Give it time.",How to Overcome Eating Disorders2," Negative thoughts can seem to rule your life when you are afflicted by an eating disorder. You might bully yourself about gaining an extra pound or criticize yourself for eating an entire meal as opposed to a partial serving. Overcoming these thought patterns is essential in your recovery.Use a few days to notice what you’re thinking. Label certain thoughts as negative or positive, helpful or unhelpful. Think about how such thoughts might affect your mood or behavior.
Combat negative, unhelpful thoughts by identifying if they are unrealistic. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I will never get to a healthy weight,” you might ask yourself how you could possibly know such a thing. Can you predict the future? Of course not.
Now that you have identified your unproductive thoughts, you can replace them with more helpful, realistic versions, such as, “It is taking me awhile to get to a healthy weight, but I can do it.”

, Stress can often serve as a trigger for the unhealthy behavior patterns that drive eating disorders. Therefore, developing positive methods for stress-management can help you maintain recovery. Some great ways to fight stress include:Get regular exercise.

Sleep at least 7 to 9 hours each night.

Get a hobby.
Listen to music and dance.
Spend time with positive, supportive people.
Walk your dog.
Take a long, relaxing bath.

Learn how to say “no” when you’ve got too much on your plate.

Release perfectionistic tendencies.

, Eating and physical activity are an important part of overall health. However, people with eating disorders have unhealthy relationships with these things. You must work closely with your doctor and dietitian to determine a safe balance of exercise and a well-rounded diet that allows you to maintain optimal health., Aim to feel good about the clothing you wear. Select items that are flattering and comfortable to your current body size and shape rather than choosing clothes for your “ideal” body, or wearing clothing that completely hides your figure., Recovering from an eating disorder is a process. You may relapse several times before you successfully overcome the negative behavior patterns that drive your disorder. Keep at it. Don’t give up. Recovery can be yours if you are persistent.

Research eating disorders.,
Observe and document your symptoms.,
Look for clues about how your disorder developed.",How to Overcome Eating Disorders3," To inform yourself about the risk and seriousness of eating disorders, it can be helpful to perform a cursory internet search about these conditions. Only a doctor or mental health provider can officially diagnose your eating disorder, but learning more can help you understand how life-threatening these conditions can be, and motivate you to get help. Learn about the most common types of eating disorders.Anorexia nervosa is characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with body size and weight. An individual with this condition may fear gaining weight and believe she (or he) is overweight even when she’s severely underweight. Individuals may refuse to eat and eat very restrictive diets. Some people with anorexia may purge (vomit) or take laxatives to lose weight.

Bulimia nervosa involves periods of binge eating—that is, uncontrollably consuming large amounts of food—and then compensating for overeating by purging, taking laxatives or diuretics, exercising excessively, fasting, or a combination of these methods. This condition can be hard to spot because many people with bulimia maintain an average weight.

Binge eating disorder is characterized by eating large amounts of food even when a person is not hungry. People with bulimia may eat in secret and be unable to control themselves during a binge. Although similar, individuals suffering from binge eating disorder (BED) do not engage in compensatory behaviors like purging or exercising excessively. People with BED may be overweight or obese.

, Once you learn more about eating disorders, you may notice several symptoms that describe your own behavior. Paying attention to your symptoms as well as your thoughts and feelings can be helpful when you seek professional help. You can log your symptoms in a journal to help you and your doctor better understand your eating disorder.Try to write in your journal daily, as this can help you spot the connections between your thought patterns and behaviors, which can be useful for your recovery treatment.For example, you might log an episode of binge-eating. Then, think back to what happened right before the episode. What were your thoughts? Feelings? Who were you around? What were you talking about? Then, log how you felt afterwards. What thoughts and feelings came over you?

, It may be practical to think about when and how your symptoms began to appear. Pinpointing such details can help your doctor diagnose your condition and any co-existing conditions like anxiety or depression. Thinking about causes can also help when you start to make lifestyle changes during treatment.


The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Still, researchers have found that many people have parents or siblings with eating disorders, and may have been raised with strong social or cultural ideals of thinness. They may also have low self-esteem and a perfectionist personality, and be subjected to images of thinness from peers or the media."

Eat the right amount.,
Eat the right foods.,
Eat at the right times.,
Drink “lots” of water.",How to Get Super Skinny2," You don’t necessarily need to eat less to lose weight. Sometimes, in fact, you need to eat more. If you want to see a drastic change in your body, the fastest way to do so is by eating right.


Eat throughout the day. This helps your metabolism speed up. Get on an eating schedule and stick to it. You should be eating 5 times a day instead of 3, so remember to do so in smaller portions than you normally would. Cook (meal prep) healthy snacks. These should be used to eat between meals, because you should eat at least every 4 hours. This will help you avoid snacking on candy bars or anything else available quickly. If you have prepared snacks, you’re more likely to make a better choice.

, Just because you watch your caloric intake doesn’t mean you’re sure to get the results you want. Know what kind of calories you should be consuming throughout the day.


Fill up on protein. Proteins are your best friend. Proteins help you feel fuller longer. Also, it helps to fuel fat burning. This happens because your body burns both fat and muscle when you’re getting super skinny. Therefore, eating protein with help preserve your lean muscle which burns calories. Include vegetables in every meal. Adding vegetables to your meals will help fill you up without burning through the calories you’re allowed while dieting. Most vegetables are primarily water, which is incredibly helpful for weight loss.
Embrace the right carbs. Yes, avoid the sugary, starch filled carbs like white bread and potatoes. But brown rice and sweet potatoes are carbs that will keep your energy level up while you diet. , Eating throughout the day is going to keep your metabolism going. Try to avoid large meals late in the day because you won’t burn them off before you fall asleep. Eating bigger meals in the morning and smaller meals at night is key if you want to get (and stay) skinny.


Have a big breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating within an hour of waking up gets your metabolism going and keeps you from mindless snacking before lunch. Here are some ideas for a healthy and big breakfast:


3 scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast
1/2 cup of oatmeal, ½ cup of fresh fruit, 2 hard-boiled eggs
2 baked eggs in ½ avocado and ½ cup grits


Cut out carbs from your last meal. Try to eat your carbs early in the day and pack dinner with protein and vegetables.
Cook every meal at home. When you cook at home, you’re aware of what you’re putting into your meals. “Meal prep” is a necessary part of becoming skinny. Measure out your food depending on your goals and pack your meals ahead of time. Always have healthy options with you to avoid making bad choices.

, Staying hydrated is key to losing weight. Staying hydrated keeps your metabolism going which burns fat, and water acts as a natural appetite suppressant. Always start your day off with a full glass of water. Switch sugary soda drinks to water with meals and keep drinking water throughout the day. Buying an oversized water bottle and marking goals on it by the hour will help keep you hydrated. But how do you figure out these goals?


Find out your body weight in pounds.
Drink between half an ounce and ounce of water per pound each day.
Mark the side of a bottle (put a line for each hour) to help you stay on track through the day.

Start with cardio.,
Try HIIT (High Intensity Impact Training).,
Learn to lift weights.,
Go for low impact (Yoga/Pilates).",How to Get Super Skinny3," Cardio has many forms: Walking, running, biking, swimming, rowing, etc. All of these are considered long distance exercise. Discuss with your doctor which ones are going to be best for you. Swimming is low impact and doesn’t stress your joints, whereas running might cause knee problems.


Do the right amount of cardio. In order to get the most out of cardio, you should do between 30 and 50 minutes per cardio session. This time frame is where you’ll be in the “fat burning” portion of your workout. Count calories. If you’re using a cardio machine at the gym, most will have calorie trackers for you to keep track of the amount of calories you’re burning while exercising.

, This is a newer form of working out which requires very little time but very difficult exercises ranging over every muscle in the body. In 30 minutes you can easily burn over 500 calories if you correctly perform your HIIT workout. These are typically in circuit style and designed for maximum caloric burn. For example doing one minute of each of the following for 6 rounds without stopping:


Box jumps
Renegade Rows
Jump Rope
Leg Lifts
Lunge jumps

, Weight lifting is more goal oriented than any other exercise. It burns more calories than cardio if done properly, but can be dangerous if performed incorrectly.


Hire a personal trainer to teach you how to lift properly. Many people that lift have goals such as gaining a higher vertical leap, or wanting to perform pull ups without help.
Use a fitness tracker. Whereas cardio machines have calorie trackers, it is hard to tell how many calories you burn during your lifting session. Therefore, a fitness tracker (mentioned earlier) can be very helpful.

, Although low impact exercises will not burn as many calories, they can still be beneficial if you’re trying to get skinny. Things as simple as stretching keep your metabolism boosted throughout the day and burns extra calories while you do it.


Look up local classes offered in your area. Many places will give you free first sessions to see if the class is something you’re interested in before buying a package.
If you don’t have time to get to a class, buy a fitness program. You can find top rated DVDs on Amazon.com.

Find an accountability partner.,
Make mini goals.,
Make monthly goals.",How to Get Super Skinny4," Find someone who you can count on to share you triumphs and tribulations with. This process doesn’t happen overnight and having someone to discuss it with will help you get super skinny.


Make it count. Be sure your accountability partner is someone you are comfortable with and someone who will be honest with you. It will only make the process harder if you aren’t open with them.
Find someone who can relate. If possible, find an accountability partner who is also trying to lose weight or has done so in the past. It will be much easier to relate to them if they are going through the same thing you are.

, Weigh yourself at least once a week if not more. These mini goals will help keep you on track and make you aware of any changes you might have to make.


Keep it consistent. Each time you check your weight, do so with consistency. This means if you first weigh yourself when you first wake up, do so at the same time for every weight-check. Keep mini goals written down. Use rewards, as mentioned in Method 1, to keep you focused.

, Each month, be sure that you’re reaching the weight you want to reach. From here, make adjustments as necessary.


Learn your body. If you aren’t seeing the changes that you want, don’t be afraid to make adjustments. Not everyone has the same body, so no everyone’s body reacts the same to diet and exercise.
Change it up. Weight loss is likely to hit a plateau if you don’t change it up. It doesn’t mean that you’ve been doing the wrong thing—just that your body has adjusted to your new lifestyle. So change it again, and surprise your body into losing more weight. "

Avoid high-fat foods.,
Choose simple carbohydrates.,
Eat yogurt.,
Eat a bland diet.,
Don't eat spicy foods.,
Avoid highly processed foods.,
Drink liquids during meals.,
Chew your food.,
Eat small, frequent meals.,
Give yourself time to digest.",How to Choose Foods That Are Easy to Digest," This means that you should eat meals that are low in fat. For instance, proteins that are low in fat are easier to digest than those higher in fat. Red meat and high-fat dairy products are harder to digest than bananas, rice, or low-fat yogurt.Fat is hard to digest and can cause diarrhea if you eat too much of it.For example, avoid foods that are deep fried. This will add a lot of fat to your diet as well.;
, Simple carbohydrates, such as white rice or white bread, are easier to digest than complex carbohydrates, such as beans and whole grains, because they break down easier in the gut.If you have digestive issues that cause diarrhea, eat simple carbohydrates to help with the problem.


It is important to note that the fiber in more complex carbohydrates also has an important function in digestion. It is not easily digested — in fact, it is not digested at all — but instead serves to help move food through the digestive system smoothly.Don't eat complex carbs if you are having acute digestive problems, but they should be a big part of your normal diet.

, The probiotic bacteria in yogurt is great for digestion. It adds good enzymes to your gut and eliminates harmful bacteria that can be bad for digestion.Choose a plain low-fat yogurt that does not have a lot of added sugar to your diet to help your digestion.


However, it can be helpful to eliminate other types of dairy from your diet if you are wanting to promote good digestion. Specifically, many people have problems digesting lactose, one of the sugars contained in milk. If you have a hard time with lactose, eliminate dairy or choose lactose-free dairy products., If you need a diet that is really easy to digest, consider following a BRAT diet. The name of the diet stands for ""banana, rice, applesauce, and toast."" This is a very bland diet that can help you overcome digestive discomfort and diarrhea.


This diet should only be used temporarily to help with acute digestive discomfort. It is not good for long-term nutrition.

, Bland foods are easier on your digestive system than spicy ones. If you have a delicate digestive system, spicy foods, such as chili peppers, are likely to upset your stomach or to cause you to produce excess stomach acid.People with digestive illnesses, such as ulcers or chronic heartburn, should avoid spicy foods. They can make the symptoms of these diseases worse., Simple, whole foods are generally easier to digest than highly processed foods. If you have a choice between a whole food, such as a piece of fruit, or a processed food, such as a frozen dinner, choose the unprocessed food.


There is a range of processed foods. Frozen meals, such as frozen pizzas, are usually highly processed and contain a lot of extra sodium, salt, and preservatives. But the term ""processed foods"" also includes things that are very minimally processed, from washed and bagged lettuce to vegetables that are simply flash-frozen. These are acceptable options, as they do not have a lot of added ingredients that are bad for you.If you're unsure, check the ingredient list.

, It is a myth that drinking water during a meal will harm your digestion. Instead, adding a beverage to your meal can actually help digestion.Cut out caffeinated beverages from your diet if you are having digestive issues such as stomach pain or heartburn.These can dehydrate you and cause excessive stomach acids to be produced.

, Digestion can be aided by chewing your food thoroughly. Chewing your food thoroughly allows your digestive system to do a better job at digestion because the food has already been broken down into small pieces and the food is covered in saliva, which contains enzymes that break down food.Remember that the digestive process begins as soon as the food enters your mouth.

, Eating smaller meals allows your digestive system to work more efficiently. Instead of overloading the system with a huge meal, multiple small meals allows the food to be properly digested, in addition to helping to maintain your blood sugar and maintain your metabolism.On that same note, avoid overeating. Eating too much food overwhelms your digestive system, requires excessive digestive acid, and doesn't allow you to digest food efficiently.

, Don't do a lot of activity right after eating. Allow your body to focus on digestion instead of physical activity. This will allow your body to use all the blood it needs for digestion instead of using it elsewhere in the body.


Eating right before extreme physical activity, such as working out, can cause nausea, acid reflux, and vomiting. Instead, wait until after you exercise to eat a big meal."

Eat fresh vegetables for snacks. Toss some baby carrots, broccoli florets, celery sticks, or cucumber slices into a container and take it on the go.

, Whole grains are a great source of complex carbohydrates and other nutrients. While they do take time to prepare, you can make a batch and have leftovers to eat on for a few days. Consider making quinoa, millet, barley, brown rice, or a whole grain mix.For example, you can make a large batch of quinoa at night. Eat part of it for dinner, then place the rest in the refrigerator. You can use it for a breakfast porridge, sprinkle it on a salad for lunch, and use it for a base of a quinoa bowl for dinner.

Eat a variety of whole foods.,
Get phytocompounds from fruits and vegetables.,
Get omega 3 fatty acids from fish.,
Eat yogurt for probiotics and active cultures.,
Try fermented drinks for a probiotic boost.,
Look for other foods loaded with prebiotics.,
Snack on raw nuts and seeds.",How to Choose Functional Foods1," Whole foods are free from additives or other artificial ingredients and have been processed or refined as little as possible. Examples include fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as grains and nuts. A healthy, balanced diet includes all of these, with variety being especially important. If you eat enough food that naturally contains all of the nutrients your body needs, you may not need take any additional vitamins or supplements.It is likely that you already eat many functional foods already and, if you don't, it is very easy to add them to your diet. You don't need to shop at a special store to find functional foods — everyday items like garlic, chocolate, green tea, and grapes all show promising evidence of being functional foods.Granted, if you suffer from allergies or other types of intolerance to certain food groups, you may need to supplement a mostly whole-food diet with enriched or fortified foods or vitamins or supplements to include any nutrients you’re missing.;
, There are specific nutritional compounds produced by plants called phytocompounds, some of which are particularly sought after. They are purportedly anti-inflammatory, detoxifying and immune-modulating. They are also especially plentiful in veggies that have large amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as avocados and olives.Fresh fruit, especially berries, are also especially rich in phytocompounds. They also contain numerous vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
It is recommended you eat seven to nine fruits and veggies dailyas part of a nutrient-rich diet, which can help prevent health issues and improve your health overall.

, Omega 3 fatty acids are a particular type of unsaturated fatty acid. They are credited with helping reduce people’s risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and more. Mackerel, trout, herring, Alaskan salmon and albacore tuna are the best sources. Shoot for two 3-oz portions of these fish per week.Opt for fresh portions of smaller fish, as mercury and arsenic build up more in larger-bodied fish.
If you are pregnant, limit tuna to no more than once per week and avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish altogether.

, Probiotics and prebiotics are found in yogurt and can help your intestines maintain a healthy microbial balance and operate optimally. More specifically, probiotics contain beneficial live cultures, and prebiotics stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut.As with all food decisions, read labels and choose with care. Yogurt also frequently contains large amounts of sugar and artificial ingredients.
Unsweetened Greek yogurt is often the best option. Sweeten it yourself with berries or honey and mix in some whole grains (such as oats) or nuts as well.

, Kombucha, kefir, and kefir water are fermented drinks that contain B vitamins and probiotics.The taste may take some getting used to (kombucha in particular, which can be quite tart and vinegar-y), but they can be a good source of probiotics., Prebiotics are essentially food for probiotics and eating enough of them will keep probiotics efficient and healthy. Prebiotics are found in many foods, particularly those high in fiber. Good sources of prebiotics include bananas, raw and cooked onion, raw dandelion greens, raw asparagus, baked wheat flour, raw garlic, and raw leeks., Carry a bag of cashews, almonds, walnuts and/or sunflower seeds with you to help hold you over in between meal times. Each of these contain many different nutrients considered to be functional, including enzymes, phytocompounds, and unsaturated fatty acids."

Choose cereals carefully.,
Drink fortified OJ in moderation.,
Get extra Omega-3s from enriched eggs.",How to Choose Functional Foods2," There are cereals with all sorts of added ingredients purported to enhance their nutritional value; however, if these additives come with lots of processed grains, sugar, and artificial ingredients, they are simply not your best option. Go for unrefined, minimally processed, whole grain cereals for fiber and other nutrients., Orange juice makers were some of the first to jump on the fortified functional food bandwagon. There are many options that contain added calcium and Vitamin D, for instance. Further, most people do benefit from additional amounts of these nutrients. However, keep portions under control (limit to one 4 oz serving per day), and choose 100% fruit juice., You probably already know Omega-3 fatty acids are an especially popular additive, in part because so many products advertise this feature. One of the best options in this respect is enriched eggs, which have additional nutritional benefits as well, such as helping to control hypertension and regulating your metabolism."
"
Know the difference between enriched and fortified foods.,
Practice healthy skepticism.,
Talk to your doctor about your diet.,
Follow the guidance of medical specialists.",How to Choose Functional Foods3," You will likely see the terms ""enriched"" and ""fortified"" on the labels of most enhanced foods. These terms actually mean different things. Foods are enriched when nutrients are added that were lost during the manufacturing process. Foods that are fortified have extra nutrients that may not be normally found in that food.When wheat is refined into white flour, it loses B vitamins and iron contained in the wheat. A company may choose to add those nutrients back in, ""enriching"" the flour.
Milk and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin D. This is an essential nutrient that can be difficult to get through diet and is essential to absorbing calcium. Milk and orange juice do not normally contain vitamin D.

, It is totally reasonable to reach for the item that proclaims it’s health benefits in compelling, large-print font. However, you should also read the label on the food products you consume. If there are certain ingredients that are unfamiliar to you, look into them. Some additives do have legitimate benefits, so take the extra step to familiarize yourself with what you’re consuming.Never believe the claims of a single “study.” The most compelling claims about food are often made without substantiation. In particular, there is simply no miracle food that will cure you, burn away fat, etc.
Do not assume that all sources of health food information are legitimate. Generally, if you read an article with a number of sources that reference studies done on people, and published at a .edu or .gov address, the information is likely empirically tested and trustworthy.
Note sample size as well. If the study showed remarkable results but there were only five participants, this does not provide enough evidence to make any claims about the benefits of the food.

, Before making any significant dietary changes, talk to your doctor. These include changes such as switching to a formula-based diet, a gluten-free diet, or a hypoallergenic diet.Write down any questions you have about your diet to bring with you next time you visit your doctor. These include any questions about whether a certain dietary health claim you encounter should be considered valid.
Ask your doctor for a referral to see a registered dietitian for more in depth information.

, If you have a condition that requires you to consume specific amounts of certain nutrients, work with a healthcare professional to establish what products you should be eating, and how often.For instance, those with diabetes or heart disease may need to remove certain types of food from their diet, and may benefit from eating more of other types of functional food, whether whole or enriched.
Further, there are also foods designed for extremely specific conditions. For instance, there are prebiotic-enriched foods to help fight diarrhea.

A medical professional can help you decide whether full fat or low fat dairy is the best choice for you. They will consider factors like age, weight, and whether or not you have a medical condition. For example, full fat milk is generally recommended by dietitians for children under the age of 2.;
, Full fat dairy consumption is linked to lower rates of obesity. This is contrary to popular belief that full fat dairy products are less healthful than reduced or low fat dairy. For example, researchers in Scandinavia found that those who consumed full fat dairy products were less likely to be obese than people who ate low fat dairy products., A study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that people who ate full fat dairy products were less likely to develop diabetes than those who didn’t. Those who regularly included full fat dairy products in their diets were between 44 and 52 percent less likely to end up with diabetes., Eating full fat cheese is associated with maintaining healthy cholesterol levels (HDL), while not increasing bad cholesterol levels (LDL). Higher healthy cholesterol levels decrease your risk of heart disease., Low fat dairy products have fewer calories than their full fat counterparts. This can be an important consideration if you are counting calories. If you’re looking to cut calories a low fat dairy product is a good choice.In general, low fat dairy still contains the same amount of calcium and Vitamin D as full fat dairy.

, Low fat dairy products can be higher in sugar. Sugar is often added to make up flavor deficiencies when fat is removed from a product. For example, low fat yogurt can have a considerably higher amount of sugar than full fat yogurt., It is common for salt to be added to low fat dairy products. This enhances the flavor that is lost when the product’s fat content is reduced. For example, low fat cheese can contain more sodium than full fat cheese. This is especially important to consider if you are watching your sodium intake."
"
Think about the texture.,
Take flavor into consideration.,
Take your cooking needs into account.,
Watch the serving size.",How to Choose Between Full Fat and Low Fat Dairy2," Full fat dairy products can have a different texture than low fat dairy products. For example, whole milk is thicker and richer than skim milk. Low fat cheese, on the other hand, can be more brittle in texture and less springy when compared to full fat cheese., There is often a notable difference in how full fat dairy tastes compared to low fat products. For example, whole milk has a richer flavor than skim milk. Full fat cheese and full fat yogurt can also be more flavorful than their low fat counterparts, depending on the variety and type., Not all dairy cooks up the same. For example, low fat cheese may not melt in the same way that full fat cheese does. Pay attention to the recipe you are following to determine if full fat or low fat dairy is the best choice for your cooking needs.

, You might choose a low fat dairy product to cut back on calories and fat. These products can be less satisfying that their full fat counterparts. A lack of satisfaction can lead to eating more than the recommended serving. If you have more than one serving, you may consume more calories or fat than a single serving of a full fat dairy product."

Look for two ingredients.,
Avoid butters with added sugars.,
Steer clear of butters with saturated fats.",How to Choose a Healthy Nut Butter1," When you are shopping for healthy nut butters, the first thing you should look at is the nutritional label. To get a healthy butter, pick a spread that lists nuts and salt as the only ingredients. This will help you avoid any added sugars or fats.If you are on a low-sodium diet, look for a butter that is made without salt.;
, Many kinds of butter, particularly peanut butter, have added sugars to make them sweeter and more appealing to customers. When you are shopping, avoid any kinds of butter that contain sugar, corn syrup, or molasses. Too much sugar has been linked to a number of health problems, including diabetes and heart disease., Saturated fats are often added to make butters smoother and keep the oils in the butter from separating during storage.The common source of saturated fat in most nut butters is palm oil. Saturated fats can lead to heart disease and health issues related to obesity."
"
Munch on peanut butter to manage your weight and get lots of protein.,
Snack on walnut butter for your heart health and a dose of omega-3 fatty acids.,
Consume almond butter for your heart, skin, and hair health.,
Eat pistachio butter to improve your heart health and manage your blood sugar.,
Snack on cashew butter to improve your heart health.",How to Choose a Healthy Nut Butter2," If you do not have a peanut allergy, peanut butter has a number of health benefits. Peanuts boost your metabolism and help keep you satiated after you eat, which can help you avoid weight gain. They are also a great source of protein, which boosts your energy, keeps you going all day, and regulates your blood sugar.Peanuts are a great source of B vitamins, copper, manganese, protein, molybdenum, phosphorus, and vitamin E.However, these health benefits only apply to peanut butters that do not contain added sugars or fats.

, Although less common in your grocery aisle, walnut butter is one of the healthiest spreads you can eat. Walnuts have the highest amount of omega-3 fatty acids among the nuts, which will help ease the pain and discomfort of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Walnut butter also has high levels of antioxidants that improve your heart health by decreasing blood cholesterol, improving blood flow, and reducing inflammation.Walnuts are a great source of copper, manganese, molybdenum, biotin, B vitamins, protein, and monounsaturated fats., Among the nuts, almonds are the highest in fiber and the lowest in saturated fats. Because of this, almond consumption is linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Almonds also contain fifty percent of your daily value of Vitamin E, which helps keep your heart healthy, along with your skin and hair.Almonds are high in B vitamins, vitamin E, manganese, copper, phosphorus, magnesium, molybdenum, monounsaturated fats, fiber, and protein., If you suffer from diabetes, eating pistachio butter may help decrease glucose spikes. Because pistachios are high in the antioxidant lutein, consuming them is also linked to decreases in bad cholesterol (LDL and triglycerides) and an increase in good cholesterol (HDL). Decreased levels of LDL cholesterol lowers your risk of developing heart disease.Pistachios are a great source of copper, vitamin B6, manganese, phosphorus, and thiamin.

, Cashews contain high levels of monosaturated fats that have been linked to low levels and LDL and high levels of HDL cholesterol. This is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease. However, cashews are high in calories, which make them a less appealing option for those looking to lose weight.Cashew butter is great source of manganese, potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium.

Eat in moderation.,
Pair your nut butters with healthy foods.,
Make your own butter.",How to Choose a Healthy Nut Butter3," Because all nuts contain some saturated fats, you should limit how much nut butter you eat each week. In order to maintain your heart health, you should try to eat about four ounces (113.398 g) a week. This will ensure that an overconsumption of saturated fat does not undermine the health benefits of eating nut butters.If you want to control how much nut butter you eat each week, use a food scale and a food diary to track what you consume.

, In order to get the most out of your nut butters, consider pairing them with whole grain bread or fruits. This will add to your feeling of satiation and keep you from overeating. Be sure to avoid overly sugary foods like jams, jellies, or syrups, which can cause spikes in your blood sugar and lead to overeating., Making your own butter will ensure that you know exactly what ingredients are in your spread. All you need are some nuts, an oven, and a food processor. Simply roast the nuts in the oven and then grind them in the food processor until the butter is the desired consistency.If you need to add some sugar, use a honey that has a mild flavor. Avoid adding any additional oils or fats.
You can make butter from any nut, including peanuts, almonds, cashews, and pecans.

Have brown rice and whole grains.",How to Choose Anti Inflammatory Foods," Opt for healthier oils like olive oil, grapeseed oil, borage oil, avocado oil, or safflower oil when you are cooking.Try to cook your foods at low temperatures, such as a low simmer or medium to low heat. Using anti-inflammatory oils at low cooking temperatures usually makes for healthier meals.;
, Add leafy green vegetables like spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, kale, broccoli, Swiss chard, turnips, and beet greens to your diet. These vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals. They are also anti-inflammatory. You should aim to have at least one leafy vegetable per meal.Beets, celery, cabbage, carrots, peas, bok choy, and Brussels sprouts are also good anti-inflammatory vegetables.
Fresh tomatoes and tomato-based sauces are also considered anti-inflammatory.
If you do not have access to fresh vegetables, you can use frozen vegetables. Check the packaging to make sure there isn't added sodium or sugar.

, Go for apples, bananas, pineapples, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, cherries, and oranges. These fruits all have anti-inflammatory properties. Try to have at least one anti-inflammatory fruit for every meal.If you do not have access to fresh fruits, you can have frozen fruits. You can then add these to smoothies to create a healthy, anti-inflammatory drink.

, Add kidney beans, garbanzo beans, navy beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, lentils and soybeans to your diet., Salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, cod, flounder, and anchovies are all good sources of omega-3 fats.Aim to have fatty fish at least one to two times a week.

, Fresh herbs like basil, sage, and rosemary can all add anti-inflammatory properties to your meals. Foods like onions and garlic also have high anti-inflammatory properties and should be added to your diet.You should also use anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric, cayenne pepper, ginger, and cloves in your meals.
Nuts, seeds, and spices are a great, simple way to add more anti-inflammatory foods to your diet. Sprinkle almonds, walnuts, or peanuts in your morning oatmeal or yogurt. Add pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, cashews, or sesame seeds to salads and curries. Season your meals with a pinch of cayenne or ginger.

, Water is always the healthiest beverage but you can also have green tea and herbal tea to consume more anti-inflammatory liquids.You may want to read up on how to properly prepare green tea.

, A food allergy is considered a specific form of inflammation, where your immune system has a negative response to a certain food. You should avoid eating any foods that cause allergies as this is a form of inflammation that can lead to serious health issues.Peanut allergies and seafood allergies are common, but you may also suffer from other food intolerances or sensitivities, such as a gluten sensitivity or lactose intolerance.
If you suspect you have an intolerance or allergy, try keeping a symptom journal. You can then pinpoint certain foods that you may want to remove as a trial. A doctor or dietitian can look at your journal to give a recommendation on what you could remove. Continue to journal and see if symptoms improve.

, Refined carbohydrates such as white breads, pastas, and baked goods can cause inflammation. Avoid these foods, especially if they are pre-packaged, as they likely contain additives and preservatives that are not good for you.Though whole grain foods are less inflammatory than white breads, pastas, and baked goods, they will have some inflammatory effects. If these foods are made with organic whole grains with no additives or preservatives, they may be considered not inflammatory.

, Stay away from fried foods, such as french fries or fried meats. In addition to being inflammatory, eating fried foods can also lead to other health issues like obesity and weight issues.

, Stay away from the cold cuts aisle, as processed meats contain inflammatory properties.Red meat is also considered an inflammatory food and should be consumed in moderation. Look for beef that is grass fed rather than grain fed, as grass fed beef has lower inflammatory properties.

, These types of fats are high in inflammatory omega 6-fats. Try to cook with healthier oils like olive oil or coconut oil and only use butter or margarine on toast in moderation., Soda and beverages sweetened with artificial flavors and sugars are considered inflammatory. Stick with water or other healthy beverages such as green tea or natural fruit juices., Processed and pre-packed foods that contain many ingredients that can be inflammatory. There are also ingredients that are added to foods during processing that can cause inflammation. Focus on foods that are unprocessed and not packaged.Try shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store so you can avoid packaged foods like instant noodles, cookies, bottled sauces and cooking mixes. The more food you can prepare and cook yourself from scratch, the less processed and pre-packed ingredients you will consume.

, Whole foods are processed and refined as little as possible and should not cause inflammation. Check the labels of foods at the grocery store to confirm they contain very few basic ingredients and the ingredients are all natural., Foods that do not contain additives or preservatives should not cause inflammation. Check food labels and the listed ingredients on food items to ensure there are no additives or preservatives., Rather than have a meal with white rice or refined pasta, go for a meal with brown rice and whole grains like quinoa or couscous.

Order a favorite main and a healthier side or vice versa.,
Choose a leaner protein source.,
Cut out high-calorie breads and pastries.,
Stick with unsweetened beverages.,
Choose a small and skip the ""up-size"" option.,
Read the entire menu.,
Review the nutrition information.,
Plan before you go.,
Alternate days of eating at home and eating out.,
Try the Starbucks turkey bacon breakfast sandwich.,
Order the McDonald's fruit and maple oatmeal.,
Power up with Dunkin' Donuts' egg white and turkey sausage wrap.,
Choose the classic Egg McMuffin.,
Try the Burger King sausage burrito wrap.,
Sip on Jamba Juice's Mango Peach Topper.",How to Choose a Healthy Fast Food Breakfast," Another option to keep fast food meals a little bit more nutritious is by doing a 50/50 deal between a favorite item and a more nutritious item.


For example, if you're craving a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich — go for it. But instead of the hash brown as a side, get the fruit cup instead.
By making that 50/50 deal you're increasing the nutrition of your overall meal and most likely saving yourself a few calories as well.Many fast food restaurants offer healthier side items to their meals. You may need to read the entire menu to see what they offer. However, fruit cups, apple slices and baby oranges are more common and more available.;
, One negative of some of the common breakfast options at fast food restaurants is the high fat meats they serve. If possible, try to choose a leaner source of protein.


Some fattier meats that are served are not only higher in calories, but also higher in saturated fats. Try to avoid these or do not eat them on a regular basis.
Eating bacon and some other processed meats has been linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancerand cancer in the lower stomach.Breakfasts meals or sandwiches that have bacon or sausage will have higher levels of fat and calories.
Choose leaner protein like ham, Canadian bacon, turkey bacon, turkey sausage, cheese or eggs.
Many fatty cuts of meats are high in saturated fats. This type of fat, if eaten regularly or in larger quantities, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke., Fast food restaurants also serve a lot of high calorie breads, pastries or sugary breakfast items. These, like saturated fat, can cause health problems if eaten regularly.


Refined carbohydrates include sugary foods and those made with white flour. They're typically high in calories and sugar but low in overall nutrients. These foods have more of a negative impact on your cholesterol than saturated fats.Bagels, waffles, pancakes, croissants, English muffins and rolls are all common versions of processed, refined carbohydrates. Try to limit or avoid how often you order breakfast items that contain these foods.
If you can, always choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain options. For example, the Starbucks turkey bacon and egg white sandwich is served on a whole wheat English muffin.

, It's not only the food choices at fast food restaurants that make meals unhealthy. What you choose to drink also plays an important role in the overall nutrient content of your breakfast.


Sweetened beverages, when consumed regularly or in large quantities, can lead to weight gain, heart disease and diabetes.Skip items like: sweetened coffee drinks, sweet tea, fruit juice cocktails, smoothies and sodas.
Stick to water or coffee and tea without sweeteners. These are naturally no calorie and do not contain any sugar.

, There's no doubt that one of the best ways to keep fast food meals in check is by ordering a small. Skip those bigger portions or the ""up-sized"" version to keep your meals in check.


Many fast food restaurants offer you the option of increasing your meal and drink size for just just a few pennies. Resist this urge. With every size increase, there's also a significant increase in calories and fat.Also, try ordering a small. Not only is this size a little cheaper in price, but also comes with fewer overall calories.
Also choose smaller meals in general. For example, instead of the double or triple burger patty, just go for a single patty instead.
If you want to order a whole meal (with a sandwich, fries and a drink) consider going for a kid's meal. You get everything included but a very small amount and it's portion controlled.

, Whenever you're planning on going to grab a quick breakfast at a fast food restaurant, start by reading the menu. This will give you all of your options up front.When you spend time thoroughly reviewing the menu, you'll be able to see every option available. Many times, if you're just order your ""usual"" you may be missing the opportunity to find other options that are more nutritious.
Also make sure you find a complete menu. The one you see behind the registers or at the drive-thru may not give you every option. Ask for a paper menu or check online.
Scan the entire menu for options that are more nutritious. You may want to look for low-calorie, low-fat or small portions of different items.

, When you go out to eat, you may not be aware of exactly how many calories or how much fat, sugar or sodium are in the items you order. Many restaurants now give the nutrition information and this is something you should check out.


Once you've reviewed the menu and have picked a few things to consider, take a look at the nutrition information to see if they're truly going to fit into your diet plan.
Restaurants that are a chain with more than 25 locations are legally required to provide the nutrition information on everything they serve in their facility.This information is in-store and also online.
Many times this information is listed on the menu next to the corresponding meal or food items; however, some restaurants have a separate nutrition information list.

, Another important aspect about going out to breakfast, is going with a plan. You're more likely to choose a more nutritious meal, if you've picked out your meal before you go.After looking at both the menu and nutrition information, select a few items you think will fit nicely into your eating plan. Keep these in mind when you go through the drive-thru or order inside.
Try to avoid looking at the menu when you get to the restaurant or looking a new items or specials. Stick to your planned breakfast meal.
You're more likely to choose an unhealthy item if you do not go in with a plan when you eat out.

, If you find yourself heading out to breakfast more often than not, consider trying to alternate in more days of eating at home.


Eating fast food on a more regular basis isn't a great option. Although there are some healthy options at fast food restaurants, it's best to include some home cooked meals.
When you make more foods from home, you have increased control on the total fat, sugar, sodium and even calories your foods contain.This can help you stick to a healthier diet overall.
Set a few days a week to have breakfast at home. That way, you can balance your diet a little bit easier.

, If you're in the mood for a coffee and breakfast, consider going to Starbucks. You can grab a cup of hot coffee and a delicious low calorie breakfast sandwich.Starbucks offers a lot of breakfast options; however, many are high in calories and fat (like their pumpkin bread, croissants or the sausage and cheddar breakfast sandwich). Skip these in lieu of a healthier and more nutritious option.
Consider ordering their turkey bacon breakfast sandwich. It's a toasted whole wheat English muffin with egg whites, turkey bacon and cheese.
This sandwich is about 230 calories total, but it has 16 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber., If you're in the mood for something warm and comforting, try stopping by McDonald's for their morning oatmeal. You'll be pleasantly surprised how tasty this nutritious item is.


Many fast food restaurants are now offering oatmeal as a breakfast option; however, things can get pretty high in calories with all the sugar and other toppings they may add.
McDonald's fruit and maple oatmeal is a great choice. It's made with whole grain rolled oats and topped with your choice of diced apples, dried fruit and brown sugar.
This oatmeal, with the brown sugar, is only 290 calories per serving. If you skip the brown sugar, it'll knock the calorie count down to 260 calories per serving. You'll also get about 5 g of protein and 5 g of fiber as well., If you're a Dunkin Donuts coffee fan, skip your coffee and donut pair and choose one of their wraps or flatbreads. They're lower in calories and are a great option to start your day with.


Although the donuts at this restaurant are delicious, they can rack up both calories and sugar quickly. These sweet treats can cost you 300 – 400 calories just for one.Instead, order yourself a egg white and turkey sausage wrap. You can get the egg white with vegetables (an extra hit of fiber!), plus it comes with a high protein meat and cheese.
One of these wraps will be about 150 calories total. In addition, most have about 10 g of protein and 1 – 2 g of fiber., If you want to stay with the all-time classic, hit up McDonald's for their Egg McMuffin. It's the perfect breakfast sandwich on the go.


Many of McDonald's breakfast sandwiches are overly high in calories since they have a ton of high fat breakfast meat or are served on high calorie items like bagels or croissants.
The Egg McMuffin is a pretty simple breakfast sandwich. It's an English muffin (smeared with a little butter), scrambled egg, Canadian bacon and cheese.
This tasty sandwich is about 300 calories total; however, if you ask them to hold the butter, you'll save yourself 30 calories. In addition, you'll get about 17 g of protein and 2 g of fiber., Breakfast burritos are another popular item that has hit fast food breakfast menus. Burger King has a great portion controlled option that'll fit into a healthier eating plan.


Some breakfast burritos (even at Burger King) can get overly high in calories. Some are upwards of over 800 calories per burrito.Instead, order the Burger King sausage burrito wrap. It's small and contains eggs, cheese and sausage in a wrap.
This wrap is about 310 calories total. It has about 14 g of protein and 1 gram of fiber per burrito., If you'd rather sip on sweet smoothie for breakfast, consider going to Jamba Juice. They offer a bright and tasty mango peach smoothie that will start your day off on the right foot.


Smoothies have become a popular breakfast item; however, many smoothie shops add a ton of sugar and sweetened juices to these drinks which can push their total calories through the roof.
Instead, consider ordering Jamba Juice's mango peach topper. It's sweet, smooth and creamy, plus it contains your whole day's worth of fruit servings.
This smoothie is about 320 calories total. It also has 6 g of fiber and 1/2 of your daily dose of Vitamin A and Vitamin C. If you add a scoop of their whey protein powder, you'll get an additional 19 g of protein."

Sticking to the Atkins Diet means major changes, and your doctor can advise you on whether or not this is a good idea for you and your overall health.


The Atkins Diet isn’t necessarily for everyone. For instance, breastfeeding mothers and people with severe kidney disease should not begin this diet.Following the Atkins diet can cause some side effects such as headache, nausea, irritability, and bad breath.Your doctor can discuss the risks with you.;
, This plan focuses on reducing or eliminating carbs from your diet, while encouraging the consumption of proteins and fats. The Atkins Diet proposes that controlling the foods in you eat in this way will lead to weight loss and long-term healthy eating.There are many resources available online to research the Atkins Diet, as well as books on the topic, like Dr. Robert Atkins’ “Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and Atkins for Life.”

, There are four distinct phases to this plan: Induction, Balancing, Pre-maintenance, and Lifetime maintenance.Many people begin at the first phase, Induction, to maximize weight loss. However, you can begin the diet at any of the first three phases.Working with a dietitian or doctor on this program can ensure that you understand the program to the fullest degree.

, For the first phase, Induction, you avoid eating nearly all carbohydrates. This includes breads, baked goods, grains, potatoes, sugary foods and drinks, fruits, alcohol, etc. This may be hard at first, so prepare yourself by slowly weening off carbs in the days leading up to your Atkin's Diet start date.


You may consume no more that 20 grams of net carbs per day, and most of these carbs should come from vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, and green beans.
About two cups of loosely-packed salad, plus a cup of another vegetable, will equal approximately 20 grams of net carbs from vegetables., In the Induction phase, you should also eat protein at each meal. You can choose from fish, poultry, red meat, pork products, eggs, cheese, etc.The portion size of these proteins can be generous.You do not need to restrict oils and fats.

, They include:Leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach
Crisp greens such as cucumbers, celery, broccoli, zucchini and green beans
Other vegetables such as peas, eggplant, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, and peppers.

, During the Induction phase of the Atkins Diet, you should drink eight glasses of water per day. This is important to avoid dehydration and constipation., If you are beginning the Atkins Diet at the Induction phase, you will need to follow these guidelines for at least two weeks to maximize your transition and weight loss. If you want to or need to lose more weight, you may stay in this phase longer., Knowing ahead of time what you can and will eat while on the Induction phase will help you succeed at the start of the Atkins Diet. It will keep you organized, focused, and on track. A typical menu for this phase might include:


For breakfast: a good source of protein like scrambled eggs, with ingredients like onions and cheese, and 3 breakfast sausages. Coffee, tea, water, or diet soda are acceptable beverages in the Induction phase and throughout the other phases of the Atkins Diet.For lunch: a salad with a protein such as chicken, and an acceptable beverage. Another option is a bacon cheeseburger (without bun).For dinner: Salmon, asparagus, and a salad, and an acceptable beverage. Another option is a shrimp cocktail, baked chicken, and a small salad.Snacks (up to two per day): An Atkins Diet product (these include shakes, granola bars, etc), diet gelatin with artificially-sweetened whipped cream, or a protein-rich, low-carb snack like celery and cheddar cheese., For the second phase, Balancing, you continue to restrict your intake of carbohydrates. You can consume about 25-30 grams of net carbs per day during the Balancing phase (a minimum of 12-15 grams of net carbs should come from vegetables), as long as your weight loss continues.You can begin to reintroduce some nutritious sweet foods like berries, as well as nuts and seeds.
You should, however, continue to avoid foods with added sugar.
Notice how these foods make you feel. Remove them from your diet if the negatives outweigh the positives.

, For the second phase, you should try to determine the amount of carbs you can have per day while not slowing your weight loss. This is known as your critical carbohydrate level (CCLL).Determining this during the Balancing phase will help you to maintain the Atkins Diet in its later phases.


You may have to experiment to determine CCLL, by adjusting the amount of carbs that you eat.

, During the Balancing phase, you can continue to eat the same foods that were acceptable in the Induction phase. In addition, you can expand your meal options to include reintroduced foods. For instance:


Try mixed nuts as a snack.
Add berries and/or nuts to a salad for variety.
Serve nutrient-rich foods like green beans and avocados as a side with your protein at lunch or dinner.

, You should continue eating according to the guidelines of the Balancing phase until you are about 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) from your ideal weight.If your weight loss stops, reduce your carb intake.

, For the third phase, pre-maintenance (or “Fine-Tuning”), you can reintroduce fruits, starchy vegetables (such as potatoes), and whole grains. A lack of variety can cause boredom and eventual derailment of your plan


Use this phase as a chance to reintroduce a carbohydrate that you especially prefer—potatoes, grains, etc. Keep in mind that you need to control the amount of this food that you eat., You can raise the amount of carbs you eat during the pre-maintenance phase by about 10 grams per week. You should cut back on your carb intake, however, if your weight loss stops. Stay in the pre-maintenance phase until you reach your target weight.


As you reach your target weight, and reintroduce carbohydrates, you will develop a new CCLL.Once you determine the CCLL for this stage, just make sure to keep your carb intake at or below this level.

, Since you are allowed to eat more types of food during the pre-maintenance phase, you can add more options to your menu possibilities. For instance:


Have a small portion of french fries with your bacon cheeseburger (without bun) for lunch.
Supplement your breakfast with a side of your favorite fresh fruit.
Have a serving of whole grain, such as brown rice or quinoa, alongside a protein like baked chicken or grilled steak for dinner.
Include slightly higher-carb vegetables and legumes, including: carrots (3/4 cup), acorn squash (1/2 cup), beets (1 cup) and potatoes (1/4 cup), apple (1/2), and kidney beans (1/3 cup). Each of these serving sizes has about 10 net carbs.Remember to keep the daily amount of carbohydrates you eat within your CCLL.

, The Lifetime Maintenance is designed as a long-term plan of healthy eating habits. Continue to follow the guidelines of this phase for life., As during the other phases of the Atkins Diet, you are encouraged to eat proteins—red meat, fish, pork, poultry, etc. In addition, 12-15 grams of your net carbs per day should still come from low-carb, “foundational” vegetables.

, The net carbs you consume should still not exceed the new CCLL you set during the pre-maintenance phase.As a rule of thumb, you can consume no more than 90-120 grams of net carbs per day if you exercise. However, you will have a better chance of maintaining your weight if you remain at your re-maintenance level CCLL.You may need to alter your carbohydrates up and down depending on your weight and how it fluctuates.

One of the benefits of this type of diet is that it can be a lifestyle change — a sustainable way to permanently change how you eat and nourish your body (and likely keep the weight off).


This type of detox diet stresses eating a wide variety of nutrient-dense, whole foods.
Nutrient-dense foods are those that are minimally processed, moderately low in calories, but very high in a variety of nutrients (like fiber, protein or vitamins).Foods that fall into this category include: fruits, vegetables, lean protein, seafood and dairy products.
Sticking to the perimeter of the grocery is an easy way to find and stick to these whole foods.
Some minimally processed versions of these foods are appropriate as well. Frozen fruits and vegetables are minimally processed, but do not have additives. The same goes for canned beans, vegetables, or fruits that have no added salt or sugar.

, Many detox diets do limit certain types of foods — especially added sugars and processed foods. Eliminating these foods can help you feel a lot better and help you lose weight.Foods that are highly processed, have a lot of preservatives, or have added sugars may be a lot higher in calories and fat. If you're eating these foods on a regular basis, it can be difficult to lose weight.
Foods that fall into this group that are okay to avoid include the following: sweetened beverages, sugary cereals, cookies, chips, crackers, cakes/pies, breakfast pastries, frozen meals, canned meals, processed meats (like deli meat or sausage) and candy.
You can safely eliminate these foods without affecting your health or body in a negative way. In fact, many people report feeling much better after a few days without these types of foods.

, Many detox plans do promote the consumption of adequate fluid consumption. Drinking adequate water and other hydrating fluids prevents dehydration and can flush toxins from your body.Most health professionals suggest consuming a minimum of 64 oz or eight glasses of clear fluids daily; however, detox diets may suggest drinking a lot more — close to 10 – 13 glasses daily.
Since many detox plans do limit additives like sugar or even artificial sweeteners, your choices for fluids may be limited. This is a good idea as you should get used to drinking regular water and limiting artificial flavorings, colors and sweeteners.
Items like water, sparkling water, infused waters or tea may be your only option when you're detoxing, as they do not have additives.
If you do get more of a choice, you can try decaf coffee or flavored waters as well.
Detox diets that suggest you consume only water or fluids are generally unsafe and should be avoided.

, Most diets, especially detox diets, will come with a time limit or specified time period. This is important to look for in your plan, as you may not be able to safely follow your detox diet for an extended period of time.


Long-term fasting by restricting multiple food groups or following a liquid diet can be dangerous and is generally not recommended. This can result in nutrient deficiencies, fatigue, and loss of muscle mass.If your detox plan does come with some fasting, that's okay, but should be limited to a few days for most people. Consult with your physician.
If your detox diet is more well-balanced and includes multiple food groups, you can most likely follow this for a more extended period of time since you're not overly restricting nutrients.

, One common aspects of many detox diets is that they are advertised as quick fixes. This makes them a fad or trendy diet, which is not recommended by health professionals.


Detox plans that promise quick weight loss (like ""lose 21 pounds in 21 days"") are never considered safe or effective.In fact, if you see marketing like this, you should stay away from these detox plans.
These plans generally cannot actually produce those results to start with. In addition, the method they use to attempt to reach those results are generally unsafe and unfounded (like drinking water with lemon juice, cayenne pepper and maple syrup).
If you are scanning through different detox diets, stay far away from plans that seem like a quick fix, are too good to be true or are overly restrictive.

, When researching detox diets, you'll notice that some diet plans suggest the use of multiple supplements. If you notice this, do not follow those detox plans.


One very common supplement you may see sold with a detox plan is a fiber supplement or a colon cleanse. These are not safe and should not be used. Do not follow a detox plan that suggests these.If a plan suggests taking a lot of vitamin or mineral supplements (like B12 supplements), avoid it. Most people do not need large doses of vitamins. If taken, they could be dangerous.
Also avoid herbal supplements (unless discussed with your physician). Some herbal supplements (like St. John's Wort) can interfere with other medications and some health conditions.

, Many detox plans do have a few days or a longer period of time of all liquids. These could range from juice fasts or fasts that rely more or less on water only. It's never recommended to follow these programs.Detox plans that advise liquid fasts can be dangerous to your body. Many times, they lead to nutrient deficiencies and fatigue.In addition, the weight lost is usually water weight and is regained the minute you return to eating regular foods.
Liquid fasts are probably the least effective dieting system. Weight regain generally happens very quickly after stopping the diet.

, Although some detox plans restrict foods (like processed foods or sugar), they still include a large variety of foods in general. There are other plans that restrict much larger food groups and should be avoided.


If you're reading through your detox plan and notice that it suggests restricting wheat or gluten, dairy or protein, this is not an appropriate or safe program to follow.When you limit multiple food groups or large varieties of foods, you're limiting the amount of nutrients you're able to eat. Again, this could lead to nutrient deficiencies over time.
In addition, if your detox plan suggests only having fruits or vegetables, make sure it includes adequate protein intake (e.g., beans, legumes, peas, kale, broccoli rabe, mushrooms).Inadequate protein intake could result in loss of muscle mass instead of fat over time.

, After you've chosen a detox plan to follow, you'll want to maintain whatever weight you've lost. To do that, make sure you also include regular physical activity into your routine.


Exercise helps you maintain a healthy weight and can help you continue to lose weight.Health professionals recommend to include at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week. This ends up being about 2 1/2 hours every week.Aerobic exercise should be moderate intensity. You can walk, jog, use the elliptical, take a spin class, or go hiking.
In addition to aerobic exercise, make sure to include one to two days of strength training as well. Yoga, weight lifting or pilates are great exercises to help build lean muscle mass.

, If your detox diet eliminated processed foods, like sweets or high fat foods, this is a good idea to continue long-term. Limiting these foods can help you maintain your weight loss.Many processed foods are higher in sugar, fat, sodium and calories. Limiting these foods long-term will most likely help you maintain your weight loss.
Foods that fall into this overly processed category include: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cake, breakfast pastries, sugary cereals, fried foods, fast foods and processed meats.

, One area where people do slip up and make mistakes is in regards to portion size. Even if you eat larger portions of healthier foods, you could still end up regaining some of your weight long-term.


For protein, you want to make sure to include a 3-4 oz serving at every meal or snack.This will help ensure you're getting enough protein everyday, but still stay within an appropriate calorie level.
Fruits and vegetables should also make an appearance at each meal to make sure you eat the recommended five to nine servings daily. Aim for 1/2 cup of fruit or one small piece, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens.Dairy does fall into the protein group, but has a separate portion size recommendation. Go for 1 cup of milk, yogurt or cottage cheese and 1 – 2 ounces of cheese.Grains should also be portioned — especially since people tend to overeat on this group specifically. Measure out 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 1 – 2 ounces of grains."

Read the ingredients list and nutrition facts carefully.,
Limit sugar content per serving.,
Recognize sugar in its many forms.,
Watch out for hidden sources of sugar and calories.,
Select a breakfast cereal with no added preservatives, colors, or unnatural flavors.,
Stay away from cereal with a high salt content.,
Stay under 250 calories per cup.,
Look for healthy gluten-free options.",How to Choose a Healthy Breakfast Cereal1," Choosing healthy breakfast cereal comes down to choosing healthy ingredients, so get into the habit of reading the labels on products. Check the nutrition facts to compare sugar, salt, fiber, and fat content between products. Read the ingredients list on every product you are considering buying, even if the label says “all-natural” or “healthy.” Don’t rely on marketing ploys — learn to recognize which ingredients to choose and which to avoid.


Determine what counts as a serving size for that product, because nutrition facts are listed by serving size. It matters whether the serving size of cereal that contains ""10 grams of sugar"" is the whole box, or 30 grams (in which case the cereal would be 1/3 sugar!);
, One of the most common unhealthy ingredients in cereal is sugar. Always check the nutrition facts on your cereal, and limit sugar to 4 – 5 grams per serving, whenever possible.Getting up to 8 grams of sugar per serving is okay if the cereal contains real fruit or lots of fiber.In general, cereals targeted toward children will have added sugars to make them more appealing. Avoid breakfast cereals with “frosted,” “sweetened,” “sugary,” or “fruity” in the name. Remember that adult cereals very commonly contain sugar as well.
If an unsweetened cereal tastes too bland, try adding fresh fruit or even a half-teaspoon of sugar or honey at home instead of buying a sweetened breakfast cereal. This way, you can better manage the added sugar and slowly wean yourself off of it at your own pace.

, Sugar can show up in obvious or much more subtle ways; check the ingredients list for sugars, but also know that some sugar-based ingredients may not be very recognizable. High fructose corn syrup, fructose, dextrose, glucose, corn syrup, cane sugar, raw sugar, monosaccharide, molasses, and “other sweeteners” indicate sugar content.Some lesser known sugar additives are barley malt, cane sugar, concentrated juice (apple, pear, grape), honey, invert sugar, levulose, malt syrup, rice syrup, sorghum, and turbinado sugar.Sugar content also includes sugar from fruit, like raisins in raisin bran. Natural fruit sugars are much less unhealthy than refined sugars, as long as it comes from real fruit., It can take a keen eye to avoid sugary or calorie-heavy ingredients in cereal, because many products may seem healthier than they are. Hidden sources of additives can include fruits, nuts, and other flavor additions, because there’s often more to them than simply fruit or nuts.


Dried fruits in cereal like strawberries or raspberries often contain lots of salt or artificial color and flavor; make sure there is real fruit in the ingredients list if the packaging boasts fruit.“Clusters” of oats, bran flakes, or nuts are frequently coated with sugar, as well. “Yogurt” clusters are mostly just fattening oils with no health benefit. Flavored oatmeal or creamed cereals may have fruit, spice, or nut flavors that are made up of sugar and artificial flavors., Artificial ingredients typically contain no health benefits, and some research indicates that excessive amounts of certain preservatives and additives may be associated with health problems. Yet many products contain artificial flavors and colors to make them look or taste more appealing, or keep them fresh on the shelves longer.


Avoid artificial sweetener like aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin.Stay away from ingredients with colors or numbers in the name, like “yellow no. 5.” These artificial colors might also be listed as “E” then a number, like “E102.”Artificial flavors might be in the ingredients at “FD&C,” or simply as “artificial flavors.”These flavor additives have no health benefits.

, You might not think it, but breakfast cereals may also contain sodium from added salt. For those with high blood pressure or other sodium-related conditions, and even for healthy individuals, breakfast cereals with high sodium levels should be avoided.


Try to get a cereal with under 180 milligrams of salt (or sodium) per serving., Cereal tends to contain more calories than you may expect, especially since a serving size is usually much smaller than what you might eat for breakfast. Check the serving size and aim for a cereal that contains fewer than 250 calories per cup of cereal.Per serving, aim for fewer than 120 calories., If you have a gluten sensitivity or have celiac disease, you will want to look for healthy cereals that contain no gluten. While this once might have been a very difficult task, many manufacturers are now offering cereals that are gluten-free or made with non-traditional ingredients. Try Special K gluten-free cereal, which has 5g fiber and 3 g protein per serving or Chex gluten-free cereal line, which includes rice, corn, chocolate, and cinnamon flavors."

",How to Do a Lemonade Fast," You'll want to make sure you're healthy enough to withstand the fast which lasts a minimum of seven days.


Discuss potential side effects which include nausea, fatigue and headaches.
During the lemonade fast, you may discontinue using medications, so ask your doctor if this poses any medical risks. Those who have stayed on the fast for an extended period of time reported changes in insulin levels, depression and blood pressure, which may affect medication dosages after the fast.
You will have a moderate energy level while undergoing the lemonade fast. You will lose weight; however, that is not the intended purpose of the lemonade fast as you may lose muscle mass in addition to fat.;
, Combine 1 to 2 tablespoons of organic maple syrup, 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon or lime juice and one cup of pure, non-fluoridated water. Sprinkle in cayenne pepper to taste.

, Aim to consume at least 6 cups of lemonade per day while on the lemonade fast.

, Drinking water is important as you don't want to get dehydrated. You can also drink herbal tea and water.


Do not consume any solid or even semi-solid food during the fast.

, You can also take enemas on the last two days of the fast.

,, For lunch, eat some raw fruit. Eat salad for dinner.

Opt for cereals that are 100% whole grains.,
Choose a cereal that is high in fiber.,
Select a cereal fortified with additional vitamins and minerals.",How to Choose a Healthy Breakfast Cereal2," Whole grains are important in the prevention of heart disease, constipation, obesity, and other health problems. Bran, oat, wheat, and granola breakfast cereals typically have more whole grains, fiber, and other important ingredients than their over-processed counterparts. The first and second items listed in the ingredients should be whole grains – specifically with the word “whole” written in front of each grain.


Get a cereal that contains at least 16 grams of whole grains per serving.If the cereal is made of rice or flour, that’s probably a refined grain, not a whole grain. Avoid these.
Don’t be fooled by the front of the box, even if it says “made with whole grains.” The only way to get the facts is to check the ingredients. If a grain isn’t listed as “whole,” it’s probably refined.
If bran, fruit, soy, or nuts are in the first one to two ingredients, that’s okay as long as a whole grain is listed as well.

, Fiber should be included in the form of whole grains, which is the type of fiber that has health benefits. “Isolated” fiber, fiber removed from grains and made into powder, is sometimes added to cereal so that manufacturers can claim fiber content – but this kind of fiber might not have any health benefits. Watch out for “high fiber” claims if the ingredients don’t include whole grains, or if the cereal includes oat fiber, corn fiber, or soy fiber.Look for cereals that contain at least 5 grams of fiber per serving., Many healthy cereals will contain additional nutrients that can make them an important part of a morning routine for a healthy lifestyle. Fortified cereals should contain between 10-25% of the Daily Value for minerals and vitamins, as listed in the nutrition information. Look for cereal high in iron, folate, B6, B12, and other nutrients.Fortified cereals are especially useful for those who do not take a multi-vitamin or mineral supplement.

"
Opt for plain hot cereals like oatmeal or creamed wheat.,
Add your own flavorings to plain breakfast cereal.,
Try making muesli at home.,
Consider breakfast cereals that are certified organic.,
Look for cereals endorsed by health associations.",How to Choose a Healthy Breakfast Cereal3," When choosing a hot cereal, pick one that is “regular,” “plain,” or “unflavored” and is made of 100% whole grains. Whole grains, as opposed to enriched or refined grains, maintain all of their health benefits and fiber content.If possible, buy oatmeal that is not quick-cook; some health authorities suggest quick-cook oats may contain fewer health benefits than their traditional alternative.If time is an issue, you can make a big batch and save it in the refrigerator to reheat later.

, Reduce your intake of added preservatives and empty calories by buying plain, unflavored cereal and adding your own flavors at home. This way you know exactly what goes into your breakfast, and you can add delicious fresh ingredients for flavor that will also contribute vitamins, antioxidants, fiber, protein, or healthy fats to your meal.


Add a handful of fresh berries, banana, or nuts to boost the nutritional value and taste of plain cereal. Even a teaspoon of honey can add nutrients and sweet flavor that is a healthier option than choosing pre-sweetened cereal from the store.
Try experimenting with fresh herbs like mint and basil, or real spices like cinnamon, cloves, or nutmeg. You can also experiment with flavor extracts like pure vanilla or almond extract for added aroma.

, Homemade muesli is another alternative to pre-flavored store-bought cereals. It can contain high amounts of fiber, vitamins, healthy carbohydrates, antioxidants, and nutrients essential for a balanced and heart-healthy diet.


Start with a base of rolled or whole oats, plain bran flakes, or other whole grain.
Soak your base grain in milk, plain yogurt, cream, water, or 100% fruit juice to soften them.
Try adding chopped nuts, fresh or dried (unsweetened) fruits, spices or flavor extracts, seeds, lemon juice, honey, and other fresh ingredients to taste.

, Organic products are required to meet a minimum standard of naturally-produced ingredients. Many times, they will have significant reductions or even total elimination of the added sugars included in their non-organic competitor cereals.


Although some organic cereals may not be more nutritious than non-organic cereals, they may contain considerably fewer preservatives, and less residue from pesticide or insecticide.

, The easiest way to do this is to look for the logo representing the American Heart Association or another nationally recognized nutrition or health association on the cereal packaging.These endorsements indicate that the cereals meet certain minimum standards of quality or nutrition, and may be useful in helping you choose a breakfast cereal with at least minimum recommended levels of nutrition.

Break your fast at the time you've designated.",How to Fast for a Day," Ask yourself what you wish to learn from the experience, and use this purpose to set an intention for the day. You may find that you get much more out of the fast if there is a drive behind your discipline. Consider whether you have any goals for spiritual or mental development, or whether you are simply trying to tap into the physical benefits. Meditate on a theme, a question, or a goal.


Fast to detoxify your system. Refraining from food for a day can help your body filter out toxins, solid obstructions, and other contaminants that weigh you down.
Fast to reach a breakthrough. Perhaps you need to answer a problem, understand a situation, or come up with with an idea or insight. Fasting can put your mind into a simplifying state that makes it easier to frame your problems.Fast in conjunction with deep meditation, yoga, or sensory deprivation to explore the depths of your mind. Transcend the distractions of hunger with discipline and focus.;
, Many traditional religious fasts only require you to refrain from eating until the sun goes down. If you're fasting for an Islamic rite, for instance, the fast begins 20 minutes before sunrise, and you can break your fast 20 minutes after the sun sets. However, a full 24-hour fast has become a popular way to maintain health and vigor – particularly in yogic circles. The goal of a 24-hour fast is to not eat anything after your evening meal, and to refrain from eating until the next day's evening meal.

, Fasting can help toxins exit your body, and it can help you digest food more efficiently – especially if you make it a habit. However, fasting will not necessarily help you lose weight. If you fast all day, but then gorge yourself on a large, carbohydrate-heavy meal, your metabolism won't kick into gear until after the meal. You won't actually burn more fat than you would if you weren't fasting.


If you are only trying to lose weight, try consuming a very small amount of calories in the morning rather than fasting outright. This morsel will activate your metabolism so that your stomach feeds on stored fats.
Consider doing a one-day juice-only fast once a week. With a juice diet, you can supply your body with enough nutrients that you don't have to deplete the sugar stores in your liver and muscles. This way, you'll detox without breaking down muscle tissue., Consider fasting for 24 hours once each week. Fasting triggers the self-healing properties of the human body; that is to say, your general health may improve when you give your digestive system a rest and your organs have time to heal themselves. A regular practice of fasting can help you digest food more efficiently, enhance your mental clarity, fortify physical and mental vigor, remove toxins, improve vision, and imbue you with a general sense of well-being.

, Water helps balance the bodily fluids that aid the digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients; the circulation of blood; the production of saliva; and the maintenance of body temperature. This doesn't mean that you should chug a ton of water immediately before the fast. All this will do is make you urinate a lot a couple of hours later. Instead, increase your water intake beginning 72 hours before the fast.Juice, milk, tea, Gatorade, and other hydrating drinks will also help you prepare for your fast. Try eating a lot of water-heavy foods, particularly fruits and vegetables.

, Don't overeat! Indeed, try to eat smaller portions than you usually would. If possible, eat primarily fruits and vegetables to balance your system. Foods that are rich in nutrients and full of water will help your body prepare for fasting. Avoid baked goods, especially those that contain a lot of salt and sugar.


Avoid eating sugary, highly-processed foods the day before you fast. Your body will not function properly if it's running predominantly on sugar. Furthermore, processed foods may take longer to leave your system, making it more difficult to have a ""clean"" fast.
If you are diabetic, consult with your doctor before consuming a lot of fruit.

, Your body won't be running on its usual caloric fuel, and you won't be able to push through tiredness with a burst of food-energy. If you give yourself a baseline of rest, it will be much easier to function throughout the day – and you may get more out of your fast.

, Fix your attention on the themes or questions that you want to answer. Focus on examining yourself, exploring an idea, touching base with your spirituality, or simply losing yourself in a state of channeled discipline. If your intention is to detoxify your system, use this purpose to hold yourself resolute against the supplications of hunger.

, Drink at least half a liter of water every two hours. Water will fill your stomach, restore your energy, and dilute the stomach acids that make you feel hungry. However, don't drink so much water that you feel sick.


Some practices, such as traditional Islamic fasting, forbid you from drinking water between sunrise and sundown. In this case, it is incredibly important that you nourish your system with water before and after the fast.

, Inactivity and boredom can lead you to thoughts of eating. Instead, occupy yourself with something that is engrossing, but not physically taxing. Reading, writing, meditating, slow yoga movements, working on your computer, walking in the woods, watching television, and driving short distances are all good ways to occupy yourself during a fast. Avoid high-energy activities like heavy exercises, going to the gym, lifting heavy weights, or running long distances: serious exertion will burn a lot of calories and make you unnecessarily hungry.Avoid thinking about food. Try not to spend time around food, pictures of food, or food smells.

, If you have the sudden urge to give up, remind yourself why you're doing this fast. Exercise discipline. Assure yourself that your hunger will not last forever. And besides: if you remain strong now, the rewards may be far greater than if you give in.


Towards the end of the fast, you will likely feel strained and exhausted. This is where you'll need to bring out the reserves. Nap, if possible, or let visual media take over your brain. An absorptive action movie or video game can work wonders in this situation.

, Take it slow, and be very mindful of how much you eat. Half your portions: it is absolutely imperative that you don't eat as much as you would regularly eat at mealtimes. Your digestive system is on low-power mode, and it isn't able to handle a massive burger right now. Instead, eat light foods like fruits, vegetables, and soup. Water and fruit juices are also important.


Remember not to eat and drink too much, too quickly. Have an apple and a glass of water first, and wait ten minutes. Then, have a bowl of soup with a glass of orange juice.
Space the process over 30 minutes to an hour. Eating a ton right away can land you in the bathroom for a long time accompanied by considerable pain – and it can even be hazardous to your health. Take it slow.

Also consider things like food allergies or sensitivities and cultural or religious diet restrictions. Many diets are very general and may not account for things like these.

, Physical activity is an important part to any healthy lifestyle. Plan on including both cardio and strength training exercises each week. These types of physical activity can help boost your weight loss and help you maintain your goal weight long-term.


In addition, exercise may help improve your mood, improve your sleeping habits, manage high blood pressure or diabetes and improve cardiovascular fitness.If you're new to fitness, try speaking with a personal trainer at your local gym or meeting with an exercise specialist. These professionals will be able to guide you to a fitness program that's appropriate for you.
See if there are any group classes for beginners at your local gym. This is a great way to get started and get support from people starting out just like you.

, Speak to your doctor about your current health, any medical conditions you may have and what medications you're currently taking. They may be able to give you insight on what type of diet or eating pattern is the most appropriate for you and your health. They may also advise you on what diets to avoid.


Many doctors also provide an in-house diet and nutrition program for patients. It generally will include direct follow up with your physician along with regular weight monitoring.
Doctors can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian that can educate you and help design your own personalized diet plan.
In addition, doctors will be able to guide you through medical weight loss. This is where a physician would prescribe a medication to help suppress your appetite, making it easier for you to follow a diet plan. Not all weight loss medications are appropriate for all people. Check with your doctor for more information.

, Spend some quality time online, in the bookstore or talking with friends or family about different types of diets. It's important to be as knowledgeable as possible when you're choosing a new eating pattern. It'll ensure you choose one that's well balanced, safe and enjoyable.


Compare several different diets you think may work for you. Take into consideration any costs, flexibility and sustainability of each diet.
Find reviews about the diet plan from other people. Someone who has tried the diet will be able to give you honest, real-life reviews that may help you make your decision.
Additionally, use reliable, trustworthy resources when doing your research. Look for information provided by hospitals/weight loss clinics, doctors, registered dietitians or other licensed health professionals.
Make sure to avoid any ""extreme"" diets that can be potentially dangerous and unhealthy.

, These types of eating patterns focus on all food groups and do not restrict specific foods. Although calorie controlled they include all food groups: protein, dairy, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. This makes them easy and simple to follow, in addition to being safe for most people.


Weight watchers is a popular diet that encourages participants to enjoy all foods. It teaches how to monitor portion sizes, choose healthy foods and stay accountable.They also offer online, in-person group and individual support groups.
The Mediterranean Diet is typically associated with a ""heart-healthy"" diet. It includes all food groups, but places a strong emphasis on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In addition, it promotes the consumption of omega-3 fats found in olive oil, avocado, and cold water fish like salmon or mackerel.You can even have a glass of red wine.
DASH diet is a well-balanced diet that was developed to help people manage high blood pressure outside of their medications. Besides a lower sodium content, the DASH diet encourages you to consume lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low fat dairy. In addition, processed foods and refined sugars are strongly discouraged., Some diets focus on high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat and low amounts of carbohydrates. Foods like grains, starchy vegetables and fruits are higher in carbohydrates and may be restricted or limited in these types of diet plans. The lower carb levels may make you feel foggy or tired during the initial one to two weeks you follow the plan.This is often called a ""carb flu."" High protein/low carb diet plans are recommended often by doctors for women with PCOS or anyone with insulin resistance.


The Atkins diet is a very popular diet that emphasizes lean protein, healthy fats, dairy, some fruit and non-starchy vegetables while limiting carbohydrates from foods including starchy vegetables and grains. Sugars and other processed foods are also restricted.
Zone Diet is another lower carb diet that focuses on lean protein, lower amounts of fats and larger quantities of non-starchy vegetables and fruit. Most of your meals should consist of fruits and vegetables with this diet plan.South Beach Diet is based on a 3 phased approach. The first phase is designed to eliminate cravings and induce fast weight loss with a very restricted diet. The second phase slowly reintroduces more foods - like whole grains, fruits and some vegetables. The third phase is designed to help you maintain your goal weight when reached., These eating patterns focus solely on plant-based proteins like beans, nuts or lentils, fruits and vegetables. They restrict the consumption of any animal based foods like meat, poultry, eggs, dairy and honey.


Veganism restricts all animal products including dairy, eggs and honey. This is the most restrictive type of eating plan within this group and requires careful planning and research to ensure meets all your required nutrients. This isn't a diet that is particularly easy to follow.
There are several different types of vegetarian diet plans. Lacto-ovo include eggs and dairy. This might be easier to start with if you've never tried a meat-free diet.

, Many diets use protein shakes, protein bars or pre-made foods to help with weight loss. These diets may help you get a jump start on weight loss compared to other diet plans.Jenny Craig, SlimFast, NutriSystem and Medifast are examples of diet plans that use protein shakes, protein bars or pre-made/pre-packaged foods to help induce weight loss.
Diets that use meal replacements may be more expensive than a well-balanced or low carb diet since you need to pay additional money for the replacement foods.
Meal replacements are also not intended for long-term use. They are generally too low in calories, vitamins and minerals compared to whole, natural foods.

, Each diet plan may require you to change some habits, stop others and possibly begin new habits. Make a list of all the things you're going to change and slowly begin incorporating them each day.


Give yourself set, timed goals. Having a deadline to stick to will help motivate you to start and stay on track with your new diet plan.
Making small changes over a longer-period of time is easier to do and you're more likely to stick with the program.
It may also be helpful to keep a journal. You can track your progress, your challenges and successes as you transition to your new diet plan.

, No matter which diet plan you choose, make sure your home and work environments are set up to support your new eating plan.


A good start would be to clean out your refrigerator, freezer and pantry. Make sure any junk food or treats are removed so that you don't have any temptations.
Also have other activities or hobbies that you enjoy outside of food. When a craving hits, it is helpful to have a project to distract you and keep you on track.

, If your diet plan suggests focusing on certain types of foods (like lean protein or 100% whole grains) or certain products (like protein shakes or bars), take a trip to the grocery store to stock up on those items. If your kitchen is full of healthy options, you'll be less tempted to stray from your new plan.


Purchase foods that are healthy swaps for your favorite treats. If you love a sweet treat after dinner, try keeping fruit, quality dark chocolate (80% cocoa and above with no artificial ingredients), or low fat yogurts on hand when a craving strikes.
It may also be helpful to purchase portion-controlled plastic containers. It makes brown-bagging lunch easy and convenient.
Some diet plans may also suggest measuring portions with a food scale or measuring cups. Food scales are relatively inexpensive and are easy tool to measure exact portions.

, Eating plans that claim ""lose 10 pounds in 10 days"" or ""drop 2 pants sizes in 1 week"" are generally unsafe and ineffective. They may seem like a great idea, but may have side effects, produce little to no weight loss and are generally not sustainable long-term.


Many over-the-counter diet pills fall into the ""fad diet"" category. These are not regulated for safety by the FDA and may be harmful to you. They also may have some side effects that can cause a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting, racing heartbeat, loose stools, headache and insomnia.Generally, safe weight loss is anywhere from 1/2 to 2 pounds per week. Be patient as you start your new diet plan.
Always make sure your diet plan is endorsed by a health professional, government website or hospital/weight loss clinic. This shows the diet plan is most likely safe and reliable.

, Diets that suggest avoiding entire food groups or specific groups are generally not healthy. They may cause you to restrict certain vital nutrients like vitamins or minerals.


Also avoid diet plans that recommend very low calorie levels. Generally, you want to consume a minimum of 1200 calories daily so you can meet all your nutrient goals.Be aware of diets that suggest you consume large quantities of specific food like grapefruit or green tea.
Remember, a healthy diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups.

, Some diets may promote the use of a variety of vitamin, mineral or herbal supplements. The FDA does not monitor the safety of supplements and they should be taken with caution.


Research all supplements before you purchase them. You can check The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicines website for detailed information and effectiveness for a large variety of supplements.
Check with you doctor before starting any type of supplement. Some supplements interact with many common medications, so it's important to check to make sure they'll be safe for you.

Consider taking a psyllium supplement.",How to Lower Cholesterol and Triglycerides," If you're overweight, talk with your doctor about safely losing weight. Your doctor or nutritionist can work with you to create a personalized weight loss plan. Even a small amount of weight loss can help to raise your HDL levels., Complex carbohydrates offer more fiber, which can increase your HDL while lowering LDL and triglycerides. Complex carbohydrates also take longer for your body to process, so you'll feel fuller longer. This may help you lose weight as well. To include complex carbohydrates, choose:Beans
Legumes
Fruit (include the rind): plums, peaches, nectarines, apples
Vegetables: artichokes, broccoli, brussels sprouts
Oats
Barley
Millet
Quinoa
Buckwheat
Rye
Whole wheat breads and pasta
Brown rice

, Choose lean meat like poultry. Avoid eating the skin which contains a lot of fat and cholesterol which may raise your LDL cholesterol levels. You can also eat wild-caught fish like salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna. These are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids which can improve your HDL.Don't forget that beans are also a good source of protein which are high in fiber and low in fat. Try to eat one or two servings of beans a day.


Avoid red meat because it contains a high amount of cholesterol which can raise your LDL levels.When you do eat red meat, choose grass-fed (not corn-fed) red meat.
Eggs are also a good source of protein, but the yolks are high in cholesterol. Choose egg whites or limit whole eggs to one or two a day., Not only will this increase your fiber intake, but it will also get more vitamins and minerals into your diet. Aim for a variety of fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that green leafy vegetables also have high levels of sterols and stanols, which help to improve your cholesterol ratio. Consider including:Leafy green vegetables (mustard, collard, beet, turnip greens, spinach, kale)
Okra
Eggplant
Apples
Grapes
Citrus fruit
Berries

, Foods containing soluble fiber have been associated with lower LDL. Soluble fiber is a form of fiber that dissolves in water to form a gel that slows digestion.Scientists theorize this form of fiber helps reduce LDL by binding to cholesterol particles in the digestive tract and preventing their absorption.Some food sources of soluble fiber include:

Oats
Peas
Beans
Citrus fruit
Carrots
Barley

, Trans fats are artificially produced fats that raise LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Studies have linked trans fats to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.To protect yourself from these negative effects, avoid foods that contain trans fats such as:


Packaged and processed baked goods such as pies, cookies, and crackers
Margarine
Nondairy coffee creamer
Fried foods like French fries, doughnuts, and fried chicken
Refrigerated cookie dough, pizza dough, or biscuit dough
Snack chips like tortilla chips and potato chips
Luncheon meats, hot dogs, fatty snack foods

, It may be tempting to cut out all fat from your diet, but the American Heart Association recommends keeping ""good"" fats. These monounsaturated fats can lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. They also have nutrients that improve cell health. To get monounsaturated fats, eat:Olive oil
Canola oil
Peanut oil
Safflower oil
Sesame oil
Avocados
Peanut butter

, Exercise can increase your HDL levels, so if regular exercise is not already a part of your lifestyle, start an exercise routine. For example, start by walking for 30 minutes a day, five days per week. Make sure that you choose an activity that you will enjoy so that you will be more likely to stick with your program. Some good options include:Walking or jogging
Biking
Swimming
Dancing
Using an elliptical walker
Practicing martial arts
Ice skating or rollerblading
Cross country skiing

, Smoking can make it harder to raise your HDL levels, so if you smoke, do your best to quit. You can raise your HDL levels by as much as 10% when you quit smoking.Talk to your doctor to learn about smoking cessation programs in your area.While quitting smoking improves HDL levels, especially in women, it does not lower LDL levels., If you drink, limit yourself to one drink a day (if you're a woman) or two drinks a day (if you're a man).Drinking in excess can lead to higher risk for high blood pressure, stroke, certain cancers, obesity, accidents, and suicide. Drinking too much alcohol has also been shown to increase triglycerides.Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol has been linked with higher HDL levels, but you should not start drinking alcohol or begin drinking more alcohol as a way to raise your HDL levels.

, Your doctor will probably be the one to suggest lowering your cholesterol and triglycerides if blood tests show your levels are high. Your doctor may recommend combining any number of cholesterol-lowering medications with lifestyle changes.


If you're over 20 and haven't been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, get your cholesterol levels checked every four to six years.If you have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, you'll need to have it checked more frequently.

, Your doctor may prescribe statins which are enzymes (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) that effectively lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.But, statins also interfere with the formation of other important substances like CoQ10. Ask your doctor about taking a CoQ10 supplement (at least 30 mg/day) while taking the statins.


Side effects of statins include headache, nausea, muscle weakness, muscle pain, and increased risk for diabetes.
Statins may interact with prescription medications and herbs. Tell your physician about all medications and herbs you are taking.

, These can reduce the absorption of fats and reduce the formation of cholesterol in the liver. Bile-acid sequestrants are most effective at lowering LDL but have little effect on HDL-cholesterol or triglycerides.For this reason, your doctor may prescribe them to be used along with other medications. Talk with your doctor if you have gallbladder disease, phenylketonuria, or are taking medications for your thyroid. You should not use bile-acid sequestrants since they may interfere with your medication.


Side effects of bile-acid sequestrants include constipation, gas, nausea, and upset stomach.

, These inhibitors are antibodies that make up a new class of drugs. They work to prevent the formation of LDL cholesterol by the liver. Since this is a relatively new drug, more studies are needed to determine its safety and effectiveness.Side effects are rare, but they include flu-like symptoms, urinary tract infections, muscle pain or spasms and diarrhea.

, If you're taking statins, your doctor may also prescribe an inhibitor of dietary cholesterol absorption. When combined, they can lower your LDL cholesterol and reduce your triglyceride level to some degree. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors do this safely without disrupting your body's absorption of other nutrients.Side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, back and joint pain

, If statins don't effectively lower your cholesterol and triglycerides, your doctor may prescribe fibrates (like gemfibrozil and fenofibrate). Fibrates primarily reduce triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol.You shouldn't take fibrates if you have liver or kidney disease.


Side effects include upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, headaches and muscle aches.

, You can purchase an over-the-counter niacin supplement (niacinamide) to lower your triglycerides, lower LDL, and raise HDL. Take a supplement of no more than 1200 to 1500 mg a day or follow your doctor's recommendation. This B vitamin should not be taken if you have liver disease, an active peptic ulcer, or a bleeding disorder.Side effects include hot flashes and nausea, vomiting, liver problems, gout and increased blood sugar levels.
Niacin is also available by prescription, which tends to be more effective. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription niacin supplement.

, Ask your doctor if you should supplement with plant sterols (beta-sitosterol and gamma oryzanol). These can increase your HDL while lowering LDL.With your doctor's approval, take 1 gram of beta-sitosterol 3 times a day. Or, take 300 mg of gamma oryzanol once a day. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.


If you prefer to get plant sterols from your diet, eat seeds nuts, vegetable oils, and foods fortified with sterols (like some orange juices and yogurts).

, To lower your LDL and triglycerides while increasing your HDL, take a supplement (if you don't eat omega-3 fish a few times a week). Take two 3,000 mg capsules of combined EPA and DHA (total milligram count of these two fatty acids should not exceed 3,000 milligrams per capsule) every day.To get omega-3 fatty acids from your diet, include salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, trout, flaxseed, flaxseed oil, soy products, legumes, walnuts and dark leafy green vegetables.

, Garlic may help more with lowering LDL cholesterol than increasing HDL cholesterol, but it does decrease the cholesterol ratio. Include a garlic supplement to see if this helps to improve your cholesterol ratio. Take 900 mg of garlic powder every day. Make sure that you check with your doctor first because garlic can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners.


Garlic supplements have also been shown to lower triglyceride levels., You're probably familiar with psyllium being used as a bulk forming laxative. But, using a daily psyllium husk supplement (in powder, capsule, or biscuit form) can help your body excrete more LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.Take 2 teaspoons of psyllium powder a day and follow the manufacturer's instructions.


Psyllium fiber is a soluble fiber and can count towards your daily fiber goal of 25 to 35 grams. 2 teaspoons of psyllium contains about 4 grams of fiber.

You can substitute legumes for meat, or even just minimize the meat content by including more legumes. Cooked legumes – like kidney beans, black beans, and fava beans – are great additions for most soups and stews.

Chili is a great source of legumes too. Most recipes include at least one kind of bean – usually kidney beans or pinto beans.Try whipping up a mouth-watering minestrone soup full of a variety of legumes and vegetables., Many common side dishes and dips are made from cooked or ground up legumes, especially in Mediterranean cuisine.

Soak legumes before use.,
Rinse the legumes.,
Learn portion sizes and conversions for cooking.",How to Add Legumes to Your Diet3," Most legumes need to be soaked before they are used for cooking or eating. Pick out any shriveled or inedible beans and then place the remaining beans in a large bowl. Use 1 lb (0.45 kg) of dried legumes and add 10  c (2,400 mL) of water. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it for at least four hours.If you’re in a hurry, you can soak the legumes more quickly by bringing the water to boil in a pot, then adding it to the legumes. Cover the bowl and let the legumes soak for one to four hours.
Remember that black-eyed peas and lentils don’t need to be soaked before cooking. Canned varieties of legumes don’t require soaking either.

, Regardless of what type of legume you are using, you should rinse them thoroughly before eating or cooking. Place the legumes in a large bowl in the kitchen sink and rinse them by hand. Be sure to run your fingers over the surface of the legumes to work away any grime that might be present.Let the legumes dry before adding directly to any food items.

, Remember that cooking legumes changes the size of the food item in the process. So, 1  c (240 mL) of dried beans is not the same as 1  c (240 mL) of cooked beans. In general, 1 lb (0.45 kg) of dried legumes yields approximately 5  c (1,200 mL) of cooked legumes.A typical 15.5-ounce can of legumes yields about 1.3  c (310 mL)of drained/cooked legumes.

Get a full night’s sleep.",How to Lose 20 Pounds in 2 Weeks," Water flushes out your system, removing unneeded toxins, making it easier to lose weight. Moreover, water is free of calories, making it a much better choice than sugary drinks. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only water, your odds of losing the weight will increase. If you need something flavored from time to time, choose unsweetened tea.


This should be 24/7, apart from right before a workout. Then you can feel free to chug a cup of black coffee (or with a splash of skim milk). The caffeine blast is reported to give you a kick, making you work out a little bit harder.It turns out drinking water can up your metabolism, too, in addition to making you feel full. Recent studies show that drinking two glasses of cold water can up your metabolism about 40% for 15-20 minutes. Participants in these weight loss studies reportedly lost 15 pounds in three months, largely by drinking only water.;
, Cut it out completely. Someone following a standard diet can usually afford to fall off the junk food wagon once or twice without suffering major repercussions. For more extreme, short-term weight loss goals (like this one), however, junk food must be completely avoided.


Stay away from greasy, fatty foods as well as those with a high sugar content. Anything battered, fried, covered in chocolate, packaged, or loaded up and preserved with sugar is a no-go.
Be sure to read your labels. Even things like yogurt and granola bars can be powerhouses of sugar. While many people think of these as healthy, they're actually not.

, Everything from pasta to cookies is full of simple carbohydrates that are actually sugars in disguise. These little villains spike our insulin levels, upping our fat stores, and ultimately increase our body weight. To lower the spike, cut out the processed carbs – that means white rice, bread, and potatoes, in addition to cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream.You may be better off cutting out carbs in general. Let's face it: 20 pounds in 2 weeks is a tall order. To put your body in ketosis, where it's feeding off your fat stores and not your glycogen stores (because those have been depleted), you'll have to go completely low or no carb. In addition to no sweets, you'll have to cut out starchy vegetables (potatoes, squash, carrots), whole grains (including quinoa and brown rice) and sugary fruits, like bananas, oranges, and apples.
What's more, being hungry makes the temptation to cave to your old habits all the more powerful. Consistently eating good-for-you, healthy foods keeps the other cravings at bay. When you're more full, you make better decisions.

, As the theory goes, some foods take so much energy to digest that eating them actually burns more calories than the foods contain. Even if you do not burn calories eating these foods, though, you will not gain many calories from them, either.


In the way of vegetables, eat more asparagus, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini.
As for fruits, gravitate toward blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon.

, Instead of beef and pork, opt for leaner meats like chicken or fish. Consuming fish is especially helpful because the fatty acids in fish give your body the beneficial oils it needs, and may help subdue the urge to consume greasy or fattening foods.And as for vegetables, go for it. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner – pile 'em on. They're nutritious, generally not full of calories or sugars (again, no potatoes), and keep you full. They're the shortest track to losing weight there is.

, The fact of the matter is that in the short term, fad diets can work. If you're looking to lose weight very quickly and don't care if you gain it back, then a fad diet could be okay for you in this situation. Just realize that, in general, they're not healthy and their effects do not last for long.


One of the most common fad diets right now is juicing. Another contender is the Master Cleanse diet – both of which are liquid-based diets. These offer quick results, but are hard to adhere to and are not wise to stay on for long. If you're desperate, look into them, but take their advice with a grain of salt.

, While you may feel tempted to skip breakfast or spend a day fasting, you should resist the urge to do so. Prolonged fasting can cause muscle loss and other health problems, but it can also make it more difficult for your body to lose weight. When the human body does not receive enough nutrition, it automatically starts conserving calories by burning them at a slower rate. You may experience significant weight loss after the first few days, but by the end of the two weeks, you will probably gain a good portion of it back.The exception to this is if you're on a highly-regimented intermittent fasting plan. This is where you don't eat anywhere from eight to twenty-four hours and then eat planned amounts of calories (often more) thereafter.While this can be effective, do this only with the approval of your physician. If you don't do it correctly, you could actually increase your body's tendency to store fat., Many people find success with a timed plan. That is, they decide that they won't eat after a certain time, usually somewhere around 7 to 8 pm. Nighttime eating is generally the worst for most people, as the TV is on and friends are habitually munching, too. This can be emotionally difficult, but it can pay off.


You may need to be reasonable with yourself. Have this rule for only five or six days out of the week. Give yourself some wiggle room to go out with friends – but that doesn't mean you can go crazy. Stick to a glass of red wine and a few bites – don't eat the entire buffet.

, The idea that it's all about calories is slowly becoming old school. The fact of the matter is that everybody's body is different and not all calories are made the same. What's more, counting calories sucks. That being said, they're a good general guideline. For the purposes of this diet, budget your calories throughout the day. If you've done really, really great, have that piece of dark chocolate or that extra half a chicken breast. Don't go overboard, but keep yourself from feeling deprived.


You'll want to balance the calories you burn with the calories you consume. In other words, the more you work out, the more you can eat. Weight loss generally occurs when you burn more calories than you consume. On average (again, on average), a person needs to burn 3,500 calories more than he or she consumes to lose 1 lb (450 g).To lose 20 pounds (9 kg) in two weeks, you will need to lose a little under 1.5 lbs (675 g) every day. That means burning a little over 5,000 calories more than you consume each day. Yep, a very, very tall order.

, It's not just about what you eat, it's also about how much you eat. Even the healthiest of foods need to be eaten in moderation. Start by using smaller plates and smaller eating utensils and don't go back for seconds. Adhere to the serving sizes listed on the nutrition labels and look up anything you're unsure about.


Snacking is where portion control gets iffy. To avoid that handful of nuts turning into the entire bag, measure out your snacks beforehand. Then when you're hungry, you grab a little baggie or container that's the right serving size and that's that. You know exactly how much you're eating.

, Intermittent fasting and calorie cycling is becoming more and more popular. These practices maintain that sometimes a lot of calories is a good thing, as it keeps your body from down regulating (where you stop burning calories). One week through your diet, consider having a little fun with your eating – it may help keep your diet on the right track.If this diet were to last longer, you might want to devote an entire day to eating. Eating whatever the heck you want. However, it may be best to limit yourself to an hour or two during this fourteen-day period. So for 60 minutes one day this week, go to town. But beyond that, you have to get back to your plan.

, Make sure to read that third word – eat more often, not eat more. Think of it this way: if you only have 5 pieces of celery you can eat in a day (not recommended; just an example), you don't want to eat them all for breakfast. You want to space them out to keep from being hungry. Along the same lines, you're likely not eating a lot in these two weeks. So eat less, but eat less more often. It'll keep your stomach from thinking it's hungry.


Many healthy diets advocate snacking and for good reason – it keeps your metabolism up and it prevents you from gorging yourself later. Make your meals smaller so you can fit in a few extra calories for snack time. In two weeks, your body and your motivation will thank you for it.

, The only way to truly control every nutrient and calorie that goes into your body is to cook for yourself. Though every restaurant nowadays tends to have healthier options, you can never be sure what's in that salad dressing or what type of oil they use for their vegetables. You'll be better off cooking for yourself and being able to exercise complete control over every bite you intake.


This way you can use healthier oils, like olive oil, less butter, less sugar, less salt (a big culprit when it comes to bloating) and control your portion sizes, too. And what's even better? It stretches your wallet further, too.

, If this were a permanent lifestyle change, keeping track might just be demotivating. But since this is only for 14 days, it's totally doable. Keeping track can help you see where you're likely to flub up, see where you have a little wiggle room, and help you see all the progress you've made – which is an awesome feeling. It's proof of a job well done.


This can be done with an old school pen and paper like with a food diary, or you could get technological and download one of the plethora of weight loss apps available. Many help you count calories, carbs, fats, and protein and take into account exercise, too.

, It sounds obvious, but one of the most important things you can do to guarantee weight loss success is to commit to your goal. This is especially important for a short-term diet like this. You cannot afford to have an “off” day when you slack on your diet or exercise regimen. Once you decide to go this route, you must be committed to seeing it through.


It'll be easier if you tell other people about your plan, or if you have other people to do it with you. They can hold you accountable, you can eat healthy and exercise together, and you can complain about it together, too.

, If your body is already familiar with moderate physical activity, you might be able to take things up a notch by alternating moderate and vigorous activity throughout your day. On the other hand, if you are unaccustomed to much physical activity, you should only stick to moderate exercise. Either way, make sure to take plenty of breaks and to re-hydrate yourself with plenty of water consistently.


Vigorous activity burns between 400 and 600 calories per hour, and examples include running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, basketball, and heavy weightlifting or yard work.
Moderate activity burns between 200 and 400 calories per hour and includes hiking, light yard work, dancing, golf, slow bicycling, and slow walking. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise 2-3 times a week.

, If you're watching your favorite program and the commercials come on, pop on down to the floor for a few push ups. While you're putting away dishes, get to dancing. Lunge your way down the hallway. Sounds silly, but these little bits add up, leading to increased muscle tone and a slimmer waistline.


Even if your schedule is ridiculous, find ways to kill two birds with one stone. Take the dog for a walk the long way around the block, park far away from the shopping center doors, clean your house vigorously, or wash your car yourself. Life in general is an opportunity for exercise.

, The human body cannot function properly without sleep. Sleep gives the body a chance to rest, restoring it to peak operating conditions and thereby making it easier for the body to burn calories and drop weight. In order to lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time, you should make sure to get between seven and eight hours of sleep each night.


It's more than just good sense, it actually regulates your hormones and can prevent hunger.So not only does it burn calories and keep you from eating, but it can keep you from eating even while you're awake.

Focus on all-around weight loss.",How to Lose Fat Around the Fingers," One of the easiest and quickest ways to increase the strength in your hands is to do simple grip exercises. Do a few sets of 30 to 50 grips in each hand with a grip or ball of your choice.


Stress balls are usually palm-sized balls that you can squeeze to exercise your hand. Don't have one? Use a tennis ball.
Spring grips, stretchy bands, spring-gloves, and other hand-exercisers are common on the market. Check out what's available at a sporting goods store in your area, or online.
Baoding balls are Chinese stress-relief balls that can be used to exercise your hands. To use them, you rotate two balls around in your palm. They make nice sounds and help you exercise your hands.;
, Wrist-strengthening exercises have the added benefit of increasing your grip strength, as you hold the weight that you're using. You can do wrist-strengthening with bands, hand-weights, or other household items.Hand weights:
Grip a small amount of weight (3 to 5 pounds) in each hand, your palm facing toward the ground. Flex your elbow up so your arm comes out straight, letting your wrist hang down. Flex your wrist slowly, making your arm straight. Then let it back down slowly. Do three sets of 10 to 15 reps with each hand. If you don't have hand-weights, use cans of soup, bricks, or any other hand-sized objects.

Exercise bands:
Stand on one end of the band and grip the band with your hand, palm facing down. Lift your arm until it comes out straight, then flex your wrist slowly as you grip the band, making your arm straight. Do three sets of 10 to 15 reps with each hand.

, If you're in relatively good shape but still struggle with slightly fatty fingers, start doing more advanced push-ups. Instead of doing push-ups with your palms flat on the floor, do them with your palms raised and your weight on your fingertips. Shoot for doing a few sets of 5 to 10 reps.


Do a couple more sets of regular push-ups in addition to your fingertip push-ups. Push-ups help to strengthen your wrists and your pectorals, both good for all-around upper body strength and weight loss.

, Dexterity is your ability to use your fingers and hands to perform complex tasks quickly. It's just as important to hand health as strength. To work on your fine motor skills, you can exercise your dexterity, doing hand and finger-oriented tasks on a regular basis.


How many words a minute can you type? If you're still hunting and pecking, check out this wikiHow article to learn more about typing more comfortably.
Playing an instrument, especially piano, violin, or guitar, but also certain woodwinds like flute, clarinet, and other instruments, are all excellent for working on your fine motor skills. Never learned? Good time to start.

, There's some debate about whether or not cracking your knuckles is harmless or harmful. Many people, however, think that cracking knuckles leads to ""fat"" knuckles. Since there's little to be gained from cracking your knuckles, it can't hurt to stop.


While there's no data to suggest that cracking your knuckles causes arthritis or significant knuckle swelling, some research seems to suggest a connection between long-term knuckle-cracking and decreased grip strength., Excess sodium can cause water retention, which results in mild swelling, specifically in the hands and feet. If you want slimmer hands, cut the salt from your diet. The less salt you consume, the less water weight you will retain.



Check those nutrition labels!
Eating less salt doesn't just mean dumping less salt onto the food you eat. Many packaged and frozen foods, even vegetables and sweet snacks, are extremely high in sodium. You can eat a lot of salt without even realizing it.
Pay attention to the serving sizes as well. Many ""Reduced Salt"" or ""Reduced Sodium"" options are basically the same product with a manipulated serving size, to reduce the sodium content per serving.

, Staying hydrated helps to rid your body of salt more quickly. Drinking eight glasses, or up to two liters of water each day is essential for all-around health and weight loss. Drinking extra water can help suppress your appetite, prevent headaches, and aid your circulation and waste management.And it's free.

, Mushrooms have less than half the calories and fat compared to even the leanest beef, and a recent study reports that people who substitute mushrooms for beef in recipes are just as satisfied after meals.It's a healthy, delicious, and easy switch.


Check out this wikiHow article to learn more about cooking with mushrooms.

, Carbs come in two forms: simple and complex. Simple carbs, those found in processed foods high-fat snacks, are processed into fat much more quickly and many people experience bloating from ingesting these kinds of carbs. Simple carbs include things like corn syrup, white sugar, candy, and soda. Complex carbohydrates, found in whole grains, take longer to move through your system, and they supply your body with more nourishment and energy.Complex carbs include things like:


Oatmeal.
Sweet potato.
Whole grain breads and pastas.
Beans and lentils.
Leafy green vegetables.

, You can gain lots of extra weight from eating unhealthy between-meal snacks. While a handful of potato chips may seem harmless, it's so much easier to replace meaningless junk food snacks with healthier options. Dump the snack cakes and chips and keep fresh fruits and vegetables around, so you won't have the choice.


Have an apple. Apples are low in calories and high in fiber.Don't skip dessert, but make your dessert a bit healthier. For example, instead of having a bowl of after-dinner ice cream, switch to a cup of low-fat Greek yoghurt and frozen blueberries. Or, if you love a piece of chocolate cake every now and then, then keep an antioxidant-rich dark chocolate bar around, and eat a square (just one) when you get a chocolate craving.

, Research suggests that one of the best ways to curb your hunger cravings is to chew more and eat more slowly.If you struggle with overeating, slow down and wait for your body to catch up.


Start your meal with a small cup of broth-based soup, or eat a small handful of unsalted almonds 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. This has been shown to reduce the amount of food you consume in the subsequent meal.

Don't skip meals.
Some studies show that skipping meals, especially breakfast, forces the body to store the calories you consume later in the day more quickly. In other words, skipping breakfast makes you gain weight., Going on walks is the easiest and cheapest way to get more exercise and start losing weight. You don't need any gear, you don't need much time, and you'll get out of it exactly what you put into it.


Start with brisk walks around the neighborhood and slowly expand your walking range. Try for a mile at first, or time it out to walk at a quick clip for 15 to 20 minutes, twice a day.
If you're not a big fan of exercise routines, don't treat it like exercise. Just treat it like you're going for a walk. Cue up an audiobook or some new tunes in your headphones.

, If you want to add some more intensity to your workouts, start doing some gentle cardio to prepare your body. Get your heartbeat up and keep it up. Whether you want to sign up for a class or find a series of workouts online, consider any of the following cardio and fitness routines:



Yoga.

Pilates.
Spin class.
Dance aerobics.
Water aerobics.
Not everyone will be up to doing heavy cardio, like the kind you might encounter in a spin class or other aerobics routines. Talk to your doctor to develop a weight loss plan for you.

, Plateaus happen regularly. If you start losing weight at an even clip, then suddenly stop, it's time to change up your workouts. This happens to almost everyone.


Try switching to a circuit-training regimen. Pick 5 to 10 quick exercises you enjoy and do high-intensity sets for 40 to 60 seconds, during which you do as many reps as you can. Rest for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next exercise.
Do three full sets of your 5 to 10 exercises, with a short five minute rest in between. If you do this routine three times a week while you eat healthy, you'll be dropping pounds fast.

, Stress produces cortisol, which is connected to a variety of ailments, including increased body fat.High periods of stress can make it much more difficult for your body to shed pounds, which means you need to learn to relax if you want to drop some pounds.


Make your mental health as much of a priority as your physical health. Take 15 to 30 minutes every day to just sit quietly and Zen-out. Don't feel guilty for needing a little you-time.
Take hot baths, read good books, or listen to quiet music. Whatever chills you out, do it.

, Nobody likes to hear this, but it's the scientific truth: It's impossible to pick a spot on your body and reduce the fat there without reducing the fat everywhere else.You can work out specific areas to build muscle there, and hand exercises will help you strengthen your wrists, hands, and fingers, but there's little muscle in your hands in the first place. The only way to lose the fat in between your fingers is to change your diet, exercise, and burn more calories than you consume, to lose weight from the rest of your body.

If you are constantly thinking about your new way of eating as a diet plan, it can be more difficult for you to stay dedicated to the nutrition and the weight won't stay away for good. Try to shift the way you see your new routine from a diet and exercise routine you have to do to an active lifestyle with healthy nutrition that is just your new way of life.


Instead of thinking about all the food you can't have, find and incorporate some healthier versions of your favorite foods into your routine. This way, you will feel like you are treating yourself and you won't be tempted to cheat.;
, One of the first things you need to do when starting a weight loss plan is get rid of all the bad food in your house.

Focus on strength training.,
Incorporate cardio.,
Try HIIT.,
Start going to classes.,
Do it when you can.",How to Lose Weight for Good2," One of the best ways to burn fat and stay fit is through strength training. For every pound of muscle you gain, you burn more calories per day. After a good strength training exercise, you continue to burn calories for days after you are done while your body works to replenish the energy it burned and repair the muscles it worked. It also makes you healthier overall by helping bone density, blood pressure, heart health, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels, and blood flow. Your improved body functions will help you keep the weight off.


The best way to see the most results in weight training is to do circuit training. To do this, choose 5 exercises and repeat them 8-12 times or 20-30 seconds each. Do the whole circuit 3 to 4 times. You can mix and match the exercises, choosing between stationary lunges, walking lunges, body weight squats, push ups, sit ups, planks, plank ups, jumping jacks, dumbbell rows, deadlifts, pull ups, and bicycles, just to name a few. Any strength building exercise would work in this routine.Don't rush through these exercises. You want to make sure that your form is solid and that you are engaging your muscles as you do them. Don't let momentum help you to do the exercises. Also remember to breathe as you do the reps.
You should do strength training three times a week, with a rest day in between each day of training. This gives you maximum results and your body time to heal. On the off days, do cardio exercises., Although strength training does get your heart rate up, you still need to incorporate a few days of cardio workouts into your weekly routine. It helps you burn calories and increases endurance, heart health, and overall fitness. This will help you feel better and burn more calories on a daily basis.


One of the best cardio exercises is running. It is really tough for some people, though others are natural runners. If you can't run for a long time at first, work up to it through intervals with programs such as Couch to 5K. You can go at your own pace and work up to running for longer periods of time. Over time, this will help you keep your weight off.If you hate to run or have bad knees or other injuries, try lower impact cardio such as elliptical or spin machines. Elliptical machines work much like running on a treadmill, but it decreases the impact by making it a continual motion with no impact involved. Spin, which is intense stationary cycling, also decreases the stress put on your legs by running. Try to find a spin class at the local gym. These workouts are intense but fun, incorporating music with high intensity cardio.
One of the best cardio motivators is good music. If you find yourself struggling to keep going, put some songs on your phone or music player that make you feel happy, energetic, and strong. Listening to them will make you want to work out longer and harder. Eventually, cardio will become part of your weekly routine, which will help you keep your weight off., If you want something a little more advanced for both cardio and strength training, try high intensity interval training (HIIT), which is the alternation of intervals of high intensity with moderate to low intensity, usually done in a 1-2 ratio. It burns more fat. It also keeps burning fat after you work out because the intervals jumpstart your metabolism and you burn calories for up to 24 hours after you work out.


For cardio, start with a 3-5 minute warm up. Then, sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds and then walk or slow jog for 60 seconds. Do 5-10 cycles of this, then cool down for 3-5 minutes. You want to get your heart rate way up with the sprints and then get it lower with your moderate to low intensity interval. You can also go up in your time as you get better, to 60 seconds sprinting and 120 seconds walking or jogging.For strength training, the ratios are flipped because the intensity is not as extreme. Start with a 3-5 minute warm up. Then, do eight rounds each of 20 seconds intense, 10 seconds rest intervals of the exercises such as squats, jumping jacks, lunges, planks, plank ups, push ups, sit ups, bicycles, skaters, and high knees. Since you want to hit around 30 minutes of intense routine time, choose 8 exercises to run through the intervals. You can change up these exercises and do whichever you think will help the areas you are trying to strengthen.There are many HIIT channels for free on YouTube, such as Fitness Blender and Body Rocker.

, It can be really difficult to motivate yourself to workout if you have to work out alone. Check into your local gym and see if they have classes that fit into your schedule. Many gyms offer weight training classes, cardio classes, as well as classes that mix the two. Find the kind of class that works for you so you will be excited about going to it. Try to fit two or three into your schedule each week to help you lose and keep your weight off.


If you like weight training, find a class like power, body combat, or other strength training focused classes. They make up routines for you and make it fun by putting them to music.
If you like dancing, try a class like zumba. It is a great mixture of cardio and muscle toning that is also really fun to do., If you find that you have a really tough schedule that doesn't leave much room for a ton of exercise, try to incorporate as much as you can at intervals throughout the day. Take a fifteen minute walk around the block, do a few sets of push ups, squats, lunges, or sit ups when you have a few minutes free. If you slowly start integrating it into your routine, it will help you burn more calories.


Only do this on really busy days. You should still try to work out on a regular basis, but this method works on those days that are just too busy to fit a 45 minute routine into your day.Make it a group endeavor to help you stick to it. Instead of going out for food or drinks with your friends or colleagues after work, go work out at the gym or for a walk or run at the local track. This will allow you to keep your time with your friends but will help all of you be healthier and lose weight."

Eat a sensible breakfast.,
Have balanced lunches and dinners.,
Make healthy snacks.,
Eat more vegetables.,
Avoid fat-free options.,
Cut out calorie heavy drinks.,
Stop eating out.,
Ditch junk food.,
Eat foods you love in moderation.",How to Lose Weight for Good3," One of the worst things you can do for weight loss is skip breakfast. If you eat early in the morning when you wake up, your metabolism will start working as soon as you get up. If you skip breakfast, your body goes into starvation mode and will stop burning fat as you expend calories during the morning. Plus, you will be less likely to give in to the temptation to snack throughout the day. Eat a sensible breakfast with protein, fruits, and whole grains to decrease your appetite throughout the day and help your metabolism work better.Have a piece of whole wheat or whole grain bread with some peanut or almond butter and a piece of fruit. You can also make it into a peanut butter and banana or apple sandwich. This meal has plenty of protein and whole grains to keep you full throughout the morning.Try half a cup of old fashioned oatmeal with a tablespoon of nuts and a half a cup of fruit. Microwave the fruit to warm it and mix it and the nuts into the oatmeal once you've cooked it. Use combinations like strawberries and almonds or bananas and walnuts.This gives you a hearty breakfast that will keep you full longer. It also has just the right amount of sweetness to satiate your sweet tooth.
If you don't like oatmeal, try an egg white omelette with spinach, tomato, and avocado. Mix 1/4 cup spinach into the omelette and have some cherry tomatoes and fourth of an avocado on the side. This has plenty of protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients that will sustain you throughout the day.

, If you have balanced lunches and dinners, you are less likely to overeat throughout the day, which will help you keep your weight off. Combine protein rich foods such as fish, chicken, other lean meats, beans, nuts, and tofu with fiber rich foods such as whole grains and vegetables to fill yourself up with every meal. The two components work together to keep you satisfied and fuller for longer periods of time.


For lunch, try a salmon salad with sauteed salmon, spinach, pecans, tomatoes, and feta cheese. You can also try chicken salad made with Greek yogurt, nuts, and grapes in half of a whole-wheat pita.
For dinner, try a fillet of tilapia sauteed with tomatoes and dill with a side of roasted broccoli, a portion of great northern beans, and sauteed green beans. You can also try baked tofu with chickpeas, kale chips, and roasted brussel sprouts.
Avoid foods with a lot of carbohydrates and sugars. Pasta, rice, and other starchy carbs will keep the pounds on you or pack them back on. Eat grains such as brown rice or quinoa if you want these foods in your diet.
Also focus on portions. You don't want your plate overrun with too much food or too many calories. Make sure half your plate is full of vegetables and avoid large helpings., Eating a small snack between meals will help you eat less during your meals and keep you from overeating. Snacks are typically eaten between each meal and between dinner and bed. Try to aim for two snacks a day during the times that you find yourself getting the most hungry. For example, if you find yourself getting hungry between lunch and dinner and between dinner and bed, have your snacks then. If you are hungry between breakfast and lunch and between dinner and bed, eat then. Just make sure they are small and healthy snacks, not full meals.


Try eating a tablespoon or two of almond butter with an apple or carrot sticks or a small wrap or half sandwich with a fourth a cup of chicken salad made with Greek yogurt and grapes. The protein will fight off hunger and the sweetness will help keep you satisfied.

, Vegetables are essential to any healthy lifestyle and will help you keep the weight off. Vegetables like kale, spinach, squash, avocado, beets, turnips, and carrots are full of fiber, potassium, and essential vitamins and nutrients that will help you stay healthy and lose weight. This will also help you eat less meat and carbohydrates such as pasta, which are full of fat and calories. Incorporate them into two to three of your meals as well as your snacks. The added fiber and other nutrients will help you get full faster, which will help you eat less and lose weight. Plus, you will be healthier overall.


In meals that you love such as pizza, instead of adding tons of cheese or pepperoni, try adding more veggies such as spinach, peppers, artichokes, tomatoes, or broccoli. Also switch to whole wheat crust. The veggies and crust taste great on the pizza and will actually fill you up faster, which will help you eat less and lose more weight.For a snack, have carrots with a tablespoon of hummus or peanut butter. The carrots are great for dipping and they taste great with both of these spreads. Plus, the fiber and protein in the snack will cut your cravings fast.
Instead of french fries, try some veggie fries instead. Try roasting other root veggies such as beets, squash, and turnips for dinner. Cut them into strips, sprinkle them with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt, and cook them in the oven. They are a much healthier option than potatoes and will fill you up faster.
Opt for dark leafy greens such as kale, mustard greens or spinach instead of lettuce. These dark green leaves are rich in antioxidants as well as vitamins A, C, E and K. They also have tons of fiber to keep your feeling full and satisfied longer.If you love pasta, substitute zucchini or spaghetti squash for your noodles. They have a similar texture and consistency as pasta but with much fewer calories and carbohydrates and many more hunger and fat fighting nutrients. Simply cut your zucchini into thin strips either by hand or with a vegetable cutter. The spaghetti squash comes out of the rind in tendrils that look like spaghetti, which is where it got its name. Sauté the vegetables in a pan with a little bit of water until they are cooked. Then add the rest of your ingredients like you normally would for a great and healthy Italian dinner.

, While eating meat and oils that are lower in fat is good for you, avoid buying fat-free products, particularly dairy-derived products other than milk. The natural fats that appear in foods actually help you stay fuller longer. Plus, when the fat is removed from products like yogurt, manufacturers typically incorporate additives, such as excess sugar, that are less nutritious. In the long run, the extra fat will actually help you eat less and keep your weight off.


Try to buy lite options of dairy products instead. The only difference is that these are typically made with 2% milk instead of whole. These products don't have additives and still have hunger fighting fats, but they have less fat overall., Drinks can be a hidden source of extra calories in your everyday life. If you drink sugary sodas, you add a few hundred calories to your diet per can. Instead, substitute water for soda and regular coffee or hot tea for your latte. Even natural choices such as fruit juices pack tons of sugar. Opt for a piece of whole fruit instead, which provides valuable fiber.If you want to add something to your coffee, add some 2% or skim milk instead of cream. If you like sweetener, substitute all natural, no calorie sweeteners such as stevia or monk fruit.
If you like the carbonation of sodas, try seltzer water. You get the carbonation of soda without the sugar and artificial ingredients.

, One of the worst things for weight loss is eating out. The ingredients and calorie content are hard to control, so you can end up eating way too many calories without realizing. Try to cook at home as much as possible. This way, you can control what kinds of foods you are eating and keep the nutrition balance.


If you have to eat out, try grilled meat options with vegetables or salads with minimal or no dressing. Also pay attention to portion sizes. Split a portion if it seems like it is larger than necessary for one person.
Steer clear of pasta, fatty meats, and fried foods. These are full of calories and lack nutrients that will help you stay fuller longer., When you are at the grocery store, avoid picking up any junk food such as chips, candy, or heavy desserts. If you don't have them in your house, you won't be tempted to splurge on them in a moment of weakness. Instead, buy healthy options for snacking, such as nuts, peanut or almond butter, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, raisins, or dark chocolate.


Try making a trail mix with unsalted almonds, raisins or dried apricots, dark chocolate morsels, and all natural granola. The mixture has sweet and savory elements and is packed with hunger fighting nutrients., There are certain foods that all of us love that aren't the most healthy. Instead of cutting out these foods forever, allow yourself to have them every once in a while to maintain a sense of balance. Try not to use food to reward yourself for hitting a certain weight or dieting goal, but go ahead and have a slice of cake on your birthday.

Eating whole fruits and vegetables including raspberries, kale, squash, blueberries, pineapple or peppers can help you get your daily allowances.Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber, which can also help you lose weight.Vary your fruit and vegetable selections at each meal. This ensures that you get a range of nutrients to help you lose weight and stay healthy. For example, have an orange with breakfast, a cup of blueberries at lunch, and some apples sprinkled with cinnamon for dessert. You could also have a spinach and tomato omelet for breakfast; a salad with kale, beets, carrots, and cucumbers for lunch; and steamed broccoli and cauliflower with dinner.
Consider steaming vegetables if they are difficult to digest when raw.
You can also count a cup of 100% fruit or vegetable juice toward your daily total. Juices lack the fiber that is found in whole foods, however, so try limiting to one serving of juice per day and make the rest of your servings from whole fruits and vegetables.;
, You should eat between 5 – 8 ounces (140 – 227 g) of grains daily. At least one half of your daily intake should be whole grains. You can get whole grains from foods such as whole wheat pasta or bread, brown rice, oatmeal, or fortified cereals.Eating grains can provide you fiber and other vital nutrients, which may aid slowing digestion after 40.Limit how many refined grains you eat, which can cause spikes in blood sugar and contribute to weight gain. Examples of refined grains include: white pasta, white bread, pre-packaged baked goods, and white rice.

, Adults should consume about 0.36 grams protein for each pound of bodyweight (or 0.8 grams per Kg of bodyweight). Those involved in resistance training or more active adults should consume more. Protein builds and maintains muscle. Increased muscle mass boosts your metabolism, which can help you lose weight.Try protein from lean meats, dairy, beans and legumes, and nut butters such as:Beef
Pork
Poultry
Cooked beans
Eggs
Peanut or almond butter
Nuts and seeds

, Adults need 2 – 3 cups (480-620 ml), or 12 oz., of dairy each day.Dairy is high in protein and can build and maintain strong bones and muscles, which get weaker as an individual ages. In turn, this may help you lose weight.Excellent choices of dairy products include:Cheese
Yogurt
Milk
Soymilk

, Foods that are lacking nutrients, high in fat and calories, or that are heavily processed can be pitfalls if you’re trying to lose weight. Avoiding unhealthy or junk and processed foods can help you lose weight.Foods such as potato chips, pizza, nachos, cookies, and cake may undermine your attempts to lose weight.


Avoid starchy, refined carbs such as white bread, white crackers, white pasta, white rice, and pre-packaged baked goods as much as you can. Refined carbs can increase your blood sugar and may lead to weight gain.Check for hidden sugar in your food choices. Your ability to taste reduces with age. This can make it difficult to detect sugar in your food choices, which promotes weight gain. Read packaging for terms that mean sugar. These include corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, or maltose.
Recognize that mass-processed foods are often high in sodium, too much of which can make you gain water weight, which can negatively affect blood pressure. Your sense of taste decreases as you age, and you may crave salt on your food. Consider alternative seasonings such as garlic or herbs. These can help you from gaining water weight.

, You might be excited to lose weight through diet, but it’s important to make changes slowly. This may help you stick to a healthy eating plan and avoid cravings for foods that may cause weight gain.


Replace processed foods. For example, if you eat white rice, try brown rice. You can also slowly replace rice with vegetables.
Let yourself cheat occasionally, which shouldn’t affect your weight. This helps you stick to your diet. Accept mistakes or cheat days and keep moving forward. Having one cheat day every week won’t throw off your weight loss plan — but don't consider this a day to binge. Just allow yourself to indulge a little., Having a weekly meal plan can keep you on track with eating healthy and losing weight. It also minimizes the risk of not getting enough nutrients to promote health and weight loss.For example, plan a healthy breakfast to get your day off to a good start. Pack yourself lunch if you don’t have a lunch meeting. If you have a lunch meeting, order salads and other dishes not laden with heavy sauces.


To help you plan meals that will support your goal of losing weight, take some time to determine your current daily calorie intake (try writing down everything you eat or using a calorie-counting app like MyFitnessPal), then make sure you are eating 500 fewer calories each day. This will allow you to lose 1 to 2 pounds each week, which is considered a safe rate for weight loss.
Dining out can also set back your weight loss. Avoiding processed, high fat, and calorie-loaded dishes can keep you on track.You should also avoid calorie bombs including buffets, breadbaskets, fried foods, or dishes in heavy sauces such as fettuccine Alfredo. Instead, choose dishes such as salads, steamed vegetables, steaks, and grilled meats and veggies. Choose a cup of whole fruits for dessert.

, Regular low-impact, moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise can help you lose weight, especially when combined with a sensible diet. Talk to your doctor or a fitness professional before beginning any exercise or physical activity regimen.


Choose activities such as walking, swimming, jogging or running, rowing, biking, or using an elliptical machine. Remember that fun activities such as scuba diving, kayaking, or even jumping on a small trampoline count towards your 30 minutes.Aim to do at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise all or most days of the week. Split exercise sessions into two 15 minute blocks if you are not able to move for 30 consecutive minutes.If you are very active, you can continue these workouts with your doctor’s approval., Muscle mass boosts your metabolism, which slows down as you age. Strength training may help you lose excess weight, as you will burn more calories.Strength-training can also prevent age-related diseases such as osteoporosis and prevent you from injuring yourself.Consult with your doctor and a trainer before starting any strength training program. Each person can suggest the safest way to strength train for weight loss over 40.
Focus on strengthening your whole body. You can do this by combining specific exercises together into one movement or selecting moves that target your largest muscle groups, such as weighted squats.Use resistance bands if weights are too heavy., It’s important to listen to your body when you do cardiovascular activity, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. Checking for signals such as thirst, fatigue, and pain can prevent more serious problems. It can also help your weight loss program: improper rest or working out too much and eating too little can derail your hard efforts.


Let yourself rest if you feel tired. Rest is an important part of losing weight and staying healthy.You may find that you don’t have as much energy as you get older.Stop any activity if you are dizzy or have a headache, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or uneven and rapid heartbeat., You may want to lose a bit of weight to promote your overall health and wellbeing after 40. Before starting any dietary changes or fitness programs, ask your doctor if this is safe for you. Some activities or foods may not be the best choices for you.Talk to your doctor about what activities are safe for you. Your doctor may suggest you be cautious if you have heart and lung problems or high blood pressure.
Recognize that depression may affect your appetite and diet. If you have symptoms of depression, speak to your doctor about how best to treat both conditions and lose weight.Talk to your doctor if you think medication may play a role in your weight gain. Some medications can change your sense of taste. This may make you crave more sugar or salt, which contribute to weight gain.

, If you want to lose weight, changing your diet is one of the most effective ways. Slowed digestion and metabolism after 40 makes it more difficult to lose weight.Meeting a registered dietician can ensure you make wiser food choices while getting the vitamins and nutrients you need for your health.Recognize that your metabolism slows down every year after the age of 40. This may cause weight gain if you eat the same amount of food.Your ability to digest also decreases after 40, making it hard to process vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients including folic acid.
Finding healthy choices on a budget may be difficult. A dietician can suggest sensible and healthy choices on the cheap.
Ask your doctor or medical professional to suggest a registered dietician who can help you lose weight and promote your overall wellbeing., Many people do physical activity to lose weight. If you are new to exercise or want to continue a current regimen, consult a certified trainer once your doctor gives you the green light. A trainer can tailor a safe exercise program to help you lose weight. Exercise can strengthen your bones and muscles as well as protect you from falls, muscle tears, or bone breaks.The benefits of regular exercise include:


Preventing and/or controlling chronic health issues such as diabetes
Maintaining and/or improving brain function,
Losing weight
Warding off age-related conditions such as osteoporosis or diabetes."

You shouldn’t need too much coordination.,
It shouldn't hurt!,
Outdoor sprinting: An option for seasoned exercisers, outdoor sprinting is a very intense workout that works great for fat loss.,
Swimming: This exercise not only uses nearly every muscle you have, it’s very low impact.

,
Instead of just doing one type of cardio exercise, try alternating through all of them.",How to Lose Fat With the Right Cardio Equipment and Exercises," Your focus shouldn’t have to be on balancing or maintaining a good form on the piece of equipment, it should simply be on doing the exercise. By choosing a simpler machine, your focus can be on maintaining a high level of intensity required for fat loss, and not on surviving the session!;
, Yet... You want to choose a machine that keeps joints and tissues healthy and strong, promoting fitness; not one that puts you at risk of injury. No matter how much you want to get fit, you’ll hit a major obstacle if you get injured. Keeping those things in mind, these are your best bets to start:


Upright stationary bike: You can easily focus your energy on maximizing intensity because this machine is so easy to use. The machine is low impact, too, so it’s easier on your joints. For fat loss purposes, the ""uphill/downhill"" interval program will definitely work you over!
Recumbent bike: This machine is just as easy at the upright bike, low-impact and simple. The recumbent bike is actually better to use than the upright stationary bike if you have lower back problems.
Treadmill: If you like running, but you’re worried about injuring your knees, the treadmill is a good alternative. The treadmill was designed to have a less-intense impact on your joints compared to concrete or other outdoor options. To increase the intensity, increase the incline on the machine, and/or the speed of it. Be careful with that, though; it's only funny when other people fall off!
Stairclimber: This low-impact machine provides an intense workout without putting your joints at risk. Avoid leaning on the handles because it lessens the amount of effort you have to put into it.
Rowing: This is a somewhat more complicated machine, as you have to coordinate your upper and lower body movements to do it right. While you can do an interval workout on it, you might not be as focused as you concentrate on form. You should also avoid it if you have lower back problems. They offer cardio and resistance training benefits in the one routine.
Elliptical: This is a great machine if you have knee issues. If your knees are OK, then choose another machine that will work you harder.


Whatever machine you choose, program it with the aforementioned interval principle in mind. If you’re not able to use one of the above exercises, there are some other ones to choose from.







, In fact, 'wind sprints' are probably the inspiration for interval training in cardio. If you consider the different physiques of sprinters and marathoners you'll have an idea of the benefits of intervals vs steady-state training. Outdoor sprinting can provide fantastic fat loss and muscle building results, but it’s very easy to get injured doing so. Because it’s a high-impact workout, it causes a lot of stress on your joints so be careful in using this method. Invest in good running shoes, too, if you plan on doing this.

,, Do different workouts during the week – one on the treadmill, one on the bike and one on the rowing machine, perhaps. Or try something new from one week to the next. Doing this will stop you from getting bored and will help you work all your muscle groups as well. The more muscle you build throughout your body, the faster your metabolism is likely to be and the better your body will lose fat and maintain muscle."

Let your body rest.",How to Lose Weight with Coffee," A little bit of coffee goes a long way. It can temporarily suppress your appetite and may stimulate minimal calorie burning. But excessive coffee consumption can lead to increased stress levels and insomnia, both of which can lead to overeating. Just 1 or 2 cups of fully-caffeinated coffee per day may be enough to help you lose weight. In total, you should have no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.This is the equivalent of four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola, or two “energy shot” drinks.Keep in mind that plain coffee is your best bet in terms of losing weight. One cup of black coffee has only 2 calories and no fat.Beverages like soda and energy drinks may be high in calories or have hidden sugar that can hinder your weight loss.;
, If you want to reap the most weight-loss benefits from drinking coffee, consider spacing out your intake throughout the day. Not only can this give you an added boost at work or during exercise, but may also suppress food cravings.


Stick to the daily limits as much as possible. For example, if you can safely drink 4 cups of coffee per day, you could have a cup in the morning, one at lunch, one mid-afternoon and a cup at dinner. Adjust the schedule to see what works best for you.

, If you want to drink more coffee throughout your day, try switching to a mixture of full and decaffeinated beans, often called half-caff. This will allow you to safely drink coffee up to eight times a day and may help you more effectively lose weight.


Make sure to read product labels to ensure you’re getting half-caffeinated coffee. The label may also indicate how much caffeine is in a cup. So long as you’re staying within the safe consumption limits every day, you can have as many cups of half-caff as you like.
Make your own half-caff by mixing one half cup of regular coffee with one half cup of decaf coffee. Another trick is to drink a half a cup of regular coffee with a half a cup of hot water.
If you use a Keurig, just leave the K-cup in the Keurig, and brew it again using the same K-cup.

, One of coffee's positive attributes is its ability to suppress your appetite.Try drinking some coffee if you find yourself craving food or going for seconds at meals. This may reduce your cravings until a meal or to get you through a long meal.


Consider having decaf or half-caf if you don’t want to drink a full cup of coffee or its close to your bedtime. You should avoid caffeine within four to six hours of your bedtime if possible. Drinking coffee too close to your bedtime can interrupt your sleep and promote weight gain., Although coffee can act as a diuretic, it won’t cause dehydration.But drinking coffee and water together throughout the day may help you stay fuller longer and avoid the temptation of eating. In addition, it can prevent you from drinking too much coffee and disrupting your sleep.Aim to get 3 liters of water a day if you are a man and 2.2 if you are a woman.Water is important to hydrate you, but hunger may also signal thirst instead of a need for food., Coffee may stimulate thermogenesis, which is a way the body makes heat and energy from digesting food. It can result in the loss of some extra calories.By sipping coffee in conjunction with a workout, you may help your body burn more calories and fat.Drink about 200 mg of caffeine from coffee for optimal results with a workout. This would be the equivalent of a medium Americano or small regular brewed coffee from a place like Starbucks.

, Specialty coffee products and coffees taste great, but they can come with unnecessary extra calories or fat and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. In addition, anything you put in your coffee like cream or sugar will increase the calorie content of your coffee. Reading the labels of any coffee products you purchase can help you stay away from coffee that may hinder your ability to lose weight.Remember that with weight loss, every calorie counts, even if it is in liquid form.

, Coffee only has two calories per cup. Adding cream and sugar to your coffee can significantly increase the caloric content. If you cannot drink black coffee, use skim milk and sugar-free sweeteners instead.Be aware that heavy whipping cream and half-and-half have 52 and 20 calories per tablespoon respectively. They also have a lot of fat. Table sugar has 49 calories per tablespoon. Adding just one tablespoon of each adds about 100 empty calories. If you usually add more, that can easily end up adding calories that promote weight gain.
Eliminate butter if you add butter (as with bulletproof coffee). One tablespoon of butter is 102 calories and has almost 12 grams of fat. Both of these can keep you from losing weight. Try switching to a skim milk or heartier unsweetened nut milk like coconut for richer flavor.Make sure to get unsweetened creamers and milks. Flavored milks often use sugar or other additives that add empty calories. Reading the nutrition information on the products can help you figure out how many calories each serving of a given product has.Consider drinking iced coffee if the taste of plain black coffee is too strong. It often has a milder taste. Just make sure it’s not sweetened with sugar.
Add flavors to your regular coffee. Sprinkling in some cinnamon, plain cacao, or honey can sweeten coffee and help you enjoy the taste more., Many cafes and coffee shops offer tasty specialty coffees that come in alluring flavors such as pumpkin spice or mint mocha. But these drinks are often more like desserts that have hundreds of calories and added fat each. If you’re trying to lose weight, stick to simple brewed coffee and allow yourself an occasional treat.Read the nutrition information before you get specialty coffees. If it is not posted, ask the manager for a listing of products and their nutritional information.

, Remember that it’s occasionally acceptable to splurge and have a specialty coffee beverage; however, if you really want a specialty beverage and want to avoid calories, consider alternative additions to reduce the calories.Order the smallest size possible and ask for sugar-free syrup, skim milk, and artificial sweetener instead of regular options. Tell the barista, or person making the coffee, to skip the whipped cream on top of your coffee. All of these together can help you save a lot of empty calories., Your diet plays a considerable role in how much weight you lose. Having three balanced and healthy meals every day can help you shed weight and burn excess fat. Whole foods that are high in vitamins and minerals, complex carbohydrates, and moderate amounts of fat can promote your well being and help you lose weight.


Subtracting 500 – 1,000 calories per day from your current intake is a good rule of thumb to follow when cutting calories. Remember that you shouldn’t go below 1,200 calories a day or you may not see any results (because your body thinks you are starving and is conserving energy and fat) and you will also be miserable because you’re not getting enough to eat. If you want to know an exact number, the National Institutes of Health has devised a new tool that can help you specifically pinpoint how many calories you need every day in order to lose weight. There are many different sites at which you can access this calculator including http://www.healthyweightforum.org/eng/calculators/calories-required/ and https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/bwp/index.html.
Incorporate different foods from the five food groups into your daily meals and snacks. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Make sure to vary your choices so that you get a range of nutrients to promote your health and weight loss. Healthy foods often also have a lot of fiber, which can help keep you full throughout the day.Eat whole fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, blueberries, broccoli and carrots. Get your whole grains from foods like whole wheat pasta or bread, oatmeal, brown rice or cereal. For protein, eat lean cuts of meat like pork or poultry as well as cooked beans, eggs, or peanut butter. Your dairy will come from sources like cheese, yogurt, cow and nut milks, and even ice cream.

, It might taste great, but junk food is a dieter’s worst enemy. Unhealthy foods are often loaded with fat and calories that can keep you from losing weight.Avoid starchy foods made out of refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, rice, and baked goods. Not eating these foods or replacing them with whole wheat versions can help keep you full and lose weight.Read labels for hidden sugar in your food choices. Look for words such as corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, or maltose, which are types of sugars. Any word that ends in ""ose"" is a sugar.

, Eating healthy is not something you do for a few weeks, but for your lifetime. This can help you lose and keep off the weight. You might be excited to overhaul your diet, but doing so gradually can keep you from going back to bad habits.


Consider beginning by replacing processed foods or junk food. For example, try brown rice with meals instead of white rice. You can also add more vegetables to your plate than rice. You could also make air-popped popcorn or bake kale chips instead of having potato chips.
Let yourself cheat once a week or if you reach a certain goal. Cheat days can prevent cravings and overindulgence., Having meal plans keeps you from easily falling back into bad eating habits.It can make it easier to make sure you are getting sufficient calories and nutrients without going over your calories for the day.


Plan three meals and two snacks every day. Vary the types of food at each meal. For example, have a cup of yogurt with fresh berries, whole wheat toast, and coffee with skim milk for breakfast. Make a salad with different vegetables, grilled chicken, and some hummus for lunch. For dinner, have a family dinner of fish with a small salad and a side of steamed cauliflower. If you want dessert, have some fresh fruit or a sugar-free popsicle.
If you know you will be dining out, include this in your plan. Either look at the restaurant's online menu or call ahead to see what healthy choices they offer. Select a couple of different healthy options from the menu and put those on your plan. Make sure to stay away from buffets, breadbaskets, dishes in heavy sauces, and fried foods. Have an espresso instead of dessert unless it’s too close to your bedtime.

, Combining physical activity with coffee and a healthy diet can help you lose weight sensibly, about 1 – 2 pounds per week. Doing some type of activity five to six days a week can help you more quickly attain your weight loss goals.Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity every week. As a rule of thumb you should try and do at least 30 minutes every day to lose weight. If you can’t do 30 minutes of activity at one time, break it up into manageable sections. For example, you could do two workouts of 15 minutes each.
Choose activities you enjoy such as walking, jogging, swimming, or biking. Remember that team sports or other activities such as jumping on a trampoline or jumping rope count towards your weekly exercise.

, Muscles burn more calories than fat cells, even at rest, so muscles will help you torch calories even while you are sleeping. Adding some simple strength training exercises to your daily activity can help you lose weight more quickly. There is no specific guideline for how long you should strength train, but you should aim to do it at least two days each week.Consider consulting a certified trainer before you start. This person can help you figure out the best strength-training moves for your needs and abilities.
Do exercises that engage your entire body. For example, strengthening exercises such as squats and lunges work on your legs, core, and also your upper body.Try resistance bands if weights seem too heavy.
Practicing regular yoga or Pilates is another way to engage your body’s strength. You can do a yoga or Pilates class by DVD, online, or go to a studio.

, Just like diet and exercise, rest is important to your health. Not getting enough rest can actually cause you to gain weight, too, because your body is more stressed. Getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can reduce and undo any benefits of your other healthy habits.Give yourself at least one full day of rest from exercise per week. This helps your body build muscles and recover from exercise or stress. You might want to pair this with your “cheat day” of eating.
Sleep at least seven hours every night and aim for eight to nine. Take a 30 minute power nap during the day if you feel tired."

Cook with extra-virgin olive oil.,
Enjoy lots of whole grains.,
Eat many fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Make fish your main animal protein.,
Eat lean poultry.,
Include nuts and seeds in your diet.,
Choose low-fat dairy.,
Season your food with herbs.,
Enjoy red wine in moderation, if you’d like.",How to Lose Weight With a Mediterranean Diet1," Losing weight with the Mediterranean diet does not involve avoiding fat entirely, it just involves eating the right type of fat. Extra-virgin olive oil is the fat of choice to use for cooking and dressing foods. This should largely take the place of butter in your diet.Olive oil may even be the key to the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.Believe it or not, studies show that eating a diet containing good fat from olive oil and nuts actually helps people lose more weight than eating a fat-restricted diet.Of course, even good fats contribute to calories, so be mindful about quantity. Fry or sauté vegetables with a tablespoon of olive oil; add more if needed.;
, Whole-grain pasta, bread, rice, quinoa, and cereal are the foundation of this diet.Unlike white bread which contains lots of refined sugar, whole grains contain many nutrients and do not contribute to sugar content of a meal.


Base your meals on whole grains and fresh produce, limiting the size of lean meal portions.
Eat breads with olive oil rather than butter or margarine., Fresh produce is a staple of the Mediterranean diet. Pomegranate, grapes, figs and other orange and purple fruits are delicious and reduce the risk of heart disease. Cantaloupe, peaches, and nectarines contain antioxidants that improve your health and help your body get good natural sugars, minerals, and vitamins from your food. Include green leafy vegetables like kale, broccoli, and spinach in your meals, which are rich in nutrients like Vitamin A, Vitamin K, folate, fiber, potassium, and magnesium.Leafy greens are considered ""super veggies"" because they provide multiple vitamins, minerals, and fiber.Aim for nine servings of fresh fruits and vegetables a day., Include a serving of fish in your meal at least twice per week. Fish is the main source of animal fat and protein in the Mediterranean diet. Unlike red meat, fish hardly contains any saturated fat — but it’s rich in good fat like omega-3’s, which are good for weight loss as well as brain and heart health.The best fish choices are salmon, halibut, albacore tuna, herring, sardines, trout, and mackerel.
Avoid fried fish. Rather bake, broil, sauté, or grill your fish., If you eat poultry like chicken and turkey, keep the serving size to 3 ounces or less.Avoid adding fat content to your meal by frying the poultry; rather bake, broil, steam, or grill it. For the healthiest poultry option, remove the skin before eating it.


Have poultry or eggs several times per week, about every two days.Eat no more then four egg yolks per week, though you can have more egg whites.

, Like olive oil, nuts contain good fats. Almonds, cashews, and walnuts contain protein and fiber, as well.Nuts are high in calories, however, so eat about a handful of nuts a day for health benefits.Beans, lentils, peas, and seeds are also great to add to a dish or as a snack.Avoid salted or candied nuts, which contain extra sugars and fats.
Natural peanut butter and tahini are good additions to your diet., Skip whole milk and opt for 1% or skim milk instead. The same goes for cheese, ice cream, and yogurt.Eat moderate portions of dairy and yogurt regularly — every day, or at least several times per week.Try alternatives to cow’s milk like goat or sheep; alternate cheeses can also be delicious.

, Rather than adding extra salt or butter to your meals for flavor, season your food with herbs and spices.Some great options include basil, parsley, cilantro, mint, rosemary, thyme, sage, chives, dill, and oregano., Red wine is a staple of the Mediterranean diet, and can have some health benefits when enjoyed in moderation. “Moderation” means 5 ounces of wine a day (148 ml) for women and men over the age 65, and 10 ounces (296 ml) a day for men under 65.This is about 1 glass for women and 2 glasses for men. You do not need to start drinking if you don’t already.


Do not drink wine if you have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, cannot limit your intake to moderate use, or have liver or heart disease.When in doubt, talk to your doctor about using alcohol.
Purple grape juice is a good non-alcoholic alternative to wine."
"
Significantly reduce the sugar in your diet.,
Eliminate butter and margarine from your meals.,
Save red meat for special occasions.",How to Lose Weight With a Mediterranean Diet2," Refined sugars come from pastries, cookies, pies, cakes — items from the bakery and snack-food aisle. Refined sugar also shows up in white bread and rice.The Mediterranean diet includes very little to no refined sugar, so aim to eliminate these products from your diet.Switching from white to whole grains is a great step.


Try using natural sweeteners in coffee and cooking like honey, molasses, or agave.

, Replace butter in cooking with olive oil.Put hummus, olive oil, or tahini on bread instead of margarine or butter. Use non-stick cookware so you don’t have to grease with butter. Experiment with recipes that replace butter with healthier alternatives.


For instance, replace butter with applesauce or prune puree in baking recipes., Red meat is rarely included in the Mediterranean diet. Limit red meat consumption to two to three times per month.When you do eat it, be sure to get lean cuts of meat. Keep your meat serving to about the size of a deck of playing cards.Meat is graded by its fat content, with “prime” cuts being the highest in fat. Lower cost cuts of meat have less fat, and are healthier options. Loin and round cuts are good lower-fat selections.Cut visible fat off of meats before cooking, and drain the grease afterwards."

Consult your doctor or dietitian for help, if needed.,
Make meals a social time.,
Cook from scratch.,
Exercise portion control.,
Choose healthy options at restaurants.,
Exchange the wrong foods for the right ones gradually.,
Keep a food journal.",How to Lose Weight With a Mediterranean Diet3," Lots of recipes are available online, but if you want more help creating a diet plan for yourself, talk to your doctor or request a referral to a dietitian.They can help you come up with specific meal plans and recipes tailored to your body and needs.

, Part of the Mediterranean diet is more than what you eat, it’s how you eat. Try to sit down to meals with family and friends at least 2-3 times per week, eat slowly, and — if you’d like — enjoy a glass of red wine.Embracing the culture of leisurely eating can help you identify when you’re full, and taking time to relax and be social can lower stress — both of which help with weight loss and overall health.

, A healthy diet contains almost no frozen, packaged, or pre-processed foods. Avoid the snack-food aisle and anything premade, which usually contain lots of fat, salt, and preservatives. The healthiest meals come from fresh products — fresh produce (or sometimes frozen, but never canned), fresh meats (not pre-prepared), and uncooked grains that you make at home yourself.


Try to make a meal plan at the start of the week and go shopping for fresh ingredients.

, You're not going to lose weight if you’re eating twice as much food as you need, even if you’re sticking to your diet. Consider some basic portions guidelines to keep in mind when preparing, and plating, your meals:A serving size of whole grain pasta (cooked) is half a cup — about the size of a hockey puck. This is about 70 calories.
2/3 cup of cottage cheese is about the size of 4 playing dice. This counts as a serving of dairy or protein, and is about 110 calories (if it’s low-fat cottage cheese).
You get one serving of fat from 1.5 teaspoons of peanut butter — about the size of two dice.
7 whole almonds is around 45 calories, or a fat serving.
A serving of protein (around 110 calories) equals 2 ounces of cooked lean beef, a little smaller than a deck of playing cards. Alternately, 3 ounces of fish (grilled or broiled, not fried), two slices of tofu, or 2.5 ounces of broiled and skinless chicken.
2 cups of raw spinach is about the size of two baseballs — and counts as one vegetable serving; so does a whole red bell pepper. A small apple is a fruit serving.

, Restaurants often cook with a lot of butter and fat to improve how food tastes. Try your best to stick to your Mediterranean diet while eating out. Request that your food be prepared with olive oil instead of butter, ask for sauces and dressings on the side (these usually contain a lot of fat), and start your meal with a salad dressed with olive oil and vinegar.

, It’s hard to completely change your diet overnight. Start by exchanging some of your unhealthy foods for those foods preferred in the Mediterranean diet. You’ll find it easier to stick to a diet if you make changes slowly.


Switch out red meat for fish one to two times per week to start, and gradually increase that amount.
Begin to decrease serving sizes of meat and increase serving sizes of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Try to limit meat to 3 ounces and base the bulk of your meals on grains, produce, and nuts and legumes (lentils, beans, and peas).
Snack on fresh vegetables with a dip like hummus or tahini, instead of eating snack-food aisle junk like potato chips.
Have fresh fruit for dessert instead of pastries. Fruit is sweet and healthy.

, In addition to eating healthier foods, keeping track of your calories is a great way to lose weight while dieting. The average adult needs to eat around 2,000 calories per day.However, to lose weight you have to burn more calories than you eat — so to lose about a pound (0.45kg) per week, aim for 1,500 daily calories or fewer.Read food labels, identify serving sizes, and record what you eat in order to tally calories.


Use a notebook, diary, excel sheet, or wall chart — whatever helps you stay organized.
The best way to lose weight is to have an overall healthy lifestyle. In addition to the Mediterranean diet, try to get at least 30 minutes of heart-pumping exercise at least 5 days per week.

If you don’t have lunch meetings, packing a healthy lunch can help you avoid buying unhealthy fast foods. If you do have a lunch meeting, order the least processed and healthiest food on the menu, such as a salad.

, No person is perfect and sometimes you crave unhealthy foods. Allow yourself occasional cheat days to enjoy junk food or foods you wouldn’t normally eat on your plan.There is increasing evidence that allowing yourself to cheat occasionally and consciously will help you maintain your diet in the long run.Never berate yourself or let mistakes or cheat days derail your overall healthy habits. Setbacks are normal., Eating out can help keep you social and stimulate your mind after 60.But it can also cause a major setback for many diets because of processed, high fat and calorie dishes.

Cut calories.,
Eat enough fiber.,
Avoid sugar.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Drink water.,
Exercise.,
Look for recipes online.",How to Lose Weight on a Vegan Diet1," Losing weight means reducing your calorie intake. Calculate how many calories you eat each day by tracking everything you eat and drink. Then reduce your daily intake by 500 calories. This, along with physical activity, should result in a 1 to 2 lb. weight loss per week, which is considered healthy.

It may be helpful to speak with a Registered Dietitian, as you will need to make sure that reducing your calories doesn't also result in nutritional deficiencies.
Focus on nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods and keep portions in mind.;
, The recommended fiber intake for women is 25 g/day, and 38 g/day for men. This amount of fiber is recommended to keep your digestive system active and moving. It also helps keep you feeling full.Sources of fiber include whole grains, beans, lentils, vegetables and fruits, especially those with rinds like plums, prunes, apricots, apples and nectarines.
This amount of fiber will likely increase the frequency of bowel movements and soften your stool. It also ensures that waste products and toxins don’t stay in your body for very long.
The average daily intake for Americans is 15 g/day, which is far below the recommended level.

, If you are trying to lose weight on a vegan diet, try to limit sugar as much as possible. Cut out processed, sugar-heavy desserts and foods. This may also mean that you limit cane sugar and fruit juice. It doesn’t, however, mean that you have to avoid fruits. Avoid fruit juice because the juice tends to concentrate the sugars.Don't think that just because a food is labeled ""vegan"" it is automatically healthy. Vegan cupcakes, cookies, muffins, cakes, and pies can have just as much fat, sugar, artificial ingredients, and calories as non-vegan desserts.Oreo cookies, for instance, are vegan, but they're certainly not part of a healthy diet.

, Many diets emphasize low fat, but eating healthy fats can help you lose weight. Foods, such as nuts,contain the healthy fats. You want to make sure to get the healthy omega-3 fats, and nuts are a great source of these fats., Keep drinking as much water as you can. This helps flush out your system. It is also important in a vegan diet because it helps allow the fiber to do its job. Try for at least eight to 10 eight ounce glasses of water a day.Another advantage of water is that it keeps you feeling fuller and less hungry.

, The best way to lose weight in a healthy way is to decrease calories and to increase calorie burn by increasing your physical activity. Any kind of aerobic activity will increase weight loss at the same time you are gaining the cardiovascular benefits, along with the benefits for mood, your nervous system, your immune system, your joints, and your muscles.Aim for 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week.


Start by walking more and climbing stairs more often. Take up running, cycling, or swimming. Join a gym and start taking classes. Try running, walking, jogging, dance, tennis, stationary bicycle, or the elliptical machine.
Incorporate strength-training two to three days a week. You don’t have to become a body-builder, but using your muscles in strength training burns calories and keeps you strong (muscle burns more calories than fat). Find a gym where you can get professional advice from a personal trainer.

, Do your homework about a healthy vegan diet and get some healthy recipes. If you are this far, you have the basic guidelines, but you will need to learn new cooking skills and how to build a healthy vegan meal. Experiment with cooking and try new, fun vegan recipes each day.To find vegan recipes, you can buy cookbooks full of healthy, delicious recipes. You can also search the internet for many recipes.

Pack healthy snacks from home.,
Keep your snacks out of sight.,
Track calories every day.,
Try chewing gum while you work.,
Drink more water.,
Replace breakfast with a smoothie.",How to Lose Weight at Work1," If you come to work empty handed, you might find yourself raiding the vending machine for candy bars and bags of chips when snack cravings hit. Instead, bring snacks and lunches from home. Plan healthy, easy-to-make meals, such as salads and bring them with you for lunch. That way, you won’t be tempted to eat out for lunch or grab fast food.Almonds, low-fat cheeses (like 1% cottage cheese), yogurt, fruit, and sliced veggies are all really great snacking alternatives. They will give you the boost in energy you need, as well as a healthy dose of vitamins, minerals, and protein. These are good snacks to help you stay full for longer while you work.Pair a lean protein with a fruit or vegetable for a healthy snack. For example, you could try a boiled egg with some cherry tomatoes, carrots and a couple of tablespoons of hummus, or low-fat Greek yogurt with fresh berries.;
, If you’ve got a crazy sweet tooth and you have to bring a little splurge snack with you to get you through the day, keep it out of sight. Tuck your food and snacks into a desk drawer or keep them in the office fridge. If it’s out of sight, it’s more likely to be out of mind. Try keeping out something healthy, like a piece of fruit or some baby carrots. That way, if you do feel compelled to snack, the first thing you’ll have to reach for will be something good for you. Something that won’t spoil from sitting out is a good option, like an apple or unpeeled orange.

, Use a smartphone app or just a regular old pen and paper to keep track of your intake throughout the day. Balancing your intake with exercise is important if you are trying to lose weight. Plus, a visual representation of what you’re taking in, like a chart of calories, can really help you see what changes you need to make with your diet.If apps or writing down your intake don’t work for you, you could try simply keeping a food journal. In it, keep notes of what you eat, when you eat it, and about how much you ate. It might not be as formal as counting calories, but it holds you more accountable for what you’re eating each day.

, Chewing gum has been shown to reduce tension in those who chew more than in those who don’t. Since stress levels can lead to a higher rate of retention of body fat, busting stress is important when trying to lose weight. Pop a stick of gum in your mouth when you feel stressed at work to limit stress eating and calm tension. Look for chewing gum that has the American Dental Association stamp of acceptance on the label. The ADA puts this label on chewing gum that is good for your teeth, so while you work on losing weight, you can also be looking after your dental health!, Keeping yourself hydrated might also help keep away the hunger pangs by keeping you feeling full. Keep a water bottle on your desk and make it a habit to drink it and refill it throughout the day. Forgo sweet drinks like sodas in favor of water to save on calories, as well.


Try adding some sliced lemons, limes, oranges, or strawberries to a jug of water. Let it steep in the fridge overnight to infuse some fruity flavors into your water--a good alternative to sugary water sweeteners.You could also use an app to monitor your water intake. There are applications available for your smartphone that will help you track how much water you’ve had each day so you can be sure you’ve reached your goal. Alternatively, you can keep track on paper.
One study showed that drinking two glasses of water before meals can help with weight loss., Rather than grabbing a donut from the break room or a greasy breakfast sandwich from the drive-thru, start your mornings with a healthy smoothie. Not only are smoothies filling and satisfying, they help you get the vitamins and minerals you need to have a productive morning and feed your body in a healthy way.Virtually any fruit or vegetable is fair game for a smoothie ingredient. Powerhouse ingredients like half an avocado, Greek yogurt, berries, bananas, and greens like kale or spinach are a great place to start.
Try this: in your blender, put in a half a cup of ice cubes, a half a cup of almond milk (or coconut milk, or soy milk, or Greek yogurt), a healthy handful of spinach leaves, a handful of strawberries (you can use frozen berries), and a banana. Blend until smooth, adding milk to thin it out as necessary. Strong-flavored fruits like berries are great for blending with greens, as you’ll taste the berries and not the spinach!

Switch out your chair for a balance ball.,
Take short walks around the office.,

Try some calf raises while waiting at the copier.,
Clench or flex different muscles each time you get an email.,
Do stretches at your desk.,
Work your abs with a simple breathing exercise.,
Do chair squats.,

Use a water bottle as a weight.",How to Lose Weight at Work2," One of the simplest ways to add a bit of cardio into your workday is to take the stairs up to your office instead of taking the elevator or escalator. If you work somewhere that doesn’t have multiple floors, opt to park a little further away from the door to add some steps to your walk inside.Work on incorporating extra movement into your day in any way you can, even if you don’t have stairs or a big parking lot at your work. Offer to run an errand that needs to be done and take a walk, for example.

, Balance balls, or stability balls, keep you moving, even while seated. Since you’re constantly working your abs and back while you’re sitting on it, it’s like building exercise into your day without much effort at all. Spend a few hours out of your work day on the ball and a few hours in your regular chair if you need to rest.You could also get rid of your chair completely and choose to stand instead. There are special lifting desks you can purchase online or at an office supply store that will lift up your workstation so that you can stand while you work, which is great for your circulation and keeps you moving.

, Set a timer on your desk for every half hour to an hour and take a short, two to three minute walk around the office. Go grab a glass of water from the break room, walk the hallways, or just take a lap or two around the perimeter of the office.Taking breaks can also help you refocus. So, when you return to your desk after your short walk, you’ll be feeling more energized to keep working and better able to focus on your work.

, While sitting in your desk chair, or any other chair in the workplace, lift your legs straight out. Hold them there for a few seconds, then slowly lower them back down. Do a few sets of at least ten repetitions scattered throughout your workday.If your job requires standing full time, try swapping this exercise out for lunges. Step forward with one foot and bend the opposite knee until it almost touches the floor. Then, gently push yourself back up to standing and repeat on the other side.

, If you’ve got some time to kill at work while standing up, you can do calf raises to exercise without drawing attention to yourself. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart and slowly raise up onto the balls of your feet. Slowly lower back down again, and repeat.Do these in sets. When starting off, try two sets of ten repetitions each, then gradually increase that over time. You could even challenge yourself to do as many calf raises as copies you have to make!

, Use little triggers like getting a new email, answering a phone call, or making a new sale and flex a different muscle group each time the trigger happens. For example, each time you get a new email, flex the muscles in your legs. Hold the flex for a few seconds and then relax it., Not only can stretching help you boost your energy and focus, it can also be an easy way to kill a few calories while staying seated at your desk. Try sitting in your chair and slowly lowering your fingers down toward your toes. Stretch your arms and back as you reach. Then, sit on the edge of the seat and without pushing your feet down into the floor. Lean back slowly without touching the chair back. Hold, then slowly sit upright. Repeat a few times. This exercise will help you stretch out and also work your abs.Stretch your chest, shoulders, and the front of your neck. Reach your arms out as wide as possible to your sides and lean back in your chair with your head tilted back and hold. For a more invigorating move you can do big arm reaches overhead and slowly fan your arms down and out to the sides, inhaling as you reach up, exhaling as you lower your arms, and then repeat.

, Sit up straight in your chair. Take in a deep breath. As you exhale, pull your abdominal muscles in, like you’re trying to pull them towards your spine. When you breathe in again, keep holding your muscles like that, and breathe into the back of your ribs. Keep holding your muscles (but not your breath!) that way for 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat this as often as you’d like., Hover a few inches above your chair with your knees bent. Hold for 5 seconds, then slowly stand up straight. Lower back down to hover above your chair again, and hold for another 5 seconds. Repeat this for as many reps as you’d like.This can get your blood pumping a little in addition to working the muscles in your lower body.

, While sitting on the edge of your chair, put one hand on the seat on either side of your hips. Lift yourself from the chair, then lower yourself down towards the floor. Your elbows should be at about 90 degrees once you’re fully lowered. Then, pull yourself back up to your chair. Repeat.Make sure your chair is stable before trying this exercise. If your chair has wheels, lock them, or use a different chair.

, A full water bottle can serve as a makeshift dumbbell at your desk. Gripping the bottle in one hand, lift your arm until it is straight out in front of you, and hold there for a moment. Then, continue lifting your arm up until your elbow is beside your ear, then bend your elbow to reach back behind you. Reverse the motion, and repeat.You can even try bringing a small weight with you to work. A one or two pound weight would be plenty. Try using a water bottle as a weight. A one liter bottle of water weighs one kilogram.

Plan to work out with a coworker after work.,
Ask that coworkers keep high-calorie foods out of the break room.,
Create a support system with your coworkers.,
Hold a healthy dish potluck.",How to Lose Weight at Work3," If you make a plan ahead of time, you might be more likely to stick to it--especially if that plan involves another person. Ask a coworker to go for a walk or jog with you after work, or to hit up the health club nearby on the way home. Or, make a plan to do yoga in the park on your day off together.Making a plan by yourself won’t be as effective as asking someone else to join you. Not only will you feel more accountable for following through with that plan, you’ll have the person nearby at work as a reminder that the plan is in place.

, If you’re not so good at keeping your hand out of the candy jar at work, ask that your coworkers keep their junk food out of the common areas. You could suggest a bin system in the fridge with each employee’s name on them, or that the candy and donuts in the break room be replaced with fruit.It might seem like a stretch to suggest others change their habits as well, but you aren’t really asking them to stop eating unhealthy things—just that those unhealthy things aren’t out in the open for anyone to graze on.
You might be surprised to find that many of your coworkers might be in favor of a healthy change in the communal snacks in the workplace.

, Some offices or workplaces hold competitions to see which employee can lose the most weight over a certain period of time. Instead of creating competitiveness, though, try fostering support. If multiple employees want to participate, consider creating a group meeting after work once or twice a week to help support each other along the way.If you work at a desk or on the computer, consider creating a digital way to keep track of each other’s success, like an email thread or a personal webpage.

, Sometimes changing up your eating habits can be difficult, especially if you don’t really know what to cook for yourself. Hold a healthy dish potluck at work to get some new ideas of easy, healthy dishes you can make yourself.


Have each person bring along a few copies of the recipe for the dish they’ve brought. That way, if you like it, you will know how to make it yourself at home!

Try to exercise regularly.,
Try cardiovascular exercises.,
Get rest if you have a gout attack.",How to Lose Weight with a Diet for Gout2," To lose weight, you should try to exercise for 30 minutes, five days a week. Start out with lighter exercises and work your way up to a more intense exercise routine. However, it is always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new exercise regimen if you have gout.Start out with light exercises like walking, swimming, cycling slowly, or gardening.
For example, you can start walking as part of your exercise regimen. Walk slowly and for a short distance when you begin. As you grow stronger, walk more quickly and for longer distances.

, Once you have started exercising more frequently, start working in some more intense cardiovascular exercises. Cardio exercises will increase your body’s ability to use oxygen, which will help to metabolize uric acid and lose weight.

Consider taking medications to help you fight gout and lose weight.,
Talk to your doctor about Colchicine.,
Consider taking Allopurinol.,
Consult your doctor about taking Probenecid.",How to Lose Weight with a Diet for Gout3," Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, you can also consider taking medications. By taking medications you will be able to reduce your chances of developing a gout attack while undergoing your diet and exercise schedule.


Options for medication will be described in the following steps.

, This medication can be taken if you are experiencing an acute attack. Colchicine interferes with white blood cells that are producing the inflammation response caused by urate crystals. When they do this, your gout attack symptoms will begin to ease up.The standard dosage is generally 0.5 to 1.2 mg, then 0.5 to 0.6 mg every one to two hours, or 1 to 1.2 mg every 2 hours until relief.

Your dosage may be increased at weekly intervals depending on your body’s production of uric acid.

, This medication, which is also called Benuryl or Probalan, helps to prevent the recurrence of gout arthritis. It does this by stopping the reabsorption of uric acid and helps your kidneys to get rid of the acid.The dosage is generally 250 mg twice a day for 1 week. There may be an increase to 500 mg twice daily if your body produces a lot of uric acid.

Make a healthy snack by combining popcorn kernels with coconut oil.,
Create low calorie-high nutrient condiments like coconut oil mayonnaise.,
Finished.

",How to Lose Weight with Coconut Oil," Not all coconut oils are created equal. For the oil with the most antioxidants look for coconut oil that has the label, “virgin” or “extra virgin.” While the virgins have a stronger flavor, you can find another type of coconut oil without the intense flavor of coconut by considering “refined” coconut oil.


Check the chemicals used to refine the coconut oil before purchasing--avoid brands that use harsh chemicals.
Look for cold-pressed or expeller-pressed oils. Both have approximately a two- year shelf life without refrigeration.;
, Create lower calorie baked goods by substituting coconut oil for butter or shortening.


Melt oil before use. Place jar in hot water immediately before use.
If combining with cold ingredients, combine and stir quickly so it doesn't clump.

, Granola, while healthy typically packs a lot of calories in a small amount. You can still have your granola and eat it too by substituting coconut for vegetable oil. Plus coconut oil adds more health benefits, making a handful of granola with your yogurt a powerful snack.

, Add a squirt of lemon juice, thyme and bake. Vegetables are low in calorie, high in dense nutrients and fiber, which are idea for any healthy weight. You will be clamoring for more!

, Add some nutrients to an-already healthy snack by substituting vegetable oil with coconut oil when you pop.

, Cut the amount of olive oil in half and use half coconut oil, half olive oil for calorie reduction and health benefit boost.

Sleep straight and take deep breaths.",How to Lose Weight Quickly and Safely (for Teen Girls)," If you want quick results, you'll probably need to change your eating habits to reflect a healthier diet. However, this does not mean that you should starve yourself. Starving yourself causes your metabolism—the process by which your body burns fat—to slow down dramatically so that it can store up energy. You won't lose weight, and you might even gain it.


It is important to remember that your body is changing as a result of hormone fluctuations. It is natural to experience some weight fluctuation as well. It is best to follow a consistent, healthy diet every day to ensure that your body can ride the hormonal wave.
Do not develop an eating disorder. Anorexia and bulimia are serious conditions that need treatment. If you think you might have an eating disorder, tell someone you trust and seek help immediately. No amount of weight loss is worth jeopardizing your health.;
, Knowing how many servings of different types of food you should eat in a day is essential for healthy weight loss. Try to eat and drink the following:


A glass of water at meals. This is a healthier choice than sugary soft drinks and artificial juice. Try adding a few slices of lemon to your water. It will get rid of the toxins in your body. Drink as much water as you can, as often as you can.

Minimum 3 servings of fruit daily.

Minimum 4 servings of vegetables daily
3 – 7 servings of protein: (meat, fish, etc.) and dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.) daily
3 – 5 servings of healthy fats: (nuts, peanut butter, avocado, etc.) daily
Eat simple carbohydrates (refined and processed products including muffins, cakes, cereals, white bread, white pasta) sparingly. Eating carbohydrates from artificial sugars and refined carbs will leave you bloated. Choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, sweet potatoes, yams, whole rice, quinoa, and couscous instead.

, Know what foods you need not to eat and make healthy menus for yourself. Here are some suggestions on what you should eat.



Breakfast Ideas: Toast with your favorite spread. Bananas are high in potassium.Try cereal with skimmed milk and fruit.

Lunch Ideas: It's best to bring your lunch from home. School food can be unhealthy, and you probably don't have much choice over what there is to eat. Try a sandwich on wholegrain/whole wheat/multi-grain bread with lean chicken, ham, or a butter-fried egg (using butter to fry egg instead of oil). Don't use white bread – it's made from bleached flour, and it contains very few nutrients. Add a salad with veggies (tomato, cucumber, lettuce, etc); a glass of milk; and veggie snacks like carrot sticks and celery.

Snack Ideas: veggies and fruit; natural yogurt and berries; a handful of nuts; veggies (like carrots, beans, snow peas) and low-fat dip. Do not buy yogurt-coated or chocolate-coated raisins or nuts. Most of these are full of added sugar.Dinner Ideas: One idea is: 1/2 veggies, 1/4 protein, 1/4 carbohydrates. If your parents make fatty foods for dinner, only have a little, then make yourself a salad on the side. If you're cooking for yourself: make brown rice (eating more lean meat than part carbohydrates helps); scrambled eggs; make yourself a sandwich; or eat some fish (it's high in omega-3, which is good for your brain).

, Eat three meals a day and two snacks in between. For each meal, make the veggies the largest portion, then the protein, then the carbohydrates. Feel free to include dairy with any meal.



Breakfast: Carbohydrates, fruit, protein

Lunch: Veggies, protein

Dinner: Protein, veggies, carbohydrates

Snacks: Fruit, veggies, protein

, Try to refrain from drinking anything but water and unsweetened tea. Water is the best liquid for keeping you hydrated; it helps your body burn fat; and it may even help keep your skin clear and zit-free!


As an added bonus: drinking only water means that you won't drink any sugar-water or energy drinks, which can contain up to 800 calories per drink. Just think: almost half your daily calories in one drink! Water is healthy, it tastes good, and it's an essential part of keeping you trim.
If you find yourself consistently hungry after every meal: try drinking a big glass of water or green tea (unsweetened) before you eat. It'll help fill you up, and it doesn't contain any extra calories.
To burn more calories, drink ice-cold water. Your body will spend more energy warming it up. A glass of cold water also feels refreshing after lots of exercise.

, Consider toning down your consumption, but not cutting anything out completely. Eat things like red meats once a week or once a month – you'll enjoy them more anyway!


As exceptions: try to cut out fast food, sweets (chocolate, candy, chips, soda, etc.), and other junk food (soft drinks, burgers, ice cream, etc.) Avoid the strategy of allowing yourself one ""cheat day"" per week , as this can lead to one day of binging. Try setting one day each week when you can have a small treat after dinner. If this is too difficult for you, then start with a small treat after dinner every day, and slowly switch to one day. Although you can have it at any time of the day, it's better to have it after dinner because you can look forward to it all day.
Fast food and sweets are highly processed, fatty, and unhealthy. McDonald's soft serves are made from pig fat, KFC fries are fried in lard, and thick-shakes contain almost no natural ingredients! It's all preservatives and additives. Know what is good for you and what isn't.

, You want to limit the amount of carbs you eat, but don't completely remove them your diet. Try to eat high-carb foods with about 50% of your meals. Your body runs on glucose (carbohydrates) in order to function. Carbohydrates translate into energy. Unless you want to become lethargic, fatigued, and eventually gain more weight back, don't cut out carbs.


Cutting out carbs completely, especially during this stage of life, can slow brain function and hormone production.
Don't fall into the trap of the low-carb Atkins diet. This diet recommends that you eat high-protein meats and fish that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Consuming too much animal protein (eggs, butter, chicken, fish, yogurt, milk, beef, lamb, pork, turkey etc.) have been linked to increased rates of heart disease and cancer.

, This might include fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, and grains. Base your diet around staples like rice, oatmeal, couscous, quinoa, yellow potatoes, and sweet potatoes. It may sound bizarre to be consuming white rice and potatoes, but these foods do not make you fat. Look at the traditional Chinese diet, where they regularly consume these starches yet remain one of the slimmest cultures in the world. Eat until you are satisfied, but not until you are stuffed. Do not restrict or starve yourself.

, These diet fads contribute to eating disorders and weight gain. As a teen, you are still growing. You need the calorie intake that's appropriate for your age/height/weight. For example, an active young woman should aim for no fewer than 2,000 calories a day.


These low-calorie 1,000 to 1,400 calorie diet plans are often three-day, seven-day, 10-day, or two-week plans – because they do not work long-term. You want weight loss that is maintainable, not just a quick fix.
Under strict doctor supervision and recommendation, inquire about how many calories you should be consuming for healthy steady weight loss for your weight, height, age, gender, and activity level.

, If you eat too much protein, your body turns the excess protein into glucose, which is what you were trying to avoid in carbs in the first place. On the other hand, fats have no effect on blood sugar and insulin levels.


Limit the amount of fat that you eat to between 35 and 60 grams per day. This means that fats should make up 20% to 35% of your entire calorie intake for the day.
Each day, aim to eat about 200 to 350 grams of complex carbohydrates: whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. This should make up 60% to 70% of your entire calorie intake for the day.
Aim to eat about 55 to 95 grams of low-fat protein, which includes beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. This should account for about 15% to 25% of your total calorie intake for the day. Did you know that 1 cup of oatmeal contains 12 grams of protein? Think outside the box, and don't just assume that meat, eggs, and fish are the only ways to get protein.

, It shouldn't be a chore! Little changes make a big difference, and will keep the weight from coming back. Starting a healthy exercise plan now will last long into your adult years. Walk, jog or cycle to school instead of driving. Run with your dog. Do crunches during commercial breaks on TV. Cycle with friends and family.


Plan your week. Set three days where you do intense exercise like running or a spin class at the gym. The other three days, do low-intensity exercise like a long walk. The other day is your day off.
Don't spend your days sitting on the couch watching TV. Try exercising! Fast weight loss will only be achieved with diet and exercise.

, One exercise session should last at least 30 minutes to an hour. You should burn around 400 calories in a high-intensity workout session. If you aren't sweating while doing a high-intensity workout, you're not working hard enough. You're working hard enough if you're sweating profusely, out of breath, and thirsty.



Stretch! Be sure to stretch before and after you exercise. Stretching also helps your growing muscles not to bunch up so you might look like a weightlifter. If you did stretch right, it would have an effect of a ballerina.
It's hard to lose weight when you're injured. However, stretching and yoga might help.
Do some weight training. Muscles burn calories by just being there. The more muscles you have, the faster you'll lose weight.

, Sports are great because they tap into our competitive energy, getting us to dig deeper than we normally might have. Don't worry about what people say, or whether you're ""skilled"" enough to join a team; just find a group of girls doing something that you're interested in, and ask if you can join. Here are some activities that are big-time calorie busters:



Spinning/elliptical trainer: Spinning or using the elliptical burns the most calories for the average U.S. woman, who weighs 163 pounds. The average female burns 841 calories per hour spinning or doing the elliptical.

Downhill skiing: Downhill skiing is another great way to burn tons of calories. Some consider it more fun than spinning. However, it may only be a viable regular workout if you in a snowy, mountainous area.The average female burns 645 – 841 calories each out while downhill skiing.

Full-court basketball: Basketball requires good hand-eye coordination and the ability to run up and down the court. The average female playing basketball blasts around 812 calories an hour.

Competitive soccer: Soccer players are known for being among the most fit athletes in the world. No wonder: You're running up and down a really long field! Female soccer players burn 742 calories of grit and determination per hour.

, Even if you don't want to do a super-rigorous sport, this doesn't mean that you have no other options. Lots of girls and women prefer to do lower-intensity workouts such as yoga or pilates. Both are good for calorie-busting, and leave you feeling refreshed and energized.


Yoga is a series of stretching exercises that originated in ancient India. There are different kinds of yoga, each burning a different amount of calories:


Hatha Yoga, where the student goes through a series of gentle exercises focusing on posture and breathing, can burn about 175 calories per hour in an average female.Vinyasa Yoga, in which poses are tougher and linked together faster, can burn about 445 calories per hour in an average female.

Bikram Yoga, where the room in which the yoga takes place is heated up to 105 degrees, burns about 635 calories in the average female.


Pilates is a stretching and body conditioning routine that works the core. It was designed by a German in the early 20th century, and it boasts over 10 million practitioners today. Pilates (for beginners) burns around 200 calories per hour, and you will burn more as you advance in difficulty.

, Try to get eight to ten hours each night.If you're still tired, try supplementing with five- to 45-minute naps in the day. This can make a huge difference in losing weight.


This is a critical issue, especially in teens due to their school schedules. Get adequate sleep each night so your body can rest, repair, and produce the hormones needed to keep weight at a healthy level.

, If possible, try not to go to sleep early enough that you don't need to wake up with an alarm. This can disrupt your sleep in the midst of a REM cycle, making you wake groggily. It's always best to wake up slowly, peacefully, and at your own time. If you are aware of how much time you usually sleep, you should go to bed early to fill in those hours.


Waking up suddenly breaks the whole fat-killing cycle and instead leads to fat producing. The system start acting the opposite.

, It is common to wake up due to thirst. The body needs the water's energy to burn even more fat!

, Sleeping on either sides of the body makes it hard for blood to run around which also helps in weight loss. When you are lying straight on the bed before sleeping, take deep, long breaths and hold them for as long as you can. Breathe slow and easy. This should act as a command for the body to help you fall asleep and start flushing down fats.

In addition, you may find that some organizations have cell phone apps for weight loss, such as the iPhone app Weight Watchers produces.



Talk to your doctor about your weight loss wishes, goals, and fears before embarking on a particular diet. Your doctor will be able to offer advice as to the dietary methods most likely to suit your needs.

, This person needs to be prepared to take calls from you when your willpower is failing and you're tempted to break the diet. Choose someone you know is always supportive of you and will be supportive of your efforts to lose weight.


Have a weekly weigh-in and text the results to your phone buddy after each weigh-in. In turn, your phone buddy should offer support by text for your progress.
Call your phone buddy if you feel that you're about to break your diet or give up altogether. Let them provide the support you need when the going gets tough.

Text your phone buddy after you try new things that are aimed at helping you lose weight. For example: ""I have just left my first gym class!"" Being able to tell someone makes the occasion feel more real and momentous than doing it alone.

, You can record the number of steps walked, or input the amount of exercise you're doing, depending on which apps you're using.


There are apps available that tell you how many calories are burned for every type of exercise. You can simply pull this out and check before making a decision on your type of exercise and the duration.
Some iPods also record how many steps you take each day.

, If you're not a keen gym visitor and you can't afford a personal trainer, your cell phone can step in for such people and places. Download apps that explain how to do exercises, how to follow certain weight loss routines, and how to do workouts properly in the comfort and privacy of your own home and personal time. As an added bonus, if you go walking, jogging, or running, your cell phone is very portable and can inform you what to do next as you're going.

, The cell phone is an excellent way of keeping notes because it's usually with you wherever you go, especially during lunch and snack outings. Tap in your notes each day about how you're coping, what feelings you're having at particular times of the day, and what triggers seem to set off your food cravings, etc. After just a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice the patterns and the pitfalls and you'll be able to start working on removing the triggers from your daily routine.

These contractions help your body flush water and waste products out of your system. In addition to regulating your system, drinking 1 to 2 cups of coffee or tea in the morning or over the course of the day will also help you to feel less bloated., While some people grab a sugary or fatty pick-me-up snack in between meals, others opt not to snack. Neither option, however, is conducive to losing weight. If you are a snacker, swap that tempting sugary, salty, or fatty snack, with a healthy snack that will sustain you until lunch. If you prefer not to eat between meals, you are more likely to binge at mealtime. To prevent overeating at lunch, consider adding a healthy mid-morning snack that will curve your appetite.


Healthy snack options include a piece of whole fruit, a cup of yogurt, or a small bowl of oatmeal., Cardio exercise benefits your body in a number of ways. First, when we exercise, we sweat. Sweating is an easy and efficient way of ridding your body of excess water weight. Second, exercise boosts your metabolism. When your metabolic rate is increased, you burn more fat and rid your body toxins that cause you to retain water. Lastly, physical activity is an excellent way to reduce stress. When you feel stressed, you may overeat, retain water, or store more fat than is needed.


Aim to workout for approximately a half hour each day. You can walk, bike, run, swim, or take an exercise class.
Consider working out 2 to 3 hours before bed. Since your metabolic rate will be higher, you will burn fat throughout the night., When you are stressed, your body releases the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is released when your body is physically stressed and or emotionally stressed. This hormone causes your body to store additional fat and water. By reducing your stress level, you can reduce the presence of cortisol in your system, and in turn begin to lose weight. The following activities may help you to unwind:


Exercise. Take a brisk walk.
Yoga and or meditation.
Listen to your favorite music.
Take a bath.
Get a massage., After consuming a meal, your body has to digest the food. The digestion process can cause you to become bloated. As a result, if you force your body to digest food while you sleep, you may struggle to lose weight overnight. To avoid going to bed bloated, consume your dinner several hours before you go to sleep., Epsom salt naturally flushes your body of toxins and excess water that cause you to bloat. Soaking in an epsom salt bath before bed will help you achieve your goal of losing weight overnight. Fill your bathtub with warm water and mix in 2 cups (500 ml) of Epsom salt. Soak in the bath for 15 minutes, and repeat this routine two or three times each week., Prior to falling asleep, make yourself a nice warm cup of green tea. Green tea, a natural diuretic, helps to boost your metabolism. When imbibed before bed, this warm, soothing liquid will help you burn fat more efficiently throughout the night., In order to lose water and carbon weight throughout the night, you must be asleep. To ensure that you will fall asleep quickly and remaining slumbering throughout the night, transform your bedroom into an environment that is conducive to sleep and weight loss.


Turn down the temperature in your bedroom to 66℉. When you sleep in a cold room, your body is forced to burn its stores of fat for warmth., Exposure to light at night may not only prevent you from getting a great night of sleep, but it can also cause you to gain weight. You can limit your exposure to unnecessary light by covering your windows with blackout curtains, removing any night lights from your room, turning off your T.V., computer, and tablet, and setting your phone aside. , Sleeping regulates your body's hormones that dictate when and how much you eat and it improves increases your metabolic rate. As you sleep, you also lose up to 2 pounds of water and carbon weight through your breath. The average adult needs 7-1/2 hours of sleep each night. If you aren't getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep, alter your schedule to allow for this amount of slumber.If you already get at least 7 hours of sleep each night, you may not notice much difference in your weight if you increase this amount by 30 to 60 minutes.
If you're more severely sleep deprived, you should find it easier to shed weight once you start sleeping more.

, When your body is dehydrated, it is more likely to retain water. Therefore, in order to shed excess water weight overnight, you must drink the recommended amount of water during the day.The average man needs to drink 3 liters of water each day.
The average woman needs to drink 2.2 liters of water each day.Avoid large amounts of caffeine and alcohol since both substances can dehydrate your body.
Other beverages can help you remain adequately hydrated, but you should avoid drinking too many sugary beverages or drinks that are otherwise high calories.

, When you consume a diet high in sodium, your body will retain water. The excess water may cause your stomach to bloat and your waist size to increase. In order to decrease your sodium intake, avoid:


Foods that taste salty.
Adding salt to your food.
Foods do not taste salty, but contain hidden sodium. These may include canned food, processed meats, and frozen meals., A diet high in sugar increases your body’s storage of fat. Throughout the day avoid sugary foods and beverages. These include:


Candies, sweets, and desserts
Fruit juices
Sodas
Alcoholic beverages, As your body digests carbohydrates, the each gram of carbs retains approximately 4 grams of water. Once the digestion process is complete, the body stores carbs as sugars and fats. In order to reduce the amount of water your body retains, as well as the amount of fats and sugars it stores, you can limit your intake of carbohydrates. When you go on a safe, low-carb diet, you can lose around 10 pounds of water weight., In an effort to lose weight, swap your sugary snacks or carb-loaded meals with items high in protein, fiber, and potassium.


Foods rich in protein, such as meats and legumes, promote muscle building and increase your metabolic rate.
Items high in fiber, such as leafy greens and whole grains, and potassium, such as bananas and peanut butter, help your body to burn fat and lose excess water."

If you are pregnant, or have a medical condition, your body may need added calories to maintain your health, so this is not the time to start losing weight.If you have medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular problems, talk to your doctor before starting a diet and exercise plan. Many factors, including age, current weight, and overall physical health, should be discussed with your doctor in order to safely start a diet and exercise plan.;
, Weight loss of 0.5 to 2 pounds per week is a healthy approach. Allow yourself the time you need to reach your weight loss goal, planning on a loss of up to 2 lbs. each week.While it may be tempting to pursue fad diets with promises of fast weight loss, a slow and steady approach is the healthiest way to lose weight.While fad diets may help you drop weight quickly, they are not sustainable long term and once you stop the fad diet, you often gain back the weight plus more.

, Weight loss happens when you burn more calories than you consume. Your doctor can help determine the number of calories to consume each day specific to your body, age, sex, and your lifestyle.

, One pound is equal to about 3,500 calories. In order to lose 1 to 2 pounds each week, your daily calorie consumption needs to decrease by about 500 to 1000 calories, or you activity level needs to increase to burn more calories.As an example, a moderately active 35 year old female needs to consume about 2000 calories per day to maintain her current weight. A target goal of 1400 to 1600 calories per day will create a situation of weight loss for this person.
Daily calorie goals factor in age, sex, and level of physical activity. Some medical conditions can be a factor that may also need to be considered.

, This way you know your calories everyday.

, This can actually prevent you from losing weight. When you skip meals or consume too few calories, your body starts to store calories as fat instead of burning them.

, Many healthy weight loss plans already exist and can be tweaked to suit your own preferences and needs. Whether you tweak a formal diet plan or come up with your own, be sure it is suited to you, and is a plan you can live with for a long time, not just for a few months.For a successful healthy lifestyle change, it is important that your new plan fit into your life without too much difficulty. Adjusting how you eat and exercise is one thing, completely changing to foods you don't normally eat and exercises you don't enjoy will most likely not be successful long term.

, As you develop your plan, incorporate what worked, and leave out what did not work., Add your own personal preferences, and include flexibility in both your food and physical activity choices. Plus, consider your preference to diet all alone or if you prefer support from a friend or group., Some diet programs involve added costs. The added expense may be from a gym membership, joining a specific group, purchasing specific food items like supplements or meals, or attending regular appointments or group meetings., Consider expanding on activities you already enjoy, like walking, Zumba dancing, biking, or yoga. Establish a physical activity routine that you can live with, for the long run. An exercise routine that includes aerobic activity and muscle development is ideal, but just increasing your level of activity is a great place to start., Work towards 150 minutes or more per week of moderate physical activity, or 75 minutes of more vigorous aerobic activity or exercise, spread evenly throughout the week., Physical activity includes the things you already do every day, such as walking, housework, yard work, and running around in the yard with the kids, grandkids, or the family pet. Exercise involves structured, scheduled, and repetitive forms of activity that you do regularly.However, seeking to add additional physical activity (ex: taking the stairs rather than the elevator, walking rather than driving, etc.) can be a great way to reach your goals.

, Your doctor can tell you what your body mass index, or BMI is. A healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 25.The formula to calculate BMI is a little confusing, but if you want to calculate your BMI, then follow these steps. Your BMI is your weight in kilograms (not pounds) divided by your height (in centimeters) squared.Here is an example. For someone that is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds, the formula reveals the BMI to be 27.3.Convert the pounds into kilograms. Do this by multiplying the weight in pounds by 0.45. So 165 x 0.45 = 74.25. Next, convert the height to centimeters. 5 feet 6 inches is 66 inches. Multiply the 66 by 0.025 to get 1.65. Then square that number by multiplying it against itself, so 1.65 x 1.65 = 2.72. Divide the new weight number by the new height number; 74.25 ÷ 2.72 = 27.3. This person’s BMI is 27.3., Successful weight loss requires a commitment to yourself to stick with your plan for the long term.,, Some people find it helpful to put your plan in writing. Include why you want to lose the weight, the plan itself, how much weight you want to lose, and your target date to reach your desired weight. Then sign it as if you are signing a contract., The 5 food groups include fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy. Your plate should be halfway covered with green vegetables and fruits, and the other half with protein and grains. The best dairy products to include in your diet are fat-free (skim) and low-fat (less than 1% fat).Good protein sources include lean meats, beans, and fish. Nuts, seeds, and eggs are also protein sources.Try to consume 3 servings per day of dairy products. Try to avoid cream cheese, cream, and butter.Choose mostly grain products made from whole-grain. Some examples include whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, and brown rice.Avoid packaged oatmeal, which often contains a lot of sugar.
Fruits and vegetables contain fewer calories than most foods, and are great sources of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. While fruits are a great choice, they do contain calories and sugars, so limit your daily intake to about 4 servings, which is about 2 cups., Solid fats and sugars add calories but no nutrients to the foods we eat. Examples of foods with empty calories include cakes, cookies, pastries, pizza, ice cream, sodas, sports drinks, fruit drinks, sausage, hot dogs, and bacon.

, Clearly, preparing your meals with fresh ingredients is the best and healthiest way to go. But everyone has days when cooking meals from scratch just doesn’t fit into the schedule. Frozen dinners have evolved over time, and there are some healthy options out there.Follow these basic guidelines as you select frozen meals. Choose meals that include servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry, vegetables, and whole grains. Try to target meals that have 300 to 350 calories, 10 to 18 grams of total fat, less than 4 grams of saturated fat, less than 500 mgs of sodium, 5 grams or more of fiber, 10 to 20 grams of protein, and about 10% of the recommended daily values for vitamins and minerals., It's easier to watch calories and enjoy eating by buying pre-portioned food. 100 calories per bag popcorn, 110 calories per ice cream bar, even snacks in portioned bags allow you to monitor calories and reduce the urge to eat too much.

, Specific cultural or ethnic preferences are a way of life for many people. Include your favorite, but healthy, cultural and ethnic food choices in your weight loss plan., While drinking a lot of water is a big part of some diet programs, others place less emphasis on the amount, and just emphasize the importance of water intake for reasons of general health. Some experts report that drinking water when you are hungry helps you to feel full, and therefore controls that cue your stomach sends to your brain that you need to eat., Beyond drinking plenty of water, include coffee and tea, minus the added sweeteners, as part of your plan. Limit your intake of diet drinks, milk other than skim, fruit juice, and alcohol., Emotional or comfort eating gets in the way of nutritional eating. Think about healthy foods you like that can replace your past unhealthy comfort foods.Look up healthy recipe swaps for your favorite dishes so you won't feel so restricted.

, Eating something fried might taste good today, but it might not feel so good the next morning., Your stomach will start to feel full if you slow down as you eat. Have a conversation with someone, or put the fork down between bites, to allow your stomach to tell your brain you are getting full., Be aware of what you plan to eat, and read the nutrition labels to be sure you are eating what you planned.Some packaging can be misleading for marketing purposes, so looking at the nutrition label is essential.

, Some foods are more pleasant than others, no doubt. Take control of experiencing new foods by removing the words “I can’t eat that”, and instead say “I don’t eat that”. By changing how you talk about food, it puts you in control of choosing foods you do not routinely eat.Instead of talking about the foods you can no longer have, talk about all of the foods your are adding in like fruit, vegetables, lean proteins, etc. Shifting your mindset from restriction to addition can make a big difference.

, Eat breakfast, plan ahead so you know what you will eat when you get hungry, avoid over-eating which can happen when watching TV, and eat the healthy food choices first. Other routines that can help include eating smaller meals, or snacks, throughout the day instead of 3 larger meals., The scale can help you to tweak your plan if you need to, and to stay on track with meeting your goal., What you can see in your cabinet, or can easily reach for, may not always be the best choice. Keep fruit on the counter and chopped veggies in the fridge. Easy access to healthy choices can help avoid unhealthy snacking., Get rid of the cookies and ice cream. Having the tempting foods within reach can pull you away from your plan., Smaller plates can help with portion control, decreasing the number of calories you consume at mealtime. Always eat off a plate as opposed to out of a box, bag or carton.You can pre-portion out servings of snack foods and leave them in your pantry to prevent over eating from the container. Grocery stores also have a lot of pre-portioned options.

, People that get enough sleep burn up to 5% more calories at rest than people that do not get a good night’s sleep. Plus, getting the sleep you need increases the amount of fat you lose compared to people that sleep less than 6 hours each night., Life happens. Weddings, covered dish dinners, birthday parties, game-day snacks, or a night out on the town can all involve eating, or drinking, calories that are not in your plan.Think about what you could have done differently, and plan ahead so you will be ready for those challenging events next time.Avoid the ""all or nothing"" mentality. Just because you messed up once, doesn't mean you can spiral out of control and have anything else you want. It happened, move on and don't be so hard on yourself.

, Talking to your friends and family about your weight loss plan can help you stay focused on your goal. You may have a friend that will want to join you in losing weight. Support groups are also available that can provide encouragement, as well as personal tips on struggles they encounter.Sharing your goals can also prevent others from being bad influences when know you are serious about losing weight.

, Talk to your doctor to determine if prescription drugs for weight loss are right for you. The FDA has recently approved several agents that can help with weight loss. Using prescription products will depend on your existing medication regimen, any medical conditions you may have, and the amount of weight you need to lose., Over-the-counter weight loss products have not been studied and tested for efficacy the way prescription-only products have been. Your doctor may consider over-the-counter products for you, but it is important to discuss this with your doctor before your try this type of product.

, For some people, considering surgical options may be the safest and most effective way to reach his or her weight loss goal. Only your doctor can properly evaluate your condition and determine if these options are right for you.Four procedures are commonly done to help people lose weight. This type of procedure is called bariatric surgery. Two primary functions are provided by the available procedures. The 2 functions include restriction, which physically limits the amount of food the stomach can contain, and malabsorption, which shortens the small intestine to reduce the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs.The 4 commonly performed procedures are called roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenal switch with biliopancreatic diversion., Your doctor may be able to help you, even though you do not realize it. In some cases, you may be taking prescription medications that cause weight gain or increase your appetite. By talking to your doctor about your weight loss goals, some of your medications can possibly be changed, or the dose adjusted, to help you achieve your goal.

, Depending on how much weight you need to lose, any existing medical conditions, and your age, your doctor can help to guide you in exercise and activity options that are safe for you. Healthcare professionals, like your doctor or a registered dietician, are great resources for information, guidance, and support., Don't beat yourself up if you overeat, take a breath and start fresh the next day. We didn't become overweight by over eating once in a while, overeating was a daily habit.

, It takes about 8 months to change a habit and once you start feeling healthier and people start mentioning how great you look, you will know you are on the right track!

Eat a balanced diet and avoid extremes.,
Reduce added sugars in your food.,
Eliminate refined carbs.,
Eat more protein.,
Eat more vegetables.,
Add more selenium to your diet.,
Increase your zinc intake.",How to Lose Weight when You Have Hypothyroidism2," Eating a balanced diet is essential for thyroid health. This includes eating a variety of foods with different nutrients and avoiding fad diets or extremes. Cutting out food groups completely or eating too much of a food group may negatively affect your thyroid function.For example, many people cut out all carbs, dairy, or fats when they try to lose weight. Instead of going to an extreme like this, eat a healthy balance of each food group.
Talk to your doctor about what foods you should be eating if you are concerned.

, Added sugars can negatively affect your weight loss goals, especially if you have hypothyroidism. Foods with added sugars are unhealthy and provide empty calories with no nutritional benefit.Eliminate as many foods that contain added sugars as you can. This includes candy, cookies, cakes, other baked goods, juice, sodas, and many cereals. You should also be careful of condiments and sauces because these generally contain sugar.
Read the labels and look for the different words used for sugar. Examples are sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, fructose, sucrose, and maltodextrin.

, Another way you can improve your chances of weight loss when you have an underactive thyroid is to cut the refined carbs and starches from your diet. Carbs are not as a rule bad for you. However, there are certain carbs that provide no nutritional value and interfere with weight loss.Start by cutting out all “white” carbs and starches from your diet. This includes white bread, white pasta, and white rice. Potato chips, crackers, and snack cakes also contain refined carbs.
Many packaged snack foods and even health foods are full of refined carbs. Try buying less prepackaged foods, especially snacks. Opt instead for whole foods.
Replace simple carbs with complex carbohydrates, such as whole wheat pitas, brown rice, quinoa, barley, or millet.

, A large part of your diet should be protein. This is helpful when you have hypothyroidism since protein helps boost weight loss. Protein helps keep you fuller longer and more satisfied than carbs or fat. Many high protein foods have low calorie counts, so it helps keep you full without too many extra carbs.Choose lean cuts of meats, such as chicken and turkey. If you want to eat beef, make sure to get lean cuts, such as 93/7. Seafood also contains high levels of protein.
Non-meat sources of protein include eggs, nuts, and beans. Low-fat dairy products like Greek yogurt and low-fat cottage cheese also provide protein.

, Vegetables are full of important nutrients like vitamins and minerals. This is important for people with hypothyroidism because often the condition leads to poor absorption or nutrient deficiencies.Dietary fiber may interfere with the absorption of your thyroid medication. Ask your doctor if you need to limit the amount of fiber you eat.
Half of your plate at every meal should be full of vegetables.
Try to focus on lower carb vegetables, like mushrooms, leafy greens, and asparagus.
You may want to limit the amount of kale, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussel sprouts you eat. They are considered goitrogens, which means they may interfere with your body's ability to absorb iodine. As long as you eat them in moderation, you should have no problem., Selenium is important for proper thyroid function. Many people with hypothyroidism have low selenium levels. This leads to improper iodine absorption, which the thyroid uses to make thyroid hormone. If you follow a balanced diet, then you will not need to supplement with iodine and you should never take an iodine supplement unless you are advised to do so by your doctor. However, adding more selenium-rich foods into your diet may be beneficial. To add more selenium, eat more:Brazil nuts
Tuna
Sardines
Lean beef
Chicken
Eggs
Beans

, Zinc is another vital nutrient for thyroid health. Zinc helps regulate the production of the thyroid stimulating hormone. Through a balanced diet, you should get enough zinc. However, you can eat more food containing zinc to boost your thyroid health.Oysters and shellfish contain large amounts of zinc. Beef and chicken are also good sources.
Beans, nuts, and seeds provide zinc to your diet.
Dairy products, like milk and yogurt, contain zinc.

Try light cardio exercise.,
Add in strength training.,
Get enough sleep.,
Drink more water.,
Place your food on your plate first.",How to Lose Weight when You Have Hypothyroidism3," Exercise is important in the weight loss process. When you have an underactive thyroid, diet is the most important lifestyle change, but exercise is important, too. It not only helps boost your weight loss, but it also supports a healthy lifestyle.You don’t have to do a lot of intensive cardio. Try light cardio, such as walking. Sixty minutes of walking three to five times each week can help increase your chances of losing weight.
You can try other cardio workouts, like jogging, cycling, dancing, swimming, climbing stairs, or an elliptical machine.

, A good way to help increase weight loss is to perform strength training workouts. Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises helps build muscle, which leads to increased metabolism.You can do bodyweight exercises, like squats or pushups, or try dumbbell or kettlebell exercises.

, Regular sleep is important for losing weight. Lack of sleep or sleep that is bad quality can put you at a risk for obesity. If you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you should start a sleep schedule where you go to bed at a certain time and make sure you get the proper amount of sleep.Adults should get at least seven hours of sleep each night. Shoot for seven to nine hours.

, Many people are dehydrated due to their diet. Many prepackaged foods, snack foods, and fast foods are full of sodium, which leads to dehydration. Drinking more water or zero calorie fluids can help boost your dehydration.Proper hydration depends on your lifestyle. For instance, if you exercise often or do a job where you sweat, you may need more water. If you are properly hydrated, your urine will be a light yellow or clear.
According to the Institute of Health, men should have 13 cups or three liters of water a day, while a woman should have nine cups or 2.2 liters. The rule of drinking eight eight-ounce cups (or 64 ounces) of water each day is a little under these values, but it's a good place to start.

, One technique you may use to help you regulate how much you eat is to put all of your food on your plate before you start eating. This helps you avoid piling your plate mindlessly at the table. It also helps you refrain from going back for seconds.Pay attention to how much you are putting on your plate. Eat a serving of protein that is approximately the size of your fist. Fill half your plate with vegetables, and leave only a fourth for carbohydrates.

Cut down on bad fats.",How to Lose Weight Using Self Hypnosis," Much of the power of hypnosis rests in the fact that you have convinced yourself that you have a way to take control of your urges. If you don’t believe that hypnosis will help you change your feelings, it will probably have little effect., Go to a place where you are not likely to be disturbed. This can be anywhere that is quiet like your bed, a sofa, or a comfortable armchair. Make sure that your head and neck are supported.Wear lose clothes and establish that the temperature is set at a comfortable level.You may find it easier to relax if you play some gentle music while you self-hypnotize, particularly something instrumental., Find something in the room to look at and focus on, preferably something slightly above you. Use your focus on this object to clear your head of all thoughts. Make this object the only thing you are conscious of., Tell yourself that your eyelids are becoming heavy and allow them to fall gently. As your eyes close, breathe deeply with a regular rhythm. Focus on your breathing, allowing it to occupy the entirety of your mind, much as the object you had been looking at did before. Feel yourself becoming more relaxed with each additional breath.Imagine that all of the tension and stress are dissipating from your muscles. Allow this feeling to move down your body from your face, to your chest, your arms, and finally your legs.
Once you are completely relaxed your mind should be clear and you will be part way to self-hypnosis.

, The motion of a pendulum moving back and forth has traditionally been used in hypnosis to encourage focus. In your mind, visualize this pendulum moving back and forth. Focus on it as you relax to help clear your mind., Begin counting down in your head from 10 to 1. As you count down tell yourself that you are getting progressively deeper into hypnosis. Say, “10, I am relaxing. 9, I am getting more relaxed. 8, I can feel the relaxation spreading down my body. 7, I can feel nothing but the relaxation…. 1, I am in a deep sleep.” Remember throughout that when you reach 1 you will be in a state of hypnosis.

, Once you have accomplished what you want during hypnosis, you should wake yourself. Count back up from 1 to 10. In your head, say: “1, I am waking up. 2, when I count down I will feel like I woke from a deep sleep. 3, I am feeling more awake…. 10, I am awake and refreshed.”, It takes consistent repetition to reprogram your brain with hypnosis. You should aim to spend about twenty minutes a day in a state of hypnosis. While under, alternate between some of the strategies listed below. Try a bit of everything to attack your bad eating habits from every angle available., One of the first things you should try to do while under hypnosis is to convince yourself that you aren’t interested in the nasty snack foods that you’re having trouble kicking. Pick something like ice cream that you tend to overindulge in. Tell yourself “Ice cream tastes bad and make me feel sick.” Repeat for twenty minutes, until you are ready to awake from hypnosisRemember, a good diet doesn't mean that you need to stop eating, just eat fewer bad foods. Don't try to talk yourself out of eating, just convince yourself to eat less food that you know is unhealthy., You should also use self-hypnosis to reinforce your desire to eat better. Write a mantra that to repeat while in a state of hypnosis. Examples include: “Over eating hurts me and my body. I should eat healthy to make myself a better me.” , To increase your desire to live better visualize what you would be like healthy. Take a picture of yourself from when you were thinner or do your best to imagine what you would look like after losing weight. Under hypnosis focus on this image. Imagine the confidence that you would feel if you were healthier. This will make you want to realize that thinner you when you awake., Protein is especially good at filling you up and, because it supports muscle growth, can actually improve your metabolism. Good sources of protein include seafood, lean meat, eggs, yogurt, nuts, and beans. A steak every meal might be counterproductive, but snacking on nuts when you're hungry could go a long way toward helping you reach your goals., When you don't eat for an extended period of time, your metabolism goes down and you stop burning fat. If you eat something small once every three or four hours, your metabolism will go up and you will be less hungry when you sit down for a meal., Fruits and vegetables will fill you up and supply you with nutrients without putting any pounds on. Snack on bananas instead of cookies to start losing weight., Unsaturated fats, like those in olive oil, can be good for you. You should, however, try to limit your consumption of saturated fats and trans fats. Both of these are major contributing factors in heart disease.


Trans fats are common in processed foods, particularly baked goods, frosting, and margarine.
Saturated fats are not as bad as trans fats, but can be unhealthy. Major sources of saturated fat, include butter, cheese, lard, red meat, and milk."

They're not only great for a healthy, well-balanced diet, but filling up on these nutrient dense foods can help support your weight loss.


Most adults should consume about 2-3 cups of vegetables daily.This will help you meet your daily recommendation.
Aim for 1-2 servings of vegetables at each meal or make half of your meals vegetable based. One serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.Filling up on low-calorie foods can help restrict how much other foods you can eat. In addition, making half of your plate a vegetables, automatically means half of your meal is low calorie.;
, Many popular weight loss diets promote higher amounts of lean protein. Studies also show that protein may help support weight loss and manage appetite.The amount of protein you need daily will differ based on upon your gender, age and activity level. However, eating 1-2 servings of lean protein at each meal will help ensure you're consuming an adequate amount.
One serving of protein is about 3-4 ounces. This is about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.Choose a variety of lean protein foods like: legumes, poultry, eggs, lean beef, low-fat dairy products, seafood, pork or tofu.

, Many celebrity and model diets focus on limiting carbs.This might be a good idea as studies have shown lower carb diets produce faster weight loss.Low carb diets focus on reducing foods that are high in carbohydrates. These typically include: fruits, grains, legumes, starchy vegetables and dairy foods.
Ideally, reduce carbs from the grains group the most. Most of the nutrients found in these foods can also be found in protein, fruits and vegetables.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, it's a smart idea to cut out any unnecessary calories. Model and celebrity diets say to ditch the alcohol.Alcohol can be high in calories and provides no nutrition to your body. Skipping these extra calories can help support your weight loss.
If you do consume alcohol, keep it to a minimum. Women shouldn't have more than one beverage per day and men shouldn't have more than two., Water is essential to any healthy diet. However, adequate hydration is also essential to weight loss.


Recommendations range from 8 glasses to 13 glasses a day. Everyone will need slightly different amounts based on their age and activity level.Drinking adequate water can also help manage your appetite. Many times you may feel hungry, when you're actually thirsty - the signals feel and seem the same., Some models and celebrities have helped increase their calorie burn by increasing how many steps they take each day.Every extra step can help burn more calories.


Counting steps can help tell you how active you are throughout the day. The more you're moving, the more calories you burn throughout your entire day.
Some health professionals recommend getting in 10,000 steps daily. Although this isn't a formal recommendation, reaching this goal daily signifies you're very active.Any activity beyond what you current do will result in some health benefits and possibly weight loss.
You can purchase a pedometer or download an app for your smart phone to see how active you currently are. Slowly increase your steps over time. Start by just adding in 1,000 steps a day., Many models and celebrities are seen working out together.When you're exercising with a friend, studies show you're more likely to stick with your workout routine.Studies also show that working out with a friend can help make exercise a long-term habit.Ask a friend, family member or co worker about exercising together. Schedule in a few sessions a week together.
You may also enjoy taking gym classes. Group classes have the benefit of making new friends and enjoying a group atmosphere.

, Celebrity trainers have recommended working out in the morning instead of afternoon or evenings.While there is some conflicting evidence, there are studies that show workouts in the morning burn more fat.If you plan to hit the gym or exercise in the AM, aim for 150 minutes throughout the week. This is the recommendation for average, healthy adults.Include a variety of cardio exercises like: jogging/running, using the elliptical, swimming, dancing or taking aerobic classes.

, Models and celebrities always seem to have defined and toned muscles. Including regular strength training can also help you achieve a similar look.


Aim to do strength training about 2-3 days a week. Spend 20-30 minutes working all major muscle groups.(arms, legs, core, and back)Always include a rest day in between days where you've performed strength training activities. This will help your muscles recover and repair.
Include a variety of exercises like: weight lifting (either free weights or with weight machines), yoga, pilates or body weight exercises (like lunges, push-ups or crunches).

, The models that lose the weight and keep it off long-term take it slow and steady.Rapid weight loss isn't sustainable long-term and is more easy to gain back.


In general, you want to aim to lose about 1-2 pounds (.45-.9 kilograms) a week.This is considered, safe, healthy weight loss that will be the most easy to maintain.
Slow and steady weight loss usually results from making smaller lifestyle and diet changes. When you make dramatic changes or follow a crash diet, you're not likely to keep up with that lifestyle.

, Managing stress is something both celebrities and models work on for their emotional health but also to help support weight loss.Keeping stress levels low and in control can help support weight loss and manage hunger and appetite.


In times of high stress, it's more difficult to manage cravings, you may feel hungrier and notice it's harder to lose weight. This is a natural response to stress by your body.Keep stress in check. Try journaling, listening to music, going for a walk or talking with a friend for relief.
You may also want to try practicing yoga or meditation to help calm and quiet your mind.
If home remedies are not working well, or if you feel you need additional help, try seeking the assistance of a therapist or behavioral specialist. They may be able to give you additional guidance and structure for how to manage your stress.

, Even when model's are trying to lose weight, they may occasionally indulge in some of their favorite foods or treats.Banning these tasty comfort foods forever isn't realistic and may cause you to have increased cravings over time.


The key with weight loss is balance. You can't overindulge in your favorite foods or you may risk slowing weight loss or even gaining weight.
Schedule in special treats into your week or month. Knowing they are coming up or are planned, can help you compensate for those extra calories. You might go to the gym more often, do longer work outs or eat lighter on the days you're planning to indulge.

, Losing weight, and maintaining your ideal body weight once you achieve it, can be very difficult. Depending on your current weight and health status, a strict diet and exercise regimen can also create potential health risks. Talk to your doctor before starting any new weight loss regimen.Your doctor can help you set healthy weight loss goals and suggest safe strategies for losing weight.
Your doctor might also be able to refer you to a registered dietitian or fitness professional who can help you create and achieve realistic goals.

, Everyone’s body is different. Weight loss can be more difficult (and potentially unhealthy) for some people than for others. Before trying to achieve a runway model physique, give some serious thought to what sorts of weight-loss goals you can reasonably attain. Aim for goals that are S. M. A. R. T., i.e.:Specific. E.g., plan out exactly how much exercise you are going to do each week, or how many calories you are going to consume every day.
Measurable. Keeping your goals measurable will help you pinpoint how successful you are at meeting them. For example, while you can’t measure a goal like “eating healthier,” you can definitely measure a goal like “eating 1,200 calories per day.”
Attainable. Consider whether you have the time, resources, and physical ability to meet your goals. E.g., are your daily exercise goals compatible with your work schedule? Do your diet plans meet your specific health/nutritional needs?
Realistic. There is only so much weight that you can safely lose in a given amount of time. Talk to your doctor or dietitian about what kind of weight loss you can realistically hope to attain.
Trackable. You should be able to measure your progress in some way, whether it is through weekly weigh-ins or keeping a diary of your physical activity and calorie intake every day.

, Keep in mind that models often take extreme and dangerous measures to lose or maintain weight. Models are at high risk for developing physical and psychological problems as a result of the unhealthy and unrealistic demands placed on them by the fashion industry. Read up about the potential risks to your mental and physical health before attempting to achieve a runway model physique.Runway models are especially prone to developing eating disorders like anorexia.
In some countries, new laws are being put in place to prohibit modeling agencies from hiring models whose weight falls below a healthy limit for their body type."

Eat mindfully.",How to Lose Weight Naturally," When you're trying to change your diet and eat more healthfully, planning out your meals can be helpful.


Many times when you have a meal plan, you may not be so tempted to grab a quick bite at a fast food drive through, or find yourself somewhere where you don't have those healthy options.Write out your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options for a week at a time. Note if you'll need to have a day of meal prep set aside to help make meals quicker.
For breakfast you might have 1/2 grapefruit with a bowl of oatmeal, or you could have a scrambled egg with sauteed vegetables and low fat cheese.
For lunch you could have a large salad with lettuce, spinach, beets, carrots, a handful of walnuts, 1/2 avocado, and beans (black or garbanzo). Drizzle a little balsamic vinegar over the top.
For dinner you might go for grilled salmon (with a little dill and lemon), a serving of brown rice, and grilled zucchini.
If you need a snack, go for protein and a fruit or vegetable. Try a hard-boiled egg and an apple or greek yogurt with blueberries and ground flax seed.;
, Calorie counting, limiting certain food groups or restricting carbs or fat isn't always an easy diet plan to follow or all that natural. Consuming all foods and keeping an eye on portions is an easier and more natural way to help start weight loss.


When you're measuring and monitoring your portion sizes, you will naturally cut out some calories which can help you lose weight.
Invest in a food scale, measuring cups or measuring spoons to help keep you on track. You may also want to measure any bowls, cups, or containers you have at home to see how much food they hold.

, Eating the right foods will go a long way towards helping you lose weight and keep it off.


Eating a balanced diet means that you're consuming adequate amounts of each nutrient your body needs to function.You'll need to consume the recommended servings of each food and food group to help you meet your daily nutrient needs. Measuring your portion sizes can help you manage this.
In addition to eating foods from each food group, it's wise to each a large variety of foods within each food group.For example, every vegetable offers you a different array of healthy vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

, It also helps keep you satisfied which may help support your weight loss.


Keeping your portions of protein to 3-4 oz per meal will help to keep calories in check.
You should focus on the leaner meats to assist with weight loss. Go for fish, lean beef, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy products, as well as different kinds of seeds and nuts.
Include one serving of protein at each meal and snack to help you meet your daily minimum., These will provide you with many of the nutrients you need for very few calories.Although both fruits and vegetables are low in calories, it's still important to measure your portions. Keep your portions of fruit to 1 small piece or 1/2 cup chopped and keep vegetables to 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy salad greens.Since it's recommended to get a fairly large quantity of fruits and vegetables in each day, it may be easier to eat a serving or two at each meal and snack.

, The grain group includes a large variety of foods. Choosing 100% whole grains can add fiber, protein and other essential nutrients to your diet.


Whole grains contain the germ, endosperm and bran.They include ones like: brown rice, whole wheat, millet, quinoa, and whole grain oats.
One serving of grains is about 1 oz or 1/2 cup. It's recommended to make half of your grain choices whole grains if possible.Keep grains to 1-3 servings daily.This will help support your weight loss.

, Don't start obsessing about counting calories and punishing yourself by never eating any sweets or fatty foods again. Instead, opt to eat fewer of the less healthier things and less frequently.


Losing weight naturally means to never forbid certain foods or avoid them all together. Include your favorite foods in moderation. This might be once a week or 2 times a week or just a few times a month.
If you eat a meal that's high in fat or sugar (like you go out for dinner, or go to a fast food place) compensate for that by eating meals that are low-fat and low in sugar for the next few days or hit the gym a little harder.

, Keeping hydrated has many benefits when it comes to losing weight. In addition, stay well hydrated helps support a healthy body.


Drinking the recommended 8 -13 glasses a day will support your weight loss and may make you feel energized.Stick to sugar-free, decaffeinated beverages as often as possible. Try: water, flavored water, decaf coffee or decaf tea.
Skip sweetened beverages (like soda or sports drinks), highly caffeinated beverages (like energy drinks or shots) and fruit juices.

, Trying to change everything at once is going to completely overwhelm your system and make it difficult to stick to the changes you're trying to make.Losing weight naturally and keeping that weight off means making total lifestyle changes.


Start off with smaller changes. Add a 15 minute exercise routine to your day, or switch from using butter to olive oil when you're cooking.
Start shifting how you think about food, so that you stop using it as a comfort routine (like you eat when you're sad, or bored, or upset, etc.). Start thinking about food as something you're putting in your body to fuel you, which means you want the best fuel possible and that means the healthier eating options.

, Once you have made the decision to lose weight, set some realistic and achievable goals that you can follow.


Goal setting will help you to take action, and by taking that action you will start to see some weight loss results.
Typically with more natural weight loss, you can expect to lose about 1-2 pounds per week.
Keep track of your goals so that overtime you can see the progress you've made.

, Getting into a regular exercise routine can help support your weight loss and improve your overall health.


It's recommended to do about 150 minutes of cardio each week and include 2 days of strength training.Also increase your baseline or daily activities. Even doing things where you walk to the grocery store, or you take 15 minute breaks at work and go for a walk, can help with your weight-loss and your health.Exercise boosts your mood because it releases endorphins, which help make you happier, healthier, and more confident about yourself, which may help regulate your eating.Find exercise that you enjoy, that way you'll be excited for it rather than dreading it. Practice yoga, take dance lessons, go for a run in the prettiest neighborhood in your town or city. Don't think of it as a punishment, try to think of how you are benefiting your body and your health!
Get an exercise buddy. It is much more fun and easier to stay on track with someone else to help you monitor yourself and to talk to.

, Not getting enough sleep worsens your overall mental and physical health and may make it harder to shed pounds and to keep them off.In addition, those who are sleep deprived have increased ghrelin production. This is a hormone that makes you feel more hungry the next day.Try to make sure that you get about 8 hours of sleep each night if you're an adult (as a teenager you should get a bit more sleep).
Make sure to shut off all electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime. This means computer, iPod, cell phone, etc. The light from that messes with your circadian system, slowing your biological clock and making it harder to regulate your sleep appropriately.

, There are literally hundreds of diets and weight-loss schemes on the market promising quick weight loss in short periods of time. These can be unsafe, unhealthy and hard to follow long-term.Losing weight naturally is better for your overall health and you'll most likely keep your weight off long-term.
Remember that there is no magical diet that's going to wipe away those pounds and keep them away once you're done with the diet. True, healthy weight-loss requires a lifestyle change and hard work.This doesn't mean there aren't good things to be gleaned from certain weight-loss programs. Many of them do emphasize a healthy diet and exercise, but not many of them discuss real and continued lifestyle change.

, Studies have shown that if you're craving a treat, eating the fat-free, sugar free or ""diet"" versions may trigger you to eat more.Many foods that are designed to be ""diet-friendly"" aren't necessarily lower in calories. In addition, when you take out the sugar or fat from items, companies replace them with highly processed ingredients.
Stick to your portion control and eat a small portion of the real deal. So instead of the fat-free, sugar-free ice cream bar, have a 1/2 cup of high quality, real ice cream. You'll be more satisfied in the end.

, People who are distracted while they eat (they're watching tv or reading a book, or surfing the internet) report being less satisfied than people who pay attention to what they're eating. Eating mindfully can help you focus and possible eat less. Make sure that you chew your food all the way and that you swallow before putting more food in your mouth. Eat deliberately and slowly.
Pay attention to the food you're putting in your mouth: What is the temperature? The texture? Is it salty? Sweet? Spicy?
When you're satisfied (not full), stop eating. If you're measuring and monitoring your portions, this will be a helpful guide to let you know when you've had enough to eat.

Sleep an appropriate amount of time.",How to Lose Weight in Two Weeks," Most of us can reduce caloric intake very easily by making some small changes to our diet. Reducing portions, switching to lower fat products and eliminating sources of extra calories can make a big difference. Here are some ideas:


Put low fat or skim milk in your coffee or tea.
Make a sandwich with mustard instead of mayonnaise.
Drizzle, rather than pour salad dressing onto your salads.
Order or serve gravies and sauces on the side and dip your food in them, rather than eating them poured over your food.Skip the sauces and go for grilled meats, steamed vegetables, oil and vinegar dressings on salads.;
, Drinking a lot of water will aid in the overall process of weight loss. Water will help flush your system and keep your digestive system regular - all of which are important if you want to lose weight. It will also keep you hydrated which will be important if you are exercising as part of your weight loss plan.


Staying hydrated will give you energy and help keep you vibrant.
Drinking water is important if you will be exercising to lose weight.
Drinking plenty of water will help you keep regular bowel movements, which in turn will help you lose weight and stay healthy.
Multiply your weight in pounds by .66 to determine how much water (ounces) to drink daily. Then add 12 ounces (350 ml) of water for every 30 minutes you exercise or work out., Limiting your carb consumption will help you lose weight, too. Carbohydrates break down quickly in our bodies, leaving us feeling hungry again after only a short period of time. They also signal our bodies to store fat. Both of these are counterproductive to weight loss. It's hard to completely eliminate carbs, so try reducing them rather than not eating any.


Avoid excessive amounts of bread.
Consume only one serving a day of cereal.
Limit potatoes, rice, and corn.
Be careful. A low carb diet can be harmful to people with certain health problems. Don’t stay on a low carb diet for a long period of time without consulting your doctor., Protein will be one of your biggest friends when trying to lose weight in two weeks. This is because your body requires more energy to process protein than carbs. So you’ll be working to use calories without even knowing it. It is also because protein helps you feel fuller for longer. When choosing protein to eat, consider:


Fish.
Lean red meat with little fat.
Venison or other game.
Chicken
Turkey (white meat)
Legumes
Any meat or protein that is low fat., Eating more fruits and vegetables will help you lose weight quickly. Both fruits and vegetables keep you feeling full longer, so you won't be hungry as often. They're also packed with micronutrients your body needs to stay healthy, and vegetables have lots of fiber to keep you regular. As a result, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables will help you lose weight. Here are some other ideas:


At meal times, fill up at least half of your plate with vegetables.
Snack on carrots, cherry tomatoes or other veggies.
Add spinach, sliced cucumber or sliced bell pepper to your turkey sandwich.
Consider apples, berries, bananas, or other fruits.

, Sugar is naturally present in many foods that are good for you, like dairy products, vegetables, fruits and grains, so don't cut those out. Instead, eliminate the worst culprits: sweet baked goods, sugary cereals, fruit juices, soda and candy. Here are some other tips:


Stop adding sugar to your coffee or cereal.
Read labels carefully; sugar is added to many packaged foods, even ones you might not expect like pasta sauce, energy drinks and barbecue sauce.
Remember that sugar goes by many names. You might find it listed on packages as high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, maltose, sucrose, dextrose, or corn sweetener.

, Reducing sodium intake temporary can help us shed weight. Sodium causes our bodies to retain water, and water weight can account for 55-60% of your body weight. During the two weeks you are trying to lose weight, eliminate all the sodium you can from your diet. Here are some ideas:


Don't add salt to your food. Look for salt-free seasonings if you find your food too bland.
Eat as little processed and packaged food as possible - they're full of sodium.
If you do eat packaged foods, choose low-sodium versions.
Salad dressings and other sauces are often high in sodium. Omit these if you can, or use smaller amounts.
Lowering sodium may help improve your overall health., Many people consume a lot of calories from alcoholic drinks without even realizing it. Remember that these are empty calories and have no nutritional value! Moderate alcohol consumption is defined as one drink per day for women and two per day for men.During the two weeks you're trying to lose weight, try not to consume any alcohol. If you do, choose wisely. Here are some tips:


One serving of spirits (1 ounce or 30 ml) is 100 calories, one glass of wine (4 ounces or 125 ml) is 120 calories, and one beer (8 ounces or 230 ml) is 150 calories.
Choose simple cocktails - mixed drinks made with juices and liqueurs will have more calories than say, a vodka tonic.
Make a spritzer with white wine and club soda.
Try infused spirits - they are flavorful without added calories.
Have a light beer instead of regular beer.
Avoid drinks with sugar or other rims., If you want to lose weight in two weeks, you will need to get some exercise just about every day. You'll find greater success if you schedule time to exercise. Block off an hour each day for this purpose. Write it on the calendar or set a reminder on your phone, and treat it like any other appointment.

, Even though you’ve scheduled a time to exercise, you won’t exercise as much if you don’t enjoy it. That is why it is important to pick an exercise you like. Most importantly, it should be a cardio activity that pushes your limits and challenges you. A good challenging cardio activity will help you burn calories and get your metabolism humming.


Consider: walking, running, riding a bike, swimming, using an elliptical machine.
Try to do about an hour of cardio each day for weight loss.
If you are not accustomed to a lot of exercise, start slow, and work your way up to longer and more intense workouts.
Perform interval training, alternating short periods of high-intensity exercise with moderate exercise - is a great way to burn more calories., In addition to your chosen cardio workout, make sure you walk more than you normally do. This doesn’t need to be a scheduled time, but rather squeeze walking in all day long when you can. Ultimately, walking is one of the best forms of exercise and experts suggest taking at least 10,000 steps/day to promote weight loss.


Park at far end of the parking lot at work or the store.
Get up and take a stroll around the office at least once an hour.
March in place while you're watching TV.
Use a cordless phone and walk around while you're talking.
Take the stairs rather than the elevator whenever you can.
Try to do some brisk walking, this will get your heart rate up higher than normal walking and burn more calories., While cardio is the most important for losing weight in a short amount of time, you’ll find that some light weight training will compliment cardio wonderfully and help put you on the right track for short-term weight loss and long-term fitness and health. Consider:


Lateral pulldowns.
Bicep curls.
Push-ups
Lunges
Crunches., Healthy eating habits must be intentional - they don't just happen. People who plan for healthy eating are more successful at staying on track. Here are some ways you can do it:


Make a meal plan each week that includes healthy meals and snacks, and stick to it. At the beginning of the week, shop for the foods you need for those meals, so you have no excuses for not eating according to your plan.
Sit down and eat properly. Studies show that people who sit down at the table to eat from a plate will consume fewer calories than those who eat standing up or grazing from the package.
Keep healthy and nutritious snacks. Bring them with you in your purse or bag, so you will always be able to make good choices., Eating out frequently is a surefire way to increase your waistline. Instead, by cooking meals at home you'll find yourself consuming far fewer calories. Try to make most of the food you eat at home from scratch; you'll enjoy the benefits of knowing exactly what's in your food, and you can avoid diet killers like added sugar and salt.


Use less oils and butter.
Use less sugar.
Bake, broil, and grill food instead of frying., Watching TV is a sedentary activity during which you get little-to-no exercise. Research shows that adults who watch three or more hours of TV a day are more likely to be obese than those who watch an hour or less. It makes sense: when you're watching TV, you're not engaged in healthy activities that have you moving around. You're more likely to be snacking, too. If you do watch TV, consider:


Exercise while watching. Position your TV where you can see it from your exercise bike or treadmill, and enjoy your favorite show while burning calories.
Jog in place or do jumping jacks during commercials.
Hiding the remote. Make yourself get up to change the channel. This can reduce the amount of mindless surfing that we're all susceptible to sometimes.
Finding something to do with your hands so you don't snack while watching., Sleeping is a very important part of good nutrition and good health. Your body won’t be able to recover from exercise or metabolize foods as efficiently if you haven’t had enough sleep. Fundamentally, not having enough sleep will tax your body and undermine your overall goal of losing weight and being healthy.


Teenagers usually need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep.
Adults usually need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep.
Older adults usually need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep.
If you don’t get enough sleep, consider supplementing a night’s rest with a nap. Make sure not to nap for longer than an hour at a time.
Lack of sleep can cause you to gain weight.
Too much sleep can make you sluggish."

More than 2-3 pounds of weight loss risks damage to your health and loss of performance.Creating a schedule will be addressed in a later step, but think about this from the beginning.
You should talk about any significant diet changes with your doctor.;
, You don't want to get dehydrated during a match. Trying to cast off weight by removing water from your body is a major mistake athletes can make during this process.When you do workouts, try to take in water at 10-15 minute intervals.
During the day, you should drink a glass of water (approximately 8 ounces) 3-4 times.
Avoid drinking too many caffeinated beverages like soda and coffee. These drain water out of your body faster through urination.
Stay alert for symptoms of dehydration including if you are noticing signs of confusion, dizziness, feel lightheaded, have dry mouth, cannot make tears, and/or have unusually dry skin.

, Any athletic event you participate in requires a high calorie count for you to perform. Trimming fat while at least maintaining a reasonable amount of calories can help you lose weight and not sacrifice energy.High-school/college-aged wrestlers need a minimum of 1,000-2,500 calories per day plus at least 1,000 more calories for workouts.
These will be foods that are high in carbohydrates, low in fat, and that help you lose weight at a rate of at most 2-3 pounds per week.
Don't try to lose more than 2-3 pounds per week. More than this will result in muscle loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and body chemistry imbalances which will hurt your health and performance.
Schedule three regular meals per day, and ideally allow yourself one snack. Make sure you're eating 3-4 hours before your matches.
Wrestlers need approximately 1-1.5 grams of protein for 1 kilogram of body weight. This equates to roughly 68-102 grams for a 150 pound individual.

, This will give you energy for your morning workout routine(s) without excess sugar or fat.A sample breakfast of this kind might be 2 cups of whole-grain cereal (sugar-free), 1 cup low-fat milk, 1 large banana, 1 slice whole-wheat toast (w/ 2 teaspoons of peanut butter), and 1 cup of orange juice.
This breakfast should contain approximately 685 calories.

, For this wrestling weight-loss regimen, you want a good selection of fruits and vegetables with the meal.Lunch may include a whole-wheat pita sandwich stuffed with 3 ounces lean turkey, 1 ounce of low-fat cheese stuffed, with mustard, lettuce and tomato. You can have as sides 1 cup nonfat yogurt, an apple, and 1 cup of mixed greens with 2 tablespoons of low-fat dressing.
This lunch should contain approximately 600 calories.

, Dinner during this diet needs to fill you up, probably a few hours after a match or practice, and help rebuild muscle and nutrients.A wrestling weight-loss dinner could include a shrimp stir-fry with 4 ounces of shrimp, 2 cups of mixed vegetables with 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and low-sodium soy sauce, and a side of 1 cup of brown rice.
Such a dinner should contain approximately 570 calories.

, Snacks, unlike the meals, should be eaten within 30 minutes of the wrestling practice or meet. This will also help with muscle growth and repair.Any snack should combine carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Limit snacks to 100-200 calories.
A sample snack could be 1 cup of cereal (unsweetened) with 1 cup low-fat milk, 10 crackers (whole-grain, topped with 1 ounce of low-fat cheese), or 1.5 cups of low-fat chocolate milk.

, If you find yourself tending to over-indulge during sit down meals, you can mitigate this some by keeping healthy alternatives to eat during the day.These need to be fruits, or high carb/low fat foods.
If you are making purchases for snacks, go for the fruit and pretzels, not the chips or candy.

, This is a way for you to remind yourself of the time you have to make your weight loss goal, and the foods you need to gather and/or avoid.


Remember, you need to lose no more than 2-3 pounds per week or you risk making yourself unhealthy and unfit to perform.
Match your calendar to your wrestling schedule, and count backwards the number of weeks you have to make your weight goal. Make particular note of weigh-in dates.
Factor how many weeks it will take you to reach your goal at the 2-3 pound per week interval, and if you can reasonably make it. Do not force yourself past this rate of weight loss. simply to make a much lower weight class.
Do you have the kinds of foods you need around, or do you need to do significant grocery shopping? If you live with others, you might ask them to help you by avoiding putting the foods you need to avoid in easy to reach places--you might even ask them to swap the healthier foods in for some unhealthy options they are used to storing.

, Any significant diet changes can be enhanced by running the ideas by a medical expert who can point out deficiencies you might be suffering or advantages you can pursue.If you need to lose weight quickly, perhaps a couple of pounds within the next 24-48 hours, you can ask your doctor if there is any safe way to do this through a modified diet and cardio-vascular exercise. A medical professional is the only one you should consult for this. Crash diets, laxatives, sauna suits, and other cutting techniques can be hazardous to your health and leave you too weak to perform--avoid these methods.
Consider a reasonable amount of cardio-vascular exercise, thirty minutes up to one hour of running or biking. You don't want to exhaust yourself, use up all your stored nutrients for the match or practice, and/or risk physical injury before competition.
Your doctor may be able to recommend more specific foods, diet schedules, and vitamins to target for your regimen. During your consultation, you might ask something such as, ""I weigh ____ pounds now. I am preparing for a wrestling weigh-in and match in four weeks, what changes to my calorie in take do I need to make the next lower weight class at ___ pounds?""
Some foods and beverages for the diet period might include various combinations of quinoa, black beans, oats, avocados, salmon, blueberries, bananas, broccoli, rice, pears, oranges, grapefruit, nuts, green tea, eggs, dark chocolate, potatoes, and/or cheese
These foods can mixed in ways that will leave you feeling full with small servings to help drop a tiny amount of weight, but not cut out nutrients or carbohydrates you will need for competition later. You do not want to lose muscle mass and/or energy.

, Maintain your gym exercises. You don't want to lose the strength training regimen you already have.You want to be in shape for performance at your gym meets and practices, so keeping up your workouts is essential.
Keeping up the same and/or adding workouts while cutting your fats and overall calories (remember, you're not cutting too many), will help reduce your weight gradually.
Wrestling workouts focus on speed and power as with many athletic competitions.
Core exercises for power include push-ups, pull-ups, squats, dead-lifts, shoulder presses, sit-ups, bench presses.
The weight-bearing exercises can be done with fewer repetitions and heavier weight to build power.
For lower weights, use more repetitions to build endurance and conditioning.
For exercises that use only your body-weight (like the pull-ups and push-ups), use as many repetitions as possible to build endurance.

, There are some occupational methods you may consider.These can include non-standard weights and motions like rope climbing, rowing, twists, tire flipping, medicine ball tossing.
A sample work out might be 6 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 10 squats, 8 tire flips, 15 barbell shrugs, another set of pull-ups.

, You might want professional assistance if you don't already have it.


If you are already on a wrestling team, this discussion is best had with your coach and/or team trainer. You might open the talk by mentioning you want to wrestle in a different weight class, and want to adjust your workout routine along with any other changes you are making such as diet. They may guide you personally or recommend a particular trainer at a gym.
If you are already doing these workouts at a gym, or are about the start them, talk to the gym's staff about the availability of trainers to help you set up a workout routine for your goals. Perhaps ask, ""I want to reach a certain weight level for a wrestling meet, I would trainer assistance on my exercise regiment.""

, Take time to rest from your exercises during workouts and in between.You need recovery time from workouts so muscles can heal, rebuild, and get stronger.
Include cool-down periods for daily workouts. This means gradual reduction of the workout until includes--such as slowing your run to a walk in the minutes before it ends. Don't work out again for several hours.
Build in a day or two for recovery per week to allow your muscles time to replenish energy, fluids, rebuild tissue.
If you are using a personal trainer, they can build in intense workout periods along with rest days to maximize your strength training with your recovery time.

, This includes making sure your schedule to meet your new weight-loss goal is achievable.You need to match your caloric intake to your workouts. Just like wrestling matches, workouts require energy and burn calories.
Make sure you are eating according to the previous steps before and after workouts. This means meals high in carbohydrates and proteins, but low in fat.
Keep an eye on your daily schedule so you won't have any major disruptions in your time at the gym or ability to get proper meals before and after workouts. Having this schedule in mind will allow you to anticipate interruptions and work around them to improve the chances you will meet your weight loss goal without losing performance quality at the match.

, These are either ready-to drink mixtures or powders that need to be stirred in water, milk, or juice.These should not be used as meal replacements or you risk losing too many other nutrients you will need to build strength.
Typically, these shakes are composed of some combination of milk, whey, casein, egg, soy, and/or rice.
Whatever product you select should have 50-100 percent protein product or it may unnecessarily add weight.
Make sure to drink these after each workout. If you have a trainer, let them know you are using these. You might want to consult your doctor as well to make sure this is safe for you.
These shakes are usually dairy based, so keep that in mind in case tolerance for such products is or becomes an issue.

, Maintaining a healthy sleep cycle is good for your overall health as well as managing your eating and workout routines.The standard recommendation of 7-8 hours of sleep per night should work for you.
This applies even more so to times before wrestling practices and meets. You want to be well rested for optimum performance.
As with diet and exercise, if you live with others, let them know you are on a schedule and enlist their cooperation if possible in ensuring you are not disturbed at night.
Integrate your sleep cycle with your other routines so your dinner, snacking, breakfast, and workout routines fit in without rushing you from one to the other and leave you some buffer time in case of other events.

, You don't need to stay in the gym all day for strength training. When you're mixing up your routine, consider some outdoor activities.""Fireman"" carries, sledgehammer swings, and track and field activities can improve your strength, agility, and endurance.
You want to maintain routines for the most part to keep up schedules, confidence, and consistency in performance. But a change of routine on occasion will improve your interest in the workouts, and expand your body's ability to react to different situations.

, These are snack sized bars usually a mix of some candy flavoring (such as chocolate), protein, carbohydrates, and some fat. They are usually between 100 and 200 calories.An instance where you might use one of these is you are about to head into wrestling practice or a match and you suddenly feel low on energy, but cannot have a full meal.
You should consider trying these before some of your practices or workouts early to see how they will affect you.
Eat these before workouts (not afterwards like protein shakes).
These are available as commercially sold bars in a wide variety of flavors, and there are some homemade recipes.

Revisit your goals.",How to Lose Weight in One Month," Setting a realistic weight or health goal is a great start to your weight loss plan. It will give you something to track and work towards over the course of a month.


Think about how much weight you want to lose, what time frame and other health or wellness goals. Set a goal for how much weight and what target weight you'd like to get to within a month.
A healthy rate is generally considered 1 to 2 pounds a week. So what does this mean? Generally, you can lose up to 4 to 8 pounds in a month. Setting a goal to lose more than this amount is generally not realistic.
You may also want to set goals about exercise or lifestyle factors. For example, you might set a goal of working out three days a week for 30 minutes. This is a great health-based goal but will also support your weight loss.
Remember, dramatic weight loss is risky and often ineffective; the faster you lose weight, the easier you can gain it back. Only real lifestyle changes can give you effective results. “Fad diets”, such as diet pills or liquid cleanses may help you lose water weight, but most work by essentially starving you.;
, Taking measurements is the most effective way to track your progress. It also can provide information of whether or not your diet and exercise program are effective.


Weighing yourself regularly is an easy way to track your progress. Step on the scale one to two times per week and track your weight over time.You will most likely see the most weight loss in the first week or two during your month time frame.
Since weight alone doesn't tell you the full story of your weight loss, you might want to consider taking measurements. This can help you see where you're losing weight.
Take measurements around your shoulders, bust, waist, hips, thighs and measure them about once every two weeks. Over the course of a month, you should be able to see some noticeable changes.

, A journal is a great tool when losing weight. You can use it to help you prepare for weight loss, motivate you during weight loss and to help keep you on track to maintaining your weight.


Initially, jot down notes about your weight loss or health goals in your journal. Write about how much weight you want to lose and how you're going to track your progress.
You may also take notes on what aspects of your diet or lifestyle you think you want to change. For example, you might want to cut out sodas, increase your activity or eat more fruits and vegetables.In addition, you can use your journal to keep a food and exercise diary. Studies have shown that those people who keep track of their food intake and exercise are able to maintain weight loss longer., In order to lose weight, you'll need to cut out some calories each day. You can choose to cut out calories from diet alone or combine diet and exercise.


One pound of fat is about 3500 calories. To lose a pound of fat per week, you need to eat 3500 calories less than you take in each week. Cutting out 500 calories daily will help you lose one to two pounds per week.Following this plan over the course of the month will help you lose that 5 to 8 pounds.
Use your food journal or a food journal app to help you get an idea of how many calories you can cut out from your diet. Subtract 500 calories from a typical day to get a calorie level that will help you lose about one to two pounds per week.
Do not go below 1200 calories daily. This may result in nutrient deficiencies, loss of lean muscle mass and slower weight loss long-term.If you continuously do not eat an adequate amount of calories over a month, you may notice your weight loss slows or stops.
The best way to cut calories is to eat nutrient-rich, low-calorie foods combined with regular physical activity., When you're trying to lose weight and cut calories from your diet during the course of a month, you'll want to focus on eating low calorie, yet nutrient dense foods. These foods will help you meet lower calorie levels while still consuming adequate nutrition daily.


Nutrient dense foods are those that are moderately low in calories, but very high in nutrients like protein, fiber, vitamins or minerals. They have high amounts of nutrients for few calories.
Lean protein is a great example of a nutrient dense food that will aid in weight loss. It helps keep you satisfied longer throughout the day and when you choose leaner cuts, you'll be choosing lower calorie options.
Include a 3 to 4 oz serving of lean protein at each meal and snack.Try items like: poultry, lean beef, eggs, low-fat dairy, tofu or legumes.
In addition to protein, both fruits and vegetables are also considered to be lower calorie and nutrient dense.They contain higher amounts of fiber which can aid in digestion and your feeling of fullness and satisfaction.
Include a fruit or vegetable at each meal and snack. Aim for 1/2 cup of fruit or one small piece, one cup of vegetables or two cups of leafy greens as a serving., Choosing 100% whole grains is considered a better and more nutritious choice compared to refined grains or white flour.Try to make half of all your grain choices whole grain for the most nutritional benefit.


Whole grains contain higher amounts of protein, fiber and other essential nutrients. In addition, they are less processed.One serving of grains is about 1/2 cup or one ounce. Include two to three servings of grains daily.Some studies show that diets that are lower in grains and other carbohydrates result in quicker weight loss compared to low-calorie diets alone. Try limiting your grain choices for faster weight loss., Excess snacking or grazing throughout the day may work against your weight loss and may even cause weight gain - especially if you're only giving yourself one month to lose weight. Be mindful of your snacks and limit them to help you lose weight.


Some snacks can fit into your weight loss plan. Choose snacks that are 150 calories or less and that are high in protein and fiber.This combination will give you some energy, essential nutrients and keep you feeling satisfied longer.
Some examples of healthy snacks include: a low-fat cheese stick and a piece of fruit, a small greek yogurt or a hard boiled egg.
Try to snack only if you're feeling physically hungry and it is over an hour or two until your next planned meal or snack.If you're feeling hungry and it's almost time for a planned meal, wait it out. Try drinking some water or other calorie free beverages to take the edge off your hunger until it's time to eat.

, It's fine to indulge once in a while, but to lose weight, you'll need to limit unhealthy items from your day-to-day diet when you're trying to lose weight within a month's time frame. These foods are generally higher in calories and much lower in nutrients. Here are some common culprits to avoid:


Soda
Chips and crackers
Candy and desserts
White pasta, rice, bread
Foods high in processed sugar, cane sugar, or high fructose corn syrup
Energy drinks and sugary/creamy coffees

, Not only can water keep you feeling full, it can help you manage your hunger and stay hydrated throughout the day.


Aim for about 64 oz or 8 glasses of water daily at a minimum. Some people may even need up to 13 glasses of water daily to stay adequately hydrated.
Carry around a water bottle. You may see that with the reminder of a full water bottle, you’ll find yourself drinking much more water simply because it is there.
There are ways to jazz up your water without adding lots of calories. Try adding citrus slices (lemon, lime, orange), 0-calorie drink mixes, or making decaf or herbal teas.

, Cardiovascular exercise is named so because it gets your heart pumping. Aim for 150 minutes(2 hrs and 30 min.) of aerobic exercise each week.Over the course of a month, you can make a serious contribution to your weight loss with physical activity.


You have to make time for exercise. Get creative! Go for a walk before work, or maybe go to the gym right after work. Bike to work, and even start scheduling more physical activities over the weekend.
Make exercise dates with others. If you make a commitment to someone else, you’re much less likely to break it.Try to find an activity you enjoy. Working out is a lot less painful if you can feel like you're having fun.
Activities to try include: running, hiking, swimming, dance classes, and at home exercise tapes.

, In addition to cardio and aerobic exercise, try to include one to three days of strength training.This will help you maintain your weight loss after your month of dieting ends.


Lifting weights or using weight machines helps your body build lean muscle mass. The more muscle mass you have the lower your risk of osteoporosis and the more calories your body burns at rest.In addition to lifting weights, yoga and pilates focus on building strength and stamina. These can be challenging at first but grow to be incredibly relaxing while building muscle mass.

, Just because you’re exercising now doesn’t mean you can eat as much as you want. Try to maintain the same nutritious, weight loss diet while you're exercising.


If you must reward yourself or are having a food craving try a lower calorie, more nutritious option. For example, if you're craving something sweet try going for a yogurt and fruit parfait, or a fruit salad.
Try to enjoy the endorphin rush that comes after you finish your workout instead of reaching for a snack. For example, you could recline in a chair and focus on how your body feels or take a long relaxing shower.
Also, increased exercise may make you feel more hungry throughout the day. Ensure you're eating enough protein throughout the day and are eating regularly. If you need an extra snack, keep it to the 150 calorie maximum.

, In addition to strength training and planned aerobic exercise, another way to increase your total calorie burn and weight loss is by moving more throughout your day.


Lifestyle activity, or those exercises that are a regular part of your daily routine can help burn additional calories. These are activities that you do daily - walking to and from your car, going up and down the stairs, walking to get the mail or raking the leaves in your yard.
Many of these activities do not burn a ton of calories alone. However, when combined by the end of the day, they can make a significant contribution to how many calories you've burned all day long.
Increase your daily activities and movement over the course of your month time frame. Try parking farther away, always taking the stairs, going for a short walk break on your lunch hour or doing some light yoga before bed.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, even in a short amount of time, having a support group is helpful.


Studies have shown that those people with support groups have better success with their weight loss long-term.Try asking friends or family members to help support you through your weight loss. They can be there to be motivating or to hold you accountable.
Also consider asking them to join you on your weight loss diet. Many people are looking to lose some extra weight and it can be more fun to do it together.

, Compare against the measurements you took during the first week. Keep track of your results, and let the small victories keep you going.


Keeping weighing yourself as well. After one month, you might decide to lose another 5 pounds or to continue on with your diet for another month to see how much additional weight you can lose.
Also keep track of your measurements. You might have toned down all over, but now want to focus on toning and building muscle in your body.

, A fun way to stay on track and to keep up motivation is by rewarding yourself. Setting up small incentives may help you stay on track or help you maintain your weight loss long-term.


Set up small rewards when you meet smaller goals. For example, when you follow the first week of your new diet and exercise program, you might reward yourself with a few new workout songs.
Set up bigger rewards when you meet larger goals. For example, you might buy yourself a new outfit when you lose the first 5 pounds.
It's generally not recommended to reward yourself with food or dinners out when you're trying to lose weight. These types of rewards may work against your long-term goal.

, So your month is up. You've probably lost some weight and maybe even have gotten into better shape. Revisit your weight goal to see if you want to continue your current diet.


Although you can make significant progress during one month's time frame, if you have more than 10 pounds to lose, you'll most likely need to continue your diet and exercise plan to see further weight loss.
Even if you've met your weight goal, you might want to consider keeping up with increased activity to help maintain your weight loss and physical fitness level.
If you haven't met your weight goal yet, keep on going. Or, if you need to, make some changes to your diet and exercise plan to help induce more weight loss or make the plan fit better into your lifestyle.

If you're thinking, ""Whoa, one of those huge arcade machines in my home?,
Buy a DDR game that is made for whatever kind of gaming device you have.,

There are many home versions, games for PlayStation, Xbox, Wii, etc. and you don't need a metal pad like the ones in arcades (unless you want one, but they're a lot more expensive and you need shoes to play them) You can get soft mats for around $20-30 each depending on brand. Get some of these.;
, Get a mat (or two, if you want to play with a friend) If you're unsure of which version of DDR you want, go look at the list of songs each one has on the internet and choose one you like.

, Do a couple of songs until you've got the hang of it. Don't worry if you're not good (or completely fail) at first, it will not be difficult forever and most DDR games have tutorials with them.

, Create a profile and start doing some songs on there. It will tell you how many calories you've burned when you're done! Try to start burning around 200 calories a day. This shouldn't take long.

, Now the songs will burn 10-40 calories each and you'll be both healthy and a DDR expert.

, If you keep eating junk food, you could do DDR 24/7 and you still won't lose weight. Follow the guidelines in How to Lose Weight.

Keeping track of all your meals, snacks, and beverages will help you get a good idea of what your diet looks like. You'll be able to learn a lot from this information - like what good eating habits you have and what ones might need to change.Include work days and weekend days. You typically eat differently on your days off than you do on a more scheduled weekday.Take some time and circle or highlight any problem areas you see. For example, take note of nighttime or boredom snacking or extra large portions.
Be sure to keep honest and accurate notes of everything. This exercise won't be as helpful if you're not accurate with your reporting.;
, Counting calories or points, measuring portions or avoiding certain food groups can make dieting frustrating and unappealing. To make life easy, try eating smaller portions. Even without changing the foods you eat, smaller portions automatically cut out some calories and may result in weight loss.If you don't want to measure specific portions, use plates or bowls that will limit how much food you can consume at one sitting. Use salad or appetizer plates, smaller bowls or try using a smaller fork to eat with.
Drink a glass of water before eating. This will help you feel more satisfied and curb your hunger before a meal which could result in smaller portions.Listen to your body. If you pay attention and take your time eating, you'll notice you feel satisfied with a smaller portion. Eating too fast or not paying attention to how you feel sets you up to finish off larger portions that you actually need.

, Fruits and vegetables are low calorie, nutritious foods that can help aid weight loss. If you make half of your portions a fruit or a vegetable, this will help cut down on overall calories and help support weight loss.Choose a variety of different fruits and vegetables each day. Try to go for different colors throughout the day as well. Each color contains different essential nutrients.When you're preparing fruits and vegetables, it is best to eat them raw. If you cook them, use only small amounts of oil or fats such as butter. This will help keep the calories low.Fruits and vegetables will also add volume and bulk to your dishes. They help make you feel like you're eating more, but keep the calories low.

, Protein foods are another important part to a weight loss plan. High protein foods that are low in fat help keep you feeling satisfied but also keep calories low.Try to choose low-fat or leaner protein choices. Choose white meat or poultry without skin, lean cuts of beef or low-fat dairy instead of full fat. Items like eggs, seafood, legumes, or tofu are generally lower in calories.
Prepare lean protein without adding excessive amounts of butter or oil and do not deep fry these items. Also be aware of high calorie sauces, marinades or dressings.

, There are many benefits to whole grain foods. They are higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients compared to foods that are made from refined white flour (like white bread).The extra fiber that whole grains provide can also help you stay satisfied with less and keep you feeling satisfied longer.If you're not a fan of 100% whole grains, try just making 1/2 of your grain choices whole. Also try a variety of different types of whole grains or brands. With some trial and error you might find something you enjoy.
Whole grain foods to try include: oats, quinoa, brown rice, 100% whole grain bread or barley.

, One of the harder things to do when dieting or losing weight is to cut back and monitor treats and indulgences. These types of foods or beverages need to be monitored in order to successfully lose weight and maintain weight loss.Decide what ""moderation"" means to you. It could mean a sweet treat once a week, a glass of wine every Friday night or a higher calorie dinner a few times a month.
Be honest about how often you're indulging. If you're treating yourself too often you'll have difficulty losing weight.
Another way to limit indulgences is to choose one indulgence at a time. For example, if you're out to dinner choose to have a glass of wine or dessert. Not both. Or choose a burger and a side salad instead of a burger and fries.

, If there are easy, on-the-go, healthy options available, you'll be more likely to pick these items over unhealthy treats.Keep healthy, easy to eat snacks around like: fresh fruit (make sure to wash and cut if needed), washed, and cut vegetables, individual yogurts or containers of cottage cheese, low-fat cheese sticks, individual bags of nuts or hard boiled eggs.
Also keep easy to prepare items around for quick meals. For example, choose pre-washed or cut vegetables or frozen vegetables to help get meals on the table with ease.

, Studies show that people who drink sweetened or high calorie beverages weigh more and have difficulty losing weight compared to people who stick to low or no calorie beverages.Ditch sugary, sweetened beverages like: regular soda, fruit juices, sports drinks, sweetened teas and coffees.
Try to drink at least 64 oz or 2 L of no-calorie beverages like: water, sugar-free flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee or tea and no-calorie sports drinks., If you don't have time or don't want to spend time exercising regularly, try increasing your daily lifestyle activities. These are exercises you already do and increasing them can help you burn more calories throughout the day.Think about your day and see if you can find additional ways to add in more steps or to move more. A little planning can help you find a few ways to add in activity or find an extra few minutes to be active.
Try adding in activity like: taking the stairs over the elevator, parking far away from your destination and standing or walk in place during TV commercials.
Make a rule to walk to your destinations if they are under 1 mile (if safe and appropriate for you). Skip taking the bus or driving.

, Going to the gym, doing high intensity aerobic classes or spending money on expensive equipment isn't possible or comfortable for everyone. Walking is an activity that most healthy people can do that can help burn calories and increase your cardiovascular fitness.If you walk 30 minutes on five days of the week, you'll be meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity (150 minutes per week).If you don't have time for a full 30 mins, try breaking up your walk into three 10 minute increments.

, You don't have to spend hours in the gym or purchase expensive equipment to include strength training. Even light weight resistance training can help increase muscle mass and muscle tone.Again, you can break up your strength training routine into 10 minute increments if it fits better into your schedule.
Try including exercises that are easy to do at home and require no extra equipment. Exercises can include: sit ups, push ups, tricep dips, lunges or side leg lifts.

, Sometimes people think exercise just means running on a treadmill, but there are tons of ways to get exercise, inside and outside the gym. Try a new machine at the gym, or go for a long bike ride or a challenging hike. Try jumping rope or playing hopscotch with your kids or younger siblings.


Put on some upbeat music and dance around your house. This is a fun way to get your heart rate up and get some exercise.
Make walking fun by taking an interesting tour or visiting a local museum. Or try skipping instead of walking or running.
Play a sport. Try joining a local soccer, tennis or basketball team for a fun and exciting way to be active.

Write your weight-loss meal plan.",How to Lose Weight if You Dislike Vegetables1," Speaking to a doctor prior to a new diet or weight loss plan is a good idea. They may be able to give you alternative diets or suggest vitamin or minerals to supplement your diet with since you'll be avoiding or minimizing your vegetable intake.


Review your current weight, weight goals, medications and health history with your doctor.
Your doctor also may be able to refer you to a local dietitian for additional help.;
, These nutrition experts will be able to guide you on your weight loss diet. They'll also be able to help provide you with different alternatives for vegetables.


Ask your dietitian for help designing a meal or eating plan that doesn't focus heavily on vegetables but that could still produce weight loss.
To find a dietitian in your area, visit theEatRight website and click on the orange ""Find an Expert"" button on the top right.

, Setting goals for yourself with a weight loss plan can help you keep you on track and help you stay motivated.


Be specific with your goals. You want to set goals that are specific and realistic for you. Also give yourself an end date.
Remember, large a amount of weight loss in a short period of time is not realistic or healthy.Focus on losing smaller amounts of weight over longer periods of time.
Realize that with a lack of vegetable consumption (and subsequent fiber consumption), weight loss may be slower.
Set smaller goals before your long-term goals. For example, if you want to lose 20 pounds in five months, a smaller goal would be to lose four pounds within the first month.

, Meal plans can help making dieting and weight loss a bit easier. You'll have your own plan to follow throughout the week. Having all your meals and snacks planned can help keep you organized and focused.


Spend some free time writing up an entire week's meals and snacks. It's much easier to stick to a diet when you have a plan in place.
Although you may be avoiding or minimizing the amount of vegetables that you include in your meal plan, make sure you're including all the other food groups: fruits, protein, dairy and whole grains.
Be sure to plan for quick meals, easy-to-cook items, or meals that require little cooking if necessary. You want to be realistic with your meal plan. If a scratch-made dinner isn't realistic each night, make sure to account for that.

Eat two to three servings of fruit daily.,
Make or purchase your own juices.,
Make smoothies.,
Consume lean protein and whole grains.,
Take a supplement.,
Try new vegetables.,
Add vegetables to your recipes.",How to Lose Weight if You Dislike Vegetables2," With any weight loss plan, it's important to measure your portion sizes. If you overeat, even relatively healthy foods, you can gain weight. Decreasing your portion sizes can be a fairly simple way of decreasing your overall calorie intake, which can result in weight loss.When planning and serving your meals and snacks, follow these standard portion sizes: 1 serving of fruit is 1/2 cup or 1 small whole fruit, 1 serving of grains is 1 oz or 1/2 of a cup, 1 serving of lean protein is 3 oz, and 1 serving of low-fat dairy is 1 cup (milk and yogurt) or 2 oz of cheese. If you do eat some vegetables, 1 serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy vegetables., Counting calories is another fairly simple way to lose weight. Cutting out a few calories from each meal and snack may help you lose weight. You can also try swapping out higher calorie foods for lower calorie foods to help decrease your total calorie intake each day.Losing weight safely means only dropping one to two pounds per week. In terms of calories, that equates to eating about 500 calories less each day.If you cut out more than 500 calories daily or are eating less than 1200 calories daily, you could be at risk for nutrient deficiencies. Weight loss achieved with very low calorie diets is generally not sustainable long-term., Fruits and vegetables are one of the main sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in your diet. Avoiding or minimizing the amount of vegetables you consume can minimize how many nutrients you get through the foods you choose. Focus on consuming adequate fruit daily to maximize the nutrition content of your diet.


It's recommended to consume about two servings of fruit daily. This equates two two pieces or two cups of fruit.Each color fruit offers you a different nutrient. Choose a variety of fruit and different colored fruits each day to maximize your intake of different nutrients.Also, eat nutrient-dense fruits. Although all fruit is a healthy choice, some fruits offer more nutrients than others. For example, try these: oranges, grapefruits, blackberries and strawberries., Juicing has recently become a more popular way for people to consume fruits and vegetables. If you're not a fan of raw or cooked vegetables, adding them to a juice might make them more palatable.


Vegetable juice is available at grocery stores. Try a few brands to see if any of them are tasty. If so, add one to two servings of vegetable juice to your meal plan.
If buying a fruit/vegetable juice combo from the store, make sure to buy 100% juice. Do not purchase juice mix cocktails, juice concentrate, or any products with added sugar.

Try making your own juice at home. You can purchase a juicer and make a variety of combinations yourself. Many times, vegetable juice is completely masked when mixed with sweet fruit like pineapple or apples.

, Like juices, smoothies are another method of getting in a few servings of vegetables. Many vegetables, like spinach, are almost tasteless when mixed with frozen fruit and other flavorings.


Try different combinations of fruits, vegetables and mixing liquids to see if there is a combination that strikes your fancy.
Vegetables that mix well with fruit smoothies include: spinach, beets, and carrots. These vegetables are slightly sweet and blend well with sweet fruit.
Another benefit of smoothies is that you're keeping the entire fruit or vegetable whole, which means you're consuming the fiber from these foods.

, With any weight-loss program, it's important to eat a balanced diet. Although you may be avoiding vegetables, consuming foods from the protein, dairy, and grain group is important to a well-balanced and healthy diet.


Choose lean protein if possible. Items like these are considered lean protein: poultry, lean red meat, pork, seafood, lentils/beans and eggs.
Dairy foods are excellent sources of protein, calcium and Vitamin D.These should be low-fat if possible. Choose from: low-fat milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and cheese.
100% whole grains contain fiber and vitamins that will support your weight loss.Choose items like these whole grains: brown rice, quinoa, barley, 100% whole wheat pasta or millet.

, Vitamin and mineral supplements may be a good idea to take when you're following a diet and especially when you're following a diet with limited vegetable intake.


There are a variety of nutrients found in vegetables that will need to be replaced by other foods or supplements. Vegetables provide high amounts of potassium, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, and antioxidants.Take a 100% complete multi-vitamin/multi-mineral each day.
Note that supplements are not meant to fully replace foods or entire food groups in your diet. Think of a supplement more as a ""back up"" then a full replacement.

, Even though you may not like vegetables or want to minimize them in your diet, it's important to understand they are a valuable and nutritious food group that should be included daily. If you're having trouble finding a vegetable that you enjoy, work on finding new ones to try or different recipes that you might enjoy.


Try, try, and try again. There may be a vegetable that you don't particularly enjoy, but haven't tried it in a while. Give it another go. You might be surprised your taste buds have changed.
Buy a vegetable you've never tried before. Maybe there's an exotic or interesting item you'd be willing to try. Bring it home and prepare it to see if it's something you'd be willing to eat more regularly.
Try preparing vegetables with different cooking methods. A steamed brussels sprout might not be appetizing, but when they're roasted, they're nutty and delicious!
Try vegetables that you're more willing to like. Many vegetables are slightly sweet and don't have a strong or bitter flavor. Consider trying: peas, green beans, carrots, tomatoes, and bell peppers.
Try to avoid putting a lot of sauce, gravy or dressings on vegetables. Although a cheese sauce makes broccoli tasty, it's generally higher in fat, calories and sodium. Overdoing it with sauces like these can work against your weight loss.
A great option is to purchase kale or spinach, puree it until it is in small pieces, freeze it and add it to recipes.

, You may not enjoy a side of steamed vegetables, but there are some tricks to sneak in a few vegetables into different meals and recipes.


Puree extra vegetables in soups or sauces. This works great for tomato sauce. You can also add pureed carrots or butternut squash to your mac and cheese.
Vegetables are also well-hidden in baked goods. Try adding pureed vegetables to items like meatloaf or meatballs. You can also add shredded zucchini, summer squash, or carrots to foods like muffins and cakes.

Weigh yourself weekly.,

Reevaluate your progress.",How to Lose Weight if You Dislike Vegetables3," Whenever you're trying to lose weight, it's important to weigh yourself regularly. You'll be able to see your progress and determine how well your diet is working.


Weigh yourself about one to two times per week. Hopping on the scale each day doesn't show you the most accurate progress overall. Daily fluctuations in weight (either a gain or loss) are normal and might not reflect your true overall progress.For the most accurate trend, weigh yourself at the same time of day, on the same day of the week and wear the same clothes (or wear no clothing).
Regular weigh-ins have also been shown to help prevent weight-gain., Keeping a food journal has been shown to help people succeed with weight loss.Jot down all your meals and snacks. It's harder to fall off track if you know you you'll need to document everything.


You can purchase a journal or food journaling app. Track as many days as you can. , Check in with yourself every month or two to reevaluate your progress. Consider how much weight you've lost and how this diet has worked for you. Again, a diet low in vegetables may be cause for slower weight loss.


If you're doing well, losing weight and enjoying the diet you've adopted, keep going until your goal weight.
If you notice your weight loss has slowed or stopped, take a step back and reevaluate your lifestyle. Being more diligent with your food journal can help see if there's any areas where you've slipped up or are eating more than you should.

Keep a journal.",How to Lose Weight Gradually," One of the things you may need to change about your diet is how much you eat per meal. Large portions may mean too many calories and weight gain. Cut back on portions to help you gradually lose weight.Many health professionals will tell you to eat until you're ""satisfied"" not full. This is a hard area to detect, but with some practice you can stop eating at just the right time.
Satisfied is a lack of hunger, a slight disinterest in your meal and a feeling that the food you've eaten will hold you for a few hours.Full feels like a slight to large stretching sensation in your stomach, the thought that those last few bites were too much or you've had second portions.Eat your meal slowly. Taking your time with your meal will help your brain and stomach communicate that you're satisfied and help you stop before you're full.Schedule meals so that you have an appetite, but are not starving, when you do eat. Starting a meal when you are super hungry, or have been starving yourself all day, may lead to overeating.;
, In addition to eating smaller portions, you'll need to be mindful of your total calorie intake. Too many calories daily causes weight gain.


It's typically recommended to cut out about 500 calories daily. This coincides with your goal to lose weight gradually. A 500 calorie deficit each day will result in about 1-2 pounds of weight loss each week.You can either cut out 500 calories from your food or burn off 500 calories with exercise. The best is to do a combination of both.Try keeping a food journal or using a food journaling app on your smart phone. This may make it easier to track your foods and total calories each day.

, Both fruits and vegetables are low calorie foods that can help support a slow and gradual weight loss.The USDA recommends that you make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable. These highly nutritious foods can bulk up your meals without adding too many calories to your day. You may feel satisfied on a lower calorie amount due to the higher fruit and vegetable content.
Try to include at least 1-2 servings of these foods per meal. Aim for 1/2 cup (170 grams) or 1 small piece of fruitor 1 cup (340 grams) of vegetables or 2 cups (28 grams) of leafy greens.

, It's important to include protein every day for a balanced diet. However, studies have shown that lean protein aids in weight loss and helps maintain your weight long-term.Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. Studies have also shown that it's very satisfying and satiating to your body. You may feel less hunger throughout the day when you eat regular servings of protein.Go for lean sources of protein. They are typically lower in calories and fat and will support your desire to lose weight slowly. Also stick to appropriate portion sizes of protein. Measure out 3-4 oz of protein or about 1/2 cup.
Lean protein sources include: eggs, poultry, seafood, lean pork, legumes, tofu and lean beef.

, Many diets avoid grains and other carb-rich foods. However, including a serving or two of 100% whole grains can still allow you to lose weight gradually.


Whole grains are minimally processed and contain every part of the grain: the germ, bran and endosperm. These parts together make grains higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients.Examples of whole grains include: brown rice, quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat bread. Stick to the appropriate portion size of 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains per serving.This amounts to one slice of bread, half of a bun, and half a cup or 125 milliliters of rice, pasta, or quinoa.
Try to limit or avoid more refined or processed grains since these are less nutritious. Items like white bread, white rice or plain pasta are more refined.

, Water is another essential nutrient to your diet. Being adequately hydrated helps keep your body healthy, but it can also support gradual weight loss.


Water is involved in a variety of functions in your body including lubricating joints, maintaining blood pressure and protecting organs.In addition, being adequately hydrated can help you feel more satisfied throughout the day.
Try to stick to no or low-calorie, decaffeinated beverages. Try water, flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee and tea.
Most health professionals will recommend getting a minimum of 8 glasses of water daily. However, depending on your age, gender and activity level, you may need up to 13 glasses daily., Whenever you're trying to lose weight, you should try to limit any excess foods and snacks. Although they can be a part of your diet, they should only be included occasionally.


Snacks can provide you with a boost of energy and an extra shot of nutrition. However if you snack when you're bored, stressed or just craving certain foods, this may lead to some weight gain over time.
Make snacks count. Only snack if you're truly hungry. In addition, only snack if your next meal is more than an hour away. If you're feeling hungry, but dinner is in 30 minutes, drink some water and wait until dinner to eat.
Also limit the calorie content of snacks. Keeping snacks to 100-150 calories per snack can help make sure you stick to your total calorie intake and support your weight loss.Appropriate snack examples can include: 3 oz or 85 grams beef jerky, an apple with a cheese stick, about 10 almonds, or 1/2 cup or 113 grams of cottage cheese.

, A great addition to a healthy diet is exercise. Cardio in particular helps your body burn calories and support a gradual weight loss.Aerobic exercises don't cause a lot of weight loss alone. It's when combined with diet that you see the best results for weight loss.
Health professionals recommend that you include at least 2 1/2 hours or about 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio activities each week.This amount of exercise comes with a lot of health benefits outside of weight loss. It can also improve your sleep and mood and decrease your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Try activities like: walking, jogging, hiking, swimming or doing an aerobics class.

, In addition to cardio, it's recommended to include a few days of strength training. This type of exercise can also support gradual weight loss.


Weight training or resistance exercises also do not cause a lot of weight loss by themselves. However, they can increase your lean muscle mass which may help support a faster metabolism in the future and increase your body's ability to burn calories.Aim to include about 1-3 days of strength training each week. Try to work every major muscle group and do your exercises for at least 20 minutes per session.The following activities can count as weight training: weight lifting, using weight machines, or doing isometric exercises.

, Another great way to help you burn more calories and gradually lose weight is by increasing your lifestyle activity.


Lifestyle or baseline activities are things you do in your typical day.They could be anything - raking leaves, gardening, mopping the floor or even walking to and from your car. These activities do not burn many calories at one time, but added up together at the end of the day can make a significant impact on your health and weight.
You can also do yoga or pilates, both of which are good for posture, flexibility, improving balance, and mind-body connection.
Think about your typical day and how much you move and walk around. Are there ways you can add more movement or steps to your day? Try parking further away, taking the stairs more often, going for short walk breaks at work or doing exercises during commercial breaks while you watch TV.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight or make changes to your diet or exercise plan, you should talk to your doctor first.


Your doctor will be able to tell you whether or not weight loss is safe or appropriate for you. He or she may also be able to give you additional guidance or advice on how much weight to lose and how to go about losing it.
Also talk to your doctor about what you plan on changing regarding your diet or exercise routine. Make sure that he or she thinks that's safe for you.
You may also want to consider asking your doctor for a referral or recommendation to a local registered dietitian. These nutrition professionals are experts in weight loss and may be able to help you lose the extra weight.

, Many studies show that regular weigh-ins can help you lose weight, stay accountable and even maintain your weight loss long-term.Since regular and consistent weigh-ins may help you lose weight, it's ideal to weigh yourself at least once a week. You can even increase your weigh-ins to 2 times weekly.
It's not typically advisable to weigh yourself daily as you will day to day fluctuations. These normal and expected fluctuations may discourage or frustrate you.Stick to 1-2 weigh-ins weekly to see an accurate reflection of your weight loss trend.
Also try to weigh yourself at the same time of day and in the same clothes. This again will help with the consistency and accuracy of your weigh-ins.

, Keeping a journal can be a great tool for you when you're trying to lose weight. Many studies show that journaling can help you stay accountable with your weight loss plan.Try keeping track of your weights and overall progress towards your goal. When you keep track of your weight you'll be able to pick up on any unwanted trends (like a weight gain). Then you can make any adjustments you need to your diet or exercise routine.
It may also be helpful to keep a food journal. Studies have shown that regular food journaling can keep you accountable with your diet.It can also serve as a great resource if you find you're not losing weight or gaining weight.
Lastly, you might find it helpful to journal about your exercise. Keep notes on when you exercised, for how long and what exercise you did.

Most health professionals will recommend cutting out anywhere from 500-750 calories daily. This will yield about a 1–2-pound weight loss each week.Never consume less than 1,200 calories per day. Eating fewer calories than this will make it almost impossible to consume enough nutrients to sustain daily bodily functions. Also, your body can go into starvation mode, retaining what nutrients it does receive, and inhibiting your metabolism. Start keeping track of the calorie content of all the foods you eat and measuring your portion sizes. Read nutrition labels or use online calorie calculators like Calorie King or MyFitnessPal for calorie information.;
, When you are restricting the amount of calories you eat, it's important to make nutritious food choices so that you provide your body with the nutrients it needs.


Studies show that diets comprised of mostly lean proteins and vegetables result in quicker weight loss compared to other dieting styles (like low-fat diets).Include a variety of lean protein options like poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, seafood, legumes or lean beef.
Non-starchy vegetables should be eaten at each meal and snack. Choose items like broccoli, green-leaf salad, cauliflower, green beans, artichokes, eggplants, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale, Swiss chard, asparagus, or tomatoes.
Although starchier vegetables are a healthy choice, they are higher in carbohydrates which you should limit to some degree if you want fast weight loss.These include vegetables like carrots, peas, corn, potatoes and sweet potatoes.

, Although these foods are healthy additions to any diet, they contain slightly higher amounts of carbohydrates which can slow your rate of weight loss.


Include 1 serving of fruit daily. Choose 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or eat one small whole piece.If you choose to eat a grain based food, try to choose 100% whole grains. These foods are higher in fiber and other essential nutrients. One serving of whole grains is about 1 oz or 1/2 cup., When you're trying to lose weight quickly, you'll need to keep tight control on your daily calorie intake. Snacks should be limited to help support this.


Having the occasional snack may be appropriate. If you're choosing to snack, keep the calories below 150 per snack.Include some lean protein to help keep you satisfied until your next meal and a fruit or vegetable for an extra hit of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Have a snack if there is more than two hours prior to your next meal or before or after a workout.

, Not only does drinking enough water help your body function properly, it can aid in weight loss by keeping you full in between meals.


Most experts will tell you to drink at least eight 8-oz glasses of water per day. They may even suggest consuming up to 13 glasses daily depending on gender and activity level.If you struggle with overeating, then drink two full glasses of water before each meal to help fill your stomach up.
People oftentimes mistake thirst for hunger. If you find yourself desperately craving a snack but are not physically hungry, chances are that you're dehydrated.

, It's a lot easier to control portion sizes and calorie content when you cook your own meals at home.


If you must eat out, order a healthier option. You could try: salad with some type of lean protein (like salmon, chicken, or tofu) and ask for the dressing on the side, simply grilled protein with a side of steamed vegetables or split a higher-calorie entree with friends or family.
You may also want to consider packing a lunch to bring with you to school or work. This may also help save you money.

, Exercise can help speed up your weight loss by burning extra calories and speeding up your metabolism.


Aim to get at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise. If you can, aim for 300 minutes weekly to burn even more calories.Exercises include jogging, hiking, biking, swimming, kickboxing, and dancing--basically anything that gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat., Many women avoid lifting weights at all costs out of fear of gaining ""bulk;"" however, increasing and toning your muscle mass can actually help you lose more weight.


The more muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns at rest. This is due to the increase in your metabolism as you gain muscle mass.
Aim for at least two days of strength or resistance training. You can increase this to three to four as long as you provide a rest day for each worked muscle group.To get toned without adding bulk, do many reps with a low resistance weight. For more bulk, do fewer reps with a higher resistance weight.

, You may want to try sipping on a flavored beverage like coffee or tea to help curb your appetite.If you choose decaffeinated tea or coffee, these beverages can also count towards your daily fluid goals.
Beware of calorie-ridden ""coffee drinks"" like flavored lattes and mochas, some of which contain almost 400 calories.Always choose sugar-free items when possible.

, Moderation is key since we do not fully understand the effects of artificial sweeteners and how they affect our brain chemistry to control appetite. Many times, when you're trying to lose weight quickly, you may notice some increased hunger in between meals and snacks. Chewing gum or sucking on hard candies can help curb your appetite.Some studies have shown that chewing gum simulates eating and tells your brain you're ""satisfied."" This chewing sensation can decrease your appetite and provide a sense of satiety.The same principle applies to hard candies. In addition, they will generally last longer as they dissolve in your mouth.

, Many people will experience one or a few stalls in their weight loss. This is normal and to be expected so don't give up on your plan.


Weight stalls are when you've been actively losing weight and for a week or more you notice that your weight has not decreased.There are a variety of reasons behind weight stalls.Review your exercise patterns, food journal if you've been keeping one and any other lifestyle habits. If you've been slacking at exercise or snacking more than usual, this may be the cause of your weight stall; however, even if you've stayed 100% on track, it can be normal to experience a stall.
When you've hit a weight plateau, ensure you're sticking to your plan and be patient. As your body adjusts to your new weight, you should see your weight loss restart.

, Any big lifestyle change can be difficult to follow long-term. Journaling can help you keep track of your progress and be a place to vent frustrations or write about exciting progress.


Studies have shown that journaling can help dieters in a variety of ways. Keeping track of your food will help keep you accountable.Also, seeing your progress can be a motivating factor to keep you on track.

, Dieting can get lonely, especially if the people around you lead unhealthy lifestyles. Having a friend to diet and exercise with can help you stay motivated and actually make dieting fun.Ask friends of family members to help you stay accountable. Share with them your diet, exercise, and lifestyle plan. You may feel less tempted to slip up around people who know what your goals are.
It might also be a good idea to go through weight loss together. Studies have shown that when you exercise or diet together with friends, this support group helps everyone involved be more successful long-term.

, Adults should be getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night.Being tired can impact your weight in multiple ways: you are more likely to make bad decisions when tired (like getting a pizza instead of something healthy); you may be more likely to go for late-night, carb-heavy snacks; you may crave junk food; and on top of that, you may lack the energy to exercise., When you are stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol, which tells your body to conserve energy (i.e., hang on to fat).If you're exercising, that's a great way to bust stress, but look into other methods as well.


Consider yoga, meditation, positive visualization, going for a walk in nature, laughing with a friend, or doing something creative to help reduce your stress.

Take a one-bite snack between meals, if you’d like.,
This diet follows the idea of the kind of diet that Weight loss surgery patients must follow- eating small amounts of food two to 3 times a day.,
This is not a starvation diet, but portion control.,
Dr. Lewis recommends people aim for a BMI of 18.5 .,
Maintain bite size!,
Try sugar free gum to help keep your mouth busy.,
Think of the money you’re saving!",How to Lose Weight Fast on 5 Bites Diet," Dr. Alwin Lewis, says that drinking plenty fluid is an important part of his diet: It will help you to keep feeling full and hydrated.Even if it’s diet soda, it’s okay – just keep those calories to a big fat zero. .


He recommends a breakfast every morning of a big cup of black coffee and a ""juicy"" multi-vitamin. His school of thought points out that the body goes into a fasted mode at night, and the longer you can extend this state, the more weight you’ll lose.;
, This is where it comes down to you, as this is a modified fasting technique. You could eat 5 bites of lettuce, 5 bites of lobster Thermidor, or you could eat 5 bites of a Snickers bar (Dr Alwin explains that a Snickers is the easiest way to set your 'hungerstat'). To see the most healthy success, vary these five bites as a meal – three bites of a hamburger, plus two bite of an apple, for example.

Bite sizes will vary per person- General rule of thumb, if your bite takes more than 1 swallow it is too big of a bite.

Taking a multivitamin daily will help your body receive the nutrients you might miss from eating less food. On average people do not get the recommended daily vitamins, so taking a vitamin is always best!
Make sure that you have at least one bite of protein a day.

, Dinner has the exact same stipulations as lunch: 5 bites of any variety of foods. One of the goals of this diet is to make your choices fairly monotonous, eat your five bites and move on. Find other activities to fill your time. Your stomach will adjust to the amount of food you are now eating, your hungerstat will be set!, .


One of the reasons people tend to like this diet is that it allows anything. You could eat five bites of cheesecake, cookies and ice cream, if you so desired, as long as you stick to your 5 bites per meal!

, Dr. Lewis acknowledges that the low amount of food does not furnish your body enough of the vitamins and mineral micro-nutrients it needs to maintain and to function, especially over a long period of time. Because of this, he advocates that all dieters take a multi-vitamin every day. To keep going, this stipulation needs to be adhered to.


This may seem like an unnecessary part of a balanced diet, but ‘’do not’’ skip it.
A gummy vitamin is delicious and can seem like a sweet treat amid the pangs of hunger – as an additional, free bite, if you will.

, Making sure a few of your bites are loaded up with protein. Get about two bites of protein food every day (a medium sized Snickers has several grams of protein for instance). It is far too easy to get all of your calories from carbohydrates and fat –


The easiest way to do this is with nuts, meat; chicken, turkey, beef and fish are – all jam-packed. Tofu also has some protein.

, Dr. Lewis does say that 12 bites total per day is fine; so, if you’d like, you can have a bite of something between meals. , This diet allows for rapid weight loss without the complications of surgery.


This is not meant to be a lifestyle change, but a rapid way to get the unhealthy weight off as quickly as possible. The idea being that the risk of staying overweight (and added health complications that arise from extra weight) is WORSE than limiting your bites.

Realize that the only source of energy in the body is glucose sugar, meaning no matter what you eat your body turns it in to this 'fuel' so whether it is 5 bites of ice cream or five bites of a protein bar your body will use both for fuel equally. The goal is to turn the body into a lean mean fat burning machine. .








After you’ve reset your 'hungerstat' you will find that you get full quicker on a limited amount of food.

, You can modify the diet to add more bites, start by counting how many bites you take at a normal meal, then throughout a whole day. slowly start limiting yourself per meal/day until you reach 5 bites per meal.

, .The idea being that it is better to be right at a perfect weight for your body (even on the low side) than to risk being higher and suffering the complications of excess weight.

, Keep your bites as evenly sized as possible to eliminate 'stretching' out your stomach 1 tablespoon is often equal to 1 bite for most.


Taking larger bites or 'binging' will stall or slow your weight loss progress. This is not a lifestyle change but a rapid way of losing weight

, Or chicken broth if you are feeling light headed or weak. It is not recommended to exercise heavily while on this diet


Eat your bites and throw away (or give away!) or food. Do not try to stretch your bites out- eat your meal and move on! The better you adhere to this diet the quicker you will lose the weight!

, By only taking 5 bites you are forgoing spending $5+ on lunch and dinners.

The first two days will be the roughest. After the 3rd day- if your bites have stayed constant- it will become easier. Your body gets used to ingesting less food and the stomach shrinks. The more and more you do it, the easier it will be.
Find new activities to occupy your time! Take a walk around at lunch time, pick up a new hobby to stay busy.

Limit carbohydrates.,
Focus mostly on protein and vegetables.,
Cut out gas-producing vegetables.,
Eat less salt.,
Monitor calories.,
Keep up with your workouts.,
Do toning exercises.,
Incorporate interval training on day one of your diet.,
Ditch the chewing gum and carbonated beverages.,

Reduce stress.",How to Lose Weight in 2 Days," An easy way to drop weight and decrease water retention is to limit the amount of carbohydrate-rich foods you consume each day. Studies have shown that carbohydrates hold on to several water molecules in your body which may cause weight gain or bloating.Carbohydrates are found in many different foods including: dairy products, grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, and legumes.
It's not advisable to cut out each one of these foods. Limit them in general and focus on cutting out the carbohydrates that are not as nutrient dense. For example, consume carbohydrates from vegetables and dairy rather than fruits and grains. Both vegetables and dairy products contain many essential nutrients to your diet.
This is the quickest way to see a reduction in weight, bloating, and overall size of the abdominal area.;
, When you're monitoring both calories and carbohydrates, you'll need to make most of your meals or snacks. Try a lean protein and a non-starchy vegetable.


Protein and non-starchy vegetables make up an invaluable part of your diet. It's not healthy or smart to limit either of these foods. Include both in each meal and snack.
Low-carb, higher-protein and vegetable meal ideas include: scrambled eggs with cheese and spinach, a kale salad will grilled salmon, chicken stir fry with peppers, onions and snap peas, a fat-free greek yogurt with almonds, or two hard boiled eggs.

, Cutting out certain types of vegetables that produce gas does not help you lose weight, but can limit bloating.Typical gas-producing vegetables include: beans, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and onions.Stick to less fibrous veggies like: green beans, peppers, eggplants, beets, carrots, artichokes, tomatoes, mushrooms, or cucumbers.

, Salt can cause you to retain water and increase your weight and make bloating worse. Limit sodium-related water retention by using less salt and stay away from salty foods.


Sodium attracts and holds onto water in the body. That's why after you eat a salty meal, you may feel puffy or bloated.
Stay away from typical high salt foods like: processed meats, frozen meals, canned foods, take out or restaurant meals, high salt condiments (like ketchup, salad dressings or salsa), and prepared foods.
Limit or cut out the salt you add to your meals or adding while you're cooking your meals.

, Calories will become very important in the few days you're watching your weight. They'll need to be monitored fairly strictly to help you meet your goal.


Everyone's calorie goals will be different based upon age, gender, weight, and activity level.
You can start by cutting out about 500 calories daily. This is generally considered safe and can produce modest weight loss. Combined with diet and exercise, you can feel trimmer in just a few days.In addition, it's typically recommended to never eat less than about 1200 calories daily. Any less and you could have nutrient deficiencies, fatigue, and muscle mass loss., Even though you may be limiting calories or certain foods, it's important to stay regular with your daily exercise routine.


Exercise is a great way to support weight loss and also help the body sweat out excess fluid. This may help you feel trimmer and less bloated.
Walk 10,000 steps per day. This is the general recommended amount of activity recommended by health care professionals. If you don’t know how many steps you usually walk in a day, buy a pedometer and wear it all day long.

, Also doing some light strengthen training the day of or before your event or deadline can help you feel and look toned.Add in abs, arm, and leg work to help get a defined and toned look. Do these exercises the day before and day of your event. You'll notice that your body retains that defined look in the short-term.
Exercises you can try: crunches, hanging leg lifts, lunges, squats, bicep curls, lateral raises, and tricep dips. These exercises cover the basic muscle groups and should provide modest toning.
If you're going to be wearing something specific on your ""event day"" consider the areas of your body that are going to be showing. For example, if your arms will be showing in a sleeveless dress. You may want to focus on toning that area more than others.

, Interval training is a higher intensity cardio exercise that burns a lot of calories. It will help you sweat out excess water and help support faster weight loss.Interval training can be: sprinting or very fast running for one minute followed by three minutes of jogging. Repeat this cycle a few times for up to 15–20 minutes total.
Interval training has also been shown to increase your metabolism and your body's ability to burn calories and fat for up to 24 hours after you've completed the exercise. This makes it a great activity to include on day one of your diet., Chewing gum regularly allows you to swallow more air. This can cause bloating or make it worse. Carbonation also can make you feel bloated.


Instead of chewing gum, try a mint or brush your teeth or use mouthwash to freshen breath.
Instead of carbonated beverages, stick with non-carbonated, hydrating fluids like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee, or decaf tea.

, Adequate rest is also very important for quick results. Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Not only does sleep help to destress and re-energize the body, adequate sleep also helps stave off carbohydrate cravings.


Try to go to bed early each night. Turn off all the lights, electronics and anything that makes distracting sounds. Doing these things can make sure you have a sound and restful sleep.Sleep also helps you relax and de-stress. So if you're nervous or stressed about your event, getting adequate sleep can help you manage your emotions better., If you're trying to lose extra weight in just a few days you might be a little stressed or worried. However increased stress may make you feel more tired, lethargic or possibly make you more prone to stress eating.Cortisol is a hormone released when you're stressed. When you have low levels of this hormone in your body, you may have more difficulty losing weight.Each day of your two day diet, plan for some self-reflection and times for relaxation. Spend a few minutes listening to relaxing music, reading a book, meditating, or going for a relaxing walk.

Attempt diet and exercise first.,
Ask your physician if a phentermine prescription is right for you.,
Consider the risks carefully.,
Take phentermine once every morning.,
Take phentermine for three to six weeks.,
Be on the lookout for side effects.,
Store the medicine safely.,
Recognize that phentermine requires diet and exercise to work.,
Consult a dietitian about a safe diet plan.,
Measure your calorie intake carefully.,
Create an exercise plan with your physician.,
Talk to a behavioral specialist.",How to Lose Weight with Phentermine," Because of the risks of phentermine, this drug should be used only after dietary and exercise changes have been proven ineffective.Before seeking a phentermine prescription, make lifestyle adjustments to try to lose extra weight. Be sure to consult a physician before making any major changes to your diet and exercise routine to ensure that you remain safe and healthy. Some changes you might make include:


Take a 30-minute walk every morning
Take the stairs instead of the elevator at work or at home
Replace sugary drinks like soda or energy drinks with water
Replace processed snacks (such as potato chips) with fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts
Drink a glass of water with every meal to help you feel full and satisfied
Eat foods with lots of fiber such as whole grains
Do 15 minutes of moderately aerobic exercise each day, such as jogging, biking, or swimming;
, If it is medically necessary for you to lose weight (and if diet and exercise aren't working), talk to your doctor about whether your weight loss might be assisted with the use of an appetite suppressant. Phentermine can help patients feel full for longer and resist eating unnecessary calories.Phentermine is not a magic weight loss drug: it does not work for all patients, and there are a number of risks associated with this medicine.


Furthermore, phentermine by itself will not help you lose weight, it will only decrease the apatite. It will still require self discipline to eat healthy and not overeat and to exercise in order to lose weight.
While many of the side effects are minor, others can be quite severe (such as increased blood pressure and chest pain).Never self-prescribe phentermine or try to obtain it illegally. Only take this medication under a doctor's care.
Phentermine should not be used by patients with high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, substance abuse issues, or by women who are pregnant or might become pregnant or breastfeeding.Patients over the age of 65 also should not take phentermine.Phentermine can react negatively to other medications such as MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, and weight loss drugs. Talk to your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbs you take to make sure that you don't experience harmful side effects., In addition to potential side effects, phentermine can also be habit-forming in some patients.If your health requires you to lose weight, these potential side effects might be worth the risk; however, talk to your doctor about the dangers of phentermine as well as the benefits you might experience.


There have been reports of doctors prescribing phentermine unsafely and without proper monitoring. Be sure that your doctor is reputable and forthright about the risks of phentermine before you begin taking the drug.You can do some quick research on your doctor by looking on your state's medical licensing website to find the doctor's name and credentials.

, Most phentermine prescriptions involve a capsule or tablet taken orally once a day.Because phentermine is a stimulant, it is generally best to take it in the mornings so that it doesn't interfere with sleep.Be sure that you follow your doctor's and pharmacist's instructions carefully. Never exceed the recommended dosage or ""double-up"" on your phentermine.Taking phentermine at the same time every morning can help you remember to take it. Try to maintain a consistent schedule.If you were prescribed time-release capsules, be sure to swallow them whole. Chewing a time-release capsule can lead to incorrect dosages and side effects., Phentermine is designed for short-term use, not for permanent or long-term use. Most patients are on the drug for three to six weeks as a way to jump-start a weight-loss program.Your doctor will be monitoring you throughout this time to ensure that you are responding appropriately to the drug and that you are not experiencing side effects.

, It is important that phentermine patients be aware of side effects. Pay attention to your body as you take the drug, and notify your doctor of any sudden changes that you notice. While some side effects are only minor and inconvenient, other side effects are dangerous and require immediate medical attention.Minor to moderate side effects include dry mouth, constipation, vomiting, and diarrhea. You should notify your physician if these side effects are severe and long-lasting.Serious side effects include heart palpitations, high blood pressure, insomnia, dizziness, tremors, chest pain, breathlessness, and swollen legs. Notify your doctor immediately at the first sign of these side effects.Sometimes phentermine can enhance the effects of alcohol. Do not drive or use heavy machinery until you know how phentermine affects you, and it is a good idea to stay away from alcoholic beverages while on the drug., Phentermine should be stored in a cool, dry, dark place.It is best not to store phentermine in the bathroom as it can become warm and moist when you bathe or shower. Make sure that phentermine is not in the reach of any children (such as in a childproofed drawer) in order to keep them safe., Phentermine's effects tend to plateau over time, and many patients develop a resistance to the drug. This is why it is essential that you get on a stable, sustainable diet and exercise plan, even while taking the drug.A healthy diet and regular exercise can allow you to maintain your weight loss or perhaps even continue to lose weight. Phentermine will help you lose weight in those crucial first few weeks, but only diet and exercise will give you long-term success in your weight-loss journey.

, A licensed dietitian can help you adjust your diet in a way that is both safe and effective for weight loss. Ideally, your dietitian will also be able to monitor your progress to ensure that you are responding well to your new weight-loss regime.Every patient will require a different plan; however, some common weight-loss strategies include:


Meal replacements (especially for patients who struggle with portion control)A very-low-calorie diet, often taken in liquid form, under close supervisionLifestyle modification. This can include rather simple changes such as avoiding processed snack foods, eating lots of low-fat proteins and fresh fruits and veggies, and steering clear of alcohol, simple carbohydrates, and sugars.

, Make sure that you are sticking to your diet plan by keeping track of the calories you consume. Make a list of all the food you eat throughout the day. Using a simple online tool or phone app, you can calculate your daily calories intake. Confirm that your daily calories fit within the diet plan worked out by your dietitian and physician.


A food journal (using an app, a website, or just pen and paper) might also be useful. By recording everything you eat, you can learn to resist temptations more readily., Depending on your current weight and health, there are some exercises that might be safer for you to perform than others. Talk with your doctor about some of the best ways for you to integrate exercise into your life in a healthy way. Ideally your exercise plan will allow you to continue losing weight even after you discontinue your use of phentermine.


If you cannot exercise strenuously right away, consider low-impact exercise such as swimming, or even walking. You can always work your way up to more strenuous exercises such as running, jogging, or lifting weights., Behavioral therapy is an integral part of medical weight-loss programs.A behavioral specialist can help you stick to your diet and exercise goals. Perhaps you get tempted to eat because of television commercials, or perhaps you overeat when you are stressed out. A behavioral specialist will use cognitive behavioral therapy to retrain your mind to respond to stress and temptation in healthier, more positive ways. This will help you lose weight while on phentermine as well as after you stop taking the appetite suppressant.

Determine your daily calorie intake.,
Consume more vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein.,
Cut out carbs, sugars, and animal fats.,
Have natural sugars, rather than artificial sugars.,
Create a seven day meal plan.,
Don’t skip meals.,
Avoid eating out.,
Drink more water.,
Cut down on your alcohol consumption.",How to Lose Weight Fast Without Spending Any Money2," To help lose weight in a short period of time, you should calculate how many calories a day you should consume. To do this, you can use an online calorie calculator to determine how many calories you need to eat to have enough energy to do exercise, without putting on extra weight.


Keep in mind you should never go under your daily recommended calorie intake as this can lead to unhealthy weight loss and other health issues. You should also maintain a healthy diet and do consistent exercise to lose weight fast in an effective and healthy way. Consuming too few calories might make you drop weight quickly, but it will mess up your metabolism. In addition, as soon as you start eating normally again, your weight will usually shoot right back up.

, Shape your meals so they contain one protein source, one low fat source and one low carb vegetable source.


Healthy protein sources include egg whites, soy products, and chicken. Fish such as salmon and trout, as well as shellfish like shrimp and lobster are also good sources of protein in a healthy diet. Non-fat greek yogurt is also a good way to get protein and dairy in your diet.
Low carb vegetables include: broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage, swiss chard, lettuce, cucumber, and celery. Steaming or baking vegetables, rather than frying them, will ensure you receive all the nutrients and antioxidants in low carb veggies for the week.
Healthy fat sources include avocados and nuts, as well as olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil. Cooking with these oils will boost your fat levels without causing you to gain weight.

, Foods high in carbs and sugars cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels go down, your body can start to burn fat. It also helps your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight.Avoid foods high in starch and carbs like potato chips, french fries, and white breads. You should also avoid consuming foods high in sugar like soft drinks, candy, cakes, and other junk food.
Animal fats found in red meat and gamey meat like lamb can be fattening and slow down your metabolism as they are difficult to digest. Skip the steak or the lamb burger for one week as part of your meal plan.

, Rather than have a piece of candy for a quick snack, replace it with a piece of fruit that is low in sugar, such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, or strawberries. Replace the sugar in your morning coffee with a natural sugar like Stevia, a spoon of honey or agave.Your diet should focus mostly on healthy sources of protein, fat, and vegetables. But you should also include healthy sugar options such as fruit.

, Your meal plan should include three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), scheduled at the same time of day, as well as two small snacks (between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner), also schedule at the same time of day. This will ensure you eat at a consistent time for all seven days and do not skip or miss a meal. Eating about 1,400 calories a day, combined with daily exercise, can lead to healthy weight loss depending on your gender, age, height, activity level, and current weight.Make a grocery list based on your meal plan and go food shopping for the week on Sunday. Stock your fridge with all the necessary ingredients to make your meals for the week so you can prepare each meal easily and quickly., Once you have a meal plan and are eating at a consistent time every day, avoid skipping meals or not eating when you don’t feel hungry. Skipping a meal or putting off a meal until you are starving can lead to overeating and uncontrolled eating.When you sit down to eat, you should also minimize any distractions so you can focus on your food. Turn off your computer, your television and put your phone aside. Chew your food slowly so you do not eat too fast or in a hurry.

, It’s difficult to eat out and have a healthy meal. Eating out and getting take out are also quick ways to use up your food budget and spend unnecessary money.Instead, focus on making your own meals at home. This may mean you will need to spend money on healthier food, but you need to eat anyway! Might as well make your meals help you lose weight, rather than help you put on more pounds.

, Save money and cut down on your sugar intake by replacing soda and fruit juices with at least eight glasses of water a day. Cutting out coca cola and other sodas can dramatically reduce your weight and give you more energy to exercise. Best of all, water is free from any tap in your home.


Carry a full water bottle with you so you can sip water throughout the day. Sipping water will help your body to digest food. Avoid chugging water, as this can cause your belly to swell.

, Another way to save money and slim your waistline is to limit your alcohol consumption. Alcoholic drinks like wine, beer, and cocktails contain sugars that can be difficult to burn off during exercise. These drinks will also dehydrate you, leading to water retention and less energy for your workout.

This will force you to do some exercise every day, without spending a dime., When faced the prospect of a short elevator ride to your apartment, your office, or even the next floor of the mall, opt for the stairs. Walking up and down the stairs will get your cardio going, and can help you lose weight without paying for a gym membership.If you are just starting to get in shape, a cardiovascular workout once a day for thirty minutes total can burn calories without putting too much stress or tension on your body.

, Pack your own lunch and bring it to work to avoid eating out in the middle of the day. Prepare your lunches the night before so you aren’t tempted to eat out and spend money on unhealthy food.

, Stress and anxiety can be major food triggers and lead to unhealthy eating habits. Commit to getting a solid sleep every night so you are well rested, relaxed, and have enough energy for your workout routine. A good night’s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night."

Experts recommend that elderly people over the age of 60 should walk briskly with frequency of 30 to 40 minutes per day.;
, The hypocaloric diet is a menu with fat content from 20 to 30g per day. Due to reduced physical activity of the elderly, their diets also need to reduce fat.


According to this method, the elderly should use oils derived from plants, avoid animal fats, high sugar foods; reduce the amount of food in the meals, including breakfast and split meals, add fresh fruit, juice, and low fat milk between meals simultaneously.

You'll usually lose about 1 pound per week when you cut out this many calories — possibly 2 pounds if you are able to incorporate some exercise into your week.Start by figuring out how many calories you typically eat on a given day. You can use a food journal app or website to get an semi-accurate idea of what you currently take in. Subtract 500 – 750 calories from this number to get an idea of a weight loss calorie limit for you.
Note that it's not a good idea to skip meals or eat too few calories each day. This could result in fatigue, loss of lean muscle mass and nutrient deficiencies. Try not to decrease your calorie intake to less than 1,200 calories daily.;
, In addition to monitoring calories, it's also important to focus on a well-balanced diet when you're trying to lose weight.


A balanced diet is one that focuses on each of the food groups — grains, protein, dairy, fruits and vegetables. Each food group provides your body with a variety of essential nutrients to perform the vital functions of life.The number of servings you need of each food group daily depends on your age, sex, and activity level.
Eat a serving of lean protein at each meal and snack to help meet your minimum daily needs. Eat a fruit or vegetable at each meal and/or try to make each of your meals half fruits and vegetables.
In addition to eating enough of certain food groups, a balanced diet also is one that makes sure you don't eat too much of certain types of foods. Items like sweetened beverages, sweetened foods and high fat or greasy processed foods should be limited in your diet., A calorie-controlled, balanced diet will definitely be key to your weight loss success. Measuring portions will help make this easier.


One serving of protein is 3 – 4 oz or about 1/2 cup.One serving of fruits and vegetables are: 1/2 cup of cut fruit, one small fruit (like an apple or pear),1 cup of vegetables, or 2 cups of leafy greens.One serving of grains is 1 oz or 1/2 cup of rice, pasta, or oatmeal; one slice of bread; 1 cup of cereal; or one small tortilla.Also try to make half of your grain choices a whole grains as these foods are higher in fiber and more nutritious., You need to be very careful when you snack and you're trying to lose weight. Too much snacking or grazing throughout the day can sabotage your weight loss.


If you snack when you're not hungry, snack all day long, or choose higher calorie snack foods, you may not lose weight and you may even gain weight.However, not all snacks are a bad idea. In fact, snacks can help you with weight loss if used appropriately. Snacks are a good idea to help power you up for a workout, to refuel after a workout or get you through a long period of time between meals.Be careful with your snacks. Ensure they do not go over 100 – 150 calories per snack and stick to appropriate portion sizes.The best snacks are mainly lean protein and a fruit or vegetable. For example: carrots and hummus, greek yogurt and raspberries, a hard boiled egg, or 1 oz of mixed nuts.

, Drinking a lot of liquid calories throughout the day is another way to easily sabotage your weight loss and even gain weight.Liquid calories go down really easy and many people don't feel full or satisfied after drinking them, so they continue to eat the same amount of calories through foods.Limit calorie-containing beverages as often as you can. Skip regular sodas, fruit juice or fruit juice cocktails, sweetened teas and coffees, sports drinks or energy drinks.
Stick to drinking eight to 13 glasses of unsweetened, calorie-free fluids to help maintain your hydration.Water, flavored water, or unsweetened coffee and tea are your best options.

, Physical activity has been shown to be very supportive of weight loss, not to mention the many other health benefits that come with being active.Even if you can't spend an hour at the gym, walking more throughout the day, even a small amount, can have a positive effect on your weight loss.


You may want to consider purchasing a pedometer or downloading a pedometer app on your smartphone. This can give you an idea of how many steps you currently take each day and give a starting place to add in more steps.
Many health professionals recommend that you get about 10,000 steps in (about 5 miles or 8 km) each day. This might not be possible right away but you can start with 5,000 steps per day and add 1,000 steps to your goal each week until you reach 10,000 steps per day.To get in more steps throughout the day, consider: taking a short walk break at lunch, parking farther away, walking to a restroom farther away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator or delivering messages in person instead of email.
You can even try: taking multiple trips to bring groceries or other packages inside, taking the stairs multiple times, planning to walk to destinations that are short in distance, walking a lap or two at the mall before you start shopping or walking while you talk on the phone or brush your teeth.

, Another way to be more active and help your body burn calories is by trying to stand more often than you sit.Stand at work if you can. Stand during meetings, stand at your desk, or stand while you're on a conference call.
At home, stand when you're watching TV or get up and stand or walk around during commercial breaks.
Studies have shown that standing helps keep your heart rate elevated and therefore helps your body burn more calories per hour than sitting., Although you may not have a lot of time for planned physical activity each day or week, even taking a few minutes every day to be active can help.


Try just taking a 10 minute exercise or walk break during the day. Most people have 10 minutes to themselves that they can spend being a little more active. Even if you just go for a leisurely walk to de-stress from a long day, it's still extra activity.
There are also many trendy exercises now that focus on getting in a fairly high intensity workout in during just a few minutes, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), Orangetheory Fitness (OTF), and barre classes. Some are only 10-15 minutes in length.
Also consider doing more exercise on the weekends or your days off. You may be able to get up later or spend more time at the gym. Even if you are only active two days a week, that's still better than nothing.

, If you can't exercise, and you're trying to lose weight, try to manage your stress levels. When you're stressed out, you may have a more difficult losing weight.


Stress releases a hormone called cortisol. This may make you feel more hungrier and cause you to crave higher fat, higher sugar or carb-rich foods.Manage stress as best you can. Talk to a friend or family member, listen to music, take a hot shower, read a book or meditate.

, In addition to managing stress, also make sure you get enough sleep each night. Those who do not sleep enough are typically at a higher body weight than those who do.Like stress, inadequate sleep can make you crave higher fat, higher sugar foods. In addition, it may increase your body's hunger hormone and you'll feel hungrier more throughout the day.Most health professionals suggest getting about seven to nine hours of sleep each night; however, do not sleep more than nine hours often as this is also related to weight gain., Whenever you're trying to lose weight and diet, it's help to weigh yourself regularly.


Regular and consistent weigh-ins help keep you motivated, help you stay on track and have also been shown to help you continue to lose weight.Get on the scale one to two times a week, if not every day. This will give you the most accurate trend of your weight loss over time.
Also try to weigh yourself at the same time of day and in the same clothing. This also tends to make your weight loss trend more accurate.

, Staying on track can be difficult; however, having some accountability may motivate you to stick to your plan.


Weighing yourself daily is a great way to be accountable. If you know you have to get on the scale every morning, you may be more likely to stick to your diet or exercise plan.
Try working out with a friend as well. Studies show that scheduling a ""workout"" date with a friend is something you're not likely to skip.Also try telling friends or family members what your goal is. You can ask them to help you keep accountable and support you with your goals.

The total amount, though, depends on your gender, weight, and age. Avoid:High carb vegetables like peas and squash. Instead, focus on spinach and Brussel sprouts.
Bread
Starchy food like corn and potatoes
Grains like wheat, rice, and oats;
, Healthy fats are perhaps the most important element of a ketosis diet. Without consuming enough healthy fats, you won’t be able to maintain ketosis. As a result, you’ll need to eat enough fats and bring healthy fatty foods with you to places you can’t get them. Focus on:


Meat like beef, chicken, seafood, and even bacon
High fat vegetables like avocados
Dairy products like cheese and butter
Eggs
Nuts and legumes
Products that contain coconut oil, While the foods you eat will help you stay in ketosis, you also need to exercise regularly. This is because you want your body to be active so you can burn any carbs you consume.


Do light exercise, like walking or running, if you consume more than 5 or 10 grams of carbs.
Exercise at least 3 times a week for half an hour or more. For example, set aside time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to exercise.
It is best if you do at least some sort of moderate exercise every day. Running or powerwalking for half an hour a day will do a lot to help you stay in ketosis.
Exercise is important because it will help you burn off any carbs you consume, thus helping your body stay in ketosis., If you wind up eating extra carbs on a given day (more than 5 or 10 grams), you’ll need to exercise more than normal extra to burn them off. This way, you'll burn off any carbs that could prevent your body from entering or staying in ketosis.


Consider only eating carb heavy meals before a workout., A ketogenic diet has been linked to several possible health problems. These problems include dehydration, blood flow problems, nausea, headache, and blood chemical imbalances. As a result, you should know common risk factors before committing to a ketogenic diet., You may need to kick your ketosis off with a long-term fast. Fasting will help purge your body of carbs. Your initial fast could be anywhere from half a day to a day or even more. The length of the fast depends on your preference and health.


Consult your doctor before fasting. Avoid fasting if you have metabolic disorders or conditions like diabetes., By fasting every day, you’ll give your body a chance to process any carbs you may consume and to begin to break down stored fat. As a result, you should make sure to incorporate a fast into your daily schedule.


Skip a meal or stretch times between your meals. For example, skip breakfast every day.
Try to fit all your eating into 8 hours of the day., A fat fast is when you eat only a small number of high fat calories on a given day. Ultimately, you’ll lower caloric intake but maintain a high fat diet, spurring ketosis, and forcing your body to break down stored fat to meet your energy needs.


Consider eating about 1,000 calories per day of which 90% come from fat. An example of this would be eating several cuts of beef in one today paired with green beans, spinach, broccoli.
Your total number of calories may vary based on age, gender, and weight., Because ketosis is a result of your body’s ability to process and use glycogen, you should consult your doctor before beginning a regimen intended to keep you in ketosis. This is important, as your doctor might have insight into the safety of a ketosis diet for you.


Inform your doctor about any outstanding medical issues you have
Your doctor may warn you about the side effects of ketosis, such as nausea, headache, fatigue, dehydration and associated vascular damage., Whether your physician recommends it or not, you should probably have your blood tested for certain levels if you are committed to staying in ketosis. By testing your blood, you’ll make sure that you are healthy, your liver and kidneys are functioning well, and that there are no serious side effects to ketosis. Test your:


Ketone levels – this includes acetone, beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate
Blood sugar
Protein levels, Since exercise is an important part of your body’s ability to reach and maintain ketosis, a weight trainer will be able to provide you with a plan that will help you meet your fitness goals and stay safely in ketosis.


A fitness trainer may recommend a cardio routine that includes running or swimming.
Depending on your goals, your weight trainer may suggest a light weight training routine that will help you turn the extra protein you consume into muscle.

, A dietitian or nutritionist will be able to consider your age, weight, height, and other factors. They’ll use this information to create a nutritional plan geared toward helping you stay in ketosis. They’ll take vital statistics such as your weight, age, and health conditions."

Pump up the jams.",How to Walk off Weight," Humans walk on a daily basis to move naturally from one place to the other. There are different styles of walking depending on the speed and intensity of the exercise:



Stroll: this is the walking style used for window-shopping or relaxed activities, which burns around 238 calories per hour. Picture it as level 4 on a scale of 10.

Brisk walk: this is the walking style you adopt when you are rushing somewhere; it makes you catch your breath every once in a while if you're talking to someone. You can burn up to 340 calories per hour. Think of it as level 5/6 out of 10.

Power walk: this is a step before running, and makes speaking much harder as you need to breathe regularly. This can burn up to 564 calories per hour. The level of intensity is 7/8 out of 10.;
, You should make a decision based on how much weight you want to lose, how fast and how trained you are. If you haven't exercised in a while, it's best for you to start with a more laid back plan, and then combine it with the more intense ones. These are:



Tempo day (40 minutes, 220 calories per session): Stroll for five minutes. Power-walk for 30 minutes. Stroll for five minutes.

Long-interval day (46 minutes, 355 calories): Stroll for five minutes. Power-walk intensely for five minutes and brisk-walk for one minute, repeating the routine 6 times. Stroll for five minutes.

Short-interval day (55 minutes, 405 calories): Stroll for five minutes. Power-walk intensely for two minutes and brisk-walk for one minute, repeating the routine 15 times. Stroll for five minutes., The intervals don't have to be consecutive; if you get tired faster, break up a long interval of power-walking with brisk-walking or strolling intervals.


The walking sessions shouldn't be on consecutive days, but you should not be inactive for longer than two days. For example, you can exercise on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays rather than cramming the three sessions into the weekend., There's no point in pushing your body beyond its limits at first. Aim for lower intensity but longer distances: you can burn plenty of calories just by walking a mile in 13 minutes, or less than that if you can.You can push yourself to walk a little further each day. If you're getting tired before covering the whole distance you had planned for the day, keep going at a slower pace but make sure you get to the end.

, Your goal should be walking at around 75 percent of your maximum intensity, which amounts to around 4 miles an hour for a moderately healthy adult, though this may be different depending on your age, weight and level of fitness.


When you feel confident and less tired, or feel you've reached the maximum distance you could cover in one slow-paced session, start raising the bar by introducing short intervals at faster speeds, and phase out strolling little by little (except for warming up and cooling down).
Avoid going below 3 miles per hour: this is not enough for a cardio session and will have a much lower impact on your calorie burning., This will help you maintain a correct posture while you walk. Focus on a point far ahead of you and keep your abdominal muscles tight so that your belly button gets closer to the spine.Focusing on your posture is important to improve your walking style and allow you to aim for higher intensity after a few sessions.

, You can download one for a very low price or for free on your phone. This will keep track of your daily walking and give you accurate information about your speed and heart rate, in some cases., You can keep a walking log or journal with tables where you write down the minutes walked and types of plan for each week, and your weight on the next box.Tracking the effects of walking on your body will help you figure out what you can do to maximize weight loss and keep you motivated as you go.

, Walking on non-flat roads can maximize calorie burn by almost 20 percent. The steeper the road is, the better it will get. Make sure you tackle hills and inclines only after you've exercised for awhile. As a beginner, remember that the objective is not to strain your body but to build up stamina one step at a time.Listen to your body to understand how steep an incline it's able to take. There's no point in walking up the Rockies if you get exhausted after five minutes. Choose a gentle slope, as long as you can walk on it without tiring yourself out.

, Uneven surfaces will make your body work harder and increase the intensity of your walking session. This can burn 430 calories in just one hour., This is what you would normally do while running: bend you elbows and make a fist with your hands, and coordinate the movement of your arms with your legs. You will burn 10 percent more just by doing that.This will also help you move forward as you power-walk: your body will probably phase into this posture naturally to keep the pace and balance.

, Vary the length of your stride to mix things up. Try taking longer strides for a minute then go back to your normal gait. It is better for the body to speed the pace of the steps than to increase the stride length over an extended period of time.


Lengthening your stride for an extended period or taking steps that are too wide could lead to injury.

, This can also maximize weight loss: because your ultimate goal is burning calories, decreasing your weekly intake by having lighter food will make your job much easier. Don't starve yourself: you need energy for your walking sessions, and this comes from calories in the first place. Rather than cutting down on quantity, focus on the quality of what you eat.Your diet should include:Complex carbohydrates for energy (pasta, whole grains, potatoes, etc.)
Unsaturated fat for longer endurance (nuts, olive oil, salmon, tuna, etc.)
Protein for stronger muscles (meat, legumes, etc.): around 0.7g of proteins per pound of body weight
Fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals essential for healthy body functions (bananas, kale, carrots, peppers, berries, etc.)
Calcium for stronger bones (low-fat dairy, kale, sardines, etc.)

, If where you work or study is way too far for you to reach on foot, you can park your car further away from your final destination (half a mile to a mile) and walk there.


If you use public transit, get off at the stop before the one where you should go to increase your walking activity.

, E-shopping has become routine for most of us. Walking to the grocery store, however, is much better for your body. Take it as a time to decompress, do some thinking, listen to music or catch up on your calls.

, If you live in an apartment block, avoid using the elevator unless you live at the 50th-floor penthouse. If you do, you can still take the elevator to the 42nd floor and let your feet do the rest., You can either walk your children to a specific destination or introduce walking explorations as a fun activity. This will also give you time to catch up.


Invited your kid's friends to join you. This may make walks more appealing for your child., You will have to do it anyway if you don't have a garden, so why not use this as an opportunity for exercise (for you and your dog)? Make your walks longer and speed up your pace: your dog certainly won't mind spending more time outdoors.


If you don't have a dog, join a friend who does while they take theirs for a walk., Listening to music while walking can help in many ways. It is motivational, it helps keep a certain pace, a playlist can plan fast songs for interval training, slower songs for cool down and warm up. However, caution needs to be used when listening to music while walking. It is even more important to be vigilant about traffic safety. Use just one earphone, or keep the volume low, while walking so you can hear approaching vehicles.

You can also download audiobooks or podcasts to listen to while you walk.

Incorporate chocolate into healthy snacks.,
Limit yourself to one chocolate a day.,
Have hot cocoa once a day.,
Create a ritual around having chocolate.,
Limit the amount of chocolate in your home.",How to Manage a Chocolate Addiction1," You can try to manage your addiction to chocolate by having it in moderation as part of a daily snack. Incorporating chocolate in a limited and healthy way into your diet can make it easier to control your cravings.You may try having chocolate covered fruit, such as strawberries, blueberries, or melon, as a snack rather than a chocolate bar. Or you may have trail mix that contains dark chocolate pieces or try chocolate covered nuts as a snack.
Try to vary how you add chocolate to your snacks. Make sure you balance the amount of chocolate in your snacks with other healthy items, such as fruits and nuts.;
, You may also attempt to control your cravings by only having one chocolate per a day. You may go for a small portion size, such as a three squares of dark chocolate or a small bar of chocolate, rather than a larger portion size, such as a jumbo piece of chocolate. Try to limit yourself to having 30g of chocolate a day, once a day, so you do not go overboard.When you do have your one chocolate for the day, go for high quality dark chocolate. Dark chocolate made with 70-85% percent cocoa does not have as much added sugar or fat as milk chocolate. High quality dark chocolate is also often richer in taste and texture than other chocolate, making it easier to eat less of it.

, You may also try drinking hot cocoa to help you manage how much chocolate you consume every day. Prepare a nice cup of hot cocoa and limit yourself to one a day. You may have your one cup of cocoa in the morning or in the afternoon as part of your lunch.If you are still eating a piece of chocolate every day, try alternating a hot cup of cocoa one day with a single piece of chocolate the next, rather than having both in one day.
When you prepare hot cocoa, use low-fat milk or a milk substitute like almond or soy milk to reduce the fat content. You should also go for high quality cocoa, with no additives or added sugar.

, When you do have your one piece of chocolate a day, it may help to make it feel like a ritual. Sit down and take some time to enjoy your one piece of chocolate at the same time every day. You may have your one piece of chocolate at the midpoint in the day with a cup of tea or at night as you are watching television.Pick a set time for having your one piece of chocolate and try to be consistent. Having a set ritual for having chocolate will help ensure you only consume chocolate at a specific time and not throughout the day.
When you do sit down for your one chocolate ritual, savor the experience. Chew the chocolate slowly and let yourself enjoy the taste. Take your time to savor the chocolate so you do not end up craving more later., If you have a lot of chocolate readily available to you at home, you may be tempted to eat too much of it. Get rid of excess chocolate in the house, and don’t buy more than you need for the healthy diet you have planned."

Don't over-restrict yourself.",How to Maintain Your Diet at Parties," Once you get to your party or gathering, go check out the food options. Take a round going to each table or looking at what foods or snacks are being served.


Before you grab a plate and start loading up with foods, you need to make sure you have a clear idea of what's available. This will help you be able to make the best choice.
When you're looking for items to try, don't only look for health or diet foods. There might not be a lot of ""diet"" foods there.That doesn't mean that there's nothing you can eat.
Specifically look for lower calorie options or ""free foods"" like raw or cooked vegetables or a fruit tray. Also, look for protein-based options (even if they're higher in calories or fat). These can help fill you up and keep you satisfied more than grain-based foods.;
, After you've surveyed the area, head over to the beverage section. Grab a no- or low-calorie drink and start sipping. This can help you manage your food choices over the course of the evening.


Drinking a beverage right before consuming a meal can help provide your body with a sense of fullness and satisfaction. If you drink a low- or no-calorie beverage, you can help fill yourself up with little to no extra calories.Look for beverages like: water, sparkling water, diet sodas, diet iced tea or coffee.
Avoid grabbing an alcoholic beverage first. Drinking on an empty stomach allows the alcohol to go to your head a little more quickly. This can result in overindulgence since alcohol can reduce your inhibitions.

, If the party is a buffet or just appetizers, grab a small plate to serve yourself. This can help you contain how much you're eating and keep portions a little smaller.


Always grab a small plate at any type of gathering. Studies have shown that if you use a smaller plate, you're more likely to to eat less at meals compared to if you used a bigger plate.Small plates make smaller amounts of food look like more to your brain. If there is excess white space (typically on a larger plate), you're more likely to fill that up with food.
Look for small salad plates or appetizer size plates to use. Don't use the larger dinner plates or ask the host if they have something smaller you can use.

, If the party has foods out like a buffet, you will have complete control over your food choices and portions. While many parties are served buffet-style, some may be plated meals. If you're at a party or gathering where the host is serving the food, you can quietly ask them to serve you smaller portions or not serve you certain foods. They want you to enjoy yourself, so don't feel uncomfortable asking.


If you're in control of what foods are on your plate and their portion sizes, you're more likely to stick to your desired diet.Try to make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable and the other half some sort of protein-based food. Limit how many grains you serve yourself or how many sweet treats you indulge in.

, Another trick to keep you on track when you're at a party or social gathering is to fill up on lower calorie items first. This can help tame your hunger and manage your choices for the rest of the evening.


Some foods, like fruits and vegetables, are naturally low in calories. These foods are also higher in fiber and can provide bulk to your meals without many added calories (just don't go crazy with high-calorie dips).Before having any other foods, grab a plate full of vegetables or fruit and nosh on those as your ""appetizer"" or first round.
You're more likely to feel a little satisfied and full and may have an easier time saying ""no"" to unhealthier or higher calorie items.

, Some parties will have a lot of tempting dishes to choose from. If you're having trouble saying ""no"" to food, consider leaving the room.After a bite or two of something delicious, it can be hard to refuse another serving or walk by it without grabbing a little more.
Instead of constantly saying ""no"" to yourself or risking overindulging, consider just leaving the area where the food is.
You can go outside, go to the living room or offer to help clean up in the kitchen. Anywhere you can get away from foods can be helpful.

, It's not uncommon for party hosts to suggest tasting their freshly baked dessert or go back for seconds; however, you'll need to be firm and stand up to these suggestions so you can stay on track.Many people just want you to taste their food and enjoy it. They're not necessarily coming at you with these suggestions to ruin your diet.
Even with the best and most innocent intentions, your diet can be sidetracked pretty easily.
Be polite and say something like ""Thank you so much! It was all so delicious, but no thank you."" Or you can be totally honest and say, ""I'm afraid if I have these amazing treats in my house I will completely derail my diet! Thank you for the offer, though!""

, One important trick when you're planning to head out to a party, is to have a game plan in mind. It's not wise to show up without considering your diet options.


You need to have a fairly detailed and clear idea of how you're going to manage yourself and your diet at the party.
The day before or day of your party, review your food options. Are you going to bring food with you? Are you going to use a small plate? Are you going to skip dessert?
Also consider whether or not you'll want to tell the party hosts about your diet. You may want to keep it quiet, but letting them know may make it easier for you to stay on track and even have them on your side.

, Showing up to the party with an empty stomach will make it very difficult to stick to any type of diet plan.To prevent being hungry, have a small snack or meal an hour or so before heading out to the party.


Even if you're at home or going out to dinner with your spouse, if you're feeling overly hungry you're more likely to eat bigger portions or indulge in higher calorie foods.
Also, make sure you drink water (or other no calorie fluids) so you can also fill up on a no calorie item and tame your hunger a bit.

, Although it's next to impossible to exercise off every calorie you eat at a party, you can use exercise to help prevent you from overeating. Schedule in an exercise session the day of your event.


No run or spin class will burn off all the calories from your entire day. Instead of trying to overdo it on exercise, use exercise as a motivational tool.Get yourself pumped up, feeling motivated and energized from exercise. This can also help put in you in a good mindset for staying on track at your party.
Stick to your normal exercise routine or plan to be exercising on the day of your party. Even a quick 20 minute walk can help get you into the right mindset.

, If you can, consider bringing a healthy dish with you. This can help make sure there is something you can eat at the party.


If you're going to a buffet-style party or somewhere they're just serving appetizers, offer to bring a dish with you. The host or hostess will probably be excited to have some help.
Bring something that you can eat and that will fit into your diet plan. Choose something that has a lot of vegetables, fruit or lean protein in it.
Bringing a main dish is a great idea so that you know that a good portion of your meal will be a healthy choice.

, Another way you can keep yourself on track is by inviting someone to go with you and ask them to help keep you accountable. Choose a person that can help keep you on track with your diet and eating pattern.Choose a close friend, spouse or family member that you know is also either on a diet or generally eats healthy and well-balance meals.
You can ask them to help keep you on track during the party. They can suggest healthier options, remind you to eat smaller portions or split things between the two of you.
Make sure to ask the party host if it's OK to bring a friend with you. It might not be appropriate to bring a friend without giving the host a heads up.

, Regardless of how much planning and thought you put into staying on track, there will be times when you overindulge at parties and events. But get back on track as soon as possible.


One way to help get your mindset refreshed and feel a little better is by going right back to the gym.
Even if you don't feel like going to the gym, or feel sluggish, this can be the first step to getting yourself back on track.Get up and get back to your regular workout the next day. Try not to skip this day or wait until your diet is ""back on track"" to go to the gym.

, Whether you overindulged in alcohol or higher salt foods, one important part of getting back on track after a party is drinking adequate fluids.


It's easy to overdo it on foods and beverages that can cause some mild dehydration. This may make you feel tired and sluggish the next day.
The day after you attended your party, get started with drinking a lot of hydrating clear fluids. Try: water, sparkling water, flavored water, decaf coffee or tea.
Although the general recommendation is to drink about 64 oz of clear fluids, you may need 80 oz or so to replenish after a night out., Regardless of how ""bad"" it was at the party or how much you ate, you can still recover after your party. You have to get back on track immediately to help prevent any further backsliding.


The day after overindulging might not feel great. You may feel discouraged, upset or angry at yourself for overdoing it at your party. You may see this as an excuse to give up on your diet. Stick with it!
Instead of wallowing in everything you did wrong, focus on what you can do to feel better the day after.
Get back on track with your diet immediately. Whether it's measuring portion sizes, following a specific calorie recommendation or limiting carbohydrates, its important to restart your healthy habits soon.
After a day of being on track, you'll feel much better about yourself and you'll feel more motivated to stay on track.

, It might be tempting to go on an overly strict diet after a day or evening of overindulgence; however, this tactic can backfire and is best left unexplored.Avoid going on an extreme diet or eating pattern after going out. Don't go for liquid diets, fasting, juice diets, cleanses or overly low calorie diets.
Many of these restrictive diets, especially after a day of overdoing it, can make you feel worse. You might feel more tired, have a headache or have increased hunger. It may also cause you to overindulge once again by being too restrictive.

Make a fist.,
Raise up on your toes.,
Grip your pen tightly.,
Care about your health.",How to Use Tricks to Increase Willpower and Eat Less1," Squeeze your fist harder to resist overeating or choosing wrongly. In a recent study, squeezing muscles at the moment of your purposeful decision (while resisting a bad choice) seems to help people make healthier food choices., Tense the calf muscles as another way to increase determination. In a research experiment, people were able to drink more of a not-so-great-tasting ""health tonic"" when they flexed their calf muscles while imbibing. Of course, healthful foods don't necessarily have to taste bad., Firm up your grip and eat better. Researchers recently examined willpower under two conditions. In a study people were asked to either (1) loosely or (2) tightly grip their writing pen as they filled out the same survey while standing in line at a snack bar. The people with firm, tight grasps on the pen made better, healthier snack choices than those with the loose grip, seeming to translate to relaxed choices., Muscle tensing won't help much, according to this study, if you aren't caring or showing effort already. The tense muscle effect ""only"" helps those people who already had good health intentions, according to the study. So if eating right and becoming and staying slimmer are among your goals, plan your efforts and tense your muscles when you want to strengthen your willpower against eating too much or eating junk food."

Have foods with natural sugars.,
Consume bitter beverages and foods.,
Take a theobromine supplement.",How to Manage a Chocolate Addiction2," If you are craving a sugar fix, you may opt for foods with natural sugars instead of chocolate. You may have fresh fruit, such as mangos, strawberries, blueberries, kiwis, pears, apples, or pineapple. Cut up fresh fruit and carry it in your bag as a snack for when you feel a chocolate craving coming on.You can also leave fresh fruit cut up in a bowl in your home so you can reach for it easily. This may help you replace your chocolate bars with fruit, a much healthier option that still contains sugar.

, You may also find your sweet tooth gets less intense if you switch to having beverages and foods that are more bitter. You may try to integrate beverages that are more bitter into your diet, such as black coffee or unsweet tea. Drinking beverages that are more bitter may make you crave sugar and sweet things, such as chocolate, a lot less.You may also try having foods that are more bitter in taste, such as bitter vegetables like rapini or nettles. More bitter foods could help you get used to having a more bitter taste in your mouth, rather than the sweetness of chocolate.

, One of the reasons you may crave chocolate is because your body likes to absorb theobromine, which is a natural compound found in cocoa. Dark chocolate has a higher theobromine content than milk chocolate. Theobromine is good for the management of high blood pressure and helps to increase your energy levels. If you are consuming chocolate to get the benefits of theobromine, you may consider having the supplement version instead.You can find theobromine supplements online or at your local healthfood store. Most supplement companies recommend you have 100 mg theobromine one to two times a day. Do not exceed a dose of 500 mg of theobromine a day.
You can also get theobromine by drinking yerba mate, a type of medicinal tea. Follow package directions or consult your doctor or dietitian to determine an appropriate dosage of yerba mate for you.Be aware that the FDA does not regulate the content or potency of dietary supplements. Make sure you purchase supplements that have been evaluated by a third party organization, like USP (United States Pharmacopeia). Always talk to your doctor before starting a new dietary supplement.

Consider if your addiction is emotional.,
Recognize and avoid your triggers.,
Wait 10 minutes to act on a craving.",How to Manage a Chocolate Addiction3," Some people have an addiction to chocolate due to emotional issues. They may crave chocolate when they are feeling stressed, anxious, or upset. You should think about if your addiction is based on emotion. Consider if you tend to reach for chocolate as a safety blanket when you are feeling rough emotionally.Ask your doctor for medical advice if you believe the underlying cause of your addiction is emotional.
You may also notice that you end up eating chocolate partly out of boredom. Though your feelings of boredom may not seem intense or highly emotional, this is a sign that your chocolate addiction may be tied back to feeling bored and restless.

, You should take the time to recognize any triggers that lead you to reach for a chocolate bar. This could be situations where you are feeling stressed at work or overwhelmed at school. You may also find you indulge on chocolate when you are feeling bored or restless at home. You should recognize what triggers your chocolate consumption and then work to avoid these triggers.For example, if you find you end up reaching for chocolate when you are bored at home, you may try to counteract this trigger by doing something else. You may go for a walk or visit with a friend rather than sit at home and eat too much chocolate. This way, you acknowledge your trigger and then do not give into it.
You may also notice that you crave chocolate during your period every month and tend to overindulge. You may prepare for this once a month trigger by opting for healthy snacks that still incorporate chocolate into your diet or by limiting yourself to only one chocolate a day.

, If you feel a sudden craving coming on for chocolate, you can keep it in check by waiting 10 minutes to act on it. If after 10 minutes you still want chocolate, you can allow yourself to have a very small amount. Often, waiting 10 minutes will allow your body to calm down and really consider if it needs chocolate.Waiting 10 minutes after a craving may also help you feel more in control of your cravings and not so powerless to resist overindulging in chocolate. Having a sense of control over your addiction can make it easier to cut back and limit your consumption of chocolate.

Make and stick to choices by tracking them.,
Design your ""own record keeping"" however you want it.,
Snap a picture using your cell phone to ""photo-record"" your plate of food before you eat.,
Feel the pain: Pull actual ""cash"" from your ""wallet""--not an ATM or credit card--to pay for any junk food you buy.",How to Use Tricks to Increase Willpower and Eat Less2," Why does tracking your diet work: help you to hold yourself accountable? For nearly 1,700 overweight people on a six-month weight loss program:""Those who kept a daily food journal lost twice as much weight as those who didn't keep a journal."" -- and the researchers who led the weight loss study say:

Note--Jot a few words on a sticky note to praise your success
Pump it up--Give yourself a ""pat on the back"" when you're doing it right!
Boot up--""Kick yourself"" in the rear when you did not eat right
Text--Send a text or photo message of your lunch--whatever it is, good or bad
Save half of each of your meals for later (and save 100% of the cost of your next meal).



, Why make your own system? In one study of dieters, those who got to pick their own system were 50% more likely to record their food and twice as likely to record their exercise as those who were told which record-keeping format to use. Keep it simple:Use a computer, tablet, iPad or simple index cards.
You don't need someone else's plan: Why pay for delivered diet meals even if they work?

, Be sure to look at your phone images later.

, This could help you feel ""guilty"" about the purchase. Why does paying with plastic work ""less well""? It is less emotionally charged. You'll purchase fewer but healthier and less-fattening foods than the credit- and debit-card users did. "

Take calcium and vitamin D3: Lose four times more weight than those who didn't take a calcium and vitamin D supplement according to the study with female dieters using this trick in a recent study, they ate fewer fatty foods and lost that much weight.,
Many people's diets are lacking in Omega 3, a crucial, non-inflammatory oil.",How to Use Tricks to Increase Willpower and Eat Less3," Why would a calcium supplement help? Researchers believe that when your calcium intake is low, your body may start craving foods rich in calcium. Many foods that are high in calcium are also high in fat and calories (such as ice cream and cheese). But the women in the study who were getting the calcium supplement (600 milligrams per day) lost more weight and more body fat while taking the supplement., Hereditary ratios of Omega 3 to Omega 6 are thought to be 1:1. However, the typical American diet has skewed this to as much as 1:20. This can result in constant hunger."

Realize that your tricks are for winning ""attention"", creating distractions and satisfaction, and lowering appetite.,
Eat more protein at breakfast.,
Store your snacks in the attic.,
Turn up the lights.,
Give yourself very few choices.,
Sleep eight hours.,
Spray your favorite non-food scent.,
Never load up your plate.,
Talk more, entertain friends; ""tell a great story"".,
Be seated, use utensils and a plate.,
Go with veggies.",How to Use Tricks to Increase Willpower and Eat Less4," It's entirely up to you., Why? Because you'll be less hungry later. That leads to eating fewer calories per day, as did a group of overweight women to whom St. Louis University researchers gave two scrambled eggs and two slices of toast with jelly for breakfast. Another group ate more calories during the day after consuming half as much protein at breakfast.

, Make yourself climb to the attic or go downstairs to the basement to get to your less-healthy snacks. Put your most tempting foods ""out of reach and out of sight"". Cornell University food psychologist Brian Wansink, PhD, keeps his favorite sodas in a refrigerator in the basement.

, You will consume fewer calories at a well-lit restaurant table than in a dark corner. ""In the light, you're more conscious of the other patrons what you eat,"" explains Wansink.

, Avoid snacks in variety packs. Why, you may want to try several., People given ten colors of M&Ms to munch on versus seven eat 30% more! says Wansink

, Less sleep can cause the release of hormones that increase appetite, according to researchers.

, Scientists have scanned the brains of people eating different foods and found that the brain reacts to fats in the mouth in a similar way as it responds to pleasant aromas.

, The more food you see, the more you eat. Pack up half of your restaurant meal before eating. That half will make a great meal later.

, That limits your time to eat. You'll have food left on your plate when others are finished. Tell yourself you're finished, too. Eat the leftovers for another meal.

, In other words, don't ""eat on the run."" You'll eat fewer calories if you're conscious and watchful of what you eat.

, Start lunch with around 100 calories worth of vegetable soup (not a rich stew), and you'll eat 20% fewer calories overall during lunch. This is according to Penn State experts.

Change your eating habits.,
Avoid anything with lots of sugar or fat.,
Focus on eating a high-protein, low-fat diet.,
Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables too!,
Eat smaller meals.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Supplement your diet with sufficient nutrients.",How to Maintain Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery1," Eating will be an entirely different experience after your surgery. You physically won’t be able to consume as much food, but this restriction will not contribute to weight loss if you still eat high-calorie foods.Pay close attention to both what and how you eat in order to take full advantage of the potential positive effects of bariatric surgery.
For the rest of your life, choose a diet that consists primarily of protein, vegetables, a small amount of grain, and extremely limited amounts of refined sugar.
If unfamiliar with the foods you’ll need to be eating moving forward, introduce yourself to new foods one at a time to see how they impact your body.;
, Not only will these contribute to weight retention, they will likely cause considerable discomfort after certain types of bariatric surgery.Avoid pre-packaged and processed foods, especially those with lots of ingredients. If you do purchase a pre-packaged food, read the label.
Only eat packaged foods that have a protein-to-calorie ratio of 10-to-one or better.
Quit the fried food, ice cream, and candy bars.
If you’re unable to kick soft drinks and sweetened dairy products, only consume sugar-free options.

, Emphasize fish, dairy, meat, beans, and other legumes. You will likely have to ease into a protein-focused diet after your surgery, starting with softer options first.Following your doctor’s guidance — likely a few weeks after surgery — start eating meals based on extremely soft protein sources.
Options include protein shakes, egg whites, non-fat cottage cheese, and low-fat yogurt.
Once you’re able to begin eating more solid foods, shift your long-term diet to protein-focused meals that feature lean chicken, lean turkey, fish, or tofu.

, Following your doctor’s orders in the short-term, look to a long-term diet that includes lots of vegetables. During meals, eat protein portions first.Fruit and vegetables that are particularly good options include potatoes, carrots, green beans, tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, bananas, and avocados.

, There are several reasons smaller meals help you lose weight and keep it off. First, you’re literally eating less. Second, your body burns off calories more easily if they are consumed in smaller quantities.Plan regular meal times and do not eat after eight pm. This will help you avoid snacking.
Chew your food more slowly. Chew each bite for at least 15 seconds. There's an app called Baristatic that can help you do so!Wait a full two minutes in between bites to allow your stomach to send signals to your brain about your level of satiation.
Pay attention to how your body feels. You may not feel “full” until your body has the chance to recognize you put food in it. Give yourself and your body time to redefine what satiation feels like!

, Staying hydrated is associated with a myriad of health benefits, particularly following bariatric surgery.


First and foremost, you need to drink more water than usual to help your body rid itself of the waste and toxins that need to be flushed from your system during rapid weight loss.
Shoot for at least 64-ounces of water a day.
Drinking water also helps the stomach feel full longer, which will help you eat less frequently and stick to scheduled meals.
Make a point of drinking water at least 30 minutes outside of meal times, as the reduced capacity of your stomach may lead to discomfort if you try to drink with your meals., One of the drawbacks of bariatric surgery is the diminished ability to absorb nutrients. Know that you’ll need to consume higher-than-recommended doses of vitamins and other nutrients.Pay particular attention to how much iron you are getting in order to avoid anemia, which is a common complication following bariatric surgery.
If you have either a gastric or intestinal bypass (as opposed to a gastric banding), you will definitely need to heavily supplement your intake of vitamin B12 and calcium. Expect to take vitamins as prescribed by your doctors after bariatric surgery.

"
"
Eat just a little like you would be allowed, if you had your stomach stapled or a stomach bypass done.,
Imagine this different suggestion: Eat 5 or 6 bites of food twice per day.,
Consider weight loss surgery.",How to Lose Weight Eating Delicious Fast Food1," Yes, eat as if you had ""weight loss surgery"".



No, bulimia or anorexia will not come from eating little for a few weeks! Those are totally different eating disorders with an obsessive, mental component, such as thinking ""I'm still fat"" (when boney/skinny), or repeatedly binging and purging.

, Try eating only two medium Snickers, Baby Ruth, or such bars a day.
Can you (if fairly healthy) eat candy safely. ""Yes!"", but you ask ""How does that work?""

, If you chose surgery, then eat almost nothing for 3 or 4 months, by Doctor's Orders! Then never be able to eat a large meal ever again, for life...


Decide whether to have such surgery; if not, then: Skip the doctor's radical surgery and doctor ordered, forced ""starvation"", starving safely, how? Avoid doctor's knife and those ways to starve, if you do not have the surgery.

Realize that simple solutions rarely work when it comes to losing weight.,
Look for warnings on the diet.,
Step aside from any weight loss or diet program that suggest you don't need to exercise.,
Don't take any diet or weight loss regime seriously when it suggests that you can only eat certain foods at certain times of the day.,
Beware any diet that suggests that you should cut out whole food groups.,
Take care when a diet is based on what people used to do.,
Avoid diets that use foods that are difficult to obtain.,
Do some research.,
Be suspicious of any diet guru claiming to have solved weight loss problems and claims that trained diet professionals are in the dark or misguided.,
Consider how easy or hard it is to stick to the program.",How to Spot a Diet Scam," The reality is that losing weight requires effort, determination and focus and a magic pill hasn't yet been invented that can take care of these things and allow you to lose weight while reclining in front of the TV. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is and is likely to lead you on a merry dance.


Simply put: You will lose weight pretty much at the rate you gained it. There are no quick fixes. One to two pounds weight loss a week is realistic when on a sensible diet.;
, Be wary of any diet that is promoted with enormous weight range losses in photos and fine print that says things like ""results not typical"" or ""must be combined with a calorie-controlled diet and exercise"". After all, it is the ""calorie-controlled diet and exercise"" that lose the weight for you, so why add something else on top that costs money without proven benefits?

, It's total baloney from the outset. Exercise is essential.


The only exception to this is where your doctor considers that exercise would endanger your health for any reason, such as morbid obesity. However, your doctor should be monitoring your weight loss and will tell you when exercise can be introduced, so the aim should always be to add it in somewhere along the weight loss program.

, For example, if the diet says no pineapples before noon or only eat beef at 6pm, or make Tuesday grapes-only day, then it's likely to be on shaky scientific ground.

, Sugar is not a food group, so it doesn't count. However, suggesting that you cut out fats or carbohydrates completely is unscientific. There are healthy fats and complex carbohydrates have an important role in the human diet.

, While it is sound to say that people used to eat more fruit and vegetables than today, it is not sound to suggest that the Ooloobooloo tribe of the Far South Quadrant were healthy because they filled up on snake kidneys and milk all day long. When assessing diets based on the past, ask yourself:


How relevant is the diet to your life now?
How realistic is the food being suggested in such a diet?
What does my doctor think of this diet?

, There is little point going on a diet that doesn't include locally available foods. It is important to understand that while food in one region of the world may be very healthy for people living there, there is usually always an equivalent food in your region. For example, millet is popular in African diets, while wheat is popular in western diets, and both bring protein and other nutrients to the consumer but one is easy to obtain than the other, depending on where you're living.


The diet is on really shaky ground when it expects you to fork out large amounts of money to purchase its supplements or special diet products. If it suggests you eat food specially flown in delicacies from the Orobobo jungle in the deepest darkest regions of a place not yet marked on the map, it's definitely about getting your money, not improving your health.

, What do the diet experts in scientific organizations or reputable dietary organizations have to say about the diet in question? If there are questions about it, avoid it.

, Guru quackery is as alive in diet scams as in any other scams., Diets involve exercising regularly and eating smaller portions of healthy food repeatedly. This may feel tough to begin with but it is something you can maintain and learn to cope with, especially when you see the results in weight loss and increased energy levels. However, a fad diet that causes you to feel lethargic, constrained by bizarre rituals or fed up with measuring weird supplements daily won't have sticking power in the long run. And unfortunately, it can cause you to be diet-shy because it was so finicky and useless.

Commit to an exercise program.,
Walk!,
Look to add to your fitness regime whenever possible.,
Weigh yourself weekly.,
Occupy your mind.",How to Maintain Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery2," Your doctor will be the most capable of advising you on the specific types of exercise that will be safest and most effective for you. The important thing is that you keep your body active.


Exercise will not only help you feel better, it enables your body to burn fat more efficiently.
While your body will first look to burn muscle as you lose weight, exercise will preserve your muscle, and force your body to burn excess fat instead.
You will likely notice that exercise is both easier and more enjoyable after your procedure, as your rapid weight loss will improve the health and agility of your joints.Strive for about 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per day. If you miss a day, that’s alright, but make sure to exercise at least four days a week.

, The benefits of walking are multifold. At the hospital, you’ll likely be walking a bit as part of your recovery process (as it will help reduce the chances of developing a lower extremity blood clot, or DVT), you can go at your own pace, and you don’t need any special equipment.Check with your doctor about when you can begin walking on your own. Begin doing so as soon as they allow it.
Set realistic goals for yourself. A quarter mile is a good benchmark to start with, or decide to walk for five full minutes.
Whatever sort of exercise regime you choose, start slowly and gradually build on your abilities.
Once you can comfortably walk for five minutes – even if your heart rate is pumping – see if you can go for fifteen.
Going at a quicker pace during a walk will help you get a more productive work out in the same amount of time.

, Set new goals each week. Even if you just stick to walking, actively decide to increase your pace as your stamina increases. Mindset is important too: get yourself in the habit of exercising by making everyday decisions that increase your activity level.Wear a pedometer, a fitness tracker, or even use your smartphone to track your steps, and give yourself the option to set goals in terms of specific amounts of steps.
Park further out at parking lots. It seems silly, but not only will you end up healthier, you’ll have a moment to decompress when entering and leaving the places you go.
Pretend elevators don’t exist. Take the stairs whenever you have the option.
Further, stairs are a great step-up from regular waking, so you can incorporate them into a work out too!

, Pay close attention to your numerical weight. This will help you maintain weight loss after bariatric surgery, by boosting your motivation and satisfaction with the effort you’re putting in.By getting in the habit of weekly weigh-ins, you’ll also ensure that any potential increases in weight are quickly noticed.
If occasional increases in weight do occur, get back on the metaphorical healthy-living-horse that day by doing an especially engaged work out and eating one of your favorite healthy meals.

, One of the benefits of exercise is that it will also motivate you to eat healthier, and to spend time doing more active extracurricular activities. You can also take your focus off of food by picking up other hobbies too.Keep yourself active mentally. Explore a creative outlet with music or art, or start attending a weekly game night.
Give yourself sources of pleasure other than food. Lots of people are smart about not abusing other vices, but rely on food too heavily for comfort and enjoyment.
Stated simply, commit to spending more time on something you enjoy that doesn’t include food.

Follow your doctor's instructions.,
Get specific professional advice.,
See a psychologist.,
Explain your new lifestyle to friends and loved ones.,
Join and participate in a post-bariatric-surgery support group.,
Check out BariGroups.",How to Maintain Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery3," To help you lose weight and keep it off, your doctor will give you a substantial amount of advice about how to take care of yourself after your surgery, both immediately following the operation and in the long term.Immediately after the surgery, you will only be able to consume clear liquids. You will slowly introduce other liquids, pureed foods, soft foods, and then the food described in this article at about eight weeks.Your personal doctor is the best source of advice on how to adjust your lifestyle after bariatric surgery, since he is aware of other medical conditions you may have, and will give advice specific to your surgery and current level of health.
For instance, talk to your doctor before beginning your workout program.
Get periodic blood tests by your doctor. This is the most certain way to ensure you’re getting the nutrients you need following your surgery., You doctor will likely recommend that you begin to see a nutritionist. Make a point of following this advice. Additionally, address any emotional or psychological issues that arise with a mental health professional.See a nutritionist or dietician. (But remember, you’re not going on a diet, you’re making a complete lifestyle change!) These specialists will help you make healthy, nutritious food choices.
Talking with a nutritionist may even make you more aware about potential barriers to weight loss in your life. These might include depression, negative relationships, stress, discontentment with your job, or self-esteem issues.

, You’re going to be under an immense amount of physical and mental stress during your recovery from surgery and throughout the process of adjusting to your new lifestyle.


Recognize that factors seemingly unrelated to eating can strongly effect your desire to eat.If you find yourself stress-eating, see a psychologist soon.
A psychologist will help you learn stress-relieving activities to help you avoid the desire to stress-eat.

, The people in your life will be surprised by the difference in your eating habits. They may even become jealous about the improvements in your lifestyle. Be ready to explain why you’re doing what you’re doing.Be specific about dietary changes, as these will be especially surprising. Say things like, “I can only eat four ounces of food at a time now! I've decided to lose weight and I’m committed to it.”
If your social life is built around food, you’ll likely need to articulate your desire to do different things with your friends, or even spend less time with those that eat unhealthily.
Prepare yourself for changes in your romantic relationships as well. A loved one should support your decision and effort to live a healthier, more active lifestyle.
If things immediately get worse on account of your making healthier decisions, this may be a sign that you’re in a negative relationship and should consider making another tough lifestyle change., People who join such groups and actively maintain participation are in the best position to lose weight and keep it off. Keep in mind the frequency of meetings, the cost, and the type of meeting.While you can get a lot of important support from your friends and family, it’s also vital to be able to speak with those who are going through the same experiences you’re having. The groups do more than help you lose weight; they will help reinforce positive life changes.Some support groups meet in-person, while other groups meet online.
Some include a healthcare professional to act as a moderator, or be there just to answer questions or ensure that encouragement and decision-making is safe and healthy.

, BariGroups are online meetups that are anonymous, as you join via audio only. They are facilitated by a bariatric nurse “moderator”, who will post videos and audio clips to help everyone stay on track.Attend from anywhere you wish, on any internet-capable device.
There are multiple meet-ups per week.
Joining a BariGroup is free. (You have the option to tip the moderator if you wish to do so.)

So far! -- almost 2 months' total -- crash-diet on doctor's orders!
Phase 3: ""Starve"" on six meals of two tablespoons per day, that's about six 1/4 cup ""meals"" of soft, mashed foods -- 2 to 4 added weeks of this.
Phase 4: ""Starve"", for life. 3 tiny 1/2 cup -- 2 to 4 weeks and finally get up to a mini-feast of three ""1-cup meals"" of soft, chopped foods.Suffer a life sentence: No big, chewy bites of real steak or chicken, etc. -- but, Yes... munch ground or minced meats instead.;
, Realize that if you had ""starved"" like that (after that dangerous surgery) -- then phase 1 diet is only liquids: ""Broth, Unsweetened juice, Milk, Strained cream soup, Sugar-free gelatin -- Doctor's Orders!""for weeks -- safe enough?

, Evidently, ""Yes it is safe!"" as radical-weight-loss surgeons all agree: clients can survive such a diet!
Realize you have to be virtually starving to lose weight really fast.

Succeed with ""Five Bite Diet"" meals (like a modified fast).,
Digest a few meager bites of food and what happens: All caloric nutrients break down into sugar because you are not eating enough (not consuming a maintenance diet).,
Choose balance (for your health): Could you eat an unbalanced diet (sure!,
Ask your doctor how much and what kind of food you should eat, if your stomach were stapled or bypassed.,
Consider reading the book of Dr. Alwin C. Lewis called ""Why Weight Around?"",
Tell yourself, ""Don't to worry, plenty food will be here tomorrow, the next day, next week, next year,..."" No fear!,
Consider trying the suggestion: ""eat two medium-sized Snickers per day"" for the first two weeks (or whatever you crave).,
Check calories in your five chosen bites, if you want to know that info, for example, one rolled barbequed-chicken soft taco, with tomato and green onion tops:BBQ sauce, 1 Tbsp ------------------------ 15 cal;
Sriracha hot chili sauce, 1tsp ------------- 5 cal;
1 Chicken thigh, meat, large -------------- 200 cal;
1 Tortilla flour, moist, fajita size (45g) --- 90 cal;
1 Tomato, medium, cooked --------------- 25 cal;
Onion green tops, 1/2 cup, cooked ------ 20 cal;
Total: 355 calories.

,
Make a fist when food is near to help remember that diet!,
Lose safely: Don't stay on quick weight (modified fasting/actually starvation) level more than a few (like three or four) weeks at a time.

,
Cycle on and off of the diet.,
Handle a big plate/big meal: Take one bite of each kind of food on your plate (up to 5 or 6), slowly, enjoying the tastes.,
Get about 10% protein (1 big bite of a high quality protein food), every day on the diet (Snickers and Baby Ruth have some peanuts, a protein food).

,
Take a multivitamin supplement every day on your diet.,
Maintain your loses easily when finished -- eating three 7 bite meals.",How to Lose Weight Eating Delicious Fast Food3," Crash-diet. Think it through simply: all foods turn into sugar (glucose); that is: When the body needs energy but when you have eaten very little. Expect your body's Krebs Cycle (cellular level chemistry) to change fat and protein to sugar, if you eat very little -- or sugar to fat, if you overeat? It will... that's its job., The various sugars and starches, refined or raw, and complex carbohydrates (about like 2 sugar molecules joined together), plus fats and proteins all turn to energy, sugar -- while your body burns some of your stored fat or some muscle protein so: eat that protein.Caution: Avoid burning your muscle! If you get too thin or too lean, there would be no more fat to burn. Stay strong...

,): But, Don't do it -- for too long! See, an apple may be 5 bites, but is less than 100 calories. 10 bites of apple per day is starvation, a pure and simple food fact. The same ""no-no"" is true for 10 big bites of lettuce or any other low nutrient food. On the other hand, 10 bites of banana or cooked beans is not such starvation, but that, also, is not balanced!

, Ask him why ""surgery and crash-diet"" is better than just a crash-diet while saving thousands of dollars and not suffering a life of tiny meals from then on!

, (about his radical, restricted diet). Research his ""Five Bites Diet"", such as:


Fill-up with coffee or tea for breakfast (decaf for calm nerves?) -- your ""daily clear liquid-diet"" -- like phase 1, each morning. Drink a 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water (or other calorie-free beverages) each day (that's eight 8 oz. glasses).
Eat 5 bites of food twice per day. Limit, eat ten bites each day, ""Yes, 10."" (He said 12 bites will work, also).
The first 2 days are the hardest, but you get to choose to have any food you crave to help prevent feelings of deprivation that could cause you to quit your diet.
Drink liquids between meals. Drinking too much liquid with your meals can leave you feeling overly full on 5 tiny bites and prevent you from eating enough nutrient-rich foods (eat big bites!).

, Eat level or rounded tablespoon-sized bites (heaping tablespoon bites are okay -- but less effective, for rapid weight loss...).
A crash 5-bite-dieter can take 5 large, satisfying bites, for example:



Eat a burger diet: 3 Bites of burger and 2 bites of fries.

Try tacos: 2 bites of taco and 1 of guacamole and 1 of beans and 1 of rice.

Veg-out: 3 large Brussels sprouts, 1 bite of ice cream and 1 of protein...

Roll up:Fruity-tutti soft-taco. Try a burrito: Use beans (protein). Fruit roll up: Ripe mangoes or stewed apples as a taco.

Pop-5: 1 of bread, a chunk of fruit, a Brussels sprout, 1ounce of meat or cheese, a mini-piece of candy, or as you like.Bingo! We have a winner ! -- a 5-bite-loser.

, Why -- because that may be satisfying and astonishing, as you may loss up to 20 or 30 pounds, in 2 or 3 weeks. A Snicker of 1.86 ounce (52.7 grams) has 250 calories, 12 grams of fat, 27 grams sugar, 4g protein, a little less than 10% protein, by weight (data from wrapper).

,, Show your determination... Also, if you may eat when stressed, try squeezing a soft rubber ball/""stress-ball"" instead, and see whether that is effective for you. Get busy to be occupied with things other than food...

,, While ""off"" savoring weeks of progress (30 pounds?) enjoying a 1/2 week break after weeks of the hard slogging: Take a retreat and eat at a buffet/but chow down on a ton of salad, plenty of vegges and some special protein, a dessert (or two like its your birthday party!)... Eat normally for a few days; then get back on the 10 bites, and march ""on"" to the battlefront, forward!
Avoid eating very high fat, high cholesterol, or processed foods with undesirable chemicals, or other foods, such as hardened or partially-hardened fats or trans fats, which can be harmful, especially, if you have high cholesterol problems or cardiovascular disease.

, One bite is enough to savor the flavor! Dump the rest, to avoid eating it, or get it boxed to take it home for your next 2 days' meals. Make a fist! According to Dr. Lewis, you'll stop feeling as hungry after three days on the diet because your body will feel full on this smaller amount of food.

,, Talk to your doctor, whether you might need to take additional supplements, such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc.Drink non calorie beverages, as much as you want -- as long as it is basically water.


Breakfast: Coffee or tea (black please). (AM snack: 1/4 cup fruit, berries - optional)

Lunch: 5 bites of food. (Afternoon snack: 1 bite yogurt or ice cream - optional)

Dinner: 5 bites of food. (PM snack: 6 nuts or 2 chips, celery or such - optional)

Get a big bite of protein each day “on average”, not empty junk foods...

, Or if you like, go for 4 meals of 5 bites: -- Tah Dah: 20 Bites! Eat just enough to stop losing...

Set your weight loss goal.,
Evaluate your lifestyle.,
Determine external variables.,
Choose a tracking system.",How to Use Quantified Self Strategies to Lose Weight," Before you can explore your tracking options, you’ll need to identify exactly what you hope to achieve with your weight loss goal.


Determine why you want to lose weight. Do you want to lose a few pounds to look hot in a new pair of jeans or are the reasons more serious such as needing to reduce your blood pressure or risk for diabetes?
Identify how much weight you want to lose. Instead of just throwing out a number, take into consideration your current weight as compared to your height. Numerous body mass index calculators on the Internet can quickly ascertain whether you are within a normal weight range for your height.
Consider how long you should track your weight loss. Tracking your weight loss until you’ve reached your goal is obvious, but do you want to continue tracking your caloric intake and/or fitness level well into the maintenance phase? Also, how many pounds do you want to safely lose each week (which should ultimately contribute to the length you plan to track)?;
, In order to select the best weight loss tracking system, you’ll need to determine which kind of tracker will fit easiest into your life.


Parent or executive on the go. If you leave the house at 7am and don’t return until well into the evening, you’ll need to consider a mobile tracking device or one that you can easily keep with you throughout the day.
Homebody. A stay at home parent or someone who works from home may have the most flexibility when it comes to a tracking system. Being at home allows you to select from a myriad of tracking systems, however you must identify the system that you are most likely to use and can be easily integrated into your daily lifestyle.
Balance between home and work. If you bounce between home and work, you’ll need to find a tracking device that allows you to track progress at home, but still be accessible if you are on the road or in a different location.

, Weight loss is not a linear endeavor, so simply tracking food in general may not be the only element toward dropping the pounds.


Exercise. While exercise alone will not produce weight loss, it can be helpful in terms of reducing your stress level (which may have an impact on stress eating), enhancing your mood (due to the release of endorphins) and boost your metabolism (which can accelerate your weight loss goals). Additionally, weight loss is measured by calories in and out. Burning more calories than you consume will speed the process, which makes exercise or fitness tracking a priority for any who wants to lose weight.
Types of food. Although all calories should be considered to be equal in terms of weight loss, identifying the kinds of food you eat may help you make better decisions throughout the day.
Time of day you eat. Nutritionists and weight loss experts contend that breakfast may be the most important meal of the day, however, numerous dieters skip breakfast but end up eating more late in the day. Identifying when you eat may help you establish a pattern to identify when you overeat and the circumstances leading up to the indulgence.
External influences. Friends, work and family can influence how and what we eat. If your family is sedentary and the pantry is stocked full of junk food, you may find it increasingly more difficult to lose weight. Identifying and revising those external influences such as a junk food pantry or a sedentary lifestyle can help you home in on changes you will need to make in order to be successful.

, Using the information gathered from your goal, lifestyle and external variable evaluation in order to review and decide upon the different methods for tracking weight loss.


Comprehensive all-in-one online tracking system. If you like to maintain all your data in one place, an online tracking system that tracks food, exercise and mood may be ideal for you. Online trackers like “My Fitness Pal” and “My Calorie Counter” provide an opportunity to input food, exercise and daily journaling in both an online and mobile application. This type of tracker may be ideal for someone on the go either all day or sporadically throughout the day.
Individual food and fitness trackers. If you would prefer to break out your tracking system and track food using one method and fitness on something different, consider using an online or mobile app such as “The Daily Mile” or “Digifit” to track fitness or exercise. You could still use one of the comprehensive online tracking systems for food only or you could journal your food using pen and paper. This method may be better for someone who is typically at home or in one place for the majority of the day.
Identify tracking support. Do you automatically know how many calories you shed when you run a 10 minute mile or how many calories are in a two egg omelet? One of the keys to being successful is having the proper resources in place for quick reference. Food manuals from sites such as “Calorie King” can provide a smattering of calorie results from not only individual foods, but also meals at many popular restaurants. Additionally, some tracking systems can help you determine how many calories you’ve burned based on your weight, intensity and duration of the workout. If you are unsure about the intensity, consider purchasing a heart rate monitor system, which will automatically calculate the number of calories you burn during a specific workout. Sometimes amounts vary based on how hard you push yourself--which may not be the same every day.

Learn about the nutrition information and chemical composition of apple cider vinegar in order to determine precisely how this supplement can work to promote healthy weight loss.,
Understand what to look for when purchasing apple cider vinegar.,
Purchase apple cider vinegar from a health food store rather than from a grocery store.,
Consume 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar before every single meal.,
Keep a journal that catalogues your use of apple cider vinegar and your energy levels, hunger pangs, appetite spikes, sleeping habits and weight loss.,
Remember that effective weight loss is virtually impossible if the number of calories you are burning each day does not exceed the number of calories that you are consuming each day.,
Be patient with regard to the weight loss effects of apple cider vinegar.,
Calculate your body mass index and determine how much weight you need to lose to achieve your ideal weight.,
Maintain a healthy body weight after you reach your goal weight by avoiding fatty foods and continuing to use apple cider vinegar to promote healthy weight loss.

",How to Use Apple Vinegar for Weight Loss,"


Apple cider vinegar is an acidic liquid that is created by the fermentation of whole apples. The science behind apple cider vinegar as an effective weight loss supplement is questioned in many academic circles. There are, however, an equal number of nutritionists and dietitians who believe that apple cider vinegar can curb an appetite and promote gradual fat reduction.;
,


Many apple cider vinegar products are distilled too many times. Each distillation or filtration process strips the apple cider vinegar of essential nutrients and vitamins.
Purchase apple cider vinegar or apple cider vinegar supplements that are made from whole apples and that don't use vinegar that has been distilled or filtered.

, This will ensure that the vinegar you are purchasing still includes all of the positive characteristics of a weight loss supplement rather than apple cider vinegar that is designed just for cooking.

,


Some consumers prefer to dilute the apple cider vinegar in an 8-ounce glass of water or iced tea.
If the flavor of apple cider vinegar is too strong for you to comfortably consume on a regular basis, you may choose to add 1 to 2 teaspoons of raw honey to a dose of apple cider vinegar.

,


In your journal, list the amount of apple cider vinegar you used before a meal, the method in which you consumed the apple cider vinegar and the meal that you followed your dose with.
Compare these facts with your results to determine which type of apple cider vinegar dose is most effective for your body.

, While apple cider vinegar can help to curb your appetite and boost your metabolism, it will not replace the need for an exercise regimen and a healthy diet. Only by pairing healthy eating with regular aerobic exercise can you hope to lose weight over time.

, Apple cider vinegar is not a miracle drug; in fact, no such miracle drug exists. The only way to lose weight in an effective and healthy way is to do so gradually, giving your fat cells time to adjust and adapt to their new size.


Apple cider vinegar is thought to increase weight loss by about fifteen pounds each year. An extra fifteen pounds of weight loss each year can make a huge difference in one's personal appearance and overall health.

, Set specific weight loss goals for yourself and be sure to make them feasible and reachable. Unreachable goals will cause you to be frustrated and feel as if your weight loss journey is a failure. Set reasonable goals and use apple cider vinegar to systematically help you reach those goals.

Assess your mate’s readiness for weight loss.If your friend is in denial about his or her weight problems, or if your mate is simply not interested in changing diet or exercise habits, more overt efforts on your part are unlikely to influence him or her to make a commitment to lose weight.,
Suggest that your friend try a new diet or exercise program with you.,
Ask whether your mate has considered losing weight.",How to Tell Your Mate They Need to Lose Weight1,";
, Do research on healthy, balanced dietor exercise programsand ask if your friend will join you in trying to follow the new plan. Frame the discussion as if your mate will be the one helping you stick to a commitment to be healthier, instead of the other way around.

, If you feel comfortable gently and directly addressing the matter, privately ask if he or she has thought about trying to lose weight.


If your friend is already trying, offer your support and encouragement.
If your mate is offended at the idea or sees no reason to lose weight, consider discussing your concerns about his or her health or drop the matter for a month or two to give the idea time to take hold in his or her head. Chances are, your mate is privately aware of his or her need to lose weight and is simply embarrassed to discuss the matter or to realize that someone else is concerned enough to mention it directly.

Demonstrate that individuals at a healthy weight experience less discrimination.,
Show evidence that people at a healthier weight enjoy better mental health.,
List serious physical consequences of being overweight or obese.",How to Tell Your Mate They Need to Lose Weight2," Growing attention is being placed on the societal bias against heavy people by physicians, corporations, insurance agencies, the media, clothing stores, employers, potential and by current romantic partners.Achieving a healthy weight will make your mate more likely to receive less judgmental healthcare from a primary care provider, may reduce health insurance costs, may make him or her more appealing to hire or promotable, will make shopping for clothes more enjoyable, and will reduce your mate’s experience of social stigma attached to weight.
Individuals at a healthier weight are more likely to have a satisfying love life. Those at a healthy weight are less likely to experience sexual dysfunction,and people of average weight are also more likely to rate their sexual health and satisfaction positively., Individuals at an average weight experience less depression, fewer eating disorders, and lower rates of other mental disorders.Showing your mate that healthier weight may equate to a happier life– less likely to include negative self-image and other stresses and worries associated with extra weight – may be the stimulus he or she needs to work toward serious weight loss goals.

, Carrying a significant amount of excess weight contributes to multiple diseases.


Even just a few extra pounds increases your mate’s risk of heart disease,certain types of cancer,diabetes,hypertension, sleep apnea,and high cholesterol,among other conditions.
Excess weight may also inhibit recovery from certain illnesses and surgeries, prevent the provision of certain life-saving treatment or rescue services, and complicate the administration of effective medications and medical treatments.Women who are significantly overweight are also at increased risk of gestational diabetes, pregnancy complications and cesarean sections, birth defects in babies, and other maternal health complications.

"
"
Be honest about your concerns.,
Focus discussions on health, not the number on the scale.,
Make a commitment to a healthier lifestyle with your mate.",How to Tell Your Mate They Need to Lose Weight3," If your mate is obese or considerably overweight, he or she is at risk of many health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, joint pain, and certain types of cancer.


Have a private conversation in which you focus solely on your worries for his or her health, mentioning your concern for his or her well-being. Let your friend know that you do not want to see him or her go through any of the common problems that extra weight can cause.
Express tenderness and let your mate know you are genuinely concerned that his or her weight will prevent the two of you from being able to fully enjoy life together (such as the birth of a child or grandchild of yours or getting to enjoy retirement or even a 40th birthday together).

, Avoid focusing your comments on your friend’s weight, and instead emphasize the fact that you feel he or she is not healthy. Let your mate know that you care about him or her and would like to see him or her make a commitment to a healthy lifestyle.


Pointing out difficulties your mate has controlling blood pressure or completing simple physical tasks without getting out of breath will show that you are genuinely concerned about health issues and not just a full figure.
Consider making the conversation solely about the health issue, like working to reduce cholesterol, learning to better manage diabetes, or preventing a repeat heart attack.
Addressing particular health problems through dietary changes or increased exercise may have the effect of improving health measures and dropping pounds without focusing your intervention on excess weight alone.

, Providing a good example and being a friendly companion may help your friend decide to adopt healthy changes. Even if you do not need to lose weight, you may be able to benefit significantly from adopting a healthier lifestyle.


If you can personally commit to changing your diet (drinking less alcohol, eating less fast food, cooking more vegetables, etc), you can make a joint commitment to improving health with your mate.
Encourage your friend to make a pact to improve health for both of you by joining a fitness club together, trying a new sport or physical game, taking a class on healthy cooking, or simply taking walks together every evening.

Explain that you could spend more quality family time together if your mate lost weight.,
Talk about how traveling would become easier.,
Make a “bucket list” of life-long dreams.,
Invite your mate to join a team or activity with you.",How to Tell Your Mate They Need to Lose Weight4," Losing weight could help your mate enjoy activities with your family that were previously unavailable to you due to the restrictions placed on an overweight individual.


Amusement parks and water parks are safer and more accessible when a visitor is of a healthy weight.
Playing Frisbee, taking 5K walks or runs as a family team, using the swing set, and chasing after young children are examples of family activities that are easier to perform when an individual is of average weight.
Family-oriented events that require stamina or considerable time standing, such as cheering at a child’s daylong sporting event or volunteering at a school fair, will be easier and more pleasant for your mate to participate in once he or she has lost weight.

, Carrying excess weight can make travel more expensive and less comfortable. By losing weight, your mate can join family and friends in trips with less inconvenience and expense.


Planes often have narrow passenger seats that make air travel uncomfortable for an overweight individual and the passengers traveling next to them. In some cases, significantly overweight passengers are required to purchase tickets for two seats so that they do not infringe on the space of neighboring passengers. Although this can quickly escalate travel costs and be an embarrassment to overweight individuals, this problem can be eliminated with even moderate weight loss in many cases.
Travel often requires significant amounts of time walking, standing in line, carrying luggage, climbing steps, and touring on foot. Listing a few travel dreams of your mate and demonstrating how visiting these places would be easier without the strain of excess weight (and thus with increased mobility, stamina, and energy) may help goad him or her into attempting weight loss.

, Having a concrete list of things you and your mate wish to do together but cannot experience due to the discomfort or inconvenience of his or her excess weight may encourage your mate to drop the extra pounds.


Think of all the places you would like to travel, the outdoor activities you would like to accomplish, the type of jobs your mate would like to achieve, and even the activities you would like to do together once he or she has a slimmer physique, and present the list of goals as more easily achievable with less excess weight.
Climbing Mount Everest, walking a famous pilgrimage trail, being a model, looking great in a wedding gown or tux, and many other activities may fit well on the “bucket list” for your mate once he or she sheds some weight.

, Making a commitment to an activity that you can do together will reduce feelings of isolation in your mate and encourage him or her to lose weight in order to participate or may help him or her lose weight by virtue of participating.


Playing on a rugby team, taking yoga classes, or joining a club of mothers who take regular walks together may help your mate focus on the enjoyable activities he or she could take part in once weight loss has been achieved (or in order to achieve it).

Be supportive and encouraging – within limits.,
Do not threaten your mate.,
Offer positive reinforcement.,
Do not criticize or be cruel.,
Remove roadblocks to weight loss.",How to Tell Your Mate They Need to Lose Weight5," If you obsess over your friend’s need to lose weight, you may drive him or her away. Let your mate know you are there to help in any way he or she needs, whether it be just to listen or to give a 5am wake-up call every day.

, If you are desperate for your friend to commit to losing weight, resist the temptation to threaten by using “or else” statements or making your friendship or affection contingent on his or her commitment to losing weight.


Forcing your mate to choose between losing weight and having you as a supportive friend is unhelpful and may only drive your friend to poor eating habits or a sense of denial.
If your friend has rejected your attempts to encourage weight loss, drop the issue for a while. Sometimes your friend needs to know that you support him or her despite any weight problems, and time may be the key ingredient in helping him or her develop the personal motivation to lose weight.

, When he or she makes a healthy decision or reaches a goal toward committing to losing weight, celebrate with an activity that does not involve a focus on food or weight loss, like getting a manicure together, playing a game, going shopping, or simply offering positive compliments.

, Insulting your friend in words or deeds, making derogatory comments about his or her size or eating habits, or excluding your friend from activities will not motivate him or her to lose weight safely and effectively.


If you criticize your friend’s weight, clothing size, eating habits, physical activity levels, or appearance, you may inadvertently trigger unhealthy binging, eating disorders, and mental health problems while reducing your ability to influence him or her positively in the future.
Do not lose your temper or turn the matter into an argument. Your mate will begin the process of losing weight when he or she is ready, and alienating yourself by speaking or acting offensively will endanger your friendship.

, If your discussion about weight loss, health, and motivation has identified things that may be preventing your friend from taking the first step for weight loss, work to address the roadblock and help your friend find motivation.Some people just need regular reassurance that he or she is able to succeed at losing weight and that you will remain a friend no matter what the result. Others need a regular, firm reminder to exercise or eat well.
If your friend does not know how to eat well or exercise, this may be the primary barrier between your mate and weight loss. Work with him or her to prepare healthy meals, take walks, learn how to lift weights, buy more vegetables instead of chips, and identify healthy substitutions for foods and activities.
At times, the main barrier between individuals and a commitment to lose weight may be a mental or emotional difficulty. If your mate will not acknowledge a need to lose weight or get healthier, a doctor, loved one, or your friend alone may need to work through the matter without your interference.

Fresh acai is ideal if you can get it. It may be uncommon, but it is the best way to ensure the acai you're eating is of top quality.
Dried or frozen acai works well when it is hard to find fresh acai berries. These forms of acai will last longer than fresh acai berries.
Juice or concentrates can be easier to consume on the go. However, these may be expensive, and it is hard to determine how much acai you're getting.
Powder or pill forms of acai have a long shelf-life. They also make taking acai very easy. However, as these products are not evaluated by the FDA, it is difficult to tell exactly what you're getting.;
, Making frozen yogurt is a simple way to satisfy your sweet tooth, and to get your acai berry benefits at the same time. This takes some time to freeze and requires an ice cream maker, but it is worth the wait. Replace your ice cream with a healthier acai dessert.


Gather your ingredients

1 cup of frozen or fresh pomegranate arils
7 ounces of açai puree, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup of honey
32 ounces of Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
½ cup of lime juice.


Toss the frozen pomegranate arils with the açai puree, honey, vanilla, and lime juice.
Drain the liquid from the fruit and honey mixture right into the yogurt and set aside.
Whisk the yogurt/liquid mixture until smooth.
Pour the yogurt base into an ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
In the last two minutes of mixing, pour in the acai-pomegranate mixture.
Freeze for a little bit to allow the frozen yogurt to solidify.

, Liven up foods like granola, cereal, oatmeal, salads and plain yogurt using acai. There are plenty of foods to which you can just add fresh acai berries. Because they don't need to be cooked, you can liberally combine fresh acai with many of the things you already eat.

Built a yogurt parfait, by layering granola, acai berries, and yogurt in a cup.
Throw acai into your oatmeal while it is cooking.

While there are many variations on the acai bowl, highlighting the versatility of this recipe, there are some basic principles to producing one.


Vary the kinds of raw foods you include. Try spinach, nuts, and banana to name a few. Add some apple sauce and some chia or flax.
Blend your ingredients in a high-speed blender. This gives the dish an even consistency, a crucial quality of the acai breakfast bowl.
Thicken with chia or ice to the desired consistency. This will help you to feel more full, aiding in your weight-loss.

, You should think of this weight loss supplement like you would any other berry. The flavor of many foods, from muffins, breads, and pies to chicken, turkey, and fish can be improved or enhanced with the addition of this berry.


Gather your ingredients:

3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup Cognac or brandy
1/3 cup grapefruit juice
2 tablespoons acai berry vinegar
2 1/4 cups fresh or frozen acai berries, thawed
2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
4 chicken breasts, without skin

Mix Cognac, grapefruit juice and vinegar, and bring to boil, stirring. Add 1 1/4 cups berries and stock and boil, until the sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 175 °F (79.4 °C). Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown the chicken, skin side down, for a couple of minutes on each side. Then place the chicken in a greased baking dish.
Pour the still simmering sauce over the chicken, and add the remaining berries.
Bake, covered, for two hours, or until the chicken is heated to 175 °F (79.4 °C) in the center. For faster cooking, heat the oven to 400 °F (204.4 °C), and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a meat thermometer shows the meat has been heated to 175 °F (79.4 °C) throughout.
Spoon sauce onto plates. Slice chicken and place atop sauce. Garnish with additional berries.

, Using a powder, acai juice, or liquid concentrate you can make it really easy to take acai all the time. Making your own drink with it is a cost-effective method of using this weight loss product, though ready-made beverages are more convenient.


Find juice that boasts acai berry or acai extracts as one of its main ingredients.
Blend the powder into a smoothie, along with frozen yogurt, milk or soy milk, and any other fruits that you desire.
Purchase ready-made juice or smoothies at health food stores, websites, or gyms.

, This is usually the easiest form to find. It can also be the least expensive form of acai berry. Capsules will enable you to consume larger quantities of acai, without adding a lot of extra calories. However, as many herbal supplements are not evaluated by the FDA, it can be difficult to know exactly what you're taking.This is the method of choice for those needing large doses of acai.
Capsules can be purchased online or in health food stores.
Take a daily dosage as recommended on the packaging by the manufacturer.
If you don't like to swallow capsules, look for chewable tablets or those that dissolve in the mouth.

, People who are allergic to pollen or who have a palm allergy should be wary of acai. The severity of these reactions can vary. If you begin to feel abnormal or adverse reactions after taking acai, consult your doctor.

, Weight-control theories about acai rely on the idea that powerful antioxidants, such as those found in acai berries, help promote metabolic function. It is postulated that this in turn can help promote weight loss.


Antioxidants in acai are credited with promoting weight-control by aiding metabolic processes. Anthocyanins are considered the major antioxidant component in acai,but these are found in a wide variety of berries and other fruit and vegetables. They can be extracted from all of these sources, the same as acai.
Monounsaturated fats found in acai, like avocado and olives, are credited with controlling appetite. However, so much acai would have to be consumed to achieve these benefits that caloric intake would likely impede weight loss, and the diet would be impractically expensive in many cases., Because there is not very much science supporting the impact of acai on weight loss, the science that does exist is inconclusive. However, there are two studies that specifically investigated acai in its regard to body fat and weight loss, finding that acai may actually cause people to put on more fat.


In a study comparing the efficacy of a number of berries on weight-loss in mice, some berries actually had a measurable impact on weight-loss. However, acai berries were not only ineffective, they caused a build-up of fatty tissue in some parts of the body.In another study, acai consumption in humans was found to be positively correlated with an increase of visceral fat. Where minor weight loss was seen in individuals with an unhealthy level of body mass, the placebo effect cannot be ruled out., The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, released a warning to consumers about the abusive nature of misleading information regarding health benefits reported in the marketing of acai products. Pay close attention to the sources of information you read regarding acai.Specifically:


False or unsupported claims that use of the acai products would cause rapid and substantial weight loss, including as much as 25 pounds in four weeks.
News sites, where news reports, reporters who conducted independent tests of the products, and comments following the stories represented the views of independent consumers are fabricated.
Failure to adequately disclose that the content on the fake news sites was authored by affiliated marketers.
Failure to adequately disclose that consumers who sign up to receive a trial supply of the advertised products but who do not return the products and cancel quickly will be charged for the products, and will be shipped more products and billed on a recurring basis.

Try an at-home body wrap.,
Get a corset.,
Wear clothing that makes you look thinner.,
Choose certain colours and patterns for your clothes.,
Cover up problem areas and show off your best areas.,
Get fitted properly for a new bra.,
Stand and sit with good posture.",How to Take an Inch off Your Waist1," In order to do this wrap you’ll need lotion, clear plastic wrap and an elastic reusable bandage (like the kind you’d use on a sprained wrist). Once you’ve obtained the necessary items, perform the following instructions right before you go to bed:Apply the lotion to your stomach and waist area in a thick layer. Don’t massage the lotion too much into your skin.
Wrap the clear plastic wrap around your waist, on top of where you put the lotion. You may need to wrap the plastic two to three times around your waist. The plastic wrap should not be loose, but should be tight enough that it doesn’t fall off.
Wrap the elastic bandage around your waist on top of the plastic wrap. Secure the bandage to your body by tucking the end into the portion already wrapped around.
Sleep with the wrap on all night and remove it in the morning. You’ll likely notice a small difference in your waist size, but note it’s only temporary.;
, Corsets come in many different types, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. ‘Real’ corsets designed to trim your waistline have steel boning and multiple layers of non-stretchy fabrics. You can buy a ready-made corset at a lingerie store, or you can have one custom made for you.Corsets can help your waist look 2 – 4” smaller just by wearing them.
Corsets, because they’re tight, can also help you eat less as you’ll feel full faster.
Alternatively, you can also try wearing shapewear, which can help make you look thinner as well, but uses a different material than corsets. Plus you can buy shapewear that’s also underwear, camisoles, etc., The key to dressing so you look thinner is to avoid items like capris, pleated pants, long baggy shorts or shapeless skirts that only go down to your calf. Ensure the clothes you wear fit you properly, and choose items like the following:Dark-coloured jeans or pants that go down to your ankle or 1-2” below your ankle; long shirts, blazers, or non-baggy sweaters; knee-length pencil skirts; or fitted A-line skirts.
Maxi skirts. These are another great option to make you look thinner because they give you a longer vertical line and make your legs look longer. Solid colours work best. Avoid skirts with pleats, big pockets, layers and thick elastic waistbands. Pair a maxi skirt with a fitted top and heels.
Jeans that have a higher-rise or waist. Lower-rise jeans, while stylish, unfortunately can create the muffin top look around your waist, which does not look at all flattering. As with many other clothing pieces, higher-rise jeans make your legs look longer, which in turn makes you look thinner. Tuck your shirt into your jeans as well.
Skinny belts to cinch shirts, dresses and even coats. This helps to define your natural waistline and shows off your curves.
Try wearing heels. To help make your legs look slimmer and elongate your whole body, wear heels that are at least 2.5” or taller. It also helps to wear heels with a somewhat pointed toe, as opposed to a square toe.Just don't wear them all the time — wearing high heels repeatedly for prolonged periods can cause serious harm to your body and your posture.

, There are several colours and patterns you can choose for your clothing that will help make you look thinner, especially in the waist area.Black is a classic colour that can go with just about everything. But in addition to being a good colour choice for coordination purposes, it’s also a great colour choice for making yourself look thinner. Black (and dark blue, green and red) can create an illusion of a long vertical line which thins the body.
Vertical stripes create a similar illusion that the colour black does, and can be helpful when you’re trying to make your middle look smaller. If you wear vertical stripes on pants or skirts, it helps make your legs look longer and thinner, which thins out your middle and upper body too.

, If you have a particular part of your body that you don’t like and would like to keep somewhat hidden, wear dark colours in that area. On the other hand, if you have an area you’d like to show off, use a bright colour., Unfortunately most women end up wearing bras that are the wrong size for them. When a bra is the wrong size, it can give you curves in all the wrong places. Your breasts should be a proper height above your waist, which helps to make you look leaner.Before selecting any new bras, get measured properly by a professional in the lingerie department of a department store. They should also be able to point out other tricks you can look for in a bra.

, Good posture can make you look thinner, but it can also make you feel better. Standing and sitting with good posture helps relieve tense muscles in your body and can make you feel more relaxed.Evaluate your posture by standing with your back against a wall without any shoes on. Make sure you push your body such that your heels and bum are pressed against the wall behind you. Place one of your hands between the wall and your lower back, around your waist area. If the space is larger than the width of your hand, you need to work on your posture.
Good posture when you’re standing includes: keeping your shoulders back and in a relaxed position; pulling in your abdomen; keeping your feet hip-width apart; standing such that you are balanced equally on both feet; not locking your knees.Good posture when you’re sitting includes: choosing a chair where both of your feet can rest comfortably on the ground; choosing a chair that allows you to sit with your back against the back of the chair — place a pillow behind your lower back if necessary to feel comfortable; holding your head straight up with your chin tucked in a little bit; keeping your back and neck straight, but comfortable; keeping your shoulders relaxed and comfortable.

Having something to eat every 2.5 – 3 hours can help your blood sugar levels remain balanced throughout the day, but it only works when you eat the right things.Avoid snacks that are high in calories, fat, sugar and carbohydrates. This would include items such as chips, cookies, chocolate bars, bagels, pretzels.
Select snacks that are high in fibre, such as whole grains, beans and some fruits and vegetables.
Select snacks that have high amounts of good nutrients, such as low-fat dairy products, lean meats, nuts.

, Scientists have discovered that some of the artificial sweetener in diet soda tricks your body into thinking you’re consuming actual sugar. Because your body thinks you’re consuming sugar, it releases insulin in preparation. With no actual sugar to burn, the insulin ends up storing fat rather than burning it.There are multiple types of sugar substitutes on the market, each with their own benefits and problems. Know the difference between the different kinds and what potential effects they may have on your health. The Mayo Clinic offers an overview here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/artificial-sweeteners/art-20046936?pg=1


, Most people do not consume enough lean protein but instead consume too many simple carbohydrates. Carbs end up producing sugar, which our bodies normally use for energy, but if we consume too many carbs, we also produce too much sugar. This excess sugar then turns into excess weight. Alternatively lean protein builds muscles and helps keep them toned.Lean protein includes: low-fat dairy, beans, chickpeas, quinoa, round steaks, round roasts, top loin, top sirloin, pork tenderloin, ham, and skinless chicken and turkey.

, Saturated fat is the bad type of fat. Saturated fat adds inches to your waist, whereas unsaturated fats can help remove inches from your waist. Saturated fat tells your body to store fat, whereas unsaturated fat tells your body to reduce the amount of fat stored and helps balance your insulin levels.Saturated fats are usually found in processed foods like cookies and pastries. It is also found in red meat.
Instead of frying items for a meal, bake, broil or grill meats.
Use fat-free or low-fat dairy products.
Exchange two egg whites for a whole egg in recipes.
Use herbs, spices, lemon juice and other types of cooking flavours instead of adding butter or margarine.

, Studies have found that for every 10 grams of extra fibre you eat per day, you can reduce your fat by 3.7% over 5 years. One quick and easy way to get more fibre is to eat ½ cup of beans every day.


Other great sources of fibre are: flaked bran cereal, whole grain bread, oranges, raspberries, baked potatoes, carrots, hummus, and pears.
Canned beans usually are less likely to cause bloating and gas than the fresh variety, if you are concerned that might be a problem.

, Unfortunately, drinking a lot of coffee loaded with cream and sugar can lead to weight gain. But drinking green tea every day can actually lead to weight loss. Green tea contains catechins, which have been found to increase metabolism and help your liver burn more fat., Carbohydrates come in both a simple and a complex version. Simple carbohydrates are the kind that lead to an increase in fat, whereas complex carbohydrates can be good for you. Make sure you eat at least three servings of complex carbs (e.g., whole grains) every day.Complex carbs include whole grains such as oats, quinoa, brown rice and wheat.
Simple carbs include items made with refined flour, including white bread and pasta, and other items like white rice.

, Pepper contains a substance called piperine. Piperine may actually be able to reduce inflammation and prevent the formation of fat cells (also known as adipogenesis)., Dark chocolate, specifically the kind that has at least a 70% cacao level, has been shown in scientific studies to actually help people lose weight. This is because dark chocolate has something called flavonoids which are good for your heart. They’re also an antioxidant and can reduce inflammation.Try adding two servings of dark chocolate a day to your meals.

, Magnesium helps your body lower your fasting glucose and insulin levels, and it may even help prevent fluid retention.Doctors recommend women over the age of 18 consume at least 400 mg of magnesium a day. And those 31 years of age and older should consume 420 mg. Men over 18 should consume 310 mg per day, and men over 30 should consume 320 mg per day.
Magnesium food sources include nuts, spinach, soy milk, beans, avocados, brown rice, bananas, salmon and other fish.

, Many of us have work lives that don’t allow for much daily movement — usually because we’re stuck at a desk, staring a computer screen all day. Make the effort to get up and walk around every so often when you’ve been sitting awhile. If possible, opt to work at a standing desk.Any small activity you can add to your day that gets you moving is helpful:


Get off the bus a stop early and walk the extra distance.
Purposely walk up and down every aisle at the grocery store, even if you only need a few items.

Figure out how many calories you need to lose weight.,
Skip the sugar.,
Start with your vegetables.,
Eat more plants overall.,
Know how much is a portion of meat.,
Pick low-fat dairy.",How to Tighten Your Stomach1," Everyone's caloric needs are different, based mostly on your weight and activity level but also on your metabolism. To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you would to maintain your weight. Once you figure out how many calories you need to sustain your current weight, subtract 250 to 500 calories per day to figure out what you need to lose weight.For instance, if you are underweight with a low activity level, multiply your weight by 16 to see how many calories you need to sustain your weight. If you have a moderate activity level, multiply by 18, while if you have a high activity level, multiply by 22.If you are of normal weight, you multiply by 14, 16, and 18 for low, moderate, and high activity levels, respectively, while if you're overweight, your numbers are 11, 14, and 16.Low activity is defined as engaging in little to no physical activity every week. Moderate activity is 30 to 60 minutes of aerobic activity three times a week, while high is an hour or more of aerobic activity at least 3 times a week.;
, Sugar can put on weight in your belly area, and even healthy-seeming drinks can contribute. For instance, you may think fruit juice is a good idea. However, it's as sugary as some sodas, and you don't get the good fiber you do with whole fruit. If you want something sweet, try a piece of fruit., The vegetables on your plate are the healthiest part of your meal. If you start with them, you won't have as much room for other options that aren't as good for you. Plus, the fiber in vegetables tends to fill you up., If you focus on plant-based foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, it's much easier to lower your overall caloric intake. Plant-based foods are much lower in fat than other foods, so they fill you up without too many calories., When you do eat meat, restrict your portion to 3 ounces, which is about the size of a deck of cards. In addition, choose lean meats, such as chicken breast (without the skin) and fish., When eating dairy, stick with low-fat options. For instance, choose skim milk over whole, low-fat yogurt over full-fat yogurt, and low-fat cheeses."
"
Start your day with oatmeal.,
Eat lean protein in the morning.,
Add grapefruit to your diet.,
Eat fibrous vegetables and fruits.,
Eat nuts.,
Add raw flaxseeds to your diet.,
Find the good fats, like oleic acid, that slay your hunger.,
Enjoy dark chocolate.,
Eat spicy foods.",How to Suppress Appetite1," Eating either rolled oats, steel-cut oats or quick oats is a great way to suppress your appetite until lunchtime. Oatmeal is low on the glycemic index. This means that it doesn't cause a hunger-inducing blood sugar spike. Oatmeal is also high in fiber, which slows the rate at which carbohydrates are digested and absorbed by your body.Eating a serving size of oatmeal topped with almond milk and some cut apples or grapefruit is a healthy choice for appetite suppression.


The benefits of oatmeal are counteracted if you top it with brown sugar or maple syrup, which can cause a blood sugar spike followed by a drop in blood sugar. This can make you hungry long before lunchtime.;
, Another great breakfast choice is some sort of lean protein - eggs, lean meat or yogurt. Eating lean protein in the morning will help you stay satisfied throughout the day. Studies show that eating lean protein at other times of day doesn't have quite the same effect, so be sure to eat it for breakfast.When it comes to protein, don't go totally fat-free. Eating healthy fats like olive oil and avocados will keep you full longer than eating fat-free meals.

, While going on an all-grapefruit diet is a diet fad you want to avoid, having half a grapefruit with every meal has been shown to help people lose weight. One study indicates that grapefruit might have properties that lower your insulin after meals, keeping hunger at bay.However, it is very important, if you take medication, to check if it interacts with grapefruit, as it is known to interact adversely with 85 different drugs, 45 of which are very serious.Be extremely cautious when considering grapefruit. Do not consume grapefruit if you take drugs for erectile dysfunction, estrogens, statins for high cholesterol, calcium channel blockers, many blood thinners, benzodiazepines, thyroid hormone replacement, certain chemotherapies and immunomodulators, anti-fungal antibiotics and certain other antibiotics, beta-blockers, opiates, and anything else that might be metabolized by the liver and P450 cytochrome family.Additionally, pregnancy, breastfeeding or having breast cancer also contraindicate consumption of grapefruit. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the efficacy of grapefruit supplementation, so any supposition is purely anecdotal. If it works for you, and it's safe, then go for it and see if it helps.

, Most vegetables and fruits are high in fiber and water, both of which keep your stomach feeling full. Each of your meals should be mostly composed of vegetables and fruits along with portions of both protein and fat.Apples are particularly great for appetite suppression, so go ahead and have one per day.
Leafy greens are satisfying and packed with nutrients. Choose spinach, collards, mustard greens, kale, or chard over lighter greens like iceberg lettuce.
Potatoes have a chemical component that counteracts ghrelin. Eat baked, boiled or lightly sauteed potatoes, but avoid french fries and potato chips.

, Research shows that people who eat a serving size of nuts, especially almonds, on a daily basis feel less hungry than those who don't.They contain a filling combination of protein, fiber, and unsaturated fat.

, You can sprinkle them on foods like yogurt, smoothies, salads and vegetables. Flaxseeds are high in fiber, which keeps your blood sugar from rising too quickly, thereby suppressing your hunger.

, Oleic acid, which is found in peanut butter, avocados, nuts and olive oil, sends signals to your brain to curb your appetite.

, When you feel a craving for sweets and fruit just won't satisfy, eat a few pieces of dark chocolate. Unlike milk chocolate and other candies, the intensity of dark chocolate's flavor naturally tells our bodies when enough is enough. Try dark chocolate with at least 70% cacao - you'll see it's difficult to consume more than a few squares!Make sure you check the label when you buy dark chocolate. Many brands label their chocolate as ""dark"" when it contains much less than 70% cacao.

, It's easy to eat more than a serving size of bland, uninteresting food. You keep eating in an effort to satisfy your hunger, even when your belly is already full. Spicy foods, on the other hand, engage the senses such that you're paying more attention to how much you eat, and when you become full.


Cayenne is an excellent spice to add to your cooking. Sprinkle it on omelets, add it to soup, or add a bit to your avocado for a delicious kick.
Unlike ketchup, most hot sauces don't have too many calories per serving, so there's no need to stop yourself from using as much as you want. Just check the label first to make sure there's no added sugar.
Wasabi is another great hot condiment that causes you to feel sated more quickly.

Become more active.,
Start a moderate cardio exercise routine.,
Add in strength training for thirty minutes two to three times per week.,
Eat strategically.,
Don’t skip meals.,
Start a more serious strength-training plan once you have been incorporating regular exercise for about a month.,
Hire a personal trainer for the first few sessions of weight training.,
Separate your training days by areas of the body.,
Train for an hour or less.,
Do fewer reps with heavier weights.,
Drink plenty of water and eat plenty of protein.,
Increase your weight every three to four weeks of regular strength training.",How to Turn Fat Into Muscle," This is the essential step that many people ignore when they decide to eat better and exercise. Increasing the overall amount of activity you get throughout the day is likely to burn fat and keep it off in the long term.


At work, get a sit/stand desk so that you can change your body position.
Walk for three to ten minutes after each meal to kick-start your metabolism.
Incorporate at least 30 minutes of extra walking per day.
Get a pedometer and ensure you are in the 10,000 to 12,000 daily step range—the recommended amount of activity to maintain body weight. Don’t count your exercise in this tally.
Get an exercise bike or treadmill and use it while you watch TV.
Don’t sit for more than three hours on weekends. Scientists estimate that this is the point at which daily sitting starts to increase your chances for obesity and other serious illnesses.;
, If you don’t work out at all now, the main goal with exercise is to start at lower intensities and work your way up. Aim for 20 to 30 minutes of consecutive cardio per day at a rate that makes you slightly out of breath, but able to still carry on a conversation.


Slowly increasing intensity and length of exercise will also help you to avoid injury. After one to two months of adding cardio to your day, you will be ready to tackle more fat-burning exercise.

, Although more specific exercise will be targeted in the later methods, strength training increases your metabolic rate and burns more fat than cardio alone. Try a short core class at your gym, or add in light weights, squats, ab exercises and planks to get started.

, There are several recommended methods for enhancing fat burning and weight loss. Most of these focus on the types of carbohydrates, fats and sugars that you eat, cutting out the types with fewer vitamins and minerals.


Eat more meals and snacks, while reducing the amount you eat for lunch and dinner. Plan to eat a healthy snack an hour and a half before you work out and a half an hour after.
Reduce saturated fats and increase the amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These are those found in olive oil, egg yolks and fish oil and nuts, respectively.Replace processed foods with whole foods. The vitamins and minerals, as well as fats and sugars are more beneficial in whole fruits and vegetables.
Don’t cut out carbohydrates. Replace them with brown or ancient varieties that are digested more slowly and contain more nutrients.Try a low-carb diet every other day. Studies have found that the same weight loss benefits can be found in cutting calories and carbs every other day as are found in more strict dietary regimen.

, Eat regularly to ensure that your body doesn’t try to store up fat. This especially applies to breakfast, which actually boosts your metabolism and fat burning potential.

, Incorporating fat burning and muscle building strategies at the same time will allow you to see results more quickly.

, You must learn proper form to avoid injury. Learn to protect your back and other joints whenever you train.

, Having “arm days,” “leg days,” “chest days” and “ab days” will help you to break down and rebuild the muscle fibers in these areas faster.

, A 30 to 45-minute workout should give you enough of a chance to rebuild muscles in a certain area. This works out to about 15 sets that last three minutes apiece, including resting.

, A set with six reps with larger weights will be more beneficial than a 12 reps with smaller weights if you are trying to pack on muscle mass. Always do a set to fatigue—where you’re incapable of doing another repetition., Hydrated muscle fibers repair themselves more quickly. Protein is the building blocks of muscle and your post-gym snacks should be focused on this important part of your nutrition.

, You will continue to build muscle as you work into higher weights."

Drink green tea.,
Sip dandelion tea.,
Try nettle tea.,
Enjoy clove tea.,
Drink ginger root tea.",How to Use Thermogenic Teas to Help You Lose Weight1," Green tea is a great healthy beverage choice for several reasons, but it may also help you to drop some pounds. Some studies have shown that green tea has a thermogenic effect on the bodyand that it can reduce body weight by nearly 5% over three months.In other studies, EGCG, an important ingredient in green tea, has also been found to aid weight loss.Keep in mind that drinking green tea without making other changes will probably not result in any weight loss. You need to use green tea as a daily replacement for higher calorie beverages, such as sugary soda or a latte.;
, Dandelion, also known as taraxacum, has multiple benefits that may help with weight loss. It is a diuretic, which can help reduce water weight.Dandelion tea acts as a prebiotic, which may help to improve the efficiency of digestion and make it easier for you to lose weight as well., Nettle, also known as urtica, has long been used to help rebalance the body and this tea may have thermogenic properties as well. Nettles also contain serotonin, which is a natural chemical that may decrease appetite.Therefore, nettle tea may help with weight loss.


However, be aware that nettle can cause gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions., Clove tea has been found to stimulate ATP, which means that it has a thermogenic effect.Therefore, clove tea may help with weight loss. Clove has also long been used for digestive issues, such as gas, nausea, and vomiting., Studies have also shown that ginger tea can be effective as a weight loss aid.Ginger can also help with digestion by increasing saliva flow and calming an upset stomach. Other studies have shown that ginger tea may also help to reduce pain from menstrual cramps, arthritis, and headaches."

Remind yourself that self-consciousness is a feeling not a fact.,
Figure out the source of your self-consciousness.,
Deal with the people who make you self-conscious about your weight.,
Ask yourself if others are really judging you.",How to Stop Feeling Self Conscious About Your Weight1," When you feel self-conscious it seems like a spotlight has been turned on you. Every aspect of yourself seems to be on display for others, primarily the flaws. Know that this is just a feeling within you. The majority of the time, people are too wrapped up in themselves to be overly concerned about you.When you feel yourself getting very self-conscious about your body, instead of keeping these feelings in, express them. Tell a friend or close sibling how you are feeling. That way you can get a true opinion outside of yourself.;
, In order to make strides against overcoming self-consciousness, you need to uncover its roots. Were you teased as a child about your weight? Is there a certain person who always makes you feel self-conscious? Does your mom or dad constantly tell you how you need to lose weight?

, If your self-consciousness stems from the judgments of others, then the solution can take one of two forms. You will have to look deep inside yourself to determine if your relationship with this person is worth the pain they are causing you through judgments or unkind remarks.


If this person is a distant friend or acquaintance whose insults are making you feel bad about yourself, then it may be necessary to sever ties with this person. You deserve to have supporting relationships, not ones that tear you down.
If the person casting judgments about your weight is a really close friend or family member, you need to confront them. This person needs to be aware of how their remarks are affecting you. Once you confront the person, they may recognize the harmfulness of their words and no longer insult or judge you.
If you decide to confront the person, you should give them a heads up that you want to talk and choose a neutral location to meet. Use ""I"" statements and avoid blaming them. Just let out your feelings with facts. A statement might sound like ""I feel upset/sad/embarrassed when you make comments about my weight. I would really appreciate it if you could stop doing this.""

, If your attempt to identify the source of your self-consciousness came up empty-handed, it may be because these feelings are more ingrained. Perhaps you lack confidence in your body because of messages expressed in the media. Maybe your body size and shape does not resemble models or TV actresses and it causes you to feel bad about yourself. Maybe you've tried to lose weight and failed in the past, so now you are beating yourself up mentally and emotionally.It's time to get real with yourself about media messages. Both women and men idealize the unattainable bodies that are portrayed on TV and magazines when these bodies have been photo-shopped to look perfect. Tell yourself that real bodies come in all shapes and sizes. Look around you; each day you see a range of beautiful people with all sorts of bodies."

When you start to feel hungry or want a snack between meals, reach for some mint!,
Drink water.,
Chew mint-flavored gum.,
Wash then chew on a mint leaf for a similar effect.

,
Have an after-dinner mint.,
Consider taking a break to brush your teeth with mint toothpaste.",How to Suppress Your Appetite with Mint," The scent of mint acts as an appetite suppressant.;
, It will give your body a temporary fill-up. It's also good for you! Stick with plain water, or add some mint flavor to it for that bonus appetite suppressant.

, Not only will the mint scent/taste help suppress your appetite, but simply chewing gum can help reduce cravings.

,, The calories are negligible (unless you eat them in volume) and the mint flavor can help tide you over to the next meal.

, Again the mint will help, plus getting any other food flavors out of your mouth will help. And since most people brush their teeth after eating, we associate that ""just-brushed"" feeling with feeling full.

Include 150 minutes of steady-state aerobic activity each week.,
Include 1-2 days of HIIT workouts.,
Always warm-up and cool-down.,
Increase your steps throughout the day.,
Include 2-3 days of strength training.,
Do a combination of strengthening and bulking exercises.,
Always include 1-2 rest days.,
Include regular flexibility training.,
Monitor your caloric intake each day.,
Fill up on low calorie, nutrient dense foods.,
Have a pre or post workout snack if needed.,
Drink adequate fluids.",How to Use Exercise to Lose the Flab," One of the most effective exercises to burn calories is steady-state cardio activities. These burn extra calories to help you lose weight.


Steady state cardio exercises are those that raise your heart rate and keep it raised at a fairly consistent level for at least 10 minutes.Include a minimum of 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardio each week. Try to split this up throughout the week to help get yourself activity most days.If you do not see adequate result or you are interested in faster weight loss, you can try to increase your cardio time to about 300 minutes for additional calories burned.;
, In addition to steady-state cardio, there is higher a intensity interval training. This is also categorized as cardiovascular exercise but has slightly different effects compared to steady-state activities.


High intensity interval training or HIIT workouts alternate between both high intensity aerobic activities and more moderate intensity aerobic activities.
The result of HIIT workouts is that you burn more calories from fat (which can help decrease flab) and it raises your metabolism for much longer after the workout has been completed.Although HIIT workouts may seem like the best bet, it's better to have a combination of both steady-state and HIIT workouts to maximize your calorie burn.HIIT workouts can be done with any type of cardio. You can alternate between sprinting and jogging or sign up for a spin class which alternates between high resistance spinning and more moderate resistance spinning.

, When you're increasing your exercise and relying on your activity levels to burn calories and lose weight, it's important to take care of your body so that you can continue your routine without any injuries or issues.


Warm-ups are really important for your exercise routine. They can increase blood flow to your muscles, slowly rev up your heart and lungs and also reduce muscle soreness after your workout has been completed.A warm-up typically includes doing the planned cardio activity but at a slower pace. For example, if you're going to go for a run, do a fast walk or very slow jog for 5-10 minutes prior to going full speed.
A cool-down also provides your body with significant benefits including: allowing your heart and lunges to recover and helps regulate blood flow.A cool-down is similar to your warm-up. You should decrease your pace and intensity of whatever exercise you're doing and continue at this low intensity level for about 5-10 minutes.

, Many studies show that lifestyle activity or baseline activities can offer similar health and weight benefits as more structured activities like steady-state cardio.Lifestyle activities are things you do in your typical day that get you moving. For example, walking up the stairs to your bedroom or walking down the driveway to get the mail can count towards lifestyle activities.
These types of exercises don't necessarily burn large quantities of calories alone. However, the more you move around and the more active you are overall, the more calories you'll burn throughout the day.
Try to think of your typical day and plan for times when you can add more movement or steps to your day. Can you take more steps by parking farther away or taking the stairs instead of the elevator? Or can you take a 10 minute yoga break over lunch, stand at your desk instead of sit or do jumping jacks while you watch TV?

, Strength training or resistance training can also provide you with weight loss benefits in addition to cardio exercises.


You may not think strength training burns as many calories as aerobic exercise - which is true. However, strength training helps build lean muscle mass which burns more calories at rest compared to fat.The more muscle mass you have, the higher your metabolism will be.
Also, if you're interested in losing excess flab or body fat, strength training exercises will provide you the toned, strong look after some initial weight loss.
Include at least 1-3 days of strength training each week. Ensure that each session lasts for 20 minutes and you work every major muscle group., When you start strength training, there are two methods to lifting weights. You can do more reps at a lower weight to help increase muscle bulk or you can do fewer reps with higher weights to help increase strength.


If you're looking to lose flab, you may be looking to help increase muscle definition and to tone up. If you want to see a difference in the way your muscles look, try doing much fewer reps but with much higher weights as well. Fewer reps with a heavier weight build your strength.However, if you just want to lose excess body fat and be a little bit stronger, do more repetitions of the exercise with a slightly lower resistance. Many reps with a light weight build your endurance.Most people should do a combination of both types. You'll be able to lose weight and excess flab while building strength and getting a defined and toned look.

, Whenever you're doing weight training (or any type of exercise), it's important to include a few rest days during the week.Do not work the same muscles two days in a row. A rest day should allow your muscle to recover and repair. Allow a day in between weight lifting or a day in between each muscle group.
Much of the muscular growth and strengthening actually happens during your rest and recovery days.
On days that you're taking off, still make yourself active. Increase your lifestyle activities or participate in low intensity activities like yoga or walking.

, Stretching and flexibility training do not burn many calories and will not necessarily contribute to your weight loss. However, they can ensure that your body is ready for activity and can continue with more vigorous exercise over time.The benefits of regular stretching include: increased range of motion, decreased risk of injury and improved performance. Some studies show that stretching may also help decrease muscle soreness after exercise.Stretch very light after your warm-up and more intensely after you've completed your workout and cool down.
Stretching should never feel painful. In addition, do not bounce as you stretch. Hold your stretching position steady for at least 20 seconds before slowly releasing.
Also ensure to stretch every major muscle group. This will help make sure all muscles are well stretched.

, If you're trying to lose weight, you'll get the best results by combining a calorie controlled diet with your new exercise routine.In addition to your new workout routine, manage your total caloric intake. Use an online calorie calculator or a food journaling app to figure out how many calories you should be consuming each day.
If you cut out about 500 calories daily from this amount, you'll generally lose about 1-2 pounds per week. In combination with exercise, you may even lose slightly more.Do not cut out more than 500 calories daily or eat less than 1200 calories per day. Even without exercise, this is not safe as your body will start using lean muscle mass for energy and you're at increased risk for nutrient deficiencies., In addition to monitoring calories, try to make most of your meals lower calorie and nutrient dense foods. These will help you stay satisfied and meet nutrient recommendations without going over your calorie limit.


Protein will be an essential food and nutrient to include in your diet. Lean protein will help you stay within your calorie goal and support your new exercise routine. Include a 3-4 oz (85-113 grams) serving at each meal of items like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, legumes, low-fat dairy, seafood or tofu.Also make half of your meal a fruit or vegetables. This foods are very low in calories yet offer a variety of other essential nutrients. Include a 1 cup (236 milliliters) serving of vegetables, 2 cups (472 milliliters) of leafy greens and a 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of fruit.Also have no more than two servings of 100% whole grains each day. These foods are high in fiber and other essential nutrients. Include a 1 oz (28 grams) or 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) portion at most meals., If you're relying on exercise to help you lose weight and excess body fat, you'll need to make sure you support those workouts with the right type of fuel.


Some ideas for pre-workout snack include: a piece of fruit, bowl of oatmeal or a small yogurt.
After you workout, you'll need to replace both the energy you used during the exercise and the protein you broke down.Eat a snack that combines protein and complex carbohydrates.
Ideas for a post workout snack can include: one tablespoon of peanut butter on a celery stick; a glass of low-fat milk with an apple; 9 almonds and an orange; or two tablespoons of hummus with carrot sticks. In general, your post-workout snacks should stay under 200 calories.

, Like pre and post workout snacks, it's important to stay well hydrated with elevated levels of physical activity.


Drinking adequate fluid daily helps maintain proper hydration. With increased levels of physical activity you may sweat more and lose more fluid through your sweat.
While exercising make sure you're drinking adequate fluids. However, you'll want to make sure you drink enough fluids the rest of the day as well.
Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of fluids daily. On days you workout, you may need to consume up to 13 glasses of fluid daily.Stick to no-calorie, caffeine-free beverages. This will help you stay within your calorie goal but also keep you hydrated. Try water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.

Employ your whole body.,
Find a team sport.,
Include abdominal work as a part of a larger routine.,
Exercise your boredom away.",How to Tighten Your Stomach2," While you may think it's best to focus on your abs, it's actually better to do exercises that work your whole body. That's because these exercises help you lose weight all across your body, which in turn takes fat off your belly. They also help strengthen your stomach muscles.For an exercise that works your whole body, try swimming, running, or walking., Many cities have adult community leagues for sports. Alternatively, your workplace may have a baseball or soccer team. Joining a team gets you active even when you're just having fun., While working your abs by doing crunches and sit-ups can help your overall health, it's not going to flatten your stomach on its own. That's because exercising increases muscle in the areas you work, but it draws fat from your whole body. Therefore, while crunches and sit-ups can be a good workout, you can't focus only on them to flatten your stomach.If your main goal is to lose belly fat, then it's fine to stick solely with aerobic exercise.You should be getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.If you want to add in abdominal work, you can add 10 to 20 minutes to your routine.

, If you're like many people, you may eat when you're bored. Instead of reaching for a snack, go on a walk instead. Exercising instead of eating will help cut down on the fat in your body."

Learn to fidget.,
Be active during the day.,

Accept your body shape.",How to Tighten Your Stomach3," While your mother may have always told you not to fidget, fidgeting can actually be beneficial to your health. While it's not considered exercise, it does help you burn off the calories you've consumed during the day., Even if you have a desk job, you can take steps to be more active throughout the day. For instance, you can park farther away at the store or take the stairs instead of the elevator.You can also go on a walk at lunch.Another option is to ask your boss if you can convert to a standing desk, which helps you move around more instead of just sitting all day., If your goal is to make your stomach look flatter, you can use clothing like a girdle to help flatten it out. However, girdles do nothing to flatten your stomach in the long term.You can also try wearing looser-fitting tops, especially ones that fit looser around your belly.Use your pants. That is, if you wear pants with a high waist, they can give your stomach extra support, helping to flatten it.Pick darker colors, as well as simpler patterns. Anything too outrageous can draw attention to your stomach instead of hiding it. Try small polka dots or vertical stripes., Not everyone can have a perfectly flat stomach. Genetics play a part in the shape of your body. Learn to love the body you have by learning to appreciate the things it does for you,such as keeping you alive, getting you to work, and letting you enjoy the sunshine.

Drink water.,
Consider caffeine.,
Drink vegetable juice.,
Drink green tea.,
Make low-calorie soups or organic broths to suppress your appetite.,
Avoid alcohol, except wine.",How to Suppress Appetite2," You've heard it a million times, but it's true - when you're on a diet, drinking tons of water can be a lifesaver. Drinking water before, during and after meals keeps your stomach full. When you feel hunger pangs, drink a glass of water before grabbing food; it'll help prevent you from eating too much. Here are a few creative ways to drink plenty of water throughout the day:


Make ginger tea. Adding a few slices of fresh ginger to boiling water and letting the steep for a few minutes before drinking makes for a delicious beverage. Ginger aids digestion and stimulates the metabolism.Make cucumber or lemon water. Adding a flavor to your water will make it more interesting to drink and stimulate your sense of taste, which helps you stay full longer. Squeeze a lemon or float some cucumber slices in your water glass.

, Caffeine has mixed reviews when it comes to suppressing appetite. Drinking a cup of black coffee or tea works well to suppress hunger for some, but others experience big hunger pangs once the caffeine rush is gone, negating the positive effect. Try drinking a cup of coffee or black tea (without milk or sugar) and pay close attention to what happens over the next few hours. If you don't feel hungry, even when you no longer feel the effects of caffeine, it may work well as an appetite suppressant for you.

, Juicing kale, carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and other vegetables results in a vitamin-filled beverage that will keep you full for hours. The same is not true for fruit juice, though, since fruit contains a lot of sugars.

, Green tea has been used as an appetite suppressant for centuries, since it contains EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), a nutrient that increases production of the hormone that makes you feel satisfied instead of hungry. Drinking green tea on a daily basis also helps prevent fat storage from occurring., If you pick a low-calorie chicken noodle soup, you get the added benefit of protein from the chicken, while the broth fills you up.

, Most alcoholic beverages - beer, cocktails, and so on - are loaded with calories, and since they lower your inhibitions, you're more likely to break your diet when you drink. Red wine, however, has been shown to help suppress the appetite by making you feel full. Limit yourself to one or two glasses a day."
"
Eat slowly.,
Improve your cardio workout with intervals.,
Brush your teeth.,
Get a good night's sleep.,
Stay busy.,
Manage stress.",How to Suppress Appetite3," Rushing through your meals will make you end up eating more, since your stomach doesn't have time to send your brain the signal that it's full. Chew your food slowly and pay attention to what you're eating. Put your fork down in between bites, if that helps you to slow down. Avoid eating in front of the TV or while reading, since the lack of attention to your meal will have you mindlessly overeating.

, By alternating full-force cardio with small rest periods, you maximize your ghrelin level reduction (which will suppress your appetite).

, When a big craving hits, brush your teeth. The flavor tricks your mind into thinking that you ate something, and it puts you off your food for a few hours, since eating right after brushing makes food taste horrible.You don't want to go brushing your teeth 5 times a day, though. Brushing too much can wear away the enamel on your teeth. Brush no more than 2 or 3 times a day.
Chewing minty sugarless gum might be another good way to trick yourself into feeling full for awhile.

, Studies show that being sleep deprived causes us to eat more throughout the day, and also increases our affinity for high caloric foods . On the other hand, getting too much sleep can have the same effect. Aim to get 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night to achieve the ""sweet spot"" necessary to keep your hunger in check.

, Boredom is a major culprit when it comes to overeating. If you have too much time on your hands, chances are you'll fill it with food. Stay active all day long, whether you're at work or at home. Change things up by taking short walks, meeting with people in person, doing activities that require the use of your hands, and so on. Don't give yourself time to get hungry!

, Eating because you're sad, angry, or just stressed out is a great way to kill any diet. Stress causes the body to overproduce hormones that make you feel hungry, which is why the idea of reaching for cookies and ice cream to deal with bad news has become a cultural cliché. Manage your problems with meditation, exercise, and therapy so you won't turn to sugar and starch.

Select organic herbs.,
Buy from a local herbalist if possible.,
Evaluate the packaging.",How to Use Thermogenic Teas to Help You Lose Weight2," To ensure that you are not drinking any pesticides along with your herbs, select only organic herbs for your teas. Pesticides have been linked with cancer and other health conditions.Check the package for a certified organic label if you are buying prepackaged herbs or ask your wholesaler if you are buying herbs in bulk.

, You can get herb teas in most grocery stores, but herbalists carry high quality medicinal herbs. These herbs are often more potent and you may even be able to get a special blend of herbs for your individual needs., If you are buying pre-packaged herbs or herb teas, take time to study the package and determine if the product is of good quality. If the product lacks important information or seems too good to be true, then you should probably not buy it. Some things to be wary of include:unrealistic or unfounded claims on the package
a lack of information about dosing, side effects, and ingredients
a label that is hard to read or understand
no company information such as a phone number, mailing address, or website.

Exercise most days.,
Eat less than you burn.,
Drink water.,
Manage stress.",How to Use Thermogenic Teas to Help You Lose Weight3," To lose weight, it is essential to get regular moderate to vigorous exercise in addition to using your teas. Aim for 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise per day five days per week. Walking, riding a bike, swimming, and dancing are all great options for aerobic exercise.Strength training is also helpful because it helps your body build muscle, which helps to burn fat. Try to incorporate a couple of 60 minute strength training sessions a couple of days per week as well.

, In addition to exercising, it is crucial to make wise choices about food when attempting to lose weight. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in, so choose low-calorie foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Avoid foods that are fatty, fried, or loaded with sugar. If you do not eat a healthy diet and exercise you are extremely unlikely to lose weight., Drinking plenty of water is important because water helps regulate your metabolism and it also helps you to feel full. Sometimes people mistake thirst for hunger and end up eating when they are really just thirsty. Choosing water over other higher calorie beverages can also help you to reduce your overall caloric intake.Try to drink between 9-13 glasses of water per day and drink more when you have been active.
You should try to get the majority of your hydration from plain drinking water. However, studies suggest that consuming other beverages can also contribute to your daily hydration goals., Stress can lead to weight gain because when we are stressed, we tend to eat more and make poor choices about food. To combat these negative effects, take time every day to relax. Things like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can help you to reduce stress on a daily basis."

Learn to accept yourself as you are now.,
Challenge negative thoughts.,
Reevaluate your beliefs.,
Determine if there is a deeper problem.",How to Stop Feeling Self Conscious About Your Weight2," Even if you are overweight, your body is still an amazing thing. Your heart never stops beating. Your brain is a super-computer. Your eyes allow you to see the wonders of life and your environment. You have so much to be grateful for if you are able to see, hear, smell, move, and think for yourself. Practice a few body-loving exercises to learn to accept your body as it is.As you rise from your bed each morning, wonder at the strength and perseverance of your body. Your legs carry you around. Your arms tie your shoes and hold objects. Your nose can catch the scent of fresh-brewed coffee. Isn't your body a miracle?
Stand in front of the mirror and think positively about what you see before you. Before you step into the shower or change clothes, stand naked or in your underwear and admire your miraculous body. Recite this: “I fully accept and love myself right now just the way I am. I’m grateful for my wonderful body and for the gift of life.”

, If, during the course of these exercises, negative thoughts enter your mind, don't entertain them. Instead, reflect upon how awesome your body is.


Reframing means changing your negative perspective into a positive one. It takes practice but once you are able to identify which thoughts are unhelpful or negative (Hint: Those that make you feel bad.), you can tear this self-talk apart and reframe it.
For example, you might say: ""I look terrible in this outfit. Everyone will laugh at me."" While reframing, ask yourself has there ever been a time when everyone laughed at you. If the answer is no, you can reframe this statement to say ""Everyone has a different idea of style. I like this outfit and that is what's most important."" This reframing is not only more positive but also more realistic.

, Sometimes, we feel bad about ourselves because we are holding on to ingrained beliefs about what we should or should not be. An example of an ingrained belief is, ""In order to be attractive, I have to be thin."" Know that it's OK to release beliefs that no longer serve you.Ask yourself how you would respond if you found out a dear friend was attacking her/his body. You would probably tell them how beautiful they are. You would point out all their strengths and tell them they have so much going for themselves.
Tell yourself these things when you notice yourself falling prey to negative beliefs or attitudes about your body. Say things like ""I am smart. I have gorgeous skin. I rocked that dress last night.""

, If you are persistently encountering problems with your self-esteem or your negative body image causes you to practice extreme dieting or refusing to eat, you should see a therapist who has experience with body image and eating disorders. A mental health therapist in this area may help you to apply cognitive and behavioral techniques that help you modify the negative thoughts you have about your body and develop healthier habits.Another option for you to work on your self-confidence is to attend a body image group. Your therapist may be able to refer you to a local group or the professional may have a group that he or she meets with regularly. Such a group can help you to connect with others who are going through similar body image struggles, and allow you to find courage to overcome these issues with support.

Throw away the scales.,
Develop a clean eating plan.,
Stay active.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Dress and look your best.",How to Stop Feeling Self Conscious About Your Weight3," This may seem counter-intuitive, but a surefire way to stop obsessing and feeling bad over your weight is to get rid of your scale. As it turns out, the scale is only one - and not the most reliable - way to measure your progress. Plus, if you are climbing on the scale every morning and beating yourself up because the number stays the same or climbs, it's probably causing you more trouble than it's worth.Weight can be misleading, as 150 pounds will look totally different on a person who is 5'2"" than it will on a person who is 5'7"".
Instead of focusing on your weight, track your progress in more reliable way such as getting regular blood tests for blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. These numbers can give way more useful information about your health, and can also indicate disease if they are moving in the wrong direction.
Visit a gym or fitness center and get your body composition taken. Such a measure can tell you if you are within a healthy range for body mass index (BMI) and if you have lost fat and gained muscle, two factors which often influence what you weight may be on the scale.

, If you are feeling lousy about your weight, then following a healthy diet can help you feel more confident. This is one proven way you can take action against body self-consciousness. Strive to eat real, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, seafood, seeds, nuts, and low-fat dairy. Avoid refined and processed foods that have been altered from their original form.


Visit choosemyplate.gov to learn the recommendations for a balanced diet from the United States Department of Agriculture.If you are interested in receiving personalized, one-on-one feedback about your diet in relation to your current BMI and lifestyle, see a registered dietitian.

, The second most instrumental factor to becoming healthier is adopting a regular fitness program. This doesn't mean spending hours in the gym. A physical fitness program can include a range of activities you enjoy like volleyball, swimming, or dancing. Regardless of what you do, regular exercise helps you to burn calories, feel better about your physical appearance, gain more energy, and relieve stress., Goal-setting allows you to create a road map for your success. Defining our goals helps us to evaluate if our daily actions are moving us toward or away from them. Plus, achieving a goal gives you confidence and builds your self-esteem. If you are wanting to feel less self-conscious about your weight, you may strive to develop a weight loss or fitness goal such as eating more vegetables or doing a workout five days a week. Just make sure that your goals are S.M.A.R.T.Specific. You set a specific goal by answering the w's. Who's involved? What do you want to accomplish? Where will the goal take place? When will it start/finish? Why are you doing this?

Measurable. Good goal-setting includes tracking and measuring progress.

Achievable. Yes, you want your goal to challenge you, but you also want it to be something you can reasonably achieve. For example, you wouldn't want to set a goal to lose an obscene amount of weight in a short period of time.

Results-focused. S.M.A.R.T. goals focus on the outcome. You track your progress over time and see if you reached the goal in the end.

Time-bound. Timeliness is also important in goal-setting. You want to set a time-frame that is practical but also not so far away that you lose focus.

, Another way to kick self-consciousness to the curb is to feel more confident in your looks. Visit your hairstylist to get a haircut or style that is most flattering to your face shape. Also, go through your wardrobe and examine each piece of clothing you own. Ask yourself if each piece makes you feel happy, confident, and attractive. Are you constantly tugging or pulling on certain pieces? If certain pieces don't make you feel great, toss them (or donate to Goodwill).You may not have the cash to go out and pick up an entirely new wardrobe. Hold on to some things that you like, and as you get extra money, pick up new items that make you feel confident and like the person you want to be. You should smile at yourself in the mirror when you try these pieces on.
Seek out a boutique or clothing store that offers tailored, sculpted pieces in high-quality fabrics. These pieces don't have to be expensive but only look and feel of good quality. Choosing well-made pieces can go a long way towards increasing your confidence and making your body look more flattering in your clothes.

Sniff a food-scented candle.,
Indulge a little.,
Try urge surfing.",How to Stop Craving1," Chewing gum can trick your brain into feeling satisfied, especially if you have a craving for sugar. Choose sugar-free gum and pop a piece whenever you get the urge to indulge in a dessert or that afternoon cupcake.Chewing gum is also a good way to keep your mouth occupied when you might otherwise want a cigarette or an alcoholic drink. If you feel like you always need to have something in your mouth, gum may be a relatively harmless way to redirect your habit.
Avoid using peppermints or breath mints as a way to curb your cravings. They often contain more sugar than gum, and this exposure to sugar can make your cravings worse. Sugar will also harm your teeth.
Use caution if you have a history of jaw soreness or related medical issues. Gum chewing can worsen disorders that cause your jaw to pop or click.;
, Since the aftertaste of toothpaste doesn’t pair well with the flavor of food, brushing your teeth when you get a craving is a way to temporarily put a stop to your craving. The flavor in your toothpaste can also trick your body into believing a craving has been satisfied.Carry a toothbrush and toothpaste to use when big cravings hit.


Brushing your teeth too often can wear out the enamel. Don't rely on this method too many times in one day.

, It is common to feel hunger cravings when what your body really needs is water. If you tend to be a little dehydrated, start drinking water when you feel cravings coming on. The liquid will make you feel more full. As an added benefit, cold water will stimulate your metabolism as your body warms the liquid to body temperature.


Flavor the water with a squirt or two of lemon to add some flavor and make this trick even more effective. Giving it an actual taste will make you feel as though you've consumed something slightly more filling than water. Try green tea or another unsweetened beverage if you find yourself wanting some variety.

, One study found that people who inhaled a peppermint scent every two hours ate 2,700 fewer calories over the course of a week. Keep a food-scented candle such as vanilla, green apple, or banana nearby and sniff it regularly. If you are a stress eater, close your left nostril and inhale through your right to reach the portion of your brain that processes emotions. You will likely reduce both your anxiety and your appetite.Food scented lotions, lip balms and other, similar products may also be useful.
Try keeping a small bottle of cinnamon or peppermint essential oil on hand for when intense cravings hit.

, Food cravings, in particular, aren't always a bad thing. Sometimes you crave something because your body needs it. Even if it's not something you strictly need, more often than not, a little bit won't hurt. It may seem counterintuitive, but many people have fewer cravings when they indulge slightly. A small concession to your craving might prevent you from overindulgence later.


Consider combining the food you're craving with something healthier. For example, if you're craving chocolate, melt some chocolate chips and dip strawberries in the melted chocolate. Eating fresh fruit with your chocolate is a better choice than having a big slice of chocolate cake.
Complete restriction can lead to heavy cravings and subsequent binge eating.
Indulging is not a good idea if you're dealing with cravings related to nicotine or alcohol addiction. In this case, indulging even a little will intensify your cravings.

, This technique can help you get through an intense craving of any kind, whether what you crave is sugar, alcohol or nicotine. Instead of trying to push the craving from your mind, let it wash over you like a wave, and imagine yourself “surfing” it.


Notice where in your body you are experiencing the craving and what the sensations are like. Repeat back this information to yourself.
Focus on one area and describe, in detail, the sensations you are feeling. Notice any changes that occur as you continue to experience the sensations.
Repeat this process with each distinct area in which you experience the craving.
Over time, you'll learn to better recognize the way you experience cravings. Doing so will enable you to cope with them until the waves of sensation pass."

Determine whether you're consuming enough calories.,
Make yourself wait.,
Eat lean protein for breakfast.,
Eat more grapefruit.,
Consume whole foods.,
Snack on almonds.,
Add spice to your foods.,
Suppress your hunger with fat.,
Try dark chocolate.",How to Stop Craving2," Eating fewer than 1,000 calories per day or eliminating entire food groups (carbohydrates, for example) leaves your body prone to cravings. Food restriction decreases your body's production of appetite-reducing leptin by as much as 22 percent. As a result, you'll tend to consume more calories when your cravings become overwhelming.


Lift any bans you've placed upon food groups. Replace prohibitions with reasonable limits on your consumption — instead of banning dessert altogether, for example, share a piece of pie with two friends.
Don't attempt to ""eat around"" cravings by substituting low-calorie imitations. If what you really want is a milkshake, eating yogurt likely won't help — and you may actually consume more calories in your attempt to compensate., Sometimes it helps to tell yourself you're allowed to have the food, drink or cigarette you're craving in just 10 or 20 more minutes. When 10 or 20 minutes elapses, tell yourself the same thing. Keep delaying gratification until you've taken off the craving's edge. This method is good to have in your pocket for any type of craving, but especially nicotine cravings., Studies show that eating lean protein, like eggs or turkey, will help you feel full for the rest of the day, and make you less likely to give in to cravings later.It's important to eat soon after you wake up, rather than waiting until mid-morning, to get the full anti-craving effect.


Starting your day with protein and healthy fats causes your body to maintain a healthy blood sugar and continue craving those wholesome foods all day. Starting your day with heavy sugars/carbs, will do the opposite and cause carb cravings.
Try making a healthy breakfast with eggs or lean meat. Yogurt is another good option for your morning protein.
Eat a handful of nuts or a protein shake if you’re on the go and in need of a protein fix.

, Grapefruit has properties that inhibit insulin and keep you feeling full.While going on a grapefruit-only diet isn't healthy for your system, there's no reason not to incorporate grapefruit into your daily routine.


Try eating a half a grapefruit for breakfast or as a mid-morning snack.
For best results, avoid adding sugar to your grapefruit. Also, be sure to eat whole grapefruit and not just the juice, which has a lot of sugar on its own.
Grapefruit can have a negative interaction with certain medications (including some antibiotics, cancer medications, and heart drugs),so check with your doctor or pharmacist before you increase your grapefruit intake.

, The fiber in whole fruits and vegetables keeps you feeling full longer than foods without fiber, and helps stave off cravings. Even alcohol cravings may be related to having low blood sugar. Have a serving of fruits or vegetables at every meal, and eat whole grains instead of refined white flour.


Be sure to eat whole fruits; don’t just drink the juice. The juice alone has too much sugar.
Go for blueberries, strawberries, apples and pears, all of which are low on the glycemic index. These delicious fruits are good stand-ins for dessert and can help take the edge off a sugar craving. , Studies show that eating a handful of almonds helps to keep hunger at bay.Keep a bag on hand so you can turn to it during those times when you think you're in danger of eating a whole pie.


Choose raw or roasted almonds without salt for the healthiest version of this snack.
Roasting almonds with a dash of honey creates a healthy snack that also helps with sugar cravings.

, Incorporating a variety of flavors, especially hot spices, will satisfy your palette and keep you feeling full longer than bland food. Try adding hot sauce to spice things up. If you're not into heat, just start using more spices in general. Oregano, basil, mint and sage all add depth to your food, making you less likely to need to eat as much to feel full.

, It might sound counterintuitive, but it's important to eat fat to stave off cravings. If you try to eliminate fat from your diet, your cravings will heighten and become almost unbearable. The key is to eat foods containing omega-3 fatty acids such as fish, avocados and nuts. The oleic acid found in nuts, olive oil, and avocados also suppresses hunger.Steer clear of trans fats found in fried fast food and snack food.

, It has properties that keep you from eating too much, so you can satisfy your craving without going overboard.Look for chocolate bars that contain at least 70 percent cocoa, though; any less than that, and the sugar content will be too high to call this option ""healthy.""

Find ways to help others.,
Exercise regularly.,
Stimulate your happiness with music.,
Develop a mantra.,
Seek connections.,
Distract yourself.",How to Stop Craving3," Focusing upon others' needs is a wonderful way to reduce your fixation upon your own cravings. Helping others produces the feel-good chemical dopamine in your brain. Your happiness will divert your brain from cravings.


When a craving hits, ask yourself ""What can I do to help someone right now?""Perhaps you might call an elderly relative or write a letter. Maybe you can perform an act of kindness for your partner or a friend.
Build opportunities to help others into your regular routine. Consider volunteering for an organization with a mission you find appealing, or find ways to help out at work or at school.

, Exercising not only burns calories, but also suppresses your appetite for up to two hours following a high-intensity workout session. Aerobic exercise suppresses the appetite hormone ghrelin. Maximize the impact of your workout by alternating high-impact intervals with brief periods of rest., Women, in particular, tend to experience strong emotional reactions to music. Create an upbeat playlist that you can listen to when cravings strike. The music will distract you and provide an emotional release, redirecting your brain., Create a message to repeat to yourself when cravings hit. Mental conditioning can take time to become effective, but as you continue to repeat your message it will sink into your consciousness and help redirect your energy from cravings.


Target the effects of succumbing to your craving — ""A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips"" would be one example.Consider positive messages you can substitute for the negative feelings associated with your cravings. Remind yourself of your best attributes or qualities. For example, you might train yourself to remember, ""I am a compassionate person. I keep my body healthy so I can serve others well.""
Visualize yourself as healthy. When you begin to experience a craving, consciously tell yourself, ""Stop!"" Then replace the image of your craving with a healthy image. Over time, this image will sink in and override the craving., Humans need community in order to thrive. Networks of friendship and shared interests will help you manage stress and fulfill your needs in positive ways.Consider your interests. Do you enjoy art? Music? Reading? Playing a sport? Research opportunities for becoming involved in activities you enjoy.
Contact a friend when you feel the urge to succumb to your cravings. You'll distract yourself and replace a negative impulse with a positive connection.

, Do you tend to turn to food, alcohol or other substances when you're bored? Staying busy is one of the best ways to curb cravings. If you’re on the go, you won’t have time to worry about what you’re craving. Fill your schedule with activities that require you to be up and about.


If you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, mix things up by going outside for quick walks throughout the day. Doing so will prevent you from becoming bored and giving in to cravings.
Meet with people in person instead of talking on the phone or texting, since it's easy to eat and use the phone at the same time.
Examine the foundations of your craving and target your distractions accordingly. After all, when you crave you are hoping the object of your craving will make you feel better. If you're craving chocolate and recognize that you're actually lonely, taking a solo walk likely won't help — but visiting with a friend probably will."

Get more rest.,
Bust your stress.,
Steer clear of triggers.,
Get support.",How to Stop Craving4," When you get a full night’s sleep, you’re less likely to overeat the next day. Aim to get seven or eight hours of sleep each night. You'll be more in control of your dietary choices the next day, and less likely to indulge in the foods you crave., Are you a stress eater? Many people are, and it's one of the main culprits when it comes to giving in to a craving. If your food cravings are tangled up with your emotions, you might be using eating as a way to relieve stress. You’re training your body to “need” food to get through tough times. Instead of reaching for a tub of ice cream when you’re feeling sad, find healthier forms of stress relief.


Perform a brief bout of exercise, like a quick jog or even a set of jumping jacks and push-ups. Think about how much better you’ll feel after exercising than you would after overeating. Meditate when you're stressed. Focus on the source of the problem, rather than trying to fix it by giving in to your craving.

, If there's a certain place that reminds you of the item you're craving, avoid it for awhile. You may not experience cravings as often if you stay in environments that don't carry past baggage. Avoid the places and situations that make you want to cave in to your cravings.


If you have a food craving, this might mean spending less time in the kitchen, removing any tempting foods from your house, avoiding the junk food aisles at the grocery store, and not driving past your favorite ice cream place on the way home from work every day.
To quell cigarette cravings, avoid going outside to the location where you used to take your smoking breaks.
If you have alcohol cravings, stay away from the bars and restaurants where you like to indulge in a few drinks., If your cravings are so extreme that you feel they are affecting your mental and physical well-being, there are organizations that can help. Seeking outside help can be especially useful if you're trying to quit eating, smoking or drinking a particular substance for good.


If you're worried you might have an addiction it's important to get help. If you've tried a variety of methods for coping with your cravings and they have failed to have any effect, you may be dealing with an addiction and not just a garden-variety sense of craving. Seek counseling, or find a local 12-step group that focuses upon the object of your addiction.

Have the right mindset.,
Choose a restaurant most suited to your diet.,
Make a reservation.,
Become familiar with menu terminology.,
Read the menu and nutritional information before arriving at the restaurant.,
Eat a small, healthy snack before you go out.,
Order first.,
Share your food.,
Say no to extras and sauces.,
Drink water.,
Practice mindful eating.,
Be social.,
Consider how this particular meal fits into your diet at large.",How to Stick to Your Diet While Eating Out," Whether you are trying to lose a few pounds, drastically change your lifestyle, or conform to new ways of eating, much of the difficulty of maintaining a diet is linked to sustainability., This might seem obvious, but the more decisions you can make before arriving to the restaurant, the easier navigating the menu and ordering the best meal will be.


Try a steakhouse or sushi restaurant for high-quality protein with the option for vegetables.
Avoid restaurants whose main method of cooking involves frying or heavy oils.
Consider restaurants that offer tapas or small plates as opposed to an all-you-can-eat buffet.

, Making a reservation will not only help limit last minute and potentially unhealthy/diet-breaking decisions, but will also reduce the amount of time spent waiting for a table.


Studies have shown that both the sight and smell of food spark the metabolic process, which lowers blood sugar and will make you even more hungry. One quick call can help make the difference., Many menus only list partial ingredients, often leaving out entire components or methods of preparation. Learning how ingredients are prepared will help guide you to make the most informed and healthy decision possible, and will also point you to questions that you can ask the waitstaff.Try and avoid foods that are “deep fried,” “crunchy,” or “crispy.”
Opt for steamed, grilled, or baked when possible.
Enlist the help of the wait staff to see how your meal will be prepared and if exceptions can be made. Many restaurants are familiar with health conscious patrons who may have dietary restrictions.

, Reading the menu and nutritional information before you arrive will help deter snap decisions and impulse orders once you’re seated. Knowing what the restaurant has to offer before arriving will also provide the necessary information to decide whether the restaurant will be a good fit.Try checking the restaurant’s website and see if they have nutritional information available for their food. Most large chain restaurants offer nutritional information for the items on their menu.
You can also use an app like MyFitnessPal to look up the nutritional information for items on the menu before you go.
Many restaurants have a different system of symbols to represent the items on their menu. Look for a key near the bottom of the menu or ask a waiter if you are not sure what the symbols mean.

, Curbing your appetite with a healthy snack will help to make items you are trying to avoid seem less tempting when it’s time to order. Try having an apple with ½ cup of low fat cottage cheese, some carrot sticks with two tablespoons of hummus, or a cup of plain nonfat Greek yogurt with a handful of blueberries mixed in.

, Now that you’ve made it to the restaurant, it’s time to order that delicious and diet-conforming meal. If you haven’t scouted the menu before arriving, be sure to try and order first.


Ordering first can help skirt social stigma and pressure as well as making sure you’re eating exactly how you’d like to.For example, you might feel pressured to order pizza if everyone at the table orders pizza before you. To prevent this, try to order your healthy meal first.

, Not only are ingredients important to keep in mind, but so is portion size. Many restaurants tend to serve portions that are too large for an individual and can often lead to excess caloric consumption.


Ask a friend to split an appetizer or entree.
Check with your server to see if it’s possible to order a half portion or if the portion is large enough to share (the answer is usually yes!).

, The quicker temptation is put out of the way, the better. Start to develop a few ready-made answers and automatic policies for eating out at restaurants.Ask for salad dressing, sauces, and gravies on the side. Many of these sauces contain generous amounts of fats, sodium, and sugars, and are difficult to remove once served. Having them on the side will allow you to moderate how much you use.
Make a habit of abstaining from all complimentary and “on-the-house” offerings like bread, crackers, and chips.You can politely ask the wait staff not to bring you any items before your meal.
Avoid ""bottomless"" meal options as well. If the restaurant offers any dishes that are ""bottomless,"" ""endless,"" or ""all-you-can-eat"" then avoid these options. You will likely end up eating way more than you had intended by ordering such a dish.
Say no to dessert. Skipping dessert will help you save on unwanted calories. If others with you are ordering dessert, try a cup of coffee instead., Another no-brainer, but one that is often over-looked. Drinking water throughout your meal will not only give you the many benefits of staying well hydrated, but also help in cutting excess and unwanted calories, sugars, and carbohydrates.Drinking soda or an alcoholic beverage may make you hungrier and increase your chances of coming off your diet.
If the temptation for a more flavorful drink strikes, tea is a great option. You can order hot black or green tea without adding sugar, milk, or cream. Or, if you want something cold, then order a glass of unsweetened iced tea with lemon.

, Chewing slowly and at intermediate intervals allows your food to digest and register in your stomach as ""full"" before you continue to eat. Chew about 20 times per bite, or until the food is fully dissolved.


If you use an app to track your calories or write them in a journal, then do this right after your meal as well. This will help to ensure that you do not forget what you ate and how much you ate.

, You’re out at a restaurant with friends, family, or colleagues! Take a break from eating and engage in conversation. Take a moment to listen – you’re not just there to eat!

, Many diets will often emphasize how “the little choices” often amount to significant consequences. However, many studies find that not to be the case.It’s better to have a few bites of chocolate cake if it means you won’t eat an entire slice.
Remember, it's not just about one meal, it's about your overall lifestyle and diet as a whole.

Lay down on your back, knees slightly bent up. Lift your head and torso up to your knees, trying to touch your knees with your hands. Lay back down before repeating the movement.
Plank. Lay down, facing the floor, resting on your toes and elbows. Hold this position, which looks a lot like the push up position, keeping your back straight, shoulders and elbows in-line. Keep your stomach and abs engaged during this motion. Hold as long as you can.
Side planks. Lay on your side, hips off the floor, while resting your weight on your elbow. Keep your body as straight as you can. Hold this pose as long as you can and then switch to the other side.

, Focus on cardio workouts after weightlifting workouts so that you expend more energy and burn more body fat. In addition, you also want to save the easier part of your workout (cardio) for the end. Cardio exercises can improve the function and health of your heart. Many of these are easy to do and can be done without any equipment.

There may be certain recommendations for nutrition or low-impact exercise that you need to take into account.;
, Start by expecting to lose no more than one pound a week per average. Use a weight loss calculator to help calculate a realistic timeline for weight loss.


Try sites like FitWatch who provide a target date calculator.
If you are obese, try contacting a weight loss center to try setting long-term weight loss goals that are reasonable and healthy., Any weight loss plan should be a combination of diet, exercise and lifestyle changes. For example, don’t start a diet plan that is too drastic if you already know you are unlikely to stick to it.

, Get a friend who also wants to lose weight to help motivate you. Consider joining a weight loss group, like weight watchers, or joining a fitness class that meets regularly to reap the benefits of teamwork., Try an activity tracker, a gym membership or a subscription based meal plan. When you have a financial stake in it, you’ll be more motivated to continue the program.

, This could mean removing the unhealthy snacks in your pantry, reducing the number of days you go out for cocktails or refusing to schedule meetings during regular exercise times. When you’re tired or stressed, you are much less likely to stick to your plan, so make it easier on yourself.

, Try to avoid the aisles and stick to the perimeter, where the healthier options are located.

, Get started by increasing your activity levels. For most adults, you should aim to reach 10,000 steps per day at a minimum.


You may be surprised at how quickly adding 10-minute walks throughout the day can add miles to your pedometer.

, While this may seem like a lot, think of it as an extremely small portion of your 24-hour day. This is the recommended amount of low to moderate exercise recommended by experts to lose weight and keep it off.

, Start with a walk after each meal., Take a class or schedule a gym session before you get too busy. If you like to work out at home, purchase a used treadmill and walk/run as you watch TV.

, For the first month, write down everything that you eat. Recording your diet will make you mindful of what you eat and also make you feel accountable if you sneak in unhealthy options., If you eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables, you can eat more while gaining less. Processed foods should be reduced to portion sizes of 100 to 200 calories, which is a surprisingly small amount of food that won’t keep you full.

, Milky coffee drinks, soft drinks and alcohol give you the most calories for the fewest nutrients. Replace those drinks with water and you will make a significant dent in your calorie consumption.

, Never skip meals, but reduce the amount you eat by 25 to 50 percent. You can begin to see weight loss benefits in just two weeks.The same is true of low-carb diets. Using an alternate-day plan may also be easier to keep up in the long-term.

Avoid processed carbs.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Eat breakfast.,
Keep a food diary.,
Limit juice.,
Eat hot peppers.,
Choose smaller portions several times a day.,
Don't eat late in the evenings.,
Watch alcohol consumption.",How to Speed up Weight Loss1," The body doesn't really need these. There are good and ""bad"" carbs. Bad carbs cause spikes in blood sugar. The key is choosing carbs that are high in fiber so the body absorbs them more slowly. Avoid carbs that are low in fiber.


Complex carbs are far better for you than refined or processed carbs. Foods with complex carbs include green vegetables, whole grains, quinoa, oatmeal, and popcorn.Avoid white foods. That's one of the best ways to figure out which carbs are in the ""bad"" category. Rice, potatoes, and white bread are processed, refined carbs that are bad for you. Eliminate them, and you will see weight loss fast.
Eat a lot of green vegetables. Many diets allow you to eat as many of these as you want. They're healthy for you, they fill you up, and they are low in calories. Broccoli, kale, and green beans are great choices. Anything green, fresh, and a vegetable is likely a ""good"" carb.;
, Water is good for you, period. It will rev up your metabolism, so drink it constantly throughout the day. This is one of the top secrets embraced by people who are able to lose weight fast. Think of metabolism as being like a furnace. You need to keep the furnace burning to lose weight.Eight glasses of water a day will spark faster weight loss. People who drink sugary sodas find it hard to lose weight. Water is a much better choice.
If you are sick of water, you can drink green tea instead. Like water, it will reduce your appetite, and it is sugar-free and low in calories.

, It's true. Many studies have found that people who eat breakfast are more likely to keep weight off. So skipping an early meal can actually backfire later.


You'll likely want to eat less later in the day if you eat breakfast.
Eat the right breakfast, though. Steel-cut oats, fresh fruit, or even eggs can keep you full. The worst choice: Sugary breakfast cereals in boxes, which are basically empty calories., This one is very important. People who keep track of what they eat lose more. You may discover that you eat more than you thought you did. Writing down what you actually eat every day can help you track calories and monitor what you're really putting into your body., Some foods that you might think are healthy, aren't. Use labels. Even better, avoid things in cans and packages, and go for fresh. And don't build your diet around juice. A lot of people mistakenly think fruit juice will help you lose weight. It can be loaded with sugar that will sabotage your weight loss.


If you must have juice, it's better to choose a homemade, green juice built largely from vegetables (remember, though, that even carrots and sweet corn can be loaded with natural sugar. Green vegetables are better.)
Fresh fruit has fiber and other nutrients that juice does not. If you are craving fruit, try buying some fresh fruit instead.

, Jalapeno and cayenne peppers may slightly boost your body's metabolism. They can be added to drinks or solid foods to give your weight loss a needed boost.


Studies have found that chili peppers increase what is called ""brown fat."" The more brown fat you have, the more weight you are likely to lose. Capsaicin is a compound found in hot peppers that increases adrenaline., This keeps your metabolism burning. It's a myth that you will lose weight and keep it off by starving yourself or confining your meals to one per day. It's better to eat less, more often.


Experts suggest eating small meals or snacks every three to four hours to keep your weight loss moving., You're likely using less energy at night, so eating then is a bad idea. If you eat late at night - and especially if you eat the wrong things at that time - expect to put on the pounds fast and sabotage any attempts at weight loss., It's not just calories. The problem with alcohol is it depresses your central nervous system, which means you will lose less weight. You also might be more likely to binge on your favorite comfort foods when under the influence.Alcohol consists of ""empty calories."" That means it has no nutritional value.
The other problem with drinking a lot of alcohol is that the body will burn it off first. So you're wasting energy that otherwise might have burned off fat. "

Don't OVEREAT, you will be OVER weight.,
LOVE your water - water is going to be a hot commodity in the future.,
LOVE seeing yourself - fall in love yourself.",How to Slim Down," We are truly what we eat. We eat heavily of heavy food, then we will become heavy. Nothing can compensate for the intake of excessive greasy and heavy food. As one's body become healthy and fit, the cravings for junk food disappear too. Healthy body comes from and is maintained by healthy mind.;
, I have taken diet pills and followed various types of diet plans and nothing works more effectively or fast than exercising. I am not going to say do 15 crunches a day and walk a mile a day to start...because I know that we want to see the results. Start small but start well to prepare yourself to overcome yourself; don't put yourself to get disappointed with workouts that do not match what you desire. For an example, if you want to burn fat, start off with cardio workouts with yoga (passive, stretching your muscle type of yoga) - running (walking fast at first for 3 minutes) continuously for 35 to 40 minutes a day to start and dedicating to 20 minutes of stretching afterwards. You will find that running outside can be a much more enjoyable experience but running on a treadmill can be good if you have weak knees or ankles. Lifting light weights (for women - it should be 3 pounds max) twice to three times a week and no more. Work your oblique muscles to slim down the waist and whenever you walk/sit/stand or do whatever, always consciously make an effort to suck in and hold your stomach in. Do 2 cardio workouts - one in the morning and one in the afternoon AND stretch before and afterwards for 10 minutes each.

, It's a simple process, if you take in more than you can take out, you will burst. But the majority of what we're made up of is fluid and 'elastic' layers.., therefore, we'll not burst (sometimes we do..) but we get big and we begin to manifest and nurture all types of dysfunctions of organs - diseases. How do we know how much is too much for one person? When one sees or thinks of food (whether it's sitting inside the fridge or in your mouth/stomach) as a trigger to continue on a conversation or to keep up the mood; or catching yourself thinking of food when someone or something pops into your head; and when you 'initially' feel like you are 'stuffed.'

, Love the water and admire it and drink it with love. Buy a beautiful water bottle that you will love and something that can be easily carried around that will be with you. Drink and drink throughout the day but do not think 'I must drink 1L or 1.5L at least.' Enjoy drinking the water when you drink it and don't even think about certain level of consumption you have to reach per day.

, Capture yourself when in a great dress and heels on camera and look at the image and admire it sincerely. LOVE IT! Put on a nice dress or even cute sweatshirt when eating a salad dish by yourself at home. Do not put up diet or weight loss goals and pressure yourself mentally and subconsciously disappointing yourself from not seeing the result right away. Just pick a good role model (anyone around you in your immediate network or a celebrity whose body seems healthy and glamorous/beautiful to you) and always look at the image of that person and envision yourself in that image. In a simple term, love the qualities and image of a person sincerely to be comfortable and accustomed to accept that part into your life. To achieve anything in life, we aim at preparing ourselves to achieve the goal(s); not to view right now - the present moment as black-and-white win or lose.

Burn calories and track them.,
Know how many calories different exercises burn.,
Go for cardio.,
Exercise 60 minutes a day.,
Use kettlebells.,
Use ropes.,
Try circuit training.",How to Speed up Weight Loss2," This matters. The math is really simple here, actually. You have to burn more calories than you take in. It's a simple equation. Sometimes people make weight loss too difficult.


It takes a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose a pound. So, if you burn 500 extra calories a day, you're on track to lose 1 pound per week. That might not sound like a lot, but over a year, it is.
Your basal metabolism will burn some calories (that means what you burn just from living and moving). You can calculate your basal metabolism using online calculators. , You can find calorie calculators online that will provide a detailed estimate. Don't lose weight by guessing. Indoor rowing, burpees, and jumping rope are all big calorie burners. , Experts say that cardio exercises burn more calories than strength training does. Rowing, running, walking, or riding a bicycle are all cardio activities. Switch up the intensity of the workout.
Cardio is a great weight loss technique because it requires the body to use fat as its first fuel burning source. , You should aim to do 60 minutes of exercise a day about five or six days out of the week. However, don't think you can exercise without monitoring your diet and lose weight fast. Both play a key role.Take enough steps. Buy a Fitbit to track your steps, and try to get in 10,000 steps a day.Take the stairs when you could take the elevator. Walk to work, instead of driving. Spend some time in the garden. Little things will add up. Strive for consistency. It's key. You can't exercise once in a blue moon and think that will matter. Build exercise into your daily life.
Drink coffee before you exercise. A cup of coffee before your workout will give you a boost of energy that will make you work harder, and burn more. But skip the sweeteners and cream. , Kettlebells are bowling-ball size weights that are made out of cast iron. They're used for strength training. They're great for your core, and they provide a full body workout. Swinging a kettlebell can burn 400 calories in 20 minutes.
Kettlebells range from 2 to 100 pounds. Start with one that works for you. The overarm swing is one good way to use a kettlebell. , Battling ropes can burn a lot of calories, and it's a common fitness technique found at gyms. You can burn as many as 10.3 calories per minute with rope battles. You hold a thick rope in each hand and perform different motions with it. , Switch up the exercises in quick intervals. You'll lose weight faster that way than standing in the same place on a treadmill.


Circuit training sessions often contain exercises like mountain climbers, squats, bicycle crunches, and lunges. Because you are constantly switching exercises, circuit training is less boring for many people.
You will burn 30 percent more calories with a circuit training workout than other types of workouts. "

Activate all of your senses.,
Look at something blue.,
Brush your teeth.,
Weigh yourself daily.,
Watch less television.,
Chew sugar-free gum.,
Take a photo.",How to Speed up Weight Loss3," If you're tired all the time, and you can't sleep, this can actually impede your weight loss. Many studies have found a link between sleep deprivation and weight gain. Aim for at least seven hours of sleep every night.


Sleeping less than four hours a night reduces metabolism. Cherries contain a chemical that may be able to help you sleep longer., Stress increases cortisol, which is a hormone that can lead to weight gain. Sometimes, mood affects more things than we realize. Weight can be one of them.


Cortisol is produced when you don't exercise, too. , It's linked to weight loss in some studies, but that doesn't mean you can guzzle a lot of it.If you do so, the calories will get you.

Women should only drink about 5 oz or less of wine a day while men should drink less than 10 oz a day., The sense of smell. The sense of sight. Activating these can help you feel less hungry. This might sound silly, but it may help.

Eat on blue plates or paint your kitchen walls blue., If you brush your teeth after a meal, you'll eat less. That's because you'll be less inclined to put more food or drink in your mouth after you have already cleaned your teeth., This will allow you to spot small increases in weight and take corrective action before you gain much more weight. If you never weigh yourself, you might be way off when guessing your weight., Some studies have found that people who watch less television, weigh less. That's because they do not sit as much, and they are more active. Sedentary people don't burn as many calories.Studies have found that just one hour of television watching each day can be linked to weight gain. , If you are still hungry after a meal, try chewing sugar-free gum. Doing this will make you feel less hungry. It's a quick psychological attempt to trick the brain into helping you not want to eat.Sugar-free gum has about 5 calories per stick, and it can stop cravings. Don't use gum as a substitute for a good diet, though. If you're shoveling unhealthy things in your mouth on a daily basis, chewing gum the rest of the day won't matter.

, Taking pictures of yourself will let you track your progress. This can help motivate you by showing you how far you have come."

Understand your nature.,
Determine your goal.,
Accept that this process will take time.,
Be consistent with your efforts.",How to Stimulate Weight Loss," Overeating is caused by the structure of human nerve system. It takes the signal about 5-10 minutes to travel from your stomach to your brain with information that hunger is satisfied. This is a result of prehistoric times, when it was crucial. Eating as much as possible helped our ancestors to survive, because their food supplies were scarce. But nowadays, this atavistic instinct is rather harmful and should be inhibited. Otherwise, habit of overeating develops and people start gaining weight.;
, Losing a few kilograms to fit in your gorgeous dress again is possible, but these kilograms will be gained back in no time in case you do not drop your habit of overeating. Therefore, your goal is not to achieve short-term results, but to change your lifestyle and habits for better.

, Only bad things happen quickly, most of the positive changes need some time to happen. You cannot lose weight in two weeks. However, it is possible to change your lifestyle step by step, so in two months you will feel much better and in two years you will be a much slimmer person and happier with your weight. Most important, your weight and well-being will remain this way until you stop doing your exercises, so you can remain slim and fit for the rest of your life.

, You cannot go about doing exercises for a week and then skip gym the week. Or eat less for a week and then order two Big Mac Meals to eat alone. If you want to be healthy, be persistent and do not miss your training for long or the results will be lost. While missing one training is not too bad, missing six in a row means all you efforts will have to be rekindled. And starting back a second time might be harder, so it is best to be dead set against letting any backsliding occur.

The bulk of your calories should come from produce and healthy carbohydrates. Go for lean meats, like poultry and fish, over heavier, fattier meats like beef and pork.

, Sugar is a major contributor to a high BMI. The average person consumes far more sugar than is recommended.

Any increase in movement is a great start and far better than remaining sedentary. If a gym is intimidating, you can use workout videos in the privacy of your own home.
If you want more significant, quicker weight loss aim for 300 total minutes a week.

Be aware of any potential side effects of any meds you're taking.While you're on weight-loss medication, you will be closely monitored by medical professionals. You will have to have regular blood work and doctor's appointments. Weight-loss medication does not work for everyone and may not work for you and one major risk is that when you cease taking the medication you may regain some of the weight.In extreme cases, weight loss surgery may be an option. Surgeries decrease the amount of food you're able to eat. There are a variety of options when it comes to weight loss surgery and it is usually only recommended to people with health issues related to their weight with a BMI over 35. Talk to your doctor about whether weight loss surgery is right for you., Many people have issues with eating due to emotional or behavioral issues. Trained mental health professionals can help address such issues and teach you to monitor your diet and cope with food cravings.When it comes to weight loss, 12 to 24 session intensive therapy programs are usually most effective. Ask your regular physician for a referral to a mental health professional with experience in weight loss and binge eating related disorders.If you're uncomfortable with intensive therapy, regular therapy that addressing overarching mental health issues can also help., Support groups allow you to connect with others who are struggling with similar weight-related issues.

Consider doing fast exercises for your legs, like jumping moves, leg lifts, high knee jogs and heel kick backs. Quick movements work different muscle fibers than slow movements.
Slow power and strength moves — like weighted squats, deadlifts and lunges — will work the rest of the muscle fibers in the hips.
Strength training exercises do not burn as many calories compared to cardio, but will help build and tone muscle mass.In addition, the more muscle mass you build over time, the more calories your body burns at rest.
Incorporate about two to three days of strength training each week. If you're focusing specifically on your hips and thighs, make sure you have a rest day between days you target those muscles., The bridge exercise pose is a common activity that helps tone your lower back, stomach, buttocks and most importantly, your hips.Lie on your back, bend your knees and keep you feet hip-width apart. Focus on keeping a neutral spine. Contract your stomach muscles.
Lift your hips slowly until you form a plank from shoulders to knees. Hold the position for three seconds and slowly lower down to the floor. Repeat 10 to 20 times.
To increase the intensity of this exercise, hold the elevated position and lower your hips down one inch (2.5cm) and then move your hips back up. Do this for one minute. Then, lower your hips down.

, This exercise helps tone your lower body, but especially targets your hips and thighs.








Stand with legs hip-width apart. Contract your ab muscles and place the weight in your heels.
Sit back as if you are sitting into a low chair. Keep your knees behind your toes. Do the posture sideways next to a mirror to check your form.
Pause for three seconds at the lowest point you can squat. Push through your heels and rise to standing. Repeat 10 to 20 times.

, The curtsy lunge is a modified one-legged squat. It requires extra work from your hips to perform making this a great exercise to tone your hips and thighs.









Stand with feet hip width apart. Reach your right foot back behind your left foot as though you are going to curtsy in front of royalty.
Bend both of your knees and squat. Try to bring your right leg as low to the ground as you can.
Contract your muscles throughout and keep your back straight. You should not pitch forward. Repeat 10 to 20 curtsies on each side.

, This exercise helps target the outside of your hips specifically. It's great for toning and strengthening the outside of your thighs.









Find a resistance band that is a small circle. Step into it and pull it up above your knees. It should have some resistance when you step to the side.
Sidestep as far out to the right as you can. Bring your left leg to meet the right very slowly. Sidestep back the other direction, allowing your left leg to lead.
Repeat between 10-20 exercises in each direction.

, In order to make you hips and thighs smaller, you'll need to reduce your overall body fat. You cannot spot treat this area, so following a calorie restricted meal plan will help reduce the fat in your hips, thighs and overall body.


You typically want to aim for slower, more safe weight loss. This generally equates to about 1-2 pounds weekly.Cut out about 500-750 calories from your current eating plan.This will generally result in safe, gradual weight loss.
Use a food journal or online app to get an idea of how many calories you currently eat each day. This will help you determine a calorie limit that will result in weight loss.

, There are a variety of dieting styles on the market. Studies however, show that lower carb diets result in the quickest amount of weight loss and fat reduction.If you're following a lower carb diet, most of your meals should be protein, vegetables and some fruit. This combination of foods will also provide you with enough nutrients to maintain a nutritious diet.
Include a source of lean protein at each meal. Aim for a 3-4 oz serving at most meals and snacks (about the size of a deck of cards).This will help you reach your daily recommended amount.
Also include about one to two servings of fruit daily (1/2 cup chopped or one small piece)and four to five servings of vegetables each day (1 cup chopped or 2 cups loose leafy greens).Examples of lower carb meals featuring mostly protein and produce include: 1 cup cottage cheese and sliced fruit, 1/4 cup of hummus with sliced raw veggies, or a grilled chicken salad.

, If you're following a lower carb diet to help reduce body fat and trim down your hips and thighs you'll want to monitor the total amount of carbohydrates you consume each day.


Carbs are found in a wide variety foods including: fruits, dairy products, starchy vegetables, legumes and grains as well as in sugar and sweetened drinks like soda or energy drinks.
Foods like dairy products or fruit offer a lot of other beneficial nutrients outside of carbohydrates (like fiber and protein). Include minimal servings of these. It's not recommended to completely avoid these foods.Limit the grain food group the most. Many of the nutrients found in this group can be consumed from other foods. Limit items like: bread, rice, pasta, bagels, and crackers.

, Maintaining adequate hydration is essential for any balanced diet, but especially so if you're working out more often.Most health professionals recommend consuming at least eight to 13 glasses of fluids each day.You may need more fluids depending on how active you are. It's also recommend to drink enough fluids to replace what you've lost in sweat during your exercise.
Choose caffeine- and sugar-free fluids like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.

Avoid processed foods.Processed foods are those which are packed with salt, sugar, and fat, and contain few or no nutrients and vitamins.,
Choose foods which accelerate the metabolism.,
Add some spice to your meals.,
Avoid weight-loss diets.,
Get enough protein.Lean proteins like chicken breast, tofu, nuts, and beans can increase your metabolism.Protein is harder to digest than fat, salt, and sugar, and thus requires that the body work harder.",How to Naturally Increase Metabolism1," These foods taste great, but they decrease your metabolism.Plus, they will leave you hungry and wanting more, leading to even greater weight gain. Avoid sweet baked goods, soda, chips, candy, fast food, and other processed foods.


Eating an occasional treat is okay. Just make sure it’s healthy, natural, and organic. Learn to bake your own cookies, muffins and other treats at home.;
, Just as junk foods and processed foods will hamper your metabolic rate, healthy foods will accelerate it. Fruits and veggies top the list of foods which boost your metabolism naturally.Almost any fruit or veggie will do.


Incorporate more leafy greens like spinach, lettuce, and kale. Tasty fruits like apples, strawberries, and pineapple are great too.
If you don’t like eating salads and fruit, try sauteing or baking your asparagus or eggplant.
If you’re constantly on the go, think about investing in a good blender and get your fruits and veggies in the form of smoothies.

, Spicy foods increase the metabolism by around 8% beyond the BMR.

Plus, you are likely to feel full longer than if you ate the same dish without spice. Sprinkle some cayenne pepper on your potatoes, or squirt some sriracha on your sandwiches. Crushed red pepper is great for adding a bit of heat to pizza and pasta.

Chili is a classic spicy dish which warms the bones on chilly nights.
Try hot sauce with your collard greens, broccoli, or other veggies.
Add spicy sauces and additives in moderation. An excess can lead to ulcers and heartburn.

,

Weight-loss diets are those which involve taking in fewer calories than you consume through daily energy expenditures. When the body is denied the calories it needs, it goes into “starvation mode,” an evolutionary state in which calories are carefully conserved. Try to eat about 2,000 calories each day.

Don’t skip meals. Eat at least three times each day.
Eat a small snack between meals. Some whole grain toast, an apple, or a slice of watermelon all make great snacks.

, This increase in energy expenditure will boost the metabolism.


If you enjoy chicken or turkey, bake or grill them. Fried chicken and other meats will only add empty calories to your diet.
Avoid processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, salami, sliced beef, and fast food burgers. These are linked to cancer and heart disease.Do not eat processed cheese or dairy. This includes cheeses that have been mixed with lots of salt or emulsifiers. Nacho cheese and other liquified cheeses should be avoided.

Eat more frequently.,
Eat slowly.,
Drink tea or black coffee between meals.",How to Shrink Your Stomach1," The real trick to losing weight is to rein in your hunger. The easiest way to do that is to eat more often. Eat smaller meals more frequently and you will find that you eat less food overall. It also makes it easier to eat healthier foods.;
, Eat slowly when you do eat your meals and snacks. This will give your body time to process the food and let you know when you’re full more accurately. Try taking half an hour to eat, rather than fifteen minutes, for example.

, We often eat not because we are hungry but because we are bored or feel like we should be eating. Develop a habit of analyzing your hunger. If you aren’t hungry, or it isn’t a proper mealtime, try drinking tea or coffee (no milk or sugar). This will give your stomach something to work with but contains few calories.

Drink plenty of water.Water plays an important role in every cellular process in the body.,
Drink green tea.Green tea is a rich source of antioxidants known as catechins, and plays a vital role in giving your metabolism a boost.,
Drink coffee.",How to Naturally Increase Metabolism2," Since water is crucial in helping your body turn fat into energy, dehydration can slow your metabolism.


The amount of water you should drink each day depends on your body. Aim to drink at least half your body weight in fluid ounces. For instance, if you weigh 120 pounds, you should be drinking 60 fluid ounces of water each day.
If you find yourself bored with water, try flavored water. These are available in many stores, though you could flavor it yourself by dropping some sliced lemons or cucumber into a pitcher and letting it sit for a few hours.
Carry a water bottle with you wherever you go.

, Unsweetened, brewed green tea increases the rate at which calories are burned. Green tea also reduces cholesterol, combats heart disease, and prevents cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Swap out green tea for sugary sodas and fruit drinks.

, Caffeine can boost your metabolism between 5 to 8%. While it doesn’t play as important a role as water or green tea in the effort to raise your BMR, it’s worth incorporating a cup of joe into your morning or lunch routine. Avoid getting buzzed on caffeine by limiting yourself to just two or three cups each day.

Lift weights.,
Intensify your workouts.Intense bouts of exercise can drive your body to burn calories long after your workout is over.,
Lead an active lifestyle.,
Get enough sleep.,
Reduce your stress levels.If you feel you’re tense and have difficulty relaxing, take steps to manage your stress in a healthy way.,
Replace negative thoughts with healthy ones.,
Stay cool.Cold weather tends to increase the metabolism.",How to Naturally Increase Metabolism3," While both cardio and strength training are important to any exercise program, strength training is far better for boosting the metabolism.Try curls, barbell squats, and bench presses to build strength and increase your metabolic rate


To figure out how much you should be lifting, start at a low mass and work your way up. You should be able to do 14 to 22 reps of a given exercise before feeling a significant strain.
For instance, if you do 20 curls at a certain weight and are “feeling the burn,” you’re at your ideal weight. If you feel the 20 curls were easy, add five pounds and try another set of reps.
Do not lift too much. If you feel a significant strain, or feel your arms quiver while lifting, take a break and try some cardio for a bit. You could also think about reducing the amount of weight you’re lifting, or aim for a lower number of reps. Lifting too much can lead to injury.

, High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is one great way to reap the rewards of the so-called “afterburn effect.” As its name suggests, HIIT involves intense but brief periods of exercise, followed by periods of inaction or low-intensity movement. HIIT workouts encompass many forms of exercise, including weight training, running, or body weight workouts.


Start easy when engaging in HIIT. For instance, try to sprint at your top speed for twenty seconds. As you become stronger and increase your sprinting endurance, try to sprint for thirty seconds, then forty, and so on.
Keep careful track of your training intervals.Use a timer when engaging in HIIT. For instance, if you want to do twenty curls in thirty seconds, set the timer to thirty seconds, then begin your curls.
Do not sacrifice your form for the sake of speed. Always maintain proper form, especially when lifting weights.
Always warm up for about ten minutes before beginning your workout routine.
Keep your intervals short. It is impossible and even dangerous to train at your maximum intensity for long periods. Do not let your high-intensity intervals surpass sixty seconds.

,

Overall fitness and physical exertion can improve your BMR. Simple activities like getting up and walking while you talk on the phone, using the elevator instead of the stairs, fidgeting while sitting at your desk in office, etc. can add up in burned calories.

Make it a habit to take small walks around the house or workplace, ride your bike instead of driving, and do a few push-ups and sit-ups at the end of your day. This is because simple physical activities aid improvement in the metabolism and burn fat effectively.

, If you are sleep deprived, you could be slowing your metabolism.Adults should get at least seven hours of sleep each night.If you are not getting enough sleep, take proactive steps to increase your sleeping hours. Set a regular bedtime and wake time for yourself. Use an alarm clock to keep track of each. Keep your bedroom quiet and dark. Maintain a median temperature in your bedroom.


Do not use your bed or bedroom for non-sleeping activities. For instance, do not read, watch TV, or play videogames in bed.
Avoid large meals before going to bed. You should not eat within the two to three hours prior to going to bed.

, Yoga, deep breathing, and regular exercise are all proven methods to reduce stress. Everyone responds differently to different stress-reduction techniques. Experiment with several and find one that works for you.


If you work a difficult or stressful job, look for work to which you are better suited, and do not try to overload yourself by taking on too many optional additional projects.
Getting enough sleep is a good way to relieve stress. Try to get at least seven hours each night.
If you suffer serious anxiety or feel chronically stressed, consider consulting a therapist. Therapists are specially trained to help people find positive ways to relieve their stress and anxiety.

,

For instance, if you find yourself stressed because of negative thoughts like, “I will not have a good day at work,” close your eyes and envision the thought as a red balloon. Imagine yourself letting the balloon go and watching it float away into air. Then, imagine that millions of blue balloons come floating down, each containing a positive thought such as, “Today will be wonderful,” or “I am proud of my accomplishments.”

Do not drink or use drugs to relieve your stress levels.

, During winter months, fight the temptation to crank the heat. Keeping the temperature at about sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit will not only save you money on your energy bill, it will also boost your metabolic rate. During the hot season, stay cool by drinking icy beverages and chilling in the air conditioning.


If you don’t have air conditioning, keep a fan on.
If necessary, head out during the hot part of the day to a friend's house or a public place like a cafe or shopping mall.

Create a calorie deficit.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Eat more lean protein.,
Eat fewer unhealthy fats and empty calories.,
Make smart food choices.",How to Shrink Your Stomach2," Calories are the measurement of energy that our body uses. We eat food to get the energy and nutrients for our body to function. But if you eat more calories than you need to function, your body will store those nutrients in fat (making you gain weight). Take in fewer calories than you need to force your body to burn off those extra stores.

, There's a reason for that food pyramid you learned about in school. Eating a balanced diet is important for making sure your body gets all of the nutrients in the right amounts to keep you feeling full and healthy. Try to eat a diet comprised of 30% healthy carbs, 20% each of fruits and vegetables, 10% each of dairy and meat, and as little fat and sugar as possible.Healthy carbs include rye, quinoa, oatmeal, brown rice, and other nutrient-rich grains.
When fitting fruits and vegetables in your diet, make smart choices. Some fruits and vegetables are not as healthy as others. Try to eat citrus fruits, rather than fruits like apples (which have lots of sugar and relatively few nutrients). When choosing greens, the rule of thumb is that the greener it is, the better it is. Avoid the iceberg lettuce in favor of kale, arugula, or spinach.

, Protein will give you energy and nutrients. It's important to eat lean proteins like chicken, beans and lentils, and eggs, however, as many protein sources have a large amount of fat.

, Avoid saturated and trans fats (which are always labeled on the back of food containers). These fats are unhealthy and can cause you to gain weight. Empty calories are ones which include almost no nutrients and they should also be avoided.


Foods high in saturated and trans fats include margarine, chips, crackers, store-bought baked goods, frozen food, coconut, butter, processed meat, as well as a number of other foods.Examples of empty calories include white bread, chips, cookies, jam, fruit juices (even the natural ones!), soda, most breakfast cereals, and a number of other foods as well.

, Eat more foods which are rich in nutrients. These can help you feel more full and give your body what it needs to stay strong and healthy. Healthy foods include broccoli, salmon, quinoa, lentils, olive oil, eggs, kale, and edamame.

Do aerobic exercise.,
Exercise enough.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Shrink Your Stomach3," Unfortunately, there is no such thing as spot training. You can’t lose weight for just your stomach; you’ll need to lose weight over all in order to shrink that belly. But with a good diet and a little exercise, that is easy to do. Aerobic exercise is great for burning calories and helping you lose weight.



Try swimming to burn calories and lose weight.

You can run, jog, or even just walk to burn calories.

Biking is a great way to shrink that stomach.

, It is important to exercise for at least ten continuous minutes, as anything less will not really help you burn calories. You will also want to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day total. An hour would be better. The more you exercise, the more progress you’ll see. , If you want to lose weight, it is also important to exercise regularly. This may not mean every day, but you shouldn’t exercise just once a week or every now and again when you feel like it. Being sporadic will not really give you results.

Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Eat a healthy lunch.,
Eat a healthy dinner.,
Eat healthy snacks.,
Exercise.",How to Shrink Your Stomach4," Balance dairy, protein, and healthy carbs in the morning for a caffeine-free energy boost. You can alternate between these example breakfast options:


1 cup of strawberry yogurt, 1 large banana, and 1 cup cooked oatmeal.
1 cup of low-fat cottage cheese, 1 or 2 oranges, and 1 whole-wheat bagel.
2 oz of Canadian bacon, 1 cup of kiwis, and 2 pieces of whole-wheat toast.

, For many people, lunch is when we break down and eat something bad. Stay strong and make healthy choices! Alternate between these three example lunch options:


Kale salad with lentils and onions. Use low-fat dressing.
Whole wheat flat bread with chicken, hummus, and cucumber.
Rye bread sandwich with arugula, salmon, and mozzarella.

, Eat a small dinner and try to eat it as soon as possible. Your body can’t burn enough of the calories from your meal if you eat right before sleeping. Examples of healthy dinners include:


Lemon pan-seared salmon, steamed broccoli, and garlic roast potatoes.
Quinoa with steamed kale and lean chicken.
Grilled halibut and spinach salad with low-fat dressing.

, Eat one snack between meals to keep you from feeling like you have to scarf food. This will also help your body learn to process all food better. Examples of healthy snacks include:


Cherry tomatoes and green beans.
1 cup of pumpkin seeds, almonds, or walnuts.
Low fat cottage cheese and apples.

, Exercise for at least one hour a day, if you can. It doesn’t need to be all at once. Get your heart rate up for at least ten minutes at a time to ensure that you burn calories. Here are some example exercises (try to do all three every day):


Do 4 minutes of planks, 2 minutes of squats, and 4 minutes of jumping jacks when you wake up.
Go for a half hour jog if you have time before getting ready for work.
Ride a bike (stationary or mobile) for half an hour when you get home.

Work out.",How to Maintain Weight Loss," You’re probably already doing this in order to psych yourself up about your weight loss and keep going further. Once you’ve reached your target weight, however, some people feel that it’s “mission accomplished” and stop monitoring their weight. Don’t be one of those people. If you weigh yourself regularly -- for instance, every time you get home from the gym -- you’ll remain vigilant for extra pounds that are sneaking their way back onto your body.,

There’s no getting around the fact that staying healthy and fit requires a huge commitment of mental strength and a positive attitude. But if you’ve already lost the weight you struggled to get rid of, you’ll know that the victory wasn’t easy. You put time, sweat, and pain into your weight-loss program, and you don’t want to do anything to mess it up. Think about these sacrifices when preparing to maintain your specific diet and exercise regimen.

Keep photos which depict you when you were overweight. Place them in a central location like on your refrigerator door so that when you feel yourself slipping, you’ll have a visual reminder of the body you’ve left behind and don’t want to go back to.

, Besides thinking about the bad things you went through to get to where you are today, think about how weight loss has enhanced your life. For instance, think about how you have more energy, more confidence, feel stronger, and are more fit overall than when you started your weight loss journey.Envision a future where you are free of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and the other ailments which often plague overweight individuals.

,

There are online support groups and face-to-face groups. With face-to-face groups, you can get immediate responses to your situation, encouragement, and the feelings of camaraderie that come with such meetings. With the online support groups -- forums and chatrooms -- you might have to wait a bit before someone responds, though the potential network of people who respond is obviously much wider. When participating in either type of support group, be specific about your problem so you can get the best, most accurate help from people who have been there before. For instance, don’t vaguely say, “I’m gaining weight.” Explain how long you’ve been gaining weight, what changes you’ve made to your diet regiment, and so on which may be connected to the weight gain., Humans are varied at the genetic level, and these genetic differences affect how easily and quickly your body loses or (re)gains weight. Similarly, if you were or are very obese, you triggered changes in your body which altered its internal chemistry. These changes altered the speed at which your body processes calories. Staying conscious of your own body’s signals and operation will help you think more realistically about how you can maintain your target weight.


For instance, if you were very obese, you might feel hungrier than someone of the same weight even after eating the same meal.
If you have difficulty maintaining your weight, consider trying to keep your weight a bit higher than your ideal.
Expect occasional variation in your weight. Give yourself a five pound margin of departure from your target weight when evaluating your weight loss maintenance. For instance, if you wanted to be at 145 but you’re at 148, don’t freak out. If your weight starts to tick up far beyond where you want it, redouble your efforts.

, RDS is, essentially, when you eat too much food to try to increase your dopamine levels, which should bring you pleasure. If you have RDS, you might not feel the increased pleasure as much from the dopamine, so, as a result, you eat more food. This syndrome is about your brain chemistry, not your own willpower. Be careful of letting this syndrome (if it affects you) negatively influence your weight loss.

, To lose weight, you adopted new, healthier habits. To keep it off, therefore, you need to be persistent with these habits. Even if you face problems like RDS, try not to revert to your old ways. Lifestyle changes are about a lifetime commitment to be healthier and happier.


If you make a mistake and eat poorly, get right back to your good habits as soon as possible. It's okay; this happens to everyone. However, it's also important to return to healthy habits quickly.

, In order to keep your weight from fluctuating, you need to know how many calories are necessary to maintain your target weight. To determine how many calories you need each day, you’ll need to know your height, weight, age, gender, and activity level. These factors affect your calorie needs. If you’re a 5’2’’ 90-year-old woman, you will need fewer calories than a 6’6’’ 25-year-old man who exercises regularly. There are a variety of apps and online calorie calculators that can help you determine how many calories you need each day.

Use a calorie calculator, like , to determine your caloric needs. There are many different sites you can use to figure out how many calories you need.
You should also get an app for your phone like Libra or MyFitnessPal to figure out how many calories you need to meet your energy expenditure each day.

, Once you know the number of calories necessary to maintain your target weight, you need to carefully track how many calories you’re taking in so that you can stay within your calorie budget. Check the Nutrition Facts label on your packaged food. The Nutrition Facts label lists the number of calories in a given portion of packaged food.You can use food labels to track your caloric intake each day.


Don’t forget to include your snacks when monitoring your calorie intake.
Use a food diary to track how much food you eat each day. Use a physical activity diary to track how much physical activity you did each day. At the end of each day, tabulate the number of calories you took in according to your food diary and compare it with the number of calories you burned according to your physical activity diary. If you have burned roughly the same number of calories as you took in, your weight is in balance.
If you’re burning more calories than you took in, exercise less or eat more until the numbers are balanced. If you’re taking in more calories than you are expending through physical activity, reduce the number of calories you’re taking in or incorporate more exercise into your schedule.

, Fat has a high energy density. A very fatty food like peanut butter, for instance, has about 380 calories per 1/4 cup. By contrast, a low-fat food like spinach contains only seven calories per cup.


Some fat is important for a healthy diet.Incorporate nuts, seeds, and olive or safflower oil into your diet. These contain polyunsaturated fats (the “good fats”) which keep the body healthy.

,

Sugar is added to many foods and contributes to weight gain. To maintain your weight loss, avoid added sugar and read the ingredients list on your processed and packaged foods. Ingredients are listed in order of their contribution to the food’s total weight, so a food which lists sugar among the first five or six ingredients contains a large volume of sugar. Avoid these foods to maintain your weight loss.No more than 10% of your daily calories should come from added sugar.
Avoid soda and sweetened fruit juices.
Other forms of sugar include glucose, fructose, honey, malt syrup, molasses, and fruit juice concentrates. If you see a label with, for instance, high fructose corn syrup as a primary ingredient, avoid it in order to limit your sugar intake.

, Water removes extra salt and unneeded fluids out of your body.Research has found that two glasses of water before each meal can help people lose and keep weight off.It can also, in modest amounts, fill your stomach and make you feel full. Too much, through, and it will go straight through you.


Men should consume 3.7 liters of water or more per day.
Women should consume 2.7 liters (0.7 US gal) of water or more per day.

, These often have a high glycemic index (a measure of how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels) and will spike your blood sugar quickly for a short time before crashing it. When your blood sugar rapidly declines, you will experience hunger and be tempted to ruin your weight-loss maintenance diet.Instead, eat filling fibrous foods like whole-wheat toast, cereal, or oats along with fruits like blueberries and strawberries. Use skim or non-dairy milk in your cereal and only small amounts of peanut butter or jelly on your toast.

, Meal planning is the process by which you decide in advance what you are going to eat, usually a schedule you set about one week out. Carefully select meals based on their caloric and nutritional content, as well as their taste, to ensure you always have a healthy, complete meal available.


Make a list of your favorite foods and identify if they meet your dietary requirements and goals. If they don’t, look for alternatives to certain ingredients to render them more acceptable.
For instance, you might love creamed corn, but since beginning your weight loss program, you’ve adopted a vegan diet. Substitute an alternative like soy milk for the cream and you can eat your favorite dishes and maintain your weight loss, too.
After setting your meal plan, make a list of the ingredients you’ll need to prepare each meal. Go shopping with the list and purchase only those ingredients which are on it. This way, you avoid buying unhealthy snacks like chips and soda, and will have a pantry stocked exclusively with foods you can use to make your healthy meals.

, Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables and lean protein, but allow yourself everything in moderation. Learn to listen to your body. For instance, you should eat when you are hungry and do not eat when you are not hungry. Eat foods you like, but learn to like things which are healthy. If you do not enjoy the food you’re eating, you will not have the desire to stay the course and maintain your weight loss.


Incorporate healthy fats into your meals. For instance, try poached eggs, which are healthy sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Use olive oil on salads or in cooking.,

Some people have a hard time limiting their consumption of particular foods and are thus susceptible to weight increases. Does your intention to eat just two scoops of ice cream tend to turn into eating the entire carton? Do you have a history of eating an entire bag of chips in one sitting? Learn to identify patterns of overeating associated with one specific food (your trigger food) and avoid eating them.

Keep a food journal detailing what you eat each day and how much of it you eat. Review it at the end of each day and keep an eye out for patterns which indicate you have trouble controlling portion sizes for a particular food or foods.
Foods which inspire overeating tend to be high in salt, sugar, and fat. Limit your intake of foods which meet these qualifications like ice cream, French fries, and cookies.
Eat meals regularly. If you’ve already eaten a proper meal, you will be more likely to get the signal that you’re full when you start consuming excess calories.
Eat slowly. Whether you’re eating a snack or a full meal, chew each bite at least eight times and sip water between bites. This will allow time for your brain to get the signal from your belly that you do not need to eat anymore. Savor each bite to prevent binging., For instance, if you become conscious of the fact that you’re binging on glazed doughnuts, put them aside and do yoga or watch your favourite show on TV. Substituting one pleasurable activity (binge eating) for another can help you overcome food weaknesses and maintain your weight loss.


Try to do activities that keep your hands busy, like knitting, drawing, or whittling. You could also take the time to learn a musical instrument. Creative pursuits can be extra rewarding and lead to feelings of happiness and contentment.

, There are many emotional and psychological reasons as to why people choose to overeat. Stress eating, for instance, is a common reaction to excess stress in which individuals eat to cope with a difficult situation.Depression can also lead to an increased desire for comfort foods like ice cream and chocolate.

If you have ADHD, you might likewise be susceptible to unhealthy food choices. Fortunately, there are many things you can do to reduce the likelihood that your risk factors will lead to overeating.

If you’re stressed or depressed, find healthy alternatives to unhealthy eating habits. Yoga, deep breathing practices, and regular exercise are positive activities which could alleviate depression and reduce stress. You should also consider consulting a trained therapist.
If you have a high-pressure life, look for ways to reduce your stress. Take time out for yourself to go shopping or spend time with friends. Ask for help when you need it at work or at home. For instance, if you are a busy father, you could ask your parents or spouse to watch your child while you go for a walk or ride your bike.
Get enough sleep each night. Adults require about eight hours of sleep each night. A lack of adequate sleep is tied to increased depression and stress.
Stay mindful of your eating habits.Eat consciously and pay attention to how each bite tastes. Do not eat in front of the TV or computer, and do not eat while driving or engaging in other activities. By focusing on eating, you increase overall feelings of fullness and satisfaction with your food.

, By adjusting your current routine in such a way that you incorporate physical activity where there previously was none, you can avoid regaining lost weight. If you choose to incorporate physical activity into your everyday routine, you could, for instance, ride your bike to work or to the store instead of driving. You might also take the stairs instead of the elevator (provided you don’t work too high up). Think about ways you can get active without going too far out of your way.

, Staying active with your child or grandchild by playing tag, pushing them on a tire swing, or walking around the playground can keep both of you healthy and happy. Look for opportunities to maintain your weight loss by engaging in playful physical activity with your grandchildren or children.

, Marathons and other distance races are great activities that give you the chance to put your training to the test. By maintaining a healthy weight, you will perform even better in a race. Races also give you a chance to meet people who, like you, take fitness seriously. Search for runs and marathons in your area at http://www.active.com/running.


Even if you don’t finish in first place, you should be proud that you’ve gained the confidence and kept off the weight necessary to compete in a race.
Don't worry about winning or losing. Most of the people at these events are there just for the fun, rewarding nature of participating. Completing a 5k race a few times a year is a great goal for staying active, and it doesn't have to be competitive if you don't want it to be.

, You and your workout buddy should inform one another of your goals (maintaining weight loss, in your case) and check in with each other periodically to ensure your goals are being met. With a workout buddy, you make working out even more fun since you have someone to talk to.


Do not choose a workout buddy who is not committed to getting and staying fit. Bad workout buddies can be a distraction and prevent you from meeting your goals.
For the same reason, do not choose a workout buddy who is negative and complains often during the workout.
Ensure that you respect your workout buddy. You should like your workout buddy enough to make, share, and keep workout goals with them; help each other meet goals; and support each other when you need it., For instance, the Fitbit is a wristband which tracks how much activity you do each day, and allows you to input data like how many calories you consume and how many calories you want to burn.

You can visualize your daily, weekly, and monthly activity data on your phone., computer, or tablet. Activity tracking devices make maintaining your lost weight fun and easy.

Activity tracking devices also make it possible to share your activity log with your friends and family on social media. The positive encouragement you receive will then further inspire you to keep off the weight you lost.

, This can be either a bad or a good thing. For instance, if you are lazy and do not exercise every day, starting a daily exercise regimen can be hard. However, once you have developed a daily or weekly habit of doing something, it is easy to maintain it. Use good habits to keep your weight off.


Practice positive self-talk. You are capable of change and are capable of keeping that change. Reassure yourself that you are able to do this task, even if it's hard sometimes. You've lost the weight, and you can keep it off!
Continue to exercise and eat right. Aim to continue doing what you’ve been doing.,

Engage in physical activity for at least 60-90 minutes each day. You do not need to engage in 60-90 continuous minutes in order to enjoy the benefits of the exercise. For instance, you could work out for 45 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes after work in the evening. Ensure you do both aerobic exercises (like running or swimming) and resistance training (like lifting weights). Continue engaging in the workout regimen you used when losing weight so as to maintain your healthy habits."

Plan for rest days.",How to Maintain a Lean Physique," There are a variety of ways to maintain a lean physique. However, self weighing on a regular basis is one of the most important.


Many studies have shown that getting on the scale at least once a week is important for weight maintenance long-term. Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term.When you get on the scale each week, try to weigh yourself at the same time of day and in the same clothes. It'll give you a more accurate representation of any trends.
Give yourself a weight range to stick to. It's not realistic to think you'll be the exact same weight everyday or every week. It's normal to fluctuate up or down 3-5 pounds.
Track your weight in a journal. If your weight goes up too high or too low, you'll know you need to make changes to your diet or exercise plan to correct those unwanted changes.;
, Another way to maintain your physique and to keep yourself at your goal is to take regular measurements.


Common areas to measure and track are: waist, hips, thighs and arms. Keep these measurements in a journal and track them over time.
Like regular weigh-ins, taking measurements on a regular basis can let you know if you're staying at a stable weight and level of muscle mass.
You won't see many noticeable differences in measurements in just a few days or even a week. Give yourself about a month's time to notice any significant changes.
If you're aiming to maintain or even continue to increase muscle mass or decrease body fat, you should see changes in those numbers.
If you notice any unwanted to changes to these numbers, take a look at your diet and exercise and make changes to those areas if needed.

, Even when you're maintaining your goals, keeping a journal can be helpful for maintenance.


You can use your journal to keep notes of a variety of things. It's a good idea to track your food, average calorie intake, exercise and measurements.
If you notice any changes in weight, measurements or overall fitness level, you can return to your journal to see if you've slowly slipped away from your maintenance exercise or diet plan.
Journaling can also help keep you accountable over time. It might be easier when you're maintaining your weight, but it's still a good idea for long-term accountability.

, Although you may have met some of your initial goals regarding weight or physical activity, you might want to consider making additional goals to help keep you motivated to maintain your physique.


Additional goals could be a variety of things. You may want to continue losing weight or improve your fitness levels.
You may also set goals to keep pushing yourself. For example, you might want to sign up for a 1/2 marathon or a mini triathlon. These loftier goals can help keep you motivated and working hard physically.

, You still need to watch out for how many calories you take in and expend every day. If you want to maintain weight, you need to aim for an amount of calories that equals how much your body expends during the day and what you burn off during exercise.There are a variety of online calculators that can give you a pretty accurate estimate of how many calories you need daily to maintain your weight.
However in general, women should consume about 2,000 calories to maintain weight and men should consume 2,600.Note that this amount may vary person to person based on genetics, activity level, age and weight.
After you get an idea of your goal for the day, start tracking your calories over time and your weight. If you see weight loss or weight gain, adjust your calorie intake as needed so you begin to maintain your weight.
You may want to consider continuously monitoring calories and your overall food intake just to keep track. Overtime if you see any undesired changes, you can refer back to your calorie and food journal to see what caused these changes.
Plan your week to compensate. If you have a big dinner and drinks with friends on Wednesday, you might want to compensate by consuming fewer calories on Tuesday or Thursday.

, Protein is not only essential to weight loss, but even more essential for weight maintenance (especially if you're maintaining more lean muscle mass). Stick to a high protein diet to help maintain your physique.


Many studies have shown that a high protein diet helps sustain weight loss and helps maintain weight better than a lower calorie diet.A high protein diet means that you'll need to consume at least 1 serving of lean protein at every meal, in addition to including 1-2 high protein snacks throughout the day.
Leaner proteins are lower in calories and will make it easier to stay within a certain calorie level.
Measure out a 3-4 oz serving of protein for each meal and include 1-2 oz for snacks.Choose a variety of both lean protein and those containing healthy fats. Try: poultry, beef, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu, seafood and pork.

, Weight maintenance or maintaining a specific physique will require you to eat the right type of carbohydrates. What carbs and how much you need will depend on your goals.


Studies have shown that if you want to maintain a leaner physique, that you follow a lower carb diet. This type of eating patterns make it easier to maintain your weight.In addition, a lower carb diet can help you maintain a lower body fat percentage and increased muscle mass.
Carbohydrates are found in many foods including: dairy products, fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes and grains.
Foods like starchy vegetables, legumes and fruits offer your body a large variety of other nutrients like fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.Do not limit these nutritious foods due to their carbohydrate content.
However, grains can be limited as many of their nutrients are found in other foods. If you choose to eat carbs, go for 100% whole grain and measure out a 1/2 cup or 1 oz portion total., Regardless of what type of physique you're aiming to maintain or what weight you want to stay at, it's important to eat adequate amounts of vegetables everyday.


Vegetables are very low in calories but also high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. They'll fit easily into your maintenance diet and provide you with the majority of your needed nutrients each day.
Try to include vegetables at most meals and some snacks. Measure out 1 cup of denser vegetables and 2 cups of leafy salad greens., When you're trying to maintain a lean physique, you're most likely participating in some sort of physical activity. It's important to stay hydrated by drinking adequate amounts of fluid.


It's typically recommended to drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water daily. However, when you're exercising frequently, you most likely need closer to 13 glasses of water daily.Note that not all fluids count as hydrating beverages. Only water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea will hydrate your body.
In addition, electrolyte drinks, coconut water or low calorie sports drinks can replace electrolytes lost through your exercise and help hydrate you as well.

, Regardless of what type of physique you have (big and muscular or lean and toned), continuing with aerobic exercise is essential to maintaining your weight, physique and overall fitness level.


In general, its recommended that you include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise each week.This is the minimum amount needed to generally maintain your weight and cardiovascular fitness.
Depending on what goal you've reached, you may need to increase the amount of time of aerobic exercise you do or include higher intensity levels of exercise.
For example, if part of your goal was to run a 1/2 marathon, then you may want to keep up this level of fitness by including longer runs during the week.

, If you've reached a lean physique, you've probably been doing some type of weight lifting or resistance training. Maintaining your physique will require you to continue this type of training.


At a minimum include 1-2 days of strength training each week. Again, this is the minimum that's been set to maintain basic physical health.What type of physique you currently have and want to maintain will determine what type of strength training you want to do. There are exercises to help you build bulk and others that will build strength and definition.
You should definitely keep up with weight training to maintain a lean physique. If you are hitting a plateau or your physique is slipping, however, you should change up your routine.
Which exercises to do and how many reps to do of each exercise greatly depend on your fitness goals, your past experiences, your injuries, and your strengths. You can start learning about weight training here, and you can also see a personal trainer for a session or two to make a fitness plan.
There are many different ways to change your weight training routine if yours isn't working. You can change the exercises you do; the speeds of your exercises (i.e. plyometrics vs. isometrics); your positioning (such as an underhand or overhand grip); your schemes for your number of sets, reps, and weights; and which programs you do on which days.
You should also try different weight, rep, and set techniques, such as pyramiding, to keep your muscles challenged. In pyramiding sets, you start by doing more reps with smaller weight and gradually move up to fewer reps with larger weights (so, essentially, your number of reps is ""pyramiding"" from largest to smallest)., When you're working hard to be physically active and maintain a lean physique, it's important to take care of your body and take an adequate amount of rest days.


Rest days are important for everyone at any fitness level. They allow your body to rest and recover from aerobic or anaerobic training.Rest days are especially important for your muscles. It's actually during rest that your body sees significant increases in strength or mass.It's typically recommended to include 1-2 rest days per week.
Try to make your rest days active. Instead of staying home and doing no activity at all, participate in restorative, low intensity and low impact exercises. You could do yoga or go for a walk or take a leisurely bike ride.

Replace unhealthy foods.,
Instead of skipping breakfast and gorge on lunch try to begin your day with a glass of either milk, juice, or simply water.,
Eat healthy all day.,
Exercise.","How to Lose Weight, but Stay Healthy as a Teen"," Instead of a lot of things that are fried in oil, eat things that are baked. Instead of cooking with real sugar, replace it with a sugar supplement. Thinking about what you're eating and how you could make it healthier will automatically boost your health and decrease your weight.;
, If coffee is your fix then have a cup of that. Not eating breakfast puts your body into a state of hunger called ""starvation mode,"" which causes your body to store fats and carbs and actually cause you to gain weight. What you eat during breakfast is usually what your body is going to be burning up throughout the day so try to make it healthy and full of vitamins. There is so many options that you shouldn't have a hard time finding something healthy to eat for breakfast that you also enjoy. What many people usually have is either two eggs, toast, and handful of raspberries or muesli with yogurt. It keeps you full and gives you the energy boost you need to carry on throughout the day.

, For all the chocolate bars you can count there is also a much better replacement. What choices you make during lunch define how you feel the rest of the day, and how much energy you have before dinner. During lunch opt for water as main drink instead of juice. What are some healthy options to eat? There is a chicken salad, which is not only healthy and green but also delicious and full of protein. Another popular health snack is a veggie burrito. You can make one easily at home. Just buy some pita bread and spread your favorite spread on top, and throw in your favorite veggies (Add avocado for an extra dash of vitamins) and you're done!

, Exercising isn't actually what you would think it is. Instead of being forced to do countless of laps in P.E, when you are your own personal trainer you are your own boss. Hit the gym a few times a week, and just do whatever you feel like doing. If it is walking ten minutes on the treadmill then so be it! If you do it long enough you will come to find enjoyment out of those ten minutes, and I can promise you that you will find yourself taking those ten and turning them into twenty, thirty, even forty minutes. You might start jogging, biking, and a door of healthy exercising opens up to you if you are willing to just try.

Restart physical activity.",How to Safely Try a Fasting Diet," Before starting any new diet or eating pattern, talk to your doctor first. This is especially true if you're planning on fasting as a method of weight loss.


Your doctor will need to clear you and say you're healthy and stable enough to diet with a fasting program. Not everyone should do a fasting diet.
If you have a chronic disease like diabetes or high blood pressure, fasting may be inappropriate for you.
Also talk to your doctor about any specific risks fasting could cause considering any current health issues or medications you're taking.
Many fasting diets have been relabeled as ""detox diets,"" indicating that limited food intake can help clear the body/liver of impurities. There is limited scientific evidence that this is true.;
, Although physical activity is great for your overall health and will help support your weight loss, it might not be a good idea to do large quantities or high-intensity exercise while you're fasting.When you're exercising, your body burns glucose and glycogen (your body's stored form of energy) to fuel itself through exercise; however, on a fast, you're not supplying any glucose to your body which can make exercise more difficult.
If you haven't eaten in awhile, your body will burn more calories from fat, but it will also break down protein — the building blocks of your muscles — as a source of energy as well.This may stimulate your body to enter ""starvation"" mode. Your body will respond to reduced caloric intake by holding onto fat stores. Thus, the reason for fasting (weight loss) is greatly slowed, and any ingestion of food will be stored as fat.
During a day of fasting or longer stretch of fasting, stick to lower intensity exercises. You can do a light yoga session or a walk. These require little energy and it won't leave you feeling overly exhausted afterwards.
Leave your higher intensity or long workouts for a day where you've eaten (or once your fast is over). This will make sure that your body stays healthy and has enough fuel to power that type of exercise.

, Most fasting programs will allow you to drink fluids during your fast. In addition, it's not wise to fast without at least having water for more than 24 hours.Water is essential to the health and normal functioning of your body. Even 24 hours without water can cause symptoms of dehydration, which include decreased urine output, dried, cracked skin, headaches, renal failure, fatigue.
Make sure that you aim for at least 64 oz (1.9 L) or eight glasses of clear, hydrating fluids each day. Since you're not eating any foods, you may even want to strive for a total of 11–13 glasses of fluids daily.Because you're not consuming other foods and you may be limiting your total fluid, avoid caffeinated beverages, as these may cause you to lose more fluids when you urinate.Stick to sugar-free, caffeine-free drinks like water, flavored water, sparkling water and decaf coffee or tea.

, Some fasting diets or programs suggest adding in supplements to help either ""cleanse"" your body or promote quicker weight loss. Be very careful whenever ingesting a supplement, as these are not regulated substances.


The FDA does not provide any regulation to vitamin, mineral, herbal or other dietary supplements.Side effects or adverse events are only reported after consumers have taken supplements and reported the issues to the FDA.
Look for vitamins that are verified or certified by the USP or NSF. This means that the supplement has been tested and verified by an outside company and that it contains the ingredients listed on the label and in the advertised amounts.A common supplement added to a fasting program is fiber. Although fiber is a great supplement to have, too much of it or adding it too quickly to your diet can cause abdominal distress.Vitamin and mineral supplements may also be recommended. Low to moderate doses of most vitamins are generally safe; however, always talk to your primary care physician first.

, One thing many people note while fasting is that they feel a more tired or groggy. Make sure you get adequate rest so your body can cope with your fasting program.Most health professionals suggest that healthy adults need to aim for about seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Aim to get to bed earlier and wake up later if possible.
If you choose to fast — either for one day a week or multiple days (it is not recommended to fast for longer than three to five days) — taking an afternoon nap might not be a bad idea. It can give your mind a break and help rejuvenate your body.

, At first glance, following a fasting diet may seem simple or easy to do. While the concept of not eating may be simple, going without food can majorly affect your body and brain and cause some unpleasant symptoms.


Usually, a day or two of fasting won't cause any harm — especially if you're a healthy adult. However, you may notice that you feel hungry, feel irritable, are preoccupied with food, get dehydrated, have headaches or get sleepy in the afternoon.Sometimes, multiple days of fasting come with a resolution of symptoms; however, you still may noticed decreased energy and fatigue during the day.Track your symptoms and keep an eye on how your body is responding to the fasting diet of your choice. If symptoms are interfering with work or are uncomfortable, discontinue fasting.
Also keep in touch with your doctor if you notice any unusual symptoms.

, Journaling is a powerful tool that has helped many lose and maintain weight loss efforts by identifying self-sabotaging behaviors and thoughts. Many people who journal with weight loss do better than those who do not. In addition, you may find journaling helpful while following a fast.


Fasting will cause you to think a lot more about food, your eating habits and your appetite or feelings of hunger. Journal about these things as you make your way through your fast.
Many people notice that fasting helps improve their relationship with food. When they are forced to go without eating, they may realize how often they want to eat or feel hungry.If you journal and keep notes on what you've learned about yourself and your eating habits, you may be able to use this information to help you learn how to maintain your weight and manage your appetite.

, Fasting longer than a few days is typically not recommended. This is especially true if you're following a fast that allows no food. Follow a short fast instead for the safest program.There are many different types of fasts and fasting diets. Choose the one that is the safest and most well-suited for you.
Try fasting just for a few hours in a day. You can try fasting for 12 hours and then having a small meal after.
Also try fasting by just limiting yourself to 500 calories per day instead of your normal eating routine.
You may even want to consider doing intermittent fasting. Most intermittent fasting program suggest fasting only one or two days a week. This may be easier to follow and comes with less risk.

, Each fasting program or diet is different and will vary in what they do or do not allow on their fasting days. Make sure your pantry and refrigerator are stocked with the appropriate types of foods or beverages.


If you're following a fast that only allows water, there are still other things that you can have. You can try adding flavorings to your water, drinking decaf coffee or tea or even sipping on hot broth.
If you're following a juice diet, either purchase a few containers of 100% juice or consider purchasing fruit and veggies and making homemade juice with a blender or juicer at home.
If you are allowed to eat certain foods, make a grocery list of those items and purchase them each week so you have them on hand for your allowed meals.

, Each fasting program will have different instructions on what you can have and when you can have it. Make sure you follow exactly what's recommended to see the best results and keep your body healthy.


It's important to follow the recommended schedule during your fast. This is especially true if the program dictates when you should drink and what type of beverage you should have. This will help you stay hydrated.
In addition, the more consistent you are, the better your results will be and the quicker your body will adjust to the fasting diet.

, After you've completed your fasting program, make sure to ease yourself back into eating. Try to aim to go back to a balanced and nutritious diet.It might be tempting to go ""wild"" after coming off from your fast. You may end your fast feeling hungry and looking forward to eating, but try your best to control your cravings and desire to eat.
Try to stick to moderate portions at every meal and only eat until you're satisfied — not overly full or stuffed. Measure out 1 or 2 cups per meal total or stop when you're satisfied.
Also try to limit snacking and grazing. It can be difficult going back to eating after a fast, so try to control how often you reach for snacks now that you're eating again.

, Lean protein is essential to losing weight but also to maintaining weight as well. Make sure to include adequate sources of protein so you're meeting your daily minimum.If you're consuming a 3 – 4 oz serving of lean protein at each meal, you're most likely meeting your daily protein needs.Stick to lean protein sources the most often. These are naturally lower in calories. Try: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, beans, low-fat dairy or tofu.

, Like lean sources of protein, both fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories. Incorporating the recommended five to nine servings per day can also help maintain the weight you lost during a fast.Aim to make at least half of your meals and snacks either a fruit, vegetable or both. This will help ensure you meet the daily guidelines.
Measure out about 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or about 1/2 cup of fruit per serving.

, Whole grains are a great food to add back to your diet after a fast. They help keep you satisfied and make it easy to maintain the weight you lost during your fast.


Aim to include one to two servings of 100% whole grains each day. Measure out about 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 1 oz of grains.Go for 100% whole grains as these foods are high in fiber and other essential nutrients. Refined grains are stripped of all these beneficial nutrients during their processing.Try 100% whole grains like: quinoa, brown rice, farro, whole wheat pasta or whole wheat bread.

, After you've completed your fast, get back into your normal physical activity routine. You may have laid off on some more intense workouts, but now that you're eating regular foods and meals, you can safely return to these types of workouts.


Aim for 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular or aerobic activity each week. Include activities like jogging, swimming, dancing or using the elliptical.Also return to your weight lifting or strength training routine. Include at least one to two days of strength training each week and ensure you work each major muscle group. Lift weights, do yoga or try pilates during the week."

These foods will typically be higher in fiber and lower in fat, and can help you feel full longer by physically putting more food in your body without too many extra calories.Vegetables such as salad greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus are all low in calories relative to their volume. Use veggies as fillings, toppings, or as part of salad.
Stick to fresh fruits. Fruit juices, dried fruits, and fruits packed in syrup typically have more concentrated sugars, and thus a higher energy density.Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, or brown rice are high in fiber as well as other important nutrients, and can help keep you full and healthy in moderation.;
, Foods that are low on the glycemic index (GI) scale take longer for your body to break down, and so can help you stay full for a greater period of time. Try to avoid overly-processed carbohydrates such as white bread and instead opt for whole-grains, plain nuts, legumes, and seeds.Try to pair low-GI carbohydrates with other nutrient-dense foods to make sure you stay full and still get what your body needs.
For example, you may make a snack out of a hard-boiled egg, which offers protein, and half an apple, which provides low-GI carbs.
Consider reducing highly processed foods like white bread, pastries, cookies and crackers to once a week, or if possible, eliminating them entirely.

, It's natural to have cravings throughout the day, and ignoring them may only push you to make less healthy food choices later on in the day. Instead, keep healthy snacks around for when cravings strike. You can even plan them out as a part of your daily meal plan if you get regular cravings.Snacks like unbuttered popcorn and roasted edamame will help keep you full in between meals without contributing too many calories to your overall intake, and while curbing saturated and trans fats as well as added sugars.Fiber-rich snacks like berries and pieces of fruit, and unsalted, oven-baked sweet potato chips can also help keep you full longer., While overindulging can derail your diet, completely restricting yourself from foods you enjoy can push you toward making unhealthy choices, too. Incorporate small treats into your diet, such as a single scoop of ice cream or one slice of pizza. Spread three or four small treats out over the week to help you stay focused without feeling constrained.Pair your indulgences with wholesome, high nutrient foods like fruit or vegetables. For instance, one slice of pizza with a big salad that includes seeds or other healthy sources of fat and fiber. Try having your scoop of ice cream with a cup of berries or a chopped orange.
Remember to keep treats small and occasional. Allow yourself a couple of cheat meals throughout your week rather than a full cheat day, and plan them ahead so that you don’t overindulge.

, You are more likely to choose healthy, filling meals when you plan them in advance, rather than making in-the-moment decisions. Take time once a week to plan your meals for the week, including snacks and treats. Focus on incorporating filling, healthy foods into each meal, and use your meal plan to make a shopping list to ensure you bring home robust foods.It may also help to have a small snack before going grocery shopping. This helps you feel full in the store and can keep you from making impulsive, hunger-driven decisions.

, Slow eating doesn’t work in all cases, but many people report feeling full after eating less when they focus on chewing slowly. This gives your body more time to allow your digestive hormones to interact with your brain, signaling that you’re full before you take another bite.One trick to help you eat slower is to put your fork down between each bite of food. Do not pick it up again until you have fully chewed and swallowed the last bite.
Another good trick is to take a drink of water between bites. This will also improve your digestion.

, An eight ounce glass of water and an eight ounce glass of soda are going to take up relatively the same amount of space in your stomach. The soda, though, brings in unnecessary calories and sugar, and does not hydrate as well as water. Cut high-calorie beverages such as sodas, prepared coffee drinks, and other caloric beverages.If you want to add flavor to your water, try squeezing in some fresh lemon or lime juice, or infusing your water with chopped up fruit pieces. Alternatively, you may opt to drink unsweetened tea or iced tea. Be careful since sweetened teas may even have more sugar than soda.

, Some sauces, such as ketchup and barbeque sauce, are high calorie and do little to help you feel full. Opt for lower calorie flavor enhancers such as fresh herbs, ground spices, and sauces like mustard, horseradish, and hot sauce.Add fresh herbs to meats, salads, and roasted vegetables to give them rich, complex flavors. Rosemary goes well with most meats, and herbs like cilantro can help a salad taste extra fresh.

, Regular exercise has a number of benefits, including aiding in burning excess calories. Try to get between 30 and 60 minutes of moderately vigorous exercise four to six days a week. Incorporate both cardiovascular exercise and strength training to keep your body healthy.Regular exercise may allow you to eat a little more and still create a calorie deficit, since you are expending more energy during your workout.
Be sure to track your exercise and the estimated calories burned so that you do not overestimate how much you can eat. There are a number of smartphone apps that can help you track both your daily meals and exercise.

, The average adult should get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. A lack of sleep may be linked to constant snacking and overeating, and could sabotage planned meals by causing cravings for fatty and sugary foods., Stress is another factor that can contribute to overeating, encouraging unhealthy choices as opposed to healthy, filling meals and snacks. Take time every day to reflect, meditate, walk in nature, or find another way to disengage from the stress of your daily life.It may be helpful to set limits in stressful stimuli. If your work email is connected to your phone, for example, you may decide not to look at your phone starting two hours before you go to bed.
Try a progressive muscle relaxation to help you let go.

Find your basal metabolic rate.,
Reduce your caloric intake to less than your BMR.,
Join a dieting club.,
Drink water.,
Avoid certain foods.",How to Lose Weight Without Taking Pills1," The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of calories your body needs to function at rest for an entire day.A BMR calculator can be found online that will use your height and weight along with some other factors to calculate your BMR.;
, Reducing your caloric intake to 500 calories less than your BMR daily should cause you to lose one pound per week.You can use a journal or a specialized app for your smartphone to keep track of calories throughout the day.


Some apps include Lose It!, MyFitnessPal, Fooducate, and My Diet Diary.
Most apps will also help track your carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake to be sure you are in a healthy range for each.
Never reduce calories by too much or you may slow your metabolism down so much that losing weight will actually be more difficult. A person weighing 300 pounds may be able to reduce caloric intake by 1000 calories per day, but a person weighing half that much should limit their reduction to around 500 calories., Dieting clubs and services may help you count calories when cravings leave you weak or if you are having trouble keeping track on your own. Some clubs/services include Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, Jenny Craig and more.These groups not only provide plans proven to work, they provide support and accountability.

, Drinking water can support weight loss in several different ways. It can act as a hunger suppressant and it can serve as your thirst-quencher instead of drinking sugary drinks that add calories to your diet.Water also helps increase your metabolism and get rid of waste.

, Some foods have many calories in small packages, making it more difficult to count calories. Other foods may have little nutritional value, which would not be helpful when you are reducing caloric intake, because you still need adequate nutrition.Some of the foods you should avoid include:


Carb-only snacks, such as crackers, dry cereal, bread, or rice cakes. Snacks that are all carbohydrates will lower your blood sugar by forcing your body to produce more insulin, which in turn will make you hungry again.
Frozen foods. Frozen foods are often high in sodium, which makes you retain water. When you retain extra water, you may not feel like your attempts to look better are working.
Snack bars high in fiber. Snack bars with lots of fiber have a tendency to make fiber intake inconsistent (keeping you from feeling full) when you could otherwise get the fiber you need consistently by including a fruit or vegetable with each meal.Foods advertised as being low-fat. You may think you're supporting your diet by eating these foods, but you may end up eating more, and the makers of the foods often use sugar to offset the flavor missing fat, which can pose other problems for your diet.Fruit juice. Fruit juice is all the sugar from a fruit — sometimes using several pieces — with none of the fiber.
Artificially-sweetened beverages. Artificial sweeteners may make you crave foods more, which may contradict your otherwise healthy diet.
Alcohol. Alcohol may occupy the liver because it is a toxin the liver must work to get rid of, leaving it less able to burn fat.

Discuss exercise regimen with a doctor.,
Practice aerobic exercise.,
Practice strength training.,
Walk.",How to Lose Weight Without Taking Pills2," You should certainly check with a doctor before beginning an exercise regimen if you have heart disease, asthma, diabetes or other ailments.The doctor can also help you determine what a healthy weight would be for you, as well as how you may be able to reach that weight.


This is especially important if you need to lose a large amount of weight, but consulting with a doctor is always a good idea, regardless of the amount of weight needing to be lost.

, Also known simply as ""cardio,"" aerobic exercise can be beneficial because it speeds up your metabolism for a while after your exercise routine comes to an end. This means your body will use calories faster during this time, and you will lose weight by burning more calories than you take in.Aerobic exercise is exercise that is low, medium, or high intensity and performed for a longer duration continuously.
Try to get 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five to seven days per week.

, When you practice strength training, you will make your muscles bigger. Bigger muscles require more calories, so you will increase the amount of calories you burn even at rest if you have bigger muscles.Push-ups, crunches, bicep curls, squats, and lunges are examples of strength training exercises.
An hour-long strength training session three times per week can help you lose weight during and after exercise.

, Walking can be a great workout for people who need more low-impact exercise because of other health issues that preclude them from getting aerobic exercise. Walking is also good for mental health as it is overall health.Walking 45 minutes per day can help you lose up to one pound per week.

Measure your portion sizes.,
Eat enough protein.,
Eat a snack.,
Sip on a drink.,
Remove leftovers or extras.,
Purchase smaller plates and bowls.,
Eat protein and complex carbohydrates at every meal.,
Avoid carbohydrate rich meals.,
Choose whole foods over processed foods.,
Drink 64 oz clear fluids daily.,
Write down your definition of hunger.,
Sit down to eat.,
Eat slowly.",How to Satisfy Your Hunger Without Eating Too Much," Following appropriate portion sizes can help ensure you're eating just the right amount of food for you while helping you maintain your weight.


Most meals should include at least 3-5 oz lean protein, 1 serving of vegetables (about 1 cup) and 1 serving of grains (about 1/2 cup).
Purchase a food scale or measuring cups to help you stay on track. Pre-measured plastic containers or bowls can also help with portion control.
Measure protein sources raw and consistently maintain that habit.
Also, make sure you're eating enough. Sometimes diets or a weight loss plan may call for portions that are too small. If you're not eating enough, you'll feel hungry all day.
Diets or eating patterns that suggest skipping meals, drinking only liquids or fasting will generally cause you to feel more hungry throughout the day. They are also most likely not safe.;
, When calories are being restricted or you're restricting portion sizes, you may not be eating enough protein. This may make you feel more hungry and less satisfied throughout the day. This is pertinent in keeping you full and also ensuring that muscle isn't lost instead of fat when trying to lose weight.


Men should consume around 65 g of protein daily while women should consume around 50 g of protein daily.Track your protein intake with a calorie/nutrition counter either online or on your phone. Aim for your daily target and work towards meeting it as best you can.
Consume protein at each meal. If you're eating protein at each meal, you're most likely consuming the minimum amount.

, When portion sizes are smaller, you may feel hungrier sooner. Going to long in between meals without eating can leave you overly hungry which makes it harder to control your portions at your next meal.


Snacks aren't used to replace meals. They are used in between meals to keep you full and keep your metabolism revved up.
Snacks also need to be portion controlled or calorie controlled and not be a meal. Try to keep snacks under 200 calories.Include protein and produce (fruit or vegetable) at your snacks. This combination will help keep you satisfied longer.Options include: greek yogurt with fruit; carrots and hummus; small apple and cheese stick; hard boiled egg and grapes; or pumpkin seeds with dried fruit.

, Following smaller portions can be difficult at first. Try sipping on a clear, sugar-free beverage prior to eating your planned meal or snack. This can help quell your hunger and make it easier to maintain a small portion. Try sipping on water, low-fat or skim milk, unsweetened coffee or tea or low-calorie sports drinks.
You can even try sipping on vegetable or low-calorie broth-based soups.

, Once you portion out your meal or snack, put away any remaining foods. It'll help prevent you from being tempted by second servings.


After you've prepared dinner, plate your food and then automatically put the leftovers in the refrigerator.
For snacks, portion out what you're planning on eating. Do not eat snacks from the box or bag. It's almost impossible to stick to an appropriate portion size since you can't see how much you've eaten.
The minute you feel satisfied, clear your plate. This will help prevent you from finishing what's on your plate when you've already had enough to satisfy you.

, Using smaller server ware can help make it seem like there is more food on your plate. It's an easy mind trick to help you eat less.


Appetizer or salad plates are the perfect size for your main meals.
Don't have small plates? Try serving yourself 20% less instead.

, Studies have shown that protein can keep you feeling satisfied longer when compared to meals that are mostly carbohydrate.In addition, whole grains, fruits and vegetables are complex carbohydrates or foods that are high in fiber and contain other nutrients, that also keep you feeling satisfied longer.Healthy fats can also be used to improve satiety without overeating. Consider pairing protein with complex carbs OR protein with healthy fats.
Lean protein options include: poultry, lean beef, fish, shellfish, nuts, lentils, beans and low-fat dairy foods. Include a variety of these protein based foods in your diet.
Foods like berries, lentils, beans, whole grains (like oatmeal or brown rice) and broccoli are high in fiber and are considered a complex carbohydrate.
Combinations of meals that are protein-rich and contain complex carbohydrates are: whole wheat English muffin with low-fat cheese and a scrambled egg, oatmeal with fruit and nuts, mixed green salad with raw vegetables, grilled chicken and low-fat dressing, a whole wheat wrap with deli meat, low-fat cheese and lettuce or shrimp and vegetable stir-fry served over brown rice.
Combinations of snacks that are protein-rich and contain complex carbs are: yogurt with fruit and whole grain granola, carrots and hummus, an apple with peanut butter or sliced raw vegetables with low-fat dip and a cheese stick.

, Meals that contain a lot of carbohydrates or are mostly carbohydrates without much protein or fats do not keep you satisfied long compared to a meal that's a combination of protein, carbohydrates and fats.


Carbohydrate rich foods include foods like: bread, rice, pasta, tortillas/wraps, beans, potatoes, corn and lentils.
Aim to have about a 1/3 of your meals to be a carbohydrate rich food.Ensure you have a source of lean protein in each meal - about half of your meals or snacks should be protein-based - in addition to a serving or two of a fruit or vegetables.

, Highly processed foods (even low calorie ones) should make up a very small portion of your diet. Studies have shown they are not as satisfying long term.When your body is fed processed foods, it has to weed through the junk to absorb the real nutrition. Sometimes, you're left undernourished and still hungry. Eat whole foods to avoid this.


Processed foods generally refer to foods that have a lot of additives (like flavorings or colorings), preservatives and have gone through multiple changes to become the final product.Examples of processed foods to limit include: desserts, ""100-calorie packs"", refined grains (like white bread or white rice), frozen meals, chips and cookies.
Most of your choices should be whole foods or minimally processed foods. Examples include: fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, fresh or frozen lean protein, 100% whole grain breads, pasta or grains and dairy products.

, Many times even mild dehydration can make you feel hungry, when in fact you just need a few sips of water.Stay hydrated daily to prevent this mistake.


Purchase a water bottle to help you keep track of you ounces each day. This can also help you see what progress you've made throughout the day.
If you're not a fan of water, try other options like: diet iced tea, unsweetened coffee, water with lemon or flavored water.

, It can be difficult to maintain small portions or not snack when you feel hungry. However, it's also important to understand and define what true physical hunger is. You may feel ""hungry"" when you're bored, stressed or angry and be tempted to eat.


Physical hunger comes on gradually. In addition your stomach may feel empty or growl or make noises. Physical hunger also goes away after even a small portion of food.If it's been several hours since your last meal or snack, you may be physically hungry. Eat your planned snack or meal.
If you noticing you're feeling ""hungry"" without the signs of physical hunger, consider the other reasons you may be craving foods.
Remember, feeling hungry is OK. You should feel hungry before your meal and you might feel hungry at bedtime. This is normal and expected.

, It can be easy to eat in the car, during a work meeting or while watching TV. Sitting down to eat will draw your attention to your meal. This can help you stick to a smaller portion.Take this a step further and disconnect from all technology. Turn off the TV, computers and phones so you can fully pay attention to your meal.
Set a rule that you only eat when you're sitting down at a table or desk. This will help curb unnecessary eating or snacking.

, Take about 20 minutes or more to eat your meal. This is about the time it takes for your brain and stomach to communicate that you've had enough to eat and you're satisfied.Promote an environment that is solely used to eat. Avoid snacking while working or watching TV. Sit down to a meal and don't get up until it's done. Really savor your food and dedicate a specific meal time to you. You will appreciate your meal more and feel more full as you enjoy each bite.
Set a timer or a stop watch to give you an idea of how much longer it should take you to eat.
Put your fork down in between each bite, take a sip of water between each bite or chat with friends or family as you eat.
Take small bites and chew each bite at least 20 times to slow you down.

Use a low calorie sweetener.,
Substitute skim milk.,
Stir in a healthy creamer.,
Request extra foam.,
Avoid syrupy shots.,
Skip the whipped cream.,
Choose your toppings carefully.",How to Reduce Calories in Coffee Drinks1," Replace teaspoons of sugar added directly into your coffee with a low calorie or no-calorie sweetener, such as Splenda. Follow the directions on the package regarding serving size and resist the urge to add extra. You can also request this substitution when ordering at a coffee shop.It is best to choose sweeteners that do not list “aspartame” as one of the ingredients. Aspartame has been the subject of concern as a potential contributor to cancer. It can also cause headaches in some people when consumed in products that contain it, such as Equal.You can also cut down on calories by gradually reducing your use of sweetener until you eliminate it altogether. Do this by adding just a little bit less to your coffee each day.;
, Using whole milk adds flavor but it also packs on the calories. Instead, go “skinny” and opt for skim milk or low-fat milk instead. Be aware that if you order in some coffee shops this swap may not be a possibility as they use premixed packages for certain drinks, especially seasonal ones.Drink milk substitutes, such as soy or coconut milk, only in moderate amounts as they can contain high levels of sugars.It’s not necessary to remove milk products entirely from your coffee. In fact, milk has been shown to offset the calcium that coffee pulls out from your system.However, the amount of calcium coffee pulls from your system is very small, so just 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk is enough to offset it., Read the labels on your store bought creamers paying particular attention to the calories, fats, and sugar content. Buy a creamer that is made with artificial sweeteners. It may also help to move away from creamers that use a half-and-half type substance as their base.


Especially watch the ‘holiday flavored’ creamers as they are often loaded down with sugars and highly processed ingredients resulting in a higher calorie count.
If you want a more healthy option, make your own creamer at home. Stir skim milk, cinnamon, and artificial sweetener in a saucepan until it simmers. Let it cool and refrigerate between uses., Light, foamy drinks are less calorically dense. The foam takes up the space in the cup where more liquid could be. Turn your attention toward a cappuccino with extra foam instead of your traditional latte. You could cut 40 calories just by making this exchange., If you are out at a coffeehouse, request that the barista put one less shot or pump of flavoring or syrup into your cup. Keep lowering this number each time you visit until most of the extra shot calories are removed. You can save right around 70 calories a shot with this request., If you make coffee at home, simply stop buying whipped cream at the store. If you are at a restaurant, request that they “hold the whipped cream” when they make your drink. Whipped cream is a staple with most specialty coffees but it can add between 80-120 calories per cup.You might also ask your barista if whipped cream is mixed in to the drink itself. If this is the case, make sure they know to not do that for your drink.

, A ‘pretty’ cup of coffee is always wonderful to look at, but it can pack o the calories. Ask your barista to skip the syrupy or chocolatey topping. Or, you can ask them to just use half the typical amount. One tablespoon of a chocolate drizzle syrup can contain up to 50 calories.If you are at home, experiment with some healthy toppings. For example, lightly sprinkle cinnamon or nutmeg on your drink instead of a heavier syrup. You will get an extra flavor kick without the calorie consequences."

Manage your calorie intake.,
Eat three to six meals daily.,
Make meals high in fiber and protein.,
Bulk up meals with fruits and vegetables.,
Include regular aerobic exercise.,
Do one to three sessions of weight training weekly.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Control stress.",How to Lose Weight Without Skipping Your Meals," Weight loss will depend on decreasing your total calorie intake - not skipping meals. Cut out a few calories each day to help you lose weight.


It's typically recommended to cut out about 500 calories daily. Over the course of a week you might lose about one to two pounds.If you skip a meal, you might think that is an easy way to cut out about 500 calories. However, when you skip meals your blood sugar drops, your energy level drops, and so does your metabolism.If you shave off just a few calories from each meal or snack you can end up with a 500 calorie deficit without having to skip entire meals.;
, Skipping meals won't help you lose weight. Eating regular consistent meals every few hours will.


There's been some back and forth over which amount of meals is better for weight loss. Some experts recommend only three meals daily while others say to eat five to six. There are benefits to both.
Eating more regularly might seem like it will increase your metabolism and make weight loss easier, but this has been proven to be untrue.However, you may find you have less cravings and your appetite is controlled more efficiently if you eat more regularly.
You may only need to eat three meals daily if you choose the right combinations of foods at each meal.
You may want to try a few days of only three meals daily and a few days of five to six smaller meals daily. Stick to the meal pattern that helps you lose weight, satisfies your cravings and hunger levels and is easy to manage.

, Many studies show that both protein and fiber can help you feel more full and satisfied throughout the day when you're on a diet.Increase both protein and fiber to help you lose weight while still being satisfied.


Make sure you eat one to two servings of protein at each meal. You need to have protein spread evenly throughout the day. Choose leaner proteins to help you stay within a lower calorie goal each day.
Measure out a 3 to 4 oz (80 to 120 grams) serving of lean proteins like poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, tofu or low-fat beef.Many foods are high in fiber and when combined with protein can increase your overall satiety. Go for 1 oz or 1/2 cup (125 ml) of whole grains, fruit or vegetables at each meal.For the longest feelings of satisfaction or satiation, combine a higher protein food with higher fiber foods.

, Fruits and vegetables are great for weight loss. Bulking up your meals with these low calorie foods can make following a lower calorie diet a little easier.


Fruits and vegetables are known to be very low in calories. In addition, they have a fairly high fiber and water content. By bulking up meals with more fruits and vegetables, you can feel more physically full and satisfied for few calories.Some health professionals suggest making at least half of your meals and snacks a fruit or a vegetable. This is a great idea to help decrease your overall calorie intake but keeping the volume of your meals the same.
Measure the portions of your fruits and vegetables. Go for one cup (250 ml) of vegetables, two cups (500 ml) of leafy greens or 1/2 cup (125 ml) of fruit., In addition to modifying your diet, regular aerobic exercise can help boost and support your weight loss. Start exercising more regularly or consistently.


Most health professionals will typically recommend participating in at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.However, if you're interested in faster weight loss, you can safely do up to 300 minutes of cardio each week.
In addition to weight loss, regular cardio is responsible for: reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease, reduce your risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome and decrease your risk of high blood pressure and stroke.Include cardio exercises like: jogging/running, swimming, dancing or cycling.

, Weight training or resistance training is a type of exercise that can help build and support lean muscle mass. Used in combination with aerobic exercise, you can support your weight loss efforts.


Weight training offers slightly different benefits compared to aerobic exercise. It can help support or build lean muscle mass which can increase your body's metabolism and ability to burn calories plus reduce your risk for osteoporosis by increasing your bone density.Add in one to three days of strength training. Over time, it can help your body burn more calories at rest. Make sure to work each major muscle group and aim for a 20 minute workout per session., Inadequate amounts of sleep can make you feel hungrier throughout the day. This can make weight loss difficult.


When you don't get enough sleep, your body produces additional hormones that can increase your feelings of hunger and appetite all day long. This may cause you to eat larger portions, snack or eat the wrong types of foods.Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Try going to bed early so that you can get in more hours before your morning wake up.

, Like lack of sleep, stress can make weight loss difficult. It can increase your hunger and make dieting less effective over time.


Controlling and managing stress can help you lose weight more easily. Specifically, it can help manage your appetite.When you're overly stressed, you have increased hunger and cravings for high fat, higher calorie foods.Consider adding some relaxing and de-stressing activities to your weekly routine. Try: going for a walk, meditating, talking to a friend or doing yoga.
If these activities don't help or you continue to have more difficulties managing your stress, consider seeking the help of a behavioral specialist.

Order a small size.,
Go for a single-shot coffee.,
Measure out your add-ons when at home.,
Drink your coffee black.,
Exchange one cup of coffee for water.,
Try tea-based beverages.,
Avoid all eggnog drinks.",How to Reduce Calories in Coffee Drinks2," This is single best way to cut calories. Gradually downsize from your standard size order to a smaller one. If you are at home, start making your drink with smaller mugs and put away the oversized ones. If you are out, look at the menu or ask your barista about the smallest drink size available.


Some places offer more conservative serving sizes upon request. For example, at Starbucks you can order a Short, which is smaller than a Tall and totals 8 ounces. This switch can save you 50 calories off your standard latte order., Instead of a larger beverage, go for a tiny action-packed coffee instead. Espresso, for example, logs in at only 6 calories. It won’t take you long to drink but it will provide an energy boost. You will also appreciate the flavor as it is the foundation of many coffee-house beverages., Take the extra time to measure the amounts of creamer, sweetener, or milk before putting them in your coffee cup. Keep a teaspoon, tablespoon, and small measuring cup on your counter for convenience. Consult the serving sizes on the packages to determine how much to add.This practice is also helpful in that it makes you more aware of what you are consuming. You have choices in your beverages and can lower the amounts of add-ons if you want even more benefits.

, For some people the best option is to move away from the specialty drinks and choose straight black coffee instead. It is easy to make and cheaper to buy. You will get the energy benefits and still be able to participate in the ‘ritual’ of visiting the local coffeehouse.If the taste is simply too bold for your liking you can try cold brew iced coffee. You will receive the same health benefits with a sweeter taste. These drinks are also notably low in calories. For example, a Grande cold brew iced coffee at Starbucks comes it at 5 calories., Hydration can keep you from overeating and it can also prevent you from downing too many calorically-dense beverages. At one point in the day when you typically go for a coffee refill head to the water cooler instead. Try different times for this switch to see what will work the best for you.The standard coffee-drinker consumes 3 cups a day leaving plenty of room to eliminate one refill., If you are looking for a flavorful replacement, you might want to experiment with teas. They are available to order right alongside coffees at most restaurants. They take about as long to make if you are at home. And, they can closely imitate the flavor of coffee. For example, test out a green tea with steamed milk as a low calorie alternative., The message here is to be wary of the seasonal coffees. They have a tendency to include more syrups, flavorings, etc. Eggnog is high in both fat and sugar content, making it a dangerous add-on to a more traditional drink. Instead, choose a drink spiced with nutmeg or cinnamon."

Read the nutritional displays.,
Talk to your barista.,
Understand the health effects of extra calories.",How to Reduce Calories in Coffee Drinks3," Look for the information posted in the store usually by the register. Pay attention to the columns noting calories, fat, and sugars. Depending on your diet, staying under 100 calories for a coffee drink is a good idea. You can also find nutritional information online for most major chains.With a nod to the health conscious, Starbucks and other stores have started to post online listings of their low calorie drink options., Tell your server that you are trying to reduce your calories and ask what they recommend. They may have off-the-menu secrets that they can pass along to help you slim up your drink. This is especially a good idea if you are prone to ordering coffee drinks without knowing what goes in them, as most of us do.


When ordering you might say, “Hi, I’m really trying to watch my calories but I love the flavor of the caramel macchiato. What do you suggest I order?”

, You are more likely to watch your drink calories if you know what is at stake. Do some research online regarding caloric intake and its connection to your health. You will find that reducing calories can protect you from heart disease and stroke.It will also reduce your odds of obesity or better equip you to fight weight gain.When you begin to watch your drink calories you will see that some beverages contain enough calories (300+) to substitute for a small meal."

Avoid looking in mirrors too often, especially if you are feeling depressed.,
Get to know how your emotions affect your eating habits.,
Do a reality check every once in a while.,
Avoid skipping meals.,
Have certain times a day at which you regularly eat and try to eat about the same amount of food every day.,
Bounce back if you slip up and binge.,
Refrain from using extreme weight loss methods.,
Take your body type into consideration.,
Reduce the amount of junk food you eat.,
Stay away from scales.,
Don't lose weight for the sole goal of achieving skinniness.",How to Lose Weight Without Obsessing," Because weight loss usually is (and certainly should be) a gradual process, you are likely not going to be able to notice any real difference in your body anyway. Looking in mirrors too much, especially when you are already in feeling low, can make you feel discouraged about weight loss even if you are on the right track.;
, Many people's eating habits are affected by their emotional state. Some people binge under stress, some when they are feeling very confident and good about themselves, everyone is different. It's a good idea to be aware of when you are more likely to binge on unhealthy foods because there is nothing more discouraging when you are trying to improve your diet than a binge.

, When you are in a good mood and feeling confident about yourself, take a look in the mirror. Reflect on how you have been feeling since you started eating better and exercising. If you have been feeling good, keep doing what you have been doing. If not, make small, gradual changes and see if you start to feel an improvement. These reality checks should not last more than ten minutes. After you've done a quick assessment of your progress, stop thinking about food and occupy yourself with something totally unrelated.

, Skipping a meal is often one of the first things a person does when they are developing an obsession with weight loss. Skipping a meal will not help you lose weight; instead, it will reduce your mental and physical performance and is just generally bad for you. Even if you are depressed or not feeling well, have a little something just to give your body some fuel.

, This will help make sure that you don't skip meals and also will help prevent binges.

, Your stomach might feel a bit off for an hour or two, but it will pass. Everyone loses control of their eating every once in a while; the occasional binge will not make any difference to your health. Problems arise if you do it too often or if you overreact after a binge.

, Promise yourself never to take diet pills or force yourself to throw up. These methods will only hurt your health in the long run. The only healthy and sustainable way to lose weight is to eat well and get some exercise every day, whether it's a 40-minute walk, a half-hour weight workout, or 20 minutes on the elliptical.

, Every person has a different body type; for one woman 120 lbs could be a perfectly healthy body weight, but for another 120 lbs could be dangerously underweight. There are no good and bad body types. Every one of them is healthy and beautiful. Make sure you take your body type into consideration when setting your fitness goals.

, Don't try to totally cut out all unhealthy foods from your diet because most people will not be able to sustain this kind of eating. A good idea is often to stop buying unhealthy foods at the grocery store and just keep a small amount of healthier alternatives in case you get a sudden craving. For example, if you are a person who gets cravings for chocolate, keep a small box of chocolate chip granola bars in your pantry so that you can satisfy your cravings that way instead of with a jumbo chocolate bar.

, It's a much better idea to go by how your clothes fits. As stated in step 8, your body type will have a huge effect on what body weight is best for you, so for the average person a scale does not really tell them much. If your jeans are getting a bit baggy on you, you know you are losing weight. Don't worry how many exact pounds it is every week.

, A lot of people start fitness plans and healthy eating to ""look better"", but you should try not to make it about losing weight. Make it about feeling better, having more energy, and improving your overall health. Because at the end of the day, your friends, family, coworkers, and people you know don't care if you are a size 4 or a size 4x. Just do it to become a happier, healthier person.

Drink water throughout the day.,
Drink a glass of water before every meal.,
Replace sweetened drinks with water.,
Match any alcohol consumption with equal amounts of water.,
Drink water and cut salt intake to lose water weight.",How to Lose Weight With Water1," Drinking water during the day can help keep you feeling full without consuming high-calorie beverages such as milk, tea with milk, juice and snacks that will make you gain more weight. You may also eat less when you do have a snack, as you should already have the sensation of being full. Consuming fewer calories on a daily basis can help speed weight loss.If you do not enjoy drinking water, try flavored water instead. Buy calorie-free flavor packets for a more tasty water experience.
For more suggestions on ways to enjoy water more, check out https://www.wikihow.com/Love-the-Taste-of-Water.
Set an alarm reminding you to have your water throughout the day. That way, you do not forget. This will also help you get into the habit of drinking water more regularly.
Keep water near you. Always having a water bottle around will make it easier on you to drink more water. Buy a refillable bottle and keep it handy when you are home, at work, or out running errands.;
, The feeling of fullness will help you eat less, thus consuming fewer calories for improved weight loss results.Don't forget to monitor portion size and calorie intake as well. Water doesn't cancel out an unhealthy diet.
Drink a full glass of water before, during, and after a meal to aid digestion and speed weight loss from the water. The water will help your body to break down the food and absorb its nutrients.

, Instead of drinking soda, alcoholic beverages, smoothies, or other high-calorie drinks, grab a glass or bottle of water. Swapping in a zero-calorie beverage for high-calorie alternatives can spare you hundreds of calories per day, further aiding in weight loss., This matched fluid intake should not count toward your daily water intake. Any water you drink for this purpose should be in addition to your daily water goal.

, Reducing the amount of dietary salt you consume can help you lose water weight quickly, particularly when combined with an increase in daily water intake.Try other flavors and spices instead of salt to flavor foods. Fresh herbs or garlic do not have negative health impacts and can be added to up the flavor of many foods.
If a brand offers a low-sodium option, opt for that one. That is an easy way to enjoy the foods you love without the unnecessary salt.

Sodium content is not always obvious, so check the nutrition label. Canned and frozen vegetables are high in salt, as are most restaurant dishes.
Many restaurants now publish nutrition information online, so you can check it before you order.

If you cannot follow-through with the entire fast, it is fine to stop and resume normal eating habits.
Do the fast intermittently. Do a short fast, and then try it again in a few weeks or a month.

, You do not want to do this fast if you have any dietary or health restrictions that will jeopardize your well-being. It is not worth it. Think of other ways to lose weight if you cannot fast.If you cannot do a full fast, try replacing one or two meals with just water and having a low-calorie dinner as a means to jumpstart weight loss.

It might be the technical term for something well-known and not harmful. If the ingredient list is overrun with items that are not recognizable, avoid buying it.
Shop at whole food markets or farmer’s markets. These are the best places to find food that is closest to its natural state.

Eat high protein, high fiber breakfast every morning.,
Eat mostly lean protein, fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid mindless snacking.,
Don't drink your calories.,
Avoid regular indulgences.",How to Lose Weight Without Going to the Gym1," Eating breakfast is an important part of weight loss. Studies have shown that regular consumption of a high protein, high fiber breakfast can help you stay satisfied longer and decrease hunger cravings during the day.Fiber not only adds filling bulk to your meals, but also has been shown to prevent constipation and certain cancers like colon and rectal cancer. Starting out your day with a fiber-rich breakfast can help you reach your daily goal of 25 g for women and 38 g for men.Examples of breakfast meals include: scrambled eggs with sautéed vegetables and 2 ounces of lean sausage, 1 cup of low-fat greek yogurt with fruit and nuts or an omelet with spinach and bacon and a glass of milk or milk substitute.;
, Studies show that one of the best diets for weight loss is a moderate to low-carb diet that emphasizes lean protein, fruits and vegetables.Try to make most of your meals and snacks protein, fruits and vegetables. Focusing on these food groups will help you minimize the amount of carbohydrate-rich foods you consume. Make sure you include healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) as well, as they are an essential part of your diet, too.
Examples of meals include: grilled chicken and vegetable stir fry, lettuce wrap with low-fat cheese and lean deli meat, grilled salmon with steamed vegetables, or a sliced apple with low-fat cheese. Try a big salad with tuna fish, or egg salad, or a chef salad.
Minimize carbohydrate-rich foods when you can. Items like bread, rice, pasta, bagels, crackers, chips and couscous are higher in carbohydrates compared with other food groups. Although these can be part of a healthy diet, limiting your intake may help speed weight loss., Snacking or grazing throughout the day or late at night can sabotage weight loss. While planned, healthy snacking can support weight loss, mindless eating or grazing can counteract it.Mindless eating and snacking is when you're consuming food and not realizing how much you're consuming or what you're consuming. This may happen out of boredom when you're watching TV, driving or doing work at home. When you're not aware of how much you're eating, you're more likely to overeat.If you are mildly dehydrated, your brain may be confuse a need for water with hunger. Avoid this by making sure you drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses (2 liters) every day.
If you feel like you need to snack, make your snack planned and mindful. Sit down, portion out your food, consume it and then move on with your daily activities.
Try to avoid eating from the box, bag or package. It's tough to know how much you've consumed. Also try to minimize other distractions while you're eating — like watching TV, doing work or checking emails. Focus on your snack.

, One common cause of weight gain is the consumption of calorie-filled or sugary beverages.Ditch the sweetened drinks and consume clear, sugar-free, hydrating fluids instead.


One danger of drinking calories is that you don't necessarily feel full or satisfied after consuming that beverage. You're more likely to eat your normal calorie intake in addition to the calories from your sweetened beverages.Aim for adequate fluids from drinks like: water, sugar-free flavored water, decaf black coffee or decaf tea.

, A sweet treat, a glass of wine or sweetened coffee drink are types of treats that should be watched when you're trying to lose weight. Little items like these, over time, can slow or even stop your weight loss.


Limit treats as much as possible. This is important for weight loss when you're not planning on exercising often or strenuously. You will not be burning enough calories through physical activity to cover a lot of indulgences.
If you're really craving a treat, calculate how you can fit that treat in with your desired caloric goals each day. If you can have a smaller lunch or skip a snack (but never skip a meal) and stay within your daily calorie goal, it's appropriate to have the treat.
Indulging on occasion can actually help keep your diet on track. Depriving yourself completely often leads to bingeing later on.

You can also go for a bike ride in your neighborhood or take your bike to a scenic trail.
It is recommended you do a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.

, If you don't have time or don't enjoy planned physical activity, try increasing the amount of steps you take each day. The more you move throughout the day, the more calories you'll burn.


Think about different ways you could add more steps to your day. You could park farther away, walk the long way to your destination, or take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Also consider moving more. For example, you could do leg raises during TV commercial breaks or do sitting leg lifts while you're sitting at your desk.

Set realistic goals.,
Make a list of lifestyle changes you can make.,
Write up a meal plan.",How to Lose Weight Without Dieting1," If your plan is to make small lifestyle changes instead of going on a diet, you may not lose as much weight or may lose weight more slowly compared to others that are counting calories or are following a diet.


Set small weight loss goals for yourself each week or month. Weight loss might be easier to tackle if you have small goals to meet more often instead of one large, long-term goal.
Goals that are too hefty can result in failure to stay on the program. Setting smaller, realistic goals is crucial to success.
Although it's not likely you'll lose large amounts of weight loss each week without dieting, it's not safe to try to lose more than 1–2 pounds weekly.Losing more than that may mean you're not eating enough, which could lead to nutrient deficiencies as you're most likely not eating enough food to provide you with all the essential nutrients you need.;
, Although weight loss doesn't require you to go on a ""diet"" or count calories or restrict your food intake, it may require you to make a few lifestyle changes. These are small changes you can make in a variety of areas your life to help you achieve your goals. They can be made slowly, at the pace that is comfortable for you.Lifestyle changes should be something you feel comfortable changing or altering long-term. Reverting back to old habits may cause you to gain weight back.Ideas for some small changes to begin with include: taking the stairs instead of the elevator, drinking less or giving up soda, going to the gym 2–3 times a week, or eating more fruits and vegetables.
Note that lifestyle changes should not feel like a ""diet."" If they do, they might not be sustainable long-term or be something you enjoy doing.

, Even without following a specific diet, writing up a personalized meal plan may help you lose weight. You can design your own plan, whether you want to count calories, monitor carbs, or focus on protein. Use your meal plan to design your own easy-to-follow and enjoyable eating pattern.


Ideally, consult a Dietitian for a customized meal plan that takes into account all of your medical history and preferences.
Plan for a few days or an entire week of meals. Make sure to include breakfast, lunch, dinner and any snacks.
You can also use your meal plan to write up a corresponding grocery list. This will help make your trip to the store more efficient.
If you're not planning on following any specific diet plan, it's still essential to aim for a healthy, well-balanced diet. Include all five food groups most days in your meal plan.

Find a reflexology chart.,
Support your left foot with your right hand and use your left thumb to work the spleen reflex.,
Work your stomach and pancreas reflex points.,
Work the reflex point for your gall bladder.,
Energize your key endocrine glands.,
Get a good night’s sleep every night by working on your relaxation responses.",How to Lose Weight With Reflexology1," The American Reflexology Certification Board produces reflexology charts.You can also find charts online, although you should try to make sure they are from a reputable source., (On the chart it is the oblong area indicated on the outside edge of your foot between your diaphragm line and your waistline.) Stimulation of the spleen reduces hunger.

, Cradle your left foot with your right hand and press each point with your left thumb. When you reach the outside limit of the reflex area, switch hands and work the reflex points back in the opposite direction. Stimulating these points improves your digestion.Your stomach point is on the inside arch of your foot, just under the ball of your sole.Your pancreas point is in the center of the inside arch of your foot., Your gall bladder stores bile, the digestive liquid continually secreted by your liver. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, which is conducive to weight loss. Stimulating the gallbladder can also improve digestion.Your gall bladder point is a small point in the larger liver reflex area on your right foot. This is just below the ball of your sole, toward the outside of your foot., This will promote balanced hormone secretion and appropriate appetite. Your endocrine glands are responsible for your response to stress, so applying pressure to the reflex points for your thyroid (at the base of your big toe), pituitary gland (in the center of the bottom of your big toe) and your adrenals (between your waistline and your diaphragm line) will help balance your emotional and physiological stress. The less stress you have, the better chance you have to stay on your diet.While many weight loss functions of reflexology are not supported by clinical research, reflexology has an excellent track record at reducing stress.Stimulating your adrenals can help you feel motivated to exercise as well., Studies suggest that reflexology can be very helpful for improving your sleep quality.Work your right thumb across the diaphragm line, from the inside to the outside edge of your left foot.
While you are doing this, rock your toes back and forth across your left thumb.
Edge your right thumb along your diaphragm line each time you bend your toes over.

If you currently have a medical condition or injury, talk to your doctor about what types of activity are appropriate for you. They may give you some restrictions, but also provide guidelines of what is acceptable and safe.
Also, if you suffer from a chronic injury, speaking to a physical therapist or orthopedist might be a good idea. They can give you detailed guidance on what to do or not do.
If you begin a workout routine and experience any pain, shortness of breath or other side effects, discontinue immediately and consult with your doctor.;
, Although exercise DVDs generally do not require a lot of equipment, you should evaluate your in-home set up and what you'll need to do to make exercising feasible.


Choose a spot where you plan on exercising. Make sure you'll have enough space to move around or perform the exercises suggested in your DVD in a safe manner. You may need to move some furniture or other items out of the way.
Also consider the flooring. If you have hardwood floors, you may need to purchase an exercise mat to make floor exercises more comfortable.

, After reviewing or watching a few exercise DVDs you can assess what at-home equipment you will need to purchase. However, make sure you've fully decided on what DVD or program you're purchasing before spending money on any required equipment.


Some DVD programs will require fitness equipment. Items may include: an exercise mat, a stability ball, a set or two of hand weights, resistance bands, kettle bells or a foam roller.

Fill up on fiber-rich foods.,
Eat dark greens daily.,
Eat unprocessed, whole grains.,
Choose lean protein at each meal.,
Eat more fermented foods.,
Don't forget healthy fats.,
Ditch processed foods.,
Drink a lot of fluids.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Take a probiotic supplement.,
Take fiber supplements.,
Exercise regularly.,
Sleep seven to nine hours nightly.",How to Lose Weight With Nutritional Cleansing," Fruits and vegetables are two food groups that are a key part to a cleansing and healthy diet. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. All of these qualities are important for a healthy and cleansing diet.


Include one to two servings of a fiber-rich fruit or a vegetable at each meal. This will help you meet the minimum guidelines of five to nine servings daily.The number of servings will vary based on your age and weight; however, including more fruits and vegetables can help increase the amount of nutrients you can consume from them.
One serving of fruit is generally one small piece of fruit or about 1/2 cup chopped.One serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens.One of the attractive qualities of over-the-counter diet cleanses is that they are often high in fiber. They can clean you out from the inside out; however, adding a lot of fruits and vegetables can provide you with adequate natural fiber for the same cleansing benefits.
Focus on the most high-fiber fruits and vegetables. Include at least one serving of one of these fibrous foods at each meal: cauliflower, broccoli, artichokes, Brussels sprouts, berries (like raspberries, blueberries or blackberries), apples, or pears.;
, Dark, leafy green vegetables are filled with a huge amount of beneficial nutrients. Eating at least one to two servings of these types of foods each day can help support your nutritional cleanse by providing a lot of fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients. They even been touted to be one of the best ""cancer-fighting"" foods.Dark greens can be eaten raw or cooked. Try: kale, mustard greens, spinach, collard greens, bok choy, or Swiss chard.
Dark greens contain a huge variety of nutrients including: Vitamins A, K, C, and E. In addition they contain a significant amount of folate (which is important for DNA replication and repair) and carotenoids (an antioxidant thought to prevent cancer).Eat dark greens mixed with scrambled eggs, saute them with a little olive oil and garlic for a nutritious side dish or use them in salads.

, 100% whole grains are another great nutrient-rich food group. They contain protein, vitamins and are also a good source of fiber.If you're interested in a cleanse and improving your diet, switch your grain choices to 100% whole grain.


Whole grains provide you with a host of benefits. Choose grains that have gone through the least amount of processing and contain little additives. For example, instead of a whole wheat couscous with a seasoning packet, choose to prepare plain whole wheat couscous and add your own seasonings at home.
Other examples of unprocessed whole grains include: 100% whole wheat pasta, 100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa and oats.
Skip refined, processed grains. Some grains, like refined or processed grains, add little nutritional benefit to your diet. They can be higher in calories, lower in nutrients and promote constipation (as they are lower in fiber). Switch out grains like white bread, white rice or plain pasta for whole grains., Many nutritional cleanses focus mainly on fruits and vegetables. Although this has many benefits, it's important to also include sources of lean protein at each meal.


Protein is filling and keeps you feeling satisfied longer compared to foods like fruits, vegetables or whole grains. In addition, it's important to help maintain your metabolism and muscle mass.One serving of lean protein is about 3-4 ounces. Include one serving at each meal or snack. Examples include: 4 ounces of poultry or lean beef, two eggs, 1 ounce of low-fat cheese, 1/2 cup of low-fat dairy or 1/2 cup of legumes (like beans or lentils).Include a variety of protein sources throughout your day and week. In addition, keep red meat to a maximum of one serving weekly.In general, women need 46 g of protein daily and men need 56 g daily. However, this amount may be different depending on your age, gender and activity level.Although protein is important, don't go overboard. You'll be able to meet your daily recommendations with just a few servings daily. If you're interested in a cleanse and a healthy diet, you should emphasize fruits and vegetables.

, Some foods aid your digestion by providing your GI system with healthful, protective bacteria. Fermented foods have become more popular and are a great way to add those ""good"" bacteria into your diet.Fermented foods to try include: kimchi, kombucha, kefir and sauerkraut. Serving sizes vary depending on the food. Read the packaging label and try to include one to two servings of these healthy gut-promoting foods daily.
Fermented foods have also been touted to help decrease bloating, constipation and other minor GI issues. These benefits can help support your decision for a nutritional cleanse.Fermented foods have also been shown to help you digest and absorb the nutrients from your foods.They'll help your GI system process food and move waste along quickly.

, Though you may be tempted to avoid anything labeled ""fat"" when trying to lose weight, fat is actually an essential part of our diet — they are good for your mental health and mood; reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer; reduce fatigue; and help keep you mentally sharp.Fats should be consumed in moderation, and certain types of fat should be avoided.Focus on monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (like those found in avocados, nuts, olives, fatty fish, soy, and tofu) and avoid trans fat (found in commercially baked goods like cookies, pastries, cakes, muffins, and hamburger buns; packaged snack foods like crackers, microwave popcorn, candy, and chips; fried foods; pre-mixed products like cake mix, pancake mix, or chocolate milk; and anything with partially hydrogenated oil).There is a debate about whether or not saturated fat falls into the category of good or bad fat. Consider eating a moderate amount of saturated fats (found in meat and dairy) from high-quality sources.It is recommended a person eat three to nine servings of healthy fats per day.One serving size is equivalent to: 1 teaspoon oil (olive, peanut, sesame, walnut, etc.); 1/2 tablespoon nut butter (natural, with no added sugars); 2 tablespoons or 1 ounce of avocado; eight black olives; 10 green olives; seven almonds; six cashews; nine peanuts; four halves of walnuts.Try eating two 6-ounce servings of fatty fish per week.
Make avocados, nuts, and olives staples of your diet.

, Decrease your consumption of highly processed foods. These particular foods are generally higher in sodium, sugar, fat and overall calories.Including these on a regular basis may slow or prohibit weight loss.


There is a wide range of food processing. Avoid foods that are highly refined and highly processed such as: candy and sweets; processed meats like bologna, sausage or bacon; snack cakes and pastries; cereals; frozen meals; chips or crackers.
Foods that are minimally processed, but still considered a healthy addition to your diet include: frozen fruits and vegetables without added seasonings, bagged lettuce, pre-washed/pre-cut fruits and vegetables, canned beans and vegetables without added seasonings and 100% whole grains without added seasonings.
Highly processed foods may also contain added preservatives, artificial flavorings, colorings or textural flavorings.
Skip the foods with added sugars, sodium or that are highly processed. Stick to minimally processed foods whenever possible. Highly processed foods will not promote a nutritionally cleansing diet and again may slow your weight loss.

, One very important part of a health diet and a nutritional cleanse is ensuring that you consume an adequate amount of clear, sugar-free, caffeine-free fluids. Your body needs adequate amounts each day to stay hydrated and function properly.


Your body relies on adequate hydration for a variety of things including: body temperature control, circulation, bowel function and flushing out wastes and toxins from your body.A general rule of thumb is to drink about eight 8-ounce glass of water daily; however, if you're trying to cleanse your body and improve your diet, drinking more than that might be helpful. The exact amount of fluid you need daily depends on your age, weight, gender and activity level.
Pure water is the obvious choice to keep you hydrated, but remember there is water found in other beverages and even your foods. Milk, tea, and coffee all contain water (though if you're doing a cleanse, you should stick to decaf tea and coffee).
Also consider starting your morning off with a glass of hot lemon water. A few studies show that this acts like a mild and natural diuretic. This may help reduce bloating.Avoid all alcohol, sugary beverages and caffeine. If you're doing a nutritional cleanse, focus only on clear fluids. Ditch the alcohol, sugary/sweetened beverages and caffeinated beverages.

, Before making any large dietary or lifestyle changes it's important to check in with your regular doctor. Tell them about your desire for weight loss and using a nutritional cleanse to help reach your goal.


Ask if there are any supplements that you should stay away from or that may not be recommended with your current medications or health conditions.
Also ask your physician if he or she has any recommendations that may be appropriate for your specific health and medical history. They may be able to give you some pointers on where to start with a new diet or nutritional cleanse.

, Like fermented foods, probiotic supplements may help improve your digestion and reduce minor digestive issues (like constipation or bloating).

Eat a balanced diet.,
Snack healthy.,
Indulge in moderation.,
Talk to you doctor.",How to Lose Weight Without Dieting2," Drinking adequate amounts of clear, sugar-free fluids daily can help you stay properly hydrated throughout the day. When you're dehydrated, many times your body sends hunger-like signals that may trigger you to eat.Extra snacking from this can make weight loss more difficult or slow.

Read user reviews.,
Rate your current fitness level.,
Rent or borrow DVDs.,
Choose a DVD that incorporates both aerobic and strength training exercises.,
Avoid gimmicks and ""quick fix"" programs.",How to Lose Weight with Exercise DVDs2," Many online sites, magazines or books offer reviews by a fitness expert or a number of other consumers. Reading over a few of these reviews may clue you in on the quality of the DVD you're interested in.


Pay attention to both positive and negative reviews. Try to understand why the user did or didn't like the DVD - did it promise something that wasn't achievable? Were the workouts described appropriately? Were the workouts easy to follow? They may point out aspects of the DVD that will prompt you to purchase it or not.

, Consider what your current fitness level is - are you a beginner? Or are you a well-seasoned exerciser? This information will help you decide which exercise DVDs are appropriate for you level.


Read reviews or descriptions on the DVD to find out what fitness level is required. Most DVDs will provide some information regarding the types of exercises performed in the routines and how fit you need to be to complete them.
Also think about your goals. Some DVDs have both beginner, intermediate and advanced programs included. Even if you start at the beginner level, you may be able to move up to more advanced routines as your fitness level improves.

, A variety of online sites offer fitness DVD rentals. In addition, you may be able to borrow some DVDs from your local library.

, It's the combination of both types of physical activity that produces the best results and will help maximize your weight loss.This may also help cut down on cost of multiple DVDs and save you time from doing multiple workouts.
If you're lacking on time try routines that do both cardio and strength training at the same time. Or, just go for cardio as this burns the most calories per minute compared to strength training., Like many nutrition, diet and fitness products, not all exercise DVDs deliver what they promise. Be wary of programs that look too good to be true.


Any program that promises large quantities of weight loss in a short amount of time is most likely not safe and is most likely not promoting accurate or reliable information. The best weight loss occurs in small amounts of longer periods of time.Also be aware of exercise programs that promise you significant increases in fitness levels or muscle mass in just a short amount of time or in few minute increments. Again, it takes time, energy and patience to increase your aerobic fitness levels and to increase muscle mass."

Make your calories count.,
Learn the difference between good and bad carbohydrates.,
Choose foods that are known for their filling qualities.",How to Lose Weight Without Going Hungry1," Calorie counting is an important part of weight control but does nothing to help the body if the calories are of no nutritional value. Make your calories count by only eating nutritious foods — that way you can eat plenty while fueling your body with the nutrients it needs to stay healthy.


For example, there are 526 calories in a small order (227 grams) of fries at a typical fast food place. 227 grams (8 oz) of chicken breast, however, is only 390 calories.Chicken breast is much higher in protein (over 35 grams higher), which will help keep your bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood healthy and functioning. Many vitamins like Vitamin B, Iron, Vitamin C, and Magnesium are also found in foods high in protein.
Often when people feel hungry it is because they aren't getting what they need nutritionally. Try making sure you are getting enough protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fat. The average healthy diet consists of 40% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 20% fat.;
, Low glycemic foods and foods high in fiber will help you feel full longer and prevent hunger because they are digested more slowly than refined grains and help keep your blood sugar even.Adversely, carbohydrates that are high in starch send signals to the body to store fat. High-starch (bad) carbs should be avoided as much as possible if you want to curb the spikes in your appetite.


Instead of high-glycemic foods like white rice, instant oatmeal, cornflakes, white bread, baked potatoes, and corn, try lower-glycemic food like brown rice, steel-cut oat, bran flakes, and whole-grain bread., Make a list of all of the foods that you can incorporate into your daily diet. Think about how you might use those foods to alter some of your favorite recipes and keep them in mind on your next trip to the grocery store.


Filling vegetables that are low in calories include: spinach, broccoli, tomato, and carrots. Incorporate vegetables into salads and as side dishes; try to include some in every meal. Produce will help enrich your diet with essential vitamins and minerals.
Filling fruits that are low in calories include berries and apples. Use fresh fruit as your go-to snack throughout the day to help fill you up while keeping calories down
Filling sources of dairy include fat-free milk and fat-free cottage cheese.
Filling carbohydrates that are healthy include: brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread.
Good sources of protein include: grilled salmon, chicken breast, black beans, and red kidney beans.Stay clear of soda and sweetened drinks. Instead drink plenty of water. Oftentimes what you initially interpret as hunger is your body’s way of telling you you’re dehydrated— drinking plenty of water will curb those feelings and reduce your hunger significantly.

Combine your medication with a doctor-approved fitness and diet regimen.",How to Lose Weight With Thyroid Disease," Hypothyroidism has a wide range of symptoms from weight gain to dry skin. These can appear suddenly, or, like weight gain, get worse gradually.

The symptoms of hypothyroidism include: unexpected weight gain, fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, puffy face, muscle pain, joint swelling, thinning hair, slowed heart rate, depression, heavy or irregular menstrual periods.Symptoms vary by person and can effect everyone from infants to children and adults.Hypothyroidism is more common in women and individuals over the age of 50.;
, The only way to confirm that you have hypothyroidism, and that it may have caused you to gain weight, is by seeing a doctor. Your physician will confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan for you.


If you do not see a doctor and ignore hypothyroidism symptoms, they will become more severe over time.Your doctor should measure a hormone called Thyroid Stimulating Hormone to determine if you have thyroid disease., The cause of weight gain is complex and not necessarily because of hypothyroidism.Knowing some basic facts about the disease and weight gain will help you most successfully implement a diet and exercise plan, and possibly with medication for the condition.


Most weight gain related to hypothyroidism is caused by excess salt and water in your body. Your eating and fitness habits, however, may also contribute to weight gain.You can eliminate these excess elements and extra weight by watching your diet and exercise.
Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant weight gain. Only about 5-10 pounds (2.2-4.8kilos) are usually attributable to the disease. If you have gained more, the cause is likely how you eat and whether you work out.If weight gain is your only symptom of hypothyroidism, then it’s less likely that your extra pounds are due to the disease.Some doctors believe that insulin resistance, or where your cells are not as responsive to insulin, is to blame for the weight gain, and it contributes to the problem of not being able to lose weight with thyroid disease., Depending on your diagnosis, you may not need medication for hypothyroidism. If this is the case, talk to your doctor about the best way to lose weight before you start on a diet and exercise program.


While diet and exercise are generally important to overall health, it’s important to ask your doctor what he thinks are the best ways for you to lose your extra weight.
You can also journal and keep a record of your weight loss. This can help you become more aware of what you're eating and how it affects you.

, Once you’ve talked about treatment for hypothyroidism with your doctor, put your weight plan into action diet and exercise. It’s important not to expect too much weight loss too soon.


Don’t expect the weight to fall off. Most people have to work very hard to lose extra weight, even after diagnosis.Losing weight gradually is the best way to keep it off long term.
Some people may not lose weight at all.If you notice that you’re not losing weight, try adjusting your diet and begin an exercise regimen, which will help you take off the pounds.
Ingest 1800-2000 calories every day. Do not go below 1200 calories a day. Eating 3500 fewer calories per week is equal to one pound of weight loss; therefore, losing 500 calories a day is the recommendation., Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals will not only help you lose any weight that you put on because of thyroid disease, but also that may be from poor diet and lack of exercise.Foods that have moderate fat, complex carbohydrates, and low sodium, for example, are best for the disease and your general health.


Stick to a diet of about 1,200 nutrient-rich calories a day, which will also offset any non-thyroid related weight you gained.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, ground sirloin, or edamame with most meals, which will give your metabolism a slight boost and help you burn more calories.This will also help you burn any fat that may be contributing to excess weight.
Eat whole grains such as whole wheat, oatmeal, and quinoa instead of starchy counterparts like bread.Avoid simple sugars. They are not good for your insulin levels.

, If you’re trying to lose weight, it’s a good idea to avoid unhealthy or junk foods, many of which are loaded with sodium.Potato chips, nachos, pizza, burgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight, or excess water and sodium.


Stay away from starchy, refined carbs such as bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods can also help you lose weight., Since most weight gain from hypothyroidism is caused by excess salt and water, cut as much sodium from your diet as you can. Excess sodium causes a person to retain water, which makes him heavier.Don’t consume more than 500mg of sodium per day.Avoid sodium rich-foods.Processed and prepared foods, for example, contain high amounts of sodium.Another way to get rid of excess sodium in your body is eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas, apricots, oranges, sweet potatoes, and beets., The best way to lose excess weight from water is by staying hydrated. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day will help you stay hydrated and keep you from retaining water and water weight.


Avoid sugary drinks, especially soda and processed fruit juices.Drink 8 eight ounces of water eight times a day (64 ounces total) every day. However, the Institute of Medicine has higher daily recommendations, which are 125 ounces for men and 91 ounces for women., Some people who test within “normal” ranges for thyroid productivity do not need medication for hypothyroidism even though they have the symptoms of the disease. In these cases, taking a supplemental nutrient such as selenium, combined with a healthy diet and exercise, can help someone lose weight., Having regular bowel movements will also help flush excess sodium and water from your system. Removing these elements and other waste will contribute to weight loss and maintaining your overall health.


You need fiber to stay regular to help flush out salt and water. Aim for 35-40mg of fiber a day from soluble and insoluble sources.Soluble fiber is in food such as oats, legumes, apples, pears, and flax. You can get insoluble fiber from foods like whole wheat and brown rice. Vegetables such as broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and kale also have insoluble fiber.Regular exercise will also help keep you regular because it puts force on your intestines to move., Doing cardiovascular exercise will help you lose weight and maintain overall health. Discuss your plan to do cardio training with your doctor before you start.


Aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which translates to walking about 5 miles (or 8km) per day.Wearing a pedometer can help you make sure you’re taking enough steps per day.
You can do any type of cardio training to lose weight and improve your health. Beyond walking, consider running, swimming, rowing, or biking.
Get 2.5 hours of moderate physical exercise in every week. This type of exercise, like biking slowly or canoeing, requires only moderate physical exertion (rather than running or swimming, which requires more)., In addition to cardiovascular exercise, strength training can help you lose weight. It builds calorie-burning muscle while promoting your overall health.Before you begin any strength training program, consult with your doctor and maybe even with a certified trainer, who will create the best plan for your abilities and needs.

, A doctor is the only person who can diagnose a thyroid condition. Talk to him about any concerns with thyroid disease and he will likely test you. If needed, your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose of medication to treat your hypothyroidism.Depending on your diagnosis you may not need medication for hypothyroidism., Your doctor will prescribe you medication, often Levothyroxine, to help control your medication.Take the prescription to a local pharmacy so that you can begin your treatment.


Ask your doctor or pharmacist any questions you have about the medication or your treatment.

, Take your medication at the same time every day so that you don’t forget it. If you’re taking other supplements or medications, take your thyroid medication first to avoid any drug interactions.


It’s best to take thyroid medications on an empty stomach and one hour before other medications.Wait four hours after you take your thyroid medication to take other pills such as multivitamins, fiber supplements, or antacids., Even if you feel better, take your medications regularly until you talk to your doctor. Most people with hypothyroidism will need to be on medication for the rest of their lives., When taking medication for hypothyroidism, such as Levothyroxine, expect a small amount of weight loss.This weight loss is usually from excess salt and water.Don’t expect the weight to fall off. Most people still have to work very hard to lose extra weight even after a hypothyroidism diagnosis.In some cases, you may have extra pounds in addition to thyroid-related weight. Following the same diet and exercise program as above will also help you shed this weight.

, If you’re on medication, the most effective way to lose weight from thyroid disease if you’re on medication is to combine it with a diet and exercise plan. Discuss this approach with your doctor before you start.


Follow the same rules for diet and exercise to lose weight that you would if you weren’t taking medication for hypothyroidism.

Learn to eat at a leisurely pace.,
Eat small meals several times a day.,
Replace dessert with fruit.,
Avoid eating out: Restaurants focus on serving delicious food, not healthy food.",How to Lose Weight Without Going Hungry2," If it is not available, you will be less tempted.

, Fueling yourself properly at the beginning of the day ensures that you don’t put your body in starvation mode by lunchtime. Starvation mode essentially means that your body holds on to fat, even if you don’t eat much. It also ensures that when you do eat, you will overindulge to compensate.


Try to make sure your breakfast is balanced nutritionally, including a good source of protein. Many popular breakfasts are very carbohydrate-heavy with little protein, making you hungry much sooner.

, Make sure to take at least 20 minutes to eat your meal or snack. Eating slowly gives the brain a chance to be satisfied.Slow eating will help you avoid eating more than is necessary to feel full. Take the time to appreciate the foods that you are eating. You will receive more satisfaction out of your meal by savoring it than if you quickly scarf it down.

, Try replacing three large meals a day with six smaller meals. There is evidence that suggests an association between more eating occasions and lower BMI.The theory is that eating more frequently will help keep you fuller throughout your day because your energy levels will be more stable, as will your blood sugar levels.


Try having protein at meals and snacks. This will help keep you full for longer periods of time. Beans, lean meats, and nuts are effective for this purpose.
Consider eating a snack like cottage cheese before bed. Your body takes longer to break down the casein protein contained in cottage cheese; therefore, your metabolism will be working all night.

, Treating yourself with junk food once a week can undo all of your week’s hard work. One slice of cheesecake, for example, can be over 1,000 calories.If you really need something sweet, try eating a piece of fruit instead.


Dessert usually consists of bad carbohydrates that also leave you feeling hungry quickly.
If you want a frozen treat, try freezing grapes or blueberries. You can also mash a banana and add a teaspoon of honey for an ice cream-like treat.

, Besides being tempted to order something you know is unhealthy, you may order something you think is healthy only to consume more calories than you thought.


For example, the Garlic Rosemary Chicken at Olive Garden is 540 calories;however, when you add the sides, you could end up eating over 1,000 calories for a meal without knowing it.

If your BMI is 40 or greater, you are considered morbidly obese.

, In order to lose weight it helps to know your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your BMR tells you how many calories you burn a day just by being alive. It depends on your height, weight, age, and gender. Use a calculator online to find yours: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/


If you want to calculate your BMR by hand, the formula is as follows: For women: BMR = 655 + ( 4.35 x weight in pounds ) + ( 4.7 x height in inches ) - ( 4.7 x age in years ). For men: BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) - ( 6.8 x age in year ).This number varies widely by person. For example, a 50 year old woman who is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds only burns 1,137 calories by being alive. In contrast, a 20 year old man who is 6 feet tall and 200 pounds burns 2,090 calories just by being alive.

, The number of calories your body actually burns every day, however, varies based on how active you are. The more active you are on a daily basis, the faster your metabolism is, and the more calories your body burns. Use the Harris Benedict Equation to calculate how many calories your body truly burns in one day.This final number tells you how many calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.


If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2
If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375
If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55
If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725
If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9

, To lose weight, you must output more calories than you input. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat so for every 3500 calories you net output, you lose 1 pound. Aim to reduce your current caloric intake by 500 calories a day, never allowing fewer than 1200 calories per day if you are a woman and 1500 calories a day if you are a man. You may choose to eat 250 calories less and burn 250 calories with exercise to meet this goal.


Note that the less you weigh, the longer it will take to lose weight in a healthy way. Remain patient.

Start a circuit training regimen.,
Sprint.,
Start strength training.,
Vary your workout.,
Be conscious of increased risk of injury.",How to Lose Weight Fast (For Men)1," Circuit training is a combination of workouts designed to work every major muscle in your body. The quick switching between exercises gets your heart rate up higher than most other workout regimens, which in turn burns a lot more calories.Start a circuit training regimen to burn more calories faster and help lose weight.There are a number of good workouts you can include in a circuit session, but an example workout would look like this.Burpees, three sets of 10. Read Do a Burpee for details on this technique.
Squats, three sets of 10.
Bench press, three sets of 10.
Lunges, three sets of 10.
Perform workouts fast to get your heart rate up to its max and burn the optimal amount of calories.;
, Sprinting, unlike distance running, involves running as fast as you can for a short distance. This workout gets your heart rate up quickly and is an ideal workout to shed fat quickly. The explosive motion of sprinting will also sculpt your legs and abs, while simultaneously increasing your endurance and lung capacity.Follow these steps to perform a sprint workout.Go to a track, or measure out a straight path of 100 yards.
Warm up with either a jog or a brisk walk.

Stretch thoroughly after warming up. The explosive motion of sprinting can pull or even tear muscles if they're not properly stretched. Stretch for 10 minutes before your sprinting workout.
Start at the beginning of the 100 yard (91.4 m) path and sprint to the end. If you are a beginner, don't start out with a true spring just yet — run at about 50% of your top speed to make sure your body is ready and you don't injure yourself. Then gradually increase your speed with subsequent sprints.
Slowly walk back to the starting line. If you're still fatigued when you reach the start, rest until you feel up to sprinting again.
Perform six to 10 sprints in a session. Repeat the training two to three times a week.
Be sure to wear an athletic supporter, or at least tight-fitting underwear, while doing sprints. The quick motions can lead to a pulled groin or testicular injury without proper support., Most people think that endurance training is the only workout that will help you lose weight, but strength training is very important too. For starters, weight training boosts your metabolism, so you'll burn more calories in the hours after a strength workout. Also, muscle burns calories more efficiently than fat, so building muscle will help you burn calories even when you're resting.Read Build Muscle for workout tips that will help you pack on calorie-burning muscle.
Some good muscle-building workouts for men include dead lifts, pull ups, and squats. These exercises build major muscle groups like the back, legs, and biceps. Click here for more details on these workouts.

, You may be working out regularly but not seeing the kinds of results you'd like. In fitness, this is called a plateau. Your body has gotten used to the exercises you're doing, and they're not having a noticeable effect anymore. Draw a completely new workout schedule to revamp your fitness regimen.Try changing up the order in which you work out. For example, if you always to abs, triceps, biceps, back, and legs in that order, come up with a new order.
You could also look up other workouts that train the same muscle groups.
Perform this change up routine every few weeks to prevent a plateau.

, Though you may be eager to start shedding pounds as soon as possible, if you are obese (a BMI of 30 or higher) or have not exercised much in the past year, jumping right into an intense exercise regimen can lead to injury, which could derail your efforts to get fit. Be careful not to do too much too soon.Know your limits. Think about how long it has been since you last exercised, how much you move around on a regular basis (for instance, are you walking all day for work or do you sit at a desk?), any recent injury or illness, and your current age."

Stay well hydrated.,
Eat plenty of protein.,
Eat good fats.,
Include iron in your diet.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Add spices to your meals.,
Eat lean meats.,
Count your calories.,
Avoid crash dieting.",How to Lose Weight Fast (For Men)2," Besides all the other health benefits of drinking water, it will also help keep your metabolism up. When the body gets dehydrated, metabolism slows down. This means you won't burn as many calories, making it harder for you to lose the weight you want to., While protein is important for building muscles, it also helps keep your metabolism high. This is because the body burns a lot of calories digesting it, so your metabolic rate will stay high if protein is a normal part of your diet.Good sources of protein are chicken, fish like salmon and sardines, eggs, tofu, low-fat milk, low-fat cottage cheese, nuts, and beans.

, Heart disease is the number one killer of men in the United States, and diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol are a chief contributor to heart disease. Good fats, like mono- and polyunsaturated fats, lower cholesterol and decrease your risk of heart disease.Sources of good fats include oily fish like salmon and sardines, olive oil, avocados, and nuts.
Even when you're eating good fats, make sure no more than 25-35% of your overall calories come from fat. Any more will lead to weight gain.

, Iron deficiency will slow down your metabolism, so you'll want to get plenty of this nutrient in your diet. Some good sources of iron are shellfish. red meat, lentils, beans, and spinach., Carbohydrates are important for a diet geared towards building muscle. Without carbs, your body will burn protein for energy, which means that the protein won't go towards building your muscles. There are two kinds of carbs, however. Complex carbohydrates take longer for your body to digest than simple carbs. As a result, your body's metabolic rate will remain high if you eat these foods.Good sources of complex carbs include whole grain products, starchy vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and beans., Spicy foods like chili peppers give your metabolism a short boost right after eating. It doesn't last very long, but eating spices regularly can have a sustained effect on your metabolism. Try adding a scoop or two of chili powder to your meals to add flavor and give your metabolism a boost., Although men usually love a good steak, red meat is not the best choice for your health.Satisfy your meat craving with lean meat like poultry, and keep red meat down to 3 servings per week.


You don't need to cut out red meat entirely. Extra lean cuts of beef and pork will provide much less fat and cholesterol, which is good for your waistline and overall health.The USDA considers an extra lean cut of meat as follows: for every 100 grams of meat, there are no more than 5 grams of total fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, and 95 milligrams of cholesterol., It's very important to keep track of your calories to avoid overeating. Make sure to read all food labels and write down everything you eat. This will help you keep your eating under control by showing you where you stand in relation to your daily maximum. Keep your count low by swapping high-calorie, low-nutrition items for nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods and snacks.Also check for apps that will help you track your calories. There are several of these that will give you an accurate measure of what you've consumed., Some people think that eating very few calories every day will help them lose weight. While you'll probably see some weight loss from this, it is overall counterproductive. First of all, it slows down your metabolism, so the calories you do eat stay around longer. Second, you'll probably lose muscle as well, which means your body won't burn as many calories. If you want to lose weight, crash dieting is not the way to do it."

Wait 20 minutes after eating to go for another serving.,
Avoid eating out often.,
Move consistently throughout the day.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Cut down on alcohol intake.",How to Lose Weight Fast (For Men)3," When we eat, it usually takes 20 minutes for the body to stop feeling hungry. That means that in this window, you can eat a lot more than you really need, because you won't feel full. Force yourself to wait those 20 minutes before eating more. If you're still hungry, then you can go get some more., The portions you get in restaurants is usually larger than you would normally eat, which encourages you to eat past the point of being full. The food is also usually high in sodium, an ingredient that can cause you to gain weight. Keep your time eating out to a minimum to keep pounds off., Staying idle will slow your metabolism, and you won't burn calories as efficiently. There are a lot of tricks that you can use to stay active.Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Get up and walk around or do push ups while you're watching TV.
Walk places that are nearby instead of driving.
Stand on the bus or train instead of sitting.

, Lack of sleep will slow down your metabolism, as well as boosting your appetite. That combination means that you'll eat more and not burn it off efficiently, making weight loss difficult., The classic ""beer belly"" is a real problem for many men. Alcohol contains a lot of calories, which can lead to fat accumulation around the stomach. Help your weight loss regimen by keeping your alcohol intake to a minimum. This will cut out a lot of calories and help you shed excess weight."

Consider weight loss surgery.",How to Lose Weight by Eating Candy and Nuts1," Yes, eat as if you had ""weight loss surgery"". But clearly bite size and food content make a mammoth difference.No, bulimia or anorexia will not come from eating little for a few weeks! Those are totally different eating disorders with an obsessive, mental component, such as thinking ""I'm still fat"" (when bony/skinny), or repeatedly binging and purging.

, You might try eating only two medium Snickers, Baby Ruth, or such bars a day.
Can you (if fairly healthy) eat candy safely. ""Yes!"", but you ask ""How does that work?""

, If you chose surgery, then eat almost nothing for 3 or 4 months, by Doctor's Orders! Then never be able to eat a large meal ever again, for life...


Decide whether to have such surgery; if not, then: Skip the doctor's radical surgery and doctor ordered, forced ""starvation"", starving safely, how? Avoid the doctor's knife and those ways to starve, if you do not have the surgery.

As usual: exercise.,
Reward yourself every time you see a significant drop in your weight.,
Sleep more.,
When eating, evaluate your serving.,
Drink at least 8 glasses of water each day.,
Walk and jog whenever you can.,
Take cold showers.",How to Lose Weight Easily and Healthily," That's the most important point. In fact, unless you want to lose tons of fat, that's the only thing you have to do! Simple . . . and it's free!;
, Because your stomach is like a balloon - deflates when without things in it, inflates when with things in it - it can't feel what you put inside, only whether it's full or not. Water is a good idea because it takes up tons of space in your tummy, but has no calories. Examples would be cabbage and spinach.

, Make an exercise plan if you think it works for you. If it doesn't, easy. Take more walks around, sleep earlier and wake up earlier. Fidgeting bit by bit will help you lose calories as well, it it'll do to check your weight frequently to monitor your progress.

, No, not Hershey's Kisses, but a manicure/pedicure or, if you've enough money and are sure about it, an electronic handheld game. Just remember not to spend too much time on it.

, People say, ""Early to bed, early to rise."" You say, ""Early to bed, early to lose weight."" Depriving yourself of sleep gets you hungry and panda eyes. Keep this in your mind always: when you're sleeping, you're not stuffing food into your mouth.

, Is it too much? Will you be unbelievably bloated if you finish the entire thing on your plate? If your answer is Yes to both questions, try your best to lessen your serving. If your answer is no and you are quite, quite sure it is just right, lessen your serving just a little bit.

, Plain water (not soda!) not only makes your skin glow and make you look pretty, it also is healthy to your body and you don't gain any fat from it. Isn't that a win-win situation?

, Toss public and/or private transport away for once and save the world by walking to your destination. Enjoy the scenery, smell the roses . . . even without having a nature lesson, you learn - more, in fact!

Take 20 – 30 minutes to eat your meal.,
Take smaller bites.,
Drink water while you eat.,
Stop eating when you're satisfied.,
Remove distractions.,
Prevent yourself from being starving before meals.,
Be attentive when you eat.,
Be physically active.,
Be mindful of your overall diet.,
Limit high fat, high sugar and high calories foods.",How to Lose Weight by Eating Slowly," Studies have shown that taking at least 20 – 30 minutes to eat your meal may help you eat less. Hormones secreted from your gut have time to reach your brain and signal satiation or satiety.If you're a faster eater, you'll most likely benefit from taking some extra time with your meals. You may notice, that the slower you eat, the more satisfied you are.
Put your fork down between each bite. This can help force you to slow down and take your time when you're eating.
Talk to friends or family members while you eat. Instead of focusing on eating your food, talk to family and friends and engage in conversation to help slow you down.;
, Many times we have large bites on our forks and are loading up the fork the second we take a bite. This speeds up how fast we're eating and how much we're eating in that time.


Take small bites when you're eating. Pay attention to how much you put on your fork for each bite. Try to reduce the amount of food by half.
Also make sure to chew well. This will also force you to slow down. In addition, taking more time chewing will help you taste and enjoy your food more.

, Drinking while you're eating can have a variety of positive benefits for your eating time and waistline.


If you're putting your fork down in between bites to help slow yourself down, take a sip of water.
The more you sip on water throughout your meal, the more full you will feel off of a no-calorie liquid.
In addition, the more you drink with each meal, the more water you consume overall throughout the day. This can help you reach your daily goal of eight to 13 glasses of water., One thing that eating slowly can help you understand is when you're satisfied versus when you're full. This is also called ""intuitive eating;"" you listen to your body and eat when it's hungry and stop when it's full. This can help you with your weight loss.


When you eat more slowly, you're more likely to eat less food overall. This is because your brain and gut communicate when you've eaten enough food to be satisfied. If you eat really fast, you're more likely to eat until you're full.Stop eating when you're satisfied instead of when you're full. This will help you cut out any unnecessary calories in your meals.
Satisfied feels like a lack of hunger, a slight disinterest in your food or knowing you could have a few more bites but then you'd be full.
Being full feels more like a stretching, stuffed feeling. Try to avoid eating to this point as much as possible.

, In addition to trying to slow yourself down, remove distractions from your surroundings when you're eating. It can help you concentrate and focus on how fast you're eating and your meal.Like eating slowly, studies have shown that when you're distracted you may end up eating more and this could cause weight gain long-term.Try to take 20 – 30 minutes to eat your meal free from distractions. Turn off cell phones, close laptops, and computers and turn off the TV.

, If you've been practicing slower eating, you may notice that when you're really hungry or starving, its much harder to control the speed of your eating.Manage your hunger to help support slower eating times.


Learn your hunger cues. If you get cranky, lightheaded or a light nauseous when you're starving, be mindful of these symptoms. These should signal a immediate need for fuel to help prevent you from overeating at your next meal.
Also pay attention to the timing of your meals. For example, if lunch is at 12 and dinner isn't until 7:30 pm, you most likely won't make that length of time without becoming overly hungry or starving.
Plan a snack or a small meal in between meals that are far apart to help you manage your hunger levels more appropriately.

, Many people are on autopilot during their meals. Not paying attention and grabbing food and eating on the go may make weight loss difficult.Eating on autopilot and not paying attention to meals may cause you to overeat and not feel satisfied with the food you've eaten. Your brain was never cued into the meal.
Try to avoid eating in the car or in front of the TV. These types of distractions may make it more difficult to pay attention.
Also force yourself to concentrate on your meal. Think about what the food tastes like: What are the textures? What are the flavors? How does this food make you feel?

, Diet plays a huge role in weight loss. However, if you're only focusing on slow and mindful eating, adding in some physical activity can help support your weight loss.Most health professionals recommend doing at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.You can also increase this amount to 300 minutes a week. You may see increased weight loss with higher amounts of physical activity.Also include a day or two of strength training where you work each major muscle group. Resistance training helps round out your workout., Even when you're eating slowly and possibly eating a little less, it's still important to eat an overall well-balanced diet. This will help support your weight loss.Eating a well-balanced diet high in lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains in addition to eating slowly can help you lose weight.Eat appropriate portions of each food group throughout the day. In addition, choose a wide variety of foods within each food group.
Follow appropriate portion sizes as well. Measure out 3-4 oz of lean protein, 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greensand 1/2 cup of grains.

, Even small portions of higher calorie foods (like fast food or sweets), most likely will not promote weight loss.These foods pack on calories without really keeping you full. Remember that you're better off eating foods that are nutrient-dense, not calorie-dense.


You do not need to completely avoid these types of foods — especially if they're some of your favorites — but limit them to help lower your overall calorie content.
Watch out for high-fat foods like: fried foods, fast food, fatty cuts of meat and processed meats.
Also watch for higher calorie foods with added sugars like: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, pastries, ice cream and other desserts.

, (about his radical, restricted diet). Research his ""Five Bites Diet"", such as:


Fill-up with coffee or tea for breakfast (decaf for calm nerves?) -- your ""daily clear liquid-diet"" -- like phase 1, each morning. Drink a 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water (or other calorie-free beverages) each day (that's eight 8 oz. glasses), realizing that carbonated water and artificial sweeteners are not healthful and may be harmful.
Eat 5 bites of food twice per day. Limit, eat ten bites each day, ""Yes, 10."" (He said 12 bites will work, also).
The first 2 days are the hardest, but you get to choose to have any food you crave to help prevent feelings of deprivation that could cause you to quit your diet.
Drink liquids between meals. Drinking too much liquid with your meals can leave you feeling overly full on 5 tiny bites and prevent you from eating enough nutrient-rich foods (eat big bites!).

, Eat level or rounded tablespoon-sized bites (heaping tablespoon bites are okay -- but less effective, for rapid weight loss...).
A crash 5-bite-dieter can take 5 large, satisfying bites, for example:



Eat a burger diet: 3 Bites of burger and 2 bites of fries.

Try tacos: 2 bites of taco and 1 of guacamole and 1 of beans and 1 of rice.

Veg-out: 3 large Brussels sprouts, 1 bite of ice cream and 1 of protein...

Roll up:Fruity-tutti soft-taco. Try a burrito: Use beans (protein). Fruit roll up: Ripe mangoes or stewed apples as a taco.

Pop-5: 1 of bread, a chunk of fruit, a Brussels sprout, 1 ounce of meat or cheese, a mini-piece of candy, or as you like.Bingo! We have a winner ! -- a 5-bite-loser.

, Why -- because that may be satisfying and astonishing, as you may loss up to 20 or 30 pounds, in 2 or 3 weeks. A Snicker of 1.86 ounce (52.7 grams) has 250 calories, 12 grams of fat, 27 grams sugar, 4g protein, a little less than 10% protein, by weight (data from wrapper).

Include protein and produce at each meal.,
Limit your grains and starches.,
Ditch sugary beverages and drink 64 oz clear fluids daily.,
Eat calorie-controlled meals.,
Snack healthy.",How to Lose Weight With PCOS1," Protein and produce (fruits and vegetables) are an all-star combination when it comes to weight loss. These two types of foods will power up your body and fuel your weight loss. This is especially important with PCOS, as this condition can make weight loss more difficult.


Protein is an essential macronutrient (or a nutrient you need in relatively large amounts) to your body. If you cut out too much protein, your weight loss may slow. Protein is essential for all diets, but especially with PCOS - this is what will truly fuel your weight loss.
Aim for at least 46 g protein minimum each day. This amount is easily consumed with a well-balanced diet.Lean protein includes foods like: poultry, lean beef, seafood, pork, beans, lentils, nuts, eggs and low-fat dairy products. Choose a variety of these foods each day and week.
Fruits and vegetables are chock full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and are generally low in calories. Fill up on these nutrient dense foods to help maintain a lower calorie meal.;
, Since many women with PCOS are also insulin resistant, it's important to manage your carbohydrate intake.It's not recommended to go on a low-carb diet, instead it's recommended to eat moderate amounts of 100% whole grains. Aim for about 3 servings of whole grains daily.


One serving of whole grains is about 1 ounce. For example, 1 slice of 100% whole wheat bread is about 1 ounce and 1 serving.
100% whole grains are minimally processed and contain all 3 parts of the grain: the bran, the endosperm and the germ. These parts together make a grain whole.
Whole grains also offer more health benefits compared to refined grains. They're a great source of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Foods like brown rice, quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat bread or pasta and barley are all examples of 100% whole grains.

, A minimum of eight glasses or 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids like water, iced tea or no-calorie flavored waters will help you maintain a healthy diet and body.Sugary beverages may worsen or aggravate insulin resistance that's common with PCOS.
Sodas, sweetened coffees and teas can add a lot of calories to your day and may hinder your weight loss. In addition, PCOS is often accompanied by insulin resistance, making it important to avoid refined sugar as much as possible.Keep a water bottle close by so you can track and measure your progress throughout the day.

, Weight loss with PCOS will involve monitoring your portions, types of foods and calories. Try to cut your total daily calorie amount by about 500 calories daily. This will help you lose about 1 pound per week.Cutting out 500 calories a day results in about a 3,500 calorie deficit each week. This is the amount of calories that roughly equals 1 pound of weight loss.Do not cut much more than 500 calories per day or eat fewer than 1200 calories total daily. Otherwise it'll be hard to ensure you're eating enough nutrients.If you'd like to see increased weight loss, instead of cutting out more calories from your diet, try adding in more physical activity to help burn off more calories.
Safe weight loss is losing 1-2 pounds per week. Weight loss that exceeds that may be unsafe or hard to maintain., Losing weight and dieting with PCOS may leave you feeling hungrier in between meals. Just because you're watching your weight, doesn't mean snacking is banned. Choose snacks that are high in lean protein and contain some fiber. This combination is satisfying and will keep you satiated until your next planned meal or snack.Be careful with snacking! Snacks are great to help you get through more than 4-5 hours between meals or as a pre or post-workout boost.If you're feeling hungry and your next meal is within the next hour or so, try skipping your snack and holding out until your meal.
Snack options that are high in protein and fiber include: carrots and hummus, celery and peanut butter, a small apple and a cheese stick or a small greek yogurt with fruit.

Purchase pure cocoa powder -- not drinking chocolate.,
Stick the kettle on.,
Pour yourself a cup of cocoa every time you have a food craving.,
Ensure you get your vitamins and minerals.",How to Lose Weight by Drinking Cocoa," Drinking chocolate is cocoa powder mixed with vast quantities of sugar, and it won't help you lose any significant amount of weight. You can find cocoa powder in the baking section of your local supermarket. If you're in Britain or Australia, purchase Cadbury Bourneville Cocoa. It has a soothing, mildly bitter flavour. If you're in the United States, Nestle or Hersheys.;
, Pour a level tablespoon of cocoa powder into a cup. Fill the cup with hot water, stir the cocoa with the tablespoon and give it a few minutes to cool, then drink it. Do NOT add sugar or milk, as these will reduce the appetite suppressant effect. The cocoa will taste bitter, but not unpleasant. You will find your appetite for food is immediately reduced.

, This is ""cocoa fasting."" The cocoa powder itself contains a reasonable amount of high quality protein, and because its caffeine content is lower than coffee or tea, you can safely consume about four ounces/125 grams of cocoa powder a day.

, If you're doing the full fast, then take vitamin pills. If you're just trying to reduce your food intake without drastic measures, then try having cocoa in between meals, before and after meals to reduce the amount of food you eat. Make sure you drink a lot of water, and eat plenty of fresh fruit.

Perform cardio exercises.,
Perform strength training exercises.,
Exercise with a partner.",How to Lose Weight With PCOS2," Some of the hormonal and chemical changes that occur with PCOS can make weight loss frustrating. Increasing physical activity can help increase your metabolism and body's ability to burn calories.


Adding a minimum of 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity aerobic or cardiovascular exercise is a good goal and will support your weight loss efforts. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio weekly.If you're able, increase the amount of time you can spend engaging in cardiovascular activity. As you participate in more activity, you'll see continued health benefits.Increase exercise gradually, beginning with a low-impact exercise, such as walking. As your fitness levels improve you can increase your intensity or time of the exercise. Advancing slowly is safe and may help prevent injury.Try various aerobic activities until you find an exercise you enjoy. You will be more likely to maintain an exercise routine that you find pleasurable.
Cardiovascular exercises can include: walking, jogging/running, biking, dancing, inline skating, hiking and swimming.

, Strength training exercises should be done for about 25 minutes at least 2 days a week for minimum health benefits.Increasing muscle mass helps increase your metabolism which can help fight stubborn weight in patients with PCOS.


A strong positive relationship has been shown between weight training and improved insulin response and reducing other symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome.Strength training exercises may include weight training, Pilates, or weight lifting classes.

, Studies have shown that working out with a friend can help you to stay motivated and stick to your routine.Hitting the gym with a friend can also help pass the time and keep you from getting bored.
If you can't find a friend or family member to head to the gym with you, try taking group exercise classes. You'll enjoy the company of multiple other gym-goers. If you keep going to the same classes, you might notice the same people showing up and can meet new friends!

Write down your goals.,
Purchase a journal.,
Reward yourself.,
Tell someone about your goals.",How to Lose Weight With PCOS3," Writing down specific and realistic goals is a great way to stay motivated and keep on track. It's also a great visual to see your progress!


Come up with smaller goals that will help you reach your larger long-term goal. This may make the process seem less overwhelming than contemplating a large weight-loss goal.
Purchase a scale or other items you need to help monitor and track your goals.
Make a chart or record where you can record your progress - how much weight you've lost or how many days you've stayed true to your eating plan.

, Journals are a great way to de-stress, vent and track your progress. You can take notes about your food choices, how much weight you've lost and any struggles you've been facing.This is also a good place to journal about living with PCOS, the frustrations it brings and how it affects your weight or mood.


Don't feel pressured to journal everyday. But it's a good idea to jot down your weight every time you get on the scale so you can see your progress.
Buy a journal that's pretty and attractive. This can help make it more fun and enjoyable to open up your journal and write.
Don't feel the need to write pages and pages. If you only have a few words to say, thats OK!

, After you meet one of your goals, reward yourself! Small fun rewards can help motivate you and encourage to keep on going toward your end goal.Do not reward yourself with food. Treats or dinners out can force you off your healthy eating path and may even cause some weight gain.Choose rewards that you'd truly enjoy or are something you really want. Maybe you buy that new pair of shoes or a new shirt.
Try rewarding yourself with activities that keep you active. For example scheduling a kayaking lesson or playing a round of golf at your favorite course.
Other good rewards are activities that are calming and de-stressing. You might try scheduling a massage or getting a manicure and pedicure.

, Being accountable for your goals can help make sure you stay on track - especially when you know someone else is paying attention.


Tell a friend, family member or your doctor about your weight loss and diet goals. Ask to do a weekly check-in to help monitor your progress.
Stay accountable with yourself too. Getting on the scale regularly, keeping up-to-date with your food journal or watching your insulin levels are great ways to stay accountable as you reach your goals.

Talk to your doctor.,
Consult with a registered dietitian.,
Purchase educational resources about PCOS.,
Take all prescribed medications.,
Build a support group.",How to Lose Weight With PCOS4," Your primary care or your OB/Gyn will most likely be the person who gave you the diagnosis and is one of the best sources of information. Schedule an appointment to review your medical history, current health conditions and ask questions about PCOS.


Ask for an overall assessment of your health and an estimate of the amount of weight you need to lose and how that may affect your diagnosis.
Also ask about any medications, dietary supplements or lifestyle changes that your doctor recommends to help you manage your condition.
Heredity is the major indicator of risk: the daughters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome have a 50 percent chance of developing the syndrome. In addition, a family history of diabetes also increases your risk.Weight gain, impaired fertility, increased facial hair and depression are among the symptoms experienced by women with PCOS., Some dietitians are experienced with PCOS and weight loss.


There is a strong correlation exists between polycystic ovary syndrome and increased insulin resistance.A dietitian will be able to provide you with a specific meal plan or list of foods that can help manage insulin resistance.
Ask your dietitian for a weight loss meal plan, any foods that you should eat more of or stay away from and any other educational resources about PCOS and diet.

, One of the first steps after being diagnosed with PCOS is educating yourself about the condition as best you can. This will help you have a more active role in your health.

Weigh yourself every two weeks to ensure you are losing weight.",How to Lose Weight with Diabetes," Making changes to your diet when you have diabetes can be overwhelming. To get help as you make the necessary changes, meet with a diabetes educator. This will help to ensure that you have a chance to ask questions about how to alter your diet for weight loss when you have diabetes.;
, One of the best ways to ensure you are eating healthy meals is to keep your food to as close to its original or natural form as you can. This means you should try to cook every meal from scratch, using fresh, organic ingredients. Organic foods have limited amounts of chemicals, which means you will then have less chemicals in your body that might interact negatively with your diabetes.If you are short on time, you can use a crock pot to make rice and beans and vegetable stews. Leave the ingredients in the crock pot and let them cook all day when you are at work or on the go. You can then freeze any leftovers or make extra to freeze for an easy, healthy meal.

, Increase the amount of vegetables in your diet to lose weight and stay healthy. Try a variety of vegetables and try to go for colorful vegetables, preferably fresh vegetables that are in season.You should also prepare vegetables in healthy ways, including steaming or roasting vegetables. You can also saute them in olive oil on medium heat or stir fry them in a healthy oil like canola oil or sesame oil.
Grilling vegetables on a barbeque is also a good healthy option. Try to lightly grill your vegetables, as too much of a char on food can be unhealthy for you.

, Herbs and spices can help you add a healthy taste or kick to your food, especially fresh vegetables. Herbs can also help you get over your sugar cravings, which will ensure you are not overdoing it on the sugar.You can add herbs like basil, parsley, cilantro, ginger, garlic, and rosemary to your meals. You can also add spices like cinnamon, fenugreek and cayenne pepper to your foods for more flavor.

, Complex carbohydrates are made up of individual sugar molecules that are strung together in branched chains. In contrast, simple carbohydrates are often found in processed and prepackaged foods in the form of added sugar like glucose, sucrose, and fructose. Having 90-95% of your carbohydrates as complex carbohydrates can help to control your diabetes and help you lose weight.Complex carbohydrates include whole, unprocessed foods like whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and fresh vegetables. You should try to increase your consumption of these carbohydrates and reduce your consumption of simple carbohydrates.

, Fatty fish like salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids and are also anti-inflammatory. Look for wild-caught fish, as they are usually healthier for you.You can then prepare fatty fish by baking it in the oven or cooking the fish at medium heat in a skillet.

, Ground flaxseed is an excellent source of fiber. Fiber is a good addition to your diet to keep your body healthy and your organs functioning properly. You should include one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at the end of every meal.You can use a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseed or buy pre-ground flaxseed at your local health food store. You should store pre-frozen ground seeds in your freezer so the healthy oils in the flaxseed prevent it from turning rancid.

, You should try to limit your portion sizes so you are not overeating at every meal. Try to have a fist sized portion of healthy protein, like fish, along with a fist sized portion of fresh or cooked vegetables, like a salad or sauteed kale. You should also have a fist sized portion of whole grains, such as quinoa or brown rice, to make a complete plate.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates, such as beans or whole grains, at lunch. You should try to maintain the same portion sizes for all three meals so you do not overeat.

, Stay hydrated, especially when you are doing exercise, by drinking lots of water throughout the day. You should try to consume one to two liters of water a day or six to eight 8 ounce glasses of water a day., It is important for diabetics to eat at set times throughout the day. This will help to regulate blood sugar levels and weight.For example, you may eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner so that they are spaced 5 hours apart, and then have a snack in between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner.

, A diabetes diagnosis does not mean you cannot eat any sugars at all. Instead, you should try to control the amount of sugar you consume. For example, the sugars in fruit are combined with fiber, which means it will take more time for your body to absorb the sugars in the fruit and will not lead to a sudden spike in your blood sugar levels. But the sugars in cake and baked goods are processed, meaning they can lead to a spike in your blood sugar levels.Be mindful of the types of sugars you consume and monitor your blood sugar levels. Avoid processed foods that contain sugars, as they can cause a sugar spike and lead to weight gain.
You should get in the habit of checking food labels for any sugars listed in the ingredients. Note any added sugars and avoid foods that are high in added sugars.
Packaged foods and fast foods are usually high in sugar so avoid them. You should also be wary of low-fat foods, such as low-fat yogurt. Often, the fat content is replaced with sugar in low-fat or fat-free products, especially if they are prepackaged.
Avoid or limit alcohol as well. Alcohol contains sugar and it can also interfere with your diabetes medications and insulin. Adding sugary mixers can add even more carbs and calories. If you do drink, drink moderately and only use calorie free mixers., White foods are often full of additives, preservatives, and added sugar. You should try to cut them out of your diet completely and replace them with healthy alternatives, such as whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice. You should also replace sugary cereals with oatmeal or granola with no added sugars.You should avoid baked goods, such as cakes and pastries, especially those made with white flour. These items are often high in fat and sugar.

, Though a little red meat at dinner every few weeks will not be detrimental to your weight or your diabetes, you should avoid eating high amounts of red meat every week. If you do eat red meat, have non-GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) beef or pork and choose lean cuts. For the majority of your diet, you should go for healthy protein options like fish, shellfish, organic chicken and turkey, and eggs.You should avoid processed meats, such as cold cuts, chicken fingers, sausages, etc. These meats contain additives, preservatives, and added salt.

, Make sure that you talk with your healthcare provider before you start an exercise routine. Your healthcare provider may want you to start out slowly, such as by just walking. You may also need to take special precautions if you have type 1 diabetes, such as by monitoring your pre and post workout blood glucose levels and using snacks to help regulate them., It can be difficult to jump right into getting fit and doing exercise, especially if you are not usually into physical activity. Start by setting reasonable exercise goals for yourself so you feel set up to succeed and not overwhelmed. You can then steadily increase your physical activity over time, which can lead to better weight loss and a higher likelihood of keeping the weight off.You can start by setting a goal of going for a 30 minute walk every day or jogging for 30 minutes on the treadmill. Over the period of a month, you can then add on basic exercises that you can do at home or at the gym, such as doing sit ups and push ups or using light free weights.
You may also set a weight goal, where you aim to lose a certain amount of weight by a certain time. Set a reasonable goal, perhaps five pounds a month, and then increase your weight goal as you continue to exercise.

, Motivate yourself to work out by going for physical activities you enjoy doing and do not loathe with a passion. This will ensure you stick to the physical activity and are motivated to get better at the activity. Doing a physical activity you enjoy can actually help to relieve other issues in your life, such as stress or anxiety.Try to choose a physical activity that includes aerobics, strength training, and stretching. You can also add on these elements to a simple exercise like walking. Make sure you stretch for five to ten minutes before you start walking. Then, walk four blocks with no extra weights. After two weeks, increase the distance to six blocks with no extra weights. After two more weeks, you can continue to walk six blocks and carry five pound weights as you walk. Then, after one month, add on ankle weights and walk eight blocks. Always stretch after your walk to prevent injury.
Another option is to take a skill you are good at or enjoy and turn it into a way to exercise. For example, maybe you enjoy dancing and want to use dancing as a way to get fit. You may buy dance exercise videos and do them at home or join a hip hop dance class where you can have fun dancing and burn calories.

, You can also kick start your fitness plan by joining a fitness club near your home or your office. Schedule in work out time so you go to the fitness club and use the facility at least three to four times a week. You may use the workout machines at the club, play a sport with other club members, or do a fitness class at the club. Use all of the services at the club to your advantage and integrate them into your weekly workout routine.


One way to motivate yourself to work out is to do an exercise plan with a friend or sign up for a weekly fitness class with a friend. You can motivate each other to show up and workout.

, A personal trainer can be a good way to get into fitness and learn how to do it safely and properly. Your local fitness club may offer a personal trainer option or you may seek out a personal trainer on your own.Be sure to tell the personal trainer that you have diabetes.
Make sure the personal trainer is certified by a professional trainer group such as the National Strength and Conditioning Association or the American College of Sports Medicine.

, Avoid weighing yourself every day, as it will take time for your body to shed weight.


You may not see a noticeable difference in the mirror or on the scale until two-three weeks into your fitness plan. In fact, you may initially gain some weight as you gain muscle mass. Wait at least two weeks into your health plan to weigh yourself and make sure you are maintaining a healthy diet as well as working out regularly. You should be pleased by the results on the scale.

Keep a food journal.,
Burn more calories than you eat.,
Make a meal plan, and stick to it.,
Drink more water.",How to Lose Weight as a Young Adult1," According to research, people who keep food journals lose an average of six pounds more than people who don't keep a record of what they eat.Make yourself write it all down, even the little snacks. You can use a diet-tracking app on your smartphone, which may be more convenient.


Figure out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight. The more aware you are of the calories in the food you eat, the more easily you'll be able to eat the right amount. Take your food journal and look up each item individually. Keep a running tally and add up your calorie total for the day. A commonly mentioned American average is 2,000 calories per day, but everyone has different needs.
Be thorough. Write it all down, including beverages, condiments, and a description of how the food was prepared. Don't pretend you didn't have that extra scoop of ice cream after dinner. If it goes into your stomach, it goes into the journal.
Be honest. Record your portion sizes in your food diary. Don't eat too little or too much — keep track. Also, read the ingredients list so that you can be accurate about serving sizes. May diet-tracking apps allow you to scan barcodes or look up foods from a large database that will tell you the number of calories per serving.
Be consistent. Carry your food journal everywhere that you go.
Analyze your food journal.Find out when you eat most, and then, more importantly, where you're getting your excess calories.;
, The only surefire way to lose weight is to eat less than you burn over the course of a day. Sounds simple, but it takes work and consistency. That means paying attention to diet and exercising. If you want to lose weight and stay healthy, you need to start exercising. Aim for at least half an hour of exercise two to three times a week.


Ask a registered dietitian, your doctor, or physical education teacher about healthy, daily recommended calories for your age and body-type, before making big reductions to your caloric intake.
Track your energy-output in calories each day. Pedometers, or other weight-loss tracking devices and apps make this easier. This will help you account for how many calories you expend.
Over-estimate calories, underestimate activity. Recent studies estimate that we tend to eat slightly more than we're able to keep track of in a day. Keep this in mind, and it may help you to account for discrepancies.
Set mini-goals. Instead of thinking that you need to cut five hundred calories, try one to two hundred at first.

, Decide what you're going to eat this week before you're standing at the fridge and trying to figure it out on the fly. Buy the right healthy ingredients to eat the way you want to eat, and plan it out by the calorie. There are many online sites that offer healthy recipes to help you lose weight.


Be realistic. If you like to eat out a lot, don't try to totally eliminate eating out. Instead, plan on eating home-cooked meals five or six days a week.
Try to avoid eating late in the evening. Pick a time and be strict about not eating after that time.
Cut down on snacking. If you can't, choose healthy snacks. Fresh vegetables with guacamole, unsalted nuts, air-popped popcorn that is unsalted and not buttered, or fruit make great weight-loss snacks.
Treat yourself sometimes. Promise yourself that if you can follow this for six weeks and exercise (if that is one of your goals), you will treat yourself to a restaurant meal one day of the week.

, Water has the double effect of both hydrating your body and filling your stomach with a certain volume of a liquid that has zero calories. Although there is no exact amount of water each person should drink, as every person will have differing water requirements,recommended volumes range from eight to 15 cups of water per day.


Water can help you feel full, eliminating false hunger.Drinking water half an hour before meals can reduce the amount of calories you end up consuming.
Research shows that people on a weight-loss program who drank an increased amount of water lost weight when compared to those on the weight-loss program alone.Carry a water bottle with you.

, Get rid of the temptation and you won’t be able to snack on unhealthy, caloric foods. Make healthy snacks, such as non-fat yogurt, berries, unsalted almonds, carrot sticks and celery sticks available every day.

, Serve the portions according to the recipe directions in the kitchen, instead of placing the large containers on the table. Trade smaller portions of your favorite foods.


If possible, pre-pack snacks into 100 to 200 calorie portion sizes. If you need to reach for chips, at least it will be a limited amount.
Save the remaining food for leftovers. Your food bill may be reduced as you remove the temptation to eat too much.

Bring your own lunch.,
Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Eat more whole grains and cut simple carbohydrates.,
Choose fats that are better for your body.,
Choose lean proteins instead of fatty ones.,
Cut the salt from your diet.,
Eat at home.,
Make sure that you don't get hungry.,
Don't skip meals.,
Be sure to eat breakfast.",How to Lose Weight as a Young Adult2," In many cases, cafeteria lunches might not always be the healthiest, or the most lean. In order to make sure your cafeteria food isn't inhibiting your weight loss, bring your own lunch.


Pack a simple, brown-bag lunch.
Get a nice lunchbox and thermos to keep food hot.
Mix it up with a bento box.
If you have to use the cafeteria, go for the salad instead of the pizza. If you don't have this option, try to limit your portion sizes.

, Fruit helps to satisfy your sweet tooth, thanks to its natural sugars. Fresh vegetables help you fill up more quickly. Fruits and vegetables contain fiber to help you feel full longer.Try some of these tips to introduce more fruit and vegetables into your diet:


Eat what's in season, and eat fruit and vegetables for snacks, or for dessert. When you eat apples in the fall, for instance, or cherries in late summer, it might as well be an indulgent dessert. Cut up celery, carrots, peppers, broccoli or cauliflower and dip them in a light salad dressing or hummus.
Eat vegetables as a main dish. For example, make a stir-fry or a hearty salad and add just a few ounces of cooked chicken, salmon, or almonds.
Snack on fruit or vegetables between meals in order to control your hunger.

, Whole wheat bread, oatmeal, whole wheat pasta, sweet potato, and brown rice are all excellent sources of energy and nutrition. Combined with the right proteins and vegetables, whole grains are perfect all-around nutrition.Simple carbohydrates include white bread, processed flour, and white sugar. This gives you energy quickly, but then comes with a crash. It gets transferred into fat very quickly.
Substitute whole wheat flour or oat flour in baked goods. You might need to add additional leavening ingredients. Put barley in your soup instead of rice, or try a pilaf with barley, wild rice, or brown rice.
Avoid processed foods, like white bread, semolina pasta or crackers, or processed sweets like candy bars, sugary beverages, and dessert snacks., Such fats as those from nuts and olives can help you to feel full longer. These unsaturated fats have many health benefits and, in moderation, can help you to lose weight. Look for these on labels: ""unsaturated fats,"" ""monounsaturated fats,"" or ""polyunsaturated fats."" These are the good fats.


Avoid saturated fats, as they can increase your desire to eat more and cause negative effects on your body, especially your cholesterol and your heart.Many junk food items are high in these saturated fats, and they contribute to a vicious cycle of poor eating habits.
Watch out for vegetable dips and salad dressings (especially creamy, mayonnaise-based dips such as ranch), as these can be very high in fat.
Avoid fast food and drinks with a lot of cream, which tend to both be very high in unhealthy fats.

, Protein is important for organ function, as well as building muscle if you plan on working out. There are a variety of sources for protein, but the drawback is that protein can sometimes contain a lot of unhealthy fats.


Select lean cuts of beef, or extra-lean ground beef, when you're eating red meat.
If you like chicken, remove the skin.Skip the fatty deli meats, like bologna and salami. Choose lean turkey or roast beef as a replacement.
Vegetarians can get plenty of protein from soy, nuts, beans and seeds. Lentils, legumes, and beans are excellent sources of fiber and protein as well.
Eat low-fat dairy for a source of protein, including low-fat cheeses and milk and nonfat yogurt. , Eating more sodium causes your body to retain water, which can cause you to feel bloated and gain more weight. The good news is that you'll sweat that weight out very quickly, so an easy way of cutting some pounds is to eat less sodium in your diet.


Instead of salt, try spicing your meals with chili flakes, fresh salsa, or cajun spices and seasonings.
Some people claim that unsalted foods will taste much saltier eventually, if you cut salt out for a while and let your taste-buds re-acclimate.
Watch out for foods containing a lot of cheese, as they can be very salty.

, Going out to eat makes it too easy to cheat. Food sold at restaurants is commonly much higher in fat, sodium, and other weight-loss killers. The portions are also often much larger than what you might usually eat at home. Instead of heading out, try to make your own meals.


Eat dinner with your parents. Some research shows that children who do not eat dinner with their parents at least twice a week were 40% more likely to be overweight.Don't eat while you do other things. Watching television or movies, reading, playing video games, or studying while you eat often causes people to eat much more food than they normally would. So, don't buy that salty, buttery popcorn if you go out to see a movie; you might eat too much.

, By eating small portions throughout the day at regular intervals, you can keep hunger at bay. Between your meals, eat a 150-calorie snack to stave off hunger and keep you from overeating later. Be sure that you don't eat a fattening snack such as sweets or chips. When you're hungry, your body conserves calories and slows down your metabolic processes.Research suggests that increasing meal frequency might not help increase your metabolism., Lots of people think skipping a meal will help to lose weight; however, when you skip meals, your body stops breaking down fat and starts breaking down muscle tissue. So, you should be wary of diets that involve meal-skipping.Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than other tissues, so you're actually working against your goals.

, This is the most important meal of the day. Breakfast is not only important to help give you the energy to take on the morning, it can also be a vital part of weight-loss.


Breakfasts that are high in protein were not only observed to increase satiety in the morning, they also helped people to feel more full in the evening. Try to eat at least 35 grams of protein with breakfast, in order to help you feel more full throughout the day.Eat healthy cereal for breakfast. One recent study revealed that people who eat cereal for breakfast each day have a much easier time losing weight than people who eat other types of breakfast. Start your day right with a high-fiber, nutrient rich natural cereal, or oatmeal.Switch to skim milk. Each lower-fat step you take down, you're losing 20% of the calories. Switching to a low-fat version of milk is an excellent way to cut down on the calories you're taking in, without having to sacrifice nutritional benefits.

Take an aerobics class.,
Try strength training.,
Play a sport.",How to Lose Weight as a Young Adult3," Walking around your neighborhood costs nothing and is a great way to start moving. This can help you to burn more energy than you take in. You can also try other low-impact exercises like swimming, riding a bike or slow running. If you have a dog, volunteer to be the one to walk her; walking a dog is a great way to ensure regular exercise.


Buy a pedometer. Attach the pedometer to your belt and try to reach specific goals you set for yourself.
Take the scenic route. Go a little bit out of your way as often as you can, and this can add up to a lot of extra walking. If you normally take a left on one street, go right instead, in order to walk a couple extra blocks.
Try not to drive when you can.

, D.D.R. (Dance Dance Revolution), WiiFit, and some new virtual reality games can get you moving around quite a lot. If you're looking for a fun way to get some exercise, think about getting an action-oriented video game. They can make you forget that you're exercising.

Kickboxing
Ballet
Cross-country
Yoga
Martial arts
Cross-fit
Zumba

, Exercising large muscle groups burns more calories, increases your metabolism, and can help you to lose weight, especially body fat. As your body increases its muscle mass, it requires more energy to keep those bigger muscles going. This minor but constant increase in energy output can lead to weight-loss over time.


Make sure you build up to higher weights, and work with a coach, trainer or physical therapist to get started safely.
Do squats with a dumbbell press, to work your lower body and upper body at the same time.
Perform resistance exercises while sitting or reclining on an exercise ball. You'll strengthen your core while simultaneously working on other areas.
Rest at least one full day between strength training workouts so that your body can repair, and you do not over-train or injure yourself. Serious injuries resulting from exercise can remain with you for life.

, If you're not into the idea of exercise for the sake of exercise, try finding a fun activity that you enjoy, which has the added benefit of getting you moving. Find an intramural league in your town, or just get together with some friends to play a pick-up game every now and then.


If you don't like competitive sports, try doing something that you can do by yourself. Swim, or play golf, or go hiking instead of playing a game with a ball and a net.
Get a bicycle if you want to find a great way to get around and exercise at the same time. Don't spend all that time sitting down in your car when you could be burning calories.

The doctor will let you know if they’re safe for you. Your doctor may suggest meeting with a dietitian and fitness professional to help you find the best and safest ways for you to lose weight.
Be aware that loneliness and depression, which are emotional disabilities that can also affect the physically disabled, can affect your appetite and how you eat. If you are experiencing either condition, ask your doctor about how best to treat the condition and lose weight.;
, You may need to adjust your diet to lose weight and stay healthy because of slowed metabolism, which can occur when you have a disability. Even if you don’t have special dietary needs, a registered dietitian can help you formulate a plan to best lose weight and get the nutrients you need to maintain your wellbeing.Let your dietitian know that you’d like to lose weight and stay healthy. Make sure to tell the dietitian about your normal diet and ask how you can gradually make changes to lose weight.
Ask your doctor or local hospital to suggest a local registered dietitian. You can also find one on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetic’s website at http://www.eatright.org/find-an-expert.

, Physical activity is an excellent way to boost weight loss. Depending on what type of disability you have, you may be limited in what type of movement you can do; however, even small movements may help you lose weight. Meeting with a physical therapist or certified trainer can help you figure out what types of movement and activity are feasible for you and can help you lose weight.Ask your doctor to suggest a physical therapist or certified inclusive fitness trainer, which is someone trained to work with people who have disabilities. You can also find a therapist or trainer by consulting the website of the American Physical Therapy Association or the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability.Give your physical therapist or trainer copies of your medical records and let the person know about your weight loss goals. The person may examine you and ask you questions to get a sense of what you are able to do—as well as things you might like to do to help you safely lose weight.
Before your appointment, make a list of activities in your life which might benefit from exercise (if you struggle to put on your socks or lift a kettle to make tea, for instance). This can help your trainer choose exercises to strengthen the muscles that will help you do these tasks.

, When trying to lose weight, diet and calorie intake is the most important factor, even more than exercise or activity. It’s important to eat three balanced and healthy meals every day. Getting enough nutrients is especially important to any person with a disability. Selecting whole, nutrient-rich foods can promote weight loss while maintaining and even boosting your health.Aim to lose 1 – 2 pounds every week by eating 500 – 1,000 fewer calories than your current calorie intake.Don’t eat less than 1,200 calories a day because this will keep you from losing weight (your body will enter ""starvation mode"" and cling to fat) and make you feel miserable., To stay healthy, you need to eat different foods from the five food groups. They are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Make different selections at each meal to reap the health benefits of a wide range of nutrients. Healthy foods also generally have a lot of fiber, which can keep you from eating too much., Whole fruits and vegetables are high in a broad range of nutrients that you need to stay healthy.Have at least 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 2 ½ cups of vegetables every day. These can help keep you full throughout the day and promote weight loss.Select whole fruits and vegetables like blackberries, raspberries, bananas, spinach, squash, and sweet potatoes. Vary your fruit and veggie choices at each meal so that you get the health benefits of different nutrients.
You can also drink one serving of 100% fruit or vegetable juice each day.

, Whole grains offer you fiber and other vital nutrients while keeping you full throughout the day. Choose whole wheat bread, pasta, oatmeal, cereal, or brown rice over things like white rice and bread.

Consider cutting back on your grains, as low-carb diets result in quicker weight loss. The vitamins, minerals and fiber can be replaced by whole fruits and vegetables.
Try different whole grains like amaranth, barley, buckwheat, bulgur, quinoa, and spelt.

, Dairy products can help keep your bones strong and build muscle, both of which may be especially important if you have a disability. Dairy can also help you lose weight. Drinking milk and eating foods such as reduced-fat cheese and yogurt can help you get your 3 cups of dairy every day., Junk food is enemy #1 for any person trying to lose weight. It is often high in fat and calories and has little to no nutritional value, which can undo any other steps you’ve taken to lose weight.Stay away from refined, sugary carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, rice, and baked goods. Avoiding these foods altogether or replacing them with healthy, whole grain alternatives can help you lose weight.Limit or get rid of fatty foods such as French fries or burgers.

, If you have certain unhealthy foods you like, consider swapping them for healthy alternatives. This can help you cut calories while still enjoying your favorite foods. For example, eat brown rice instead of white rice. Add more vegetables to your plate than meat or pasta. Try air-popped popcorn instead of eating potato chips. If you’re looking for crunch, try carrots or cut veggies.


Give yourself one day each week to cheat. This can curb cravings and minimize the risk of overindulgence., One way to track calories and make sure you’re getting enough nutrients is to write a meal plan. This can not only ensure you’re eating healthy and getting enough nutrients, but also may save you time and effort at the grocery store.

Include three meals and two snacks in your daily plan. Make different food choices at each meal. For example, have cottage cheese with fresh berries, oatmeal, and coffee with skim milk for breakfast. Try a salad with different vegetables, grilled chicken, and homemade vinaigrette for lunch. Dip cut vegetables in hummus for a snack. Have a lean steak, small salad, and steamed mixed vegetables for dinner. If you want dessert, have a sugar-free popsicle or some apple slices sprinkled with cinnamon.
Include any restaurant meals in your plan. See what online tools restaurants offer or call ahead to a restaurant see what healthy choices are on the menu. Select a couple of healthy dishes and write these on your plan. Make sure to stay away from dishes in heavy sauces as well as buffets and bread baskets.

, It’s important to your wellbeing to drink enough water every day. This can also help you lose weight. Drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of liquid every day if you are a man and 9 cups (2.2 liters) if you are a woman. You will need to drink more if you are active.Stay away from high-calorie beverages like soda, juice cocktails, specialty coffees, and alcohol. Go for non-calorie choices such as diet soda, tea, plain coffee, or sparkling water.

, Sometimes people eat to cope with feelings of stress, anxiety, fear, depression, boredom, sadness, or loneliness.It might help to remind yourself that eating, while it can be pleasurable, is really an important function to keep us healthy and alive. Think of eating in terms of sustenance to keep the ""machine"" of your body running and less as an event or source of comfort or pleasure. Finding pleasure in other endeavors is important for everyone, with or without disabilities.

If you find that emotional eating is an issue for you, it may help to speak with a counselor or therapist to help change your attitudes about food.
Making and sticking to a meal schedule can help you avoid emotional eating.

, No matter what type of activity you decide to do to help you lose weight, remember that you can always make modifications to accommodate your disability. Ask a fitness professional for modifications or consider alternatives to other activities you do. For example, you could try running or walking in a pool with a floatation belt or using resistance bands in your wheelchair., Activity and healthy diet can help you lose weight and promote your health. Healthy and realistic weight loss is about 1 – 2 pounds per week.Getting some type of activity five to six days a week can help you lose weight and boost your health. Remember that activity can also energize you and help improve your mood.Talk to your doctor about how much physical activity is feasible for you each week. You might try to get ½ hour every day and break it up into manageable pieces. For example, try three 10-minute workouts. Remember to start slowly and gradually increase your activity level as you are able.
Try to make it part of your regular routine. For instance, do 10 minutes upon waking and 10 minutes in the evening, or 10 minutes after meals. Try listening to faster paced music or even just getting outside in the fresh air. Exercise should become habit to stay well and keep the weight off.
Choose activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy without pain. It may take a little trial and error to find what works and what you like. Consider activities such as walking, using a hand-bike, swimming, or light stretching.
Make sure to warm up, stretch, and cool down any time you do activity. Always listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain.

, Muscle mass can speed up your metabolism and burn calories. Strength training can also help people with disabilities perform regular tasks like transferring to and from a wheelchair as well as pushing, holding and carrying things. Add a few simple strength training exercises to your daily activity in order to lose weight and promote your wellbeing.


Consult a certified inclusive trainer before you start. This person can develop the best strength-training moves for your needs and abilities.
Consider trying regular yoga or Pilates. Both of these can stretch and strengthen your body while incorporating moves for your specific disability.

, It’s important for any person to give their body at least one full day of rest every week. You may want to take one or two if you are disabled. Rest can help build muscles and give them proper time to recover, especially if you are new to activity.

Give yourself a treat now and then.",How to Lose Weight as a Young Adult4," While doing these things alone won't necessarily make you lose weight, they can be helpful little tricks to keep you moving on the right path. Sometimes you just have to fool yourself into limiting your caloric intake.


Eat three fewer bites of each meal.
Put your knife and fork down between bites.
Use smaller plates, and fill your plate only once.
Wait to eat until you feel hungry, don't just snack when you're bored.
If you do occasionally eat foods like chips, take a small portion out and put them on a plate. Put the rest away and only eat the ones you put out.

, Learning to manage your cravings for a big slice of cake or a greasy hamburger is possible, with a little creativity.


Smell fresh fruit when you want a snack, instead of eating something.
""Close"" your kitchen between meals, especially in the evening after dinner.
Don't keep sugary or fattening snacks in the house.
Some studies show that the color blue is an appetite suppressant. Try getting a blue tablecloth, or blue dishware to eat on.

Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Cook with chili powder or peppers.,
Eat more fiber.,
Eat more lean protein.",How to Lose Weight and Help Accelerate the Metabolism1," Starting your day with a healthy meal sets an important tone for the rest of your day.Eating a breakfast low in sugar and refined grains while being high in protein may be the best way to increase your energy levels and boost metabolism. The following are good ideas for simple, healthy breakfasts:


2 scrambled eggs with ¼ cup of 1% cottage cheese
2 boiled eggs sliced with 2 pieces of whole-wheat toast
1 cup of plain nonfat Greek yogurt mixed with 1 cup of raspberries
1 cup of a fiber cereal with ¾ cup of fat-free milk;
, Adding chili powder to your food can improve your weight loss and metabolism. It contains compounds called capsicums that are shown to improve metabolism for a short period of time after eating.Studies have shown that eating just 5 grams of chili pepper can increase your metabolism for up to 30 minutes.Try adding chili powder to meat and vegetables to get this important compound.

, Include at least 30 grams of fiber in your diet every day to help you lose weight. Fiber has also been shown to help improve your blood pressure and blood sugar.Try to get your fiber from food, rather than supplements. Good sources of fiber include:


Cereals: oatmeals, whole-grains, brown rice, quinoa
Vegetables: spinach, broccoli, carrots, green beans
Legumes: beans (kidney, lima, chickpeas)
Fruits: dried fruit (prunes, raisins), pears, apples, banana
Nuts and seeds: peanuts, popcorn, almonds

, Protein is an important nutrient needed for muscle growth, which will increase your metabolism. Metabolism increases when your body has a higher amount of lean muscle. To increase your lean muscle, exercise and diet are important. Try to eat a minimum of 0.8-1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.(One kilogram is equal to 2.2 lbs.) For example, a person who weighs 150 lbs weighs 68 kgs. (150/2.2) This person should eat a minimum of 54-82 grams of protein each day. (68 x 0.8 = 54) (68 x 1.2 = 82)Make sure that the protein you add to your diet comes from a lean protein source like chicken or turkey breast, low-fat dairy options, or egg whites.
Avoid protein that adds a high amount of saturated fat to your diet like fatty meats or high fat dairy options such as fatty steak, high-fat ground beef or turkey, whole milk, and cheese.

Keep your diet in check.,
Limit your intake of fat.,
Load up on fiber.",How to Lose Upper Thigh Weight1," Since there’s no easy way to spot reduce, burning total body fat will help you reduce the fat on your upper thighs. If you’re overweight, start by reducing your daily calorie intake by 250 to 500 calories per day.


Cutting 500 calories a day will result in losing one pound a week (3,500 calories is one pound). But remember: That's not including the calories you'll be burning with your increased workout regimen.;
, The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends that adults limit their total dietary fat to 20 to 35 percent of their daily calorie intake. Since one gram of fat equals nine calories, a 2,000 calorie diet should consist of 44 to 78 grams of fat per day.



The DASH eating plan (for lowering cholesterol) recommends a daily dietary fat intake of 27 percent of total calories (60 grams of fat per day for a 2,000 calorie diet). Try to include healthy (unsaturated) fats when possible while limiting saturated fats. Foods that are high in unsaturated fat include vegetable oils, such as olive and canola oils, nuts, seeds, and avocados.

, Most Americans don’t consume the recommended 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. High-fiber foods are beneficial for weight loss because they are typically low in fat and calories and high in nutrients (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes). Fiber also helps you feel more full and satisfied, for longer periods of time. Getting plenty of fiber in your diet will help you lose weight (and body fat) at a faster pace.


High-fiber foods generally require more chewing time, which gives your body time to register when you're no longer hungry, so you're less likely to overeat. And high-fiber diets also tend to be less ""energy dense,"" which means they have fewer calories for the same volume of food."

Calculate your metabolic rate.,
Calculate and reduce your calorie intake.,
Eat regular meals.,
Drink more coffee.,
Avoid late-night snacking.,
Do strength training.,
Do cardio exercise.",How to Lose Weight and Help Accelerate the Metabolism2," Our bodies burn a certain number of calories each day in order to properly function. This amount of calories burned at rest is termed Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). To find out your BMR, you can use an online calculator which will ask for your ask, gender, height, weight, and activity level. The calculator will show you the number of calories you burn based on a low, light, moderate, high, or very high activity level. This will show you how many calories your body burns a day.BMR does not take into account the amount of calories you burn through activity such as exercising or just walking around each day. To account for these, you need to use an activity factor. To do this, multiply your BMR by:

1.2 if you are inactive
1.375 if you are lightly active (you exercise once or twice a week)
1.55 if you are moderately active (you exercise three to five days out of the week)
1.725 if you are very active (you exercise six to seven days a week or do intense sports)
1.9 if you are extra active (you have a physically demanding job and/or extreme sports activity), If you want to lose weight, you first need to reduce the amount of calories you eat each day. Use the number you calculated from your Basal Metabolic Rate with the activity factor and subtract 500 calories. Eat this amount of calories each day and you will lose about 1 pound each week.To make it easier to track your calories, use an online calorie tracker such as MyFitnessPal,FitClick,or the USDA Food Tracker.These online trackers have large databases to help you find out the calorie information on the foods that you eat.

, Skipping meals can raise your blood sugar and delay insulin responses.Do not skip any meals throughout the day. Instead, eat every 3 to 4 hours to help boost your metabolism. Eating more frequently throughout the day can lower your risk for obesity.Remember to eat breakfast. It wakes up your metabolism after fasting overnight. Studies have found that those who skip breakfast on average weigh more, have diminished mental function, and do not get as many essential vitamins and minerals., Drink 1 to 2 cups of coffee a day to improve your energy levels. Just make sure not to add lots of cream or sugar, which could cause you to gain weight. Instead, drink black coffee, which contains healthy antioxidants. The caffeine in coffee has been shown to increase metabolism after drinking by a small amount.It also increases fat oxidation to help you lose weight.If you need to sweeten your coffee, consider using a natural sweetener like Stevia. You can also add almond or low fat milk in place of cream.

, Do not eat past 8pm at night. Although there is no research that shows that late night snacking can slow your metabolism, it can cause you to gain weight because you're adding calories by overeating. Preventing yourself from eating past 8pm every day will allow your body to get used to not eating at night and will cut out any added calories that you normally would eat.If you feel hungry at night, drink a large glass of water with the juice of half a fresh squeezed lemon. Eventually, your body will get used to not eating and you will no longer get hungry.

, Strength training will increase your muscle mass the most. Increased muscle mass will accelerate your metabolism. Strength training can be done using weights, resistance bands, or body weights. Try to focus on different muscle groups in order to increase muscle mass throughout the entire body. The following are some exercises that can be done to target different muscle groups:Chest: chest press machine, push-ups
Shoulders: overhead press, flies
Biceps: bicep curls
Triceps: tricep extensions
Back: lateral pull-down machine, bent over rows
Calves: calf raises (weighted or bodyweight)
Quads: leg extensions, squats
Abs: sit-ups, planks

, Cardio is also an important way to losing weight and maximizing fat-burning.Aim for 2 ½ hours of cardio exercise each week to help maximize weight loss. Below are some sample cardio exercises that can be done:


Briskly walking
Running
Swimming
Biking
Cardio Machines (stair climber, elliptical, treadmill)

Do squats.,
Do pliés.,
Do forward lunges.,
Do single-leg circles.,
Keep up the resistance training and cardio.",How to Lose Upper Thigh Weight2," They'll not only tone your thighs, but also your butt and hip area. To do a squat:


Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart, keeping an even balance. Turn your toes out slightly and place your arms at your sides with your palms facing inward. Keep your shoulders down.
Keeping your back straight, squat down like you're going to sit, shoulders moving toward your hips. Shift your weight onto your heels. Stabilize yourself with your abs.
Keep your knees in line with your feet -- resist the urge to move them forward. Bring your thighs parallel to floor and hold steady. If your heels are coming up, return to starting position. Exhale, push through your feet, and stand up straight.
For a variation to the squat, do a wall-sit (squatting against a wall and holding) or use an exercise ball., There's a reason that ballerinas are so fit! We can learn from them.


Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder-width apart and angle your toes outward.
Bring your arms out in front of you. They'll help you balance yourself and keep your back straight. Then, go down into a squatting position. Remember to align your knees with your toes!
Return slowly to your original position, keeping your hips tucked under your spine. Repeat these movements for about a minute., Lunging on all sides is the most beneficial -- your thighs need to be worked on all planes.


Stand up straight with your feet together, all the while engaging your abdominal muscles.
While keeping your back straight, lift your right foot in the air and find your balance. Once you do, slowly bring it forward and place it on the ground, heel first.
Straighten your left leg as you lower your right, maintaining weight on your front foot. Lower yourself until your right thigh and left calf are parallel to the floor and balance.
Return to your starting position, pushing off with the front leg, and switch sides. Repeat for about thirty seconds on each side, or for as long as you can manage., These are commonly found in Pilates -- a great toning workout.


Lie on the floor on top of a comfortable surface like a yoga or Pilates mat. Bring your arms to your side with your palms face down.
Bring your right foot straight up, pointing to the ceiling. Rotate your leg outward a little.
Keep your hips on the mat at all times. Then, inhale and move your entire leg in clockwise circles. Once you've done this five times, switch to counter-clockwise circles.
Repeat this set four times, alternating legs., Alright, so you've got the thigh exercises down, but since there's no such thing as spot reducing, you'll need to work out your entire body, too. Cardio burns the most fat, but a combination of cardio and resistance training will lead to ultimate calorie burn.For intense results, take up interval training. It amplifies the benefits of cardio, burning even more calories. You do a short burst of exercise as hard as you can, rest for a bit, and repeat. And your workout is done much quicker!"

Limit your sodium intake.,
Eat more potassium-rich foods.,
Eat adequate fiber daily.,
Eat foods that contain probiotics.,
Limit the amount carbs in your diet.,
Drink more water.,
Limit alcohol and caffeine.",How to Lose Water Weight1," This is one of the most important steps in reducing bloat because it has an immediate effect on the way that your kidneys control the water balance in your body.Too much salt may cause the body to retain water leading to bloating and swelling.







Avoid processed foods.
Most processed meats, prepackaged snacks, frozen meals, and canned foods are high in sodium.


Stop salting your meals
The American Heart Association recommends consuming less than 1500 mg of sodium each day, or about 1½ tsp (7 mL).Salting your food makes it easy to go over this limit.


Avoid no-sodium diets
Your body requires small amounts of sodium to function.;
, Potassium is an essential mineral in the diet that's responsible for fluid balance in the body. Low amounts of potassium (although rare) may cause unnecessary fluid retention.Focusing on potassium rich foods may help your body release excess water.








Fruits:
apricots, banana, cantaloupe, dates, kiwi, mango, oranges, papaya, avocado


Vegetables:
acorn squash, carrots, artichokes


Legumes:
dried beans, peas, lentils


, A low-fiber diet may cause constipation which can lead to bloating, abdominal distention and weight retention.Women should consume 25 g fiber daily and men should consume 38 g of fiber daily.Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables can help increase your fiber intake and reduce excess water weight by relieving bloating from constipation., Some foods contain probiotics naturally and may help reduce gas, bloating or abdominal distention. These good bacteria help regulate your GI system and may prevent or decrease side effects common with constipation.Keeping your GI system healthy and managing any constipation can help alleviate bloating, stomach cramps and abdominal distention.
Foods that contain probiotics include: yogurt, kefir, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sauerkraut and pickles.

If you dislike these foods you can also try taking a probiotic supplement daily.

, A low-carbohydrate diet may help you lose excess water weight quicker than a low calorie diet alone. Limiting the amount of carbohydrate rich foods (both refined and 100% whole grains) you eat can help you drop a few extra pounds of water weight fairly fast.


Limit these high-carb foods: bread, rice, pasta, crackers, tortillas, bagels, muffins, pastries, English muffins, quinoa, sweetened beverages and desserts. Both refined and complex carbs affect your body the same way.
When you eat carbohydrates, your body uses some as immediate energy and transforms the rest into glycogen — the body's storage form of carbohydrate. As your body stores glycogen, it also brings water with it.This can cause weight gain and fluid retention.
When you limit the amount of carbohydrates you consume, your body relies more heavily upon the glycogen stores in the body. When the glycogen is used for energy, water is also released, causing a small decrease in your weight., You may be retaining water because you haven't been drinking enough of it in the first place. Mild dehydration causes your body to hold onto water since there isn't adequate amounts being consumed.Drink at least 64 oz or about 8 glasses of water daily.This is just a general rule of thumb, but a good baseline to aim for. On days you're feeling more bloated or feel that you're retaining fluid, you may want to increase this amount.
Other beverages that may help reduce water retention include dandelion tea, green tea, and water with a squeeze of lemon.
Adequate hydration may also relieve any constipation you may be experiencing, as infrequent bowel movements are a common culprit of that bloated or puffy feeling.

, Although both alcohol and caffeine are natural diuretics, they may easily lead to low-grade dehydration. When the body is dehydrated it has the tendency to retain fluid until adequate hydration status is reached.Limit all caffeinated beverages including: coffee, black tea, and energy drinks.
Alcohol can worsen dehydration quickly. Even though it's safe for women to have one glass daily and men to have two glasses daily, it's wise to discontinue all alcohol while monitoring excess water weight."

Take vitamin and mineral supplements.,
Drink a glass of cranberry juice daily.,
Add in natural diuretics.,

Vitamins B5 and B6
red meat, brown rice, low-fat dairy.Magnesium
Nuts, legumes, whole grains, green vegetables, bananasCalcium
Low-fat dairy, leafy greens, almonds, Studies have shown this is a natural, very mild diuretic.Be careful, drinking too much fruit juice can mean a lot of extra sugar calories in your diet. Stick to no sugar added juice or 100% juice.


Consuming about 1 cup of 100% juice is acceptable. In general, this is 6–8 oz of juice.
You can also consider taking cranberry supplements.

, There are many naturally occurring herbs that may help you lose excess water; however, supplements are not regulated by the FDA and should be used with caution.


Try green tea, stinging nettle, dandelion, or corn silk supplements.

, Most pharmacies carry low-dose, over-the-counter water pills. These medications are designed to help decrease minor fluid retention and the symptoms that accompany it (bloating, puffiness or abdominal distention).


Read all package directions, warnings and suggested uses. Use only as directed.
Note that water pills are designed to alleviate minor fluid retention. Water pills are not designed for long-term use.


, Prior to taking any over-the-counter medications, supplements or herbs, talk to your doctor about their safety. Your doctor will be able to evaluate your health history to see if these items are safe and appropriate for you.


Some over-the-counter medications and supplements are known to interact with prescription medications or cause changes in certain diseases.

Exercise.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Track your cycle.,
Schedule a visit with your doctor.",How to Lose Water Weight3," Even though the last thing you may feel like doing is working out, even a short sweat session can help decrease bloating and rid your body of excess fluid.



Choose cardio or aerobic exercises to increase your heart rate and breathing pace, and cause yourself to sweat. Perspiration can help reduce fluid retention.Also, as you perform cardio and your muscles are contracting, fluid gets circulated more quickly throughout your body. This may help your body process excess fluid more quickly.Even if you don't feel like spending a lot of time working out or don't have enough time, try to fit in a shorter, more intense cardio session. Try to get the heart rate up to 70 – 80% of your maximum heart rate, even if only for a minute or two. This will help get everything circulating.

, Inadequate sleep or lack of sleep can cause your kidneys to retain more fluid.Making sure you hit the sack and sleep soundly will help minimize any fluid retention.


It's recommended to get at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.To help get a more restful sleep, turn off all lights, TVs, computers and phones before going to bed. It's also recommend to stop using these items about 30 minutes prior to your planned sleep time., In women, hormonal changes often cause bloating beginning seven to ten days prior to menstruation. Higher levels of estrogen and progesterone during that part of the cycle cause the body to retain fluid.Keeping track of your menstrual cycle will allow you to plan ahead to make adjustments in your diet to minimize water weight gain.


Nearly 90% of menopausal women will gain weight from a shift in hormones; however, some of this weight is just due to water retention and bloating from decreased progesterone levels. If you know you typically experience some mild water retention and bloating around the time of your cycle, you can starting modifying your diet and lifestyle to help minimize those side effects.
You may want to consider taking medications to help decrease these symptoms. Many PMS medications have a mild diuretic to help minimize bloating and fluid retention., Very often water retention is harmless and caused by dietary changes or lack of exercise; however, some forms of water retention are signs of serious health problems and should be addressed with your physician.


If you feel like your body is retaining large quantities of fluid or you're having other side effects, it may be a good idea to visit with your doctor.
Side effects of edema or more serious fluid retention include: shiny, tight skin, skin that retains a dimple after pressing on it, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or chest pain.

Reduce your salt intake.,
Eat potassium-rich foods.,
Increase fiber in your diet.,
Add coumarin-rich foods to your diet.,
Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily.,
Avoid high amounts of caffeine and alcohol.A diuretic is a substance that increases how much and how often you urinate, and caffeinated drinks and alcohol are major diuretics that can cause dehydration.,
Take vitamins A and C. These vitamins help to minimize fluid retention by improving the strength of your capillaries, the tiny ends of your blood vessels that regulate fluid levels in your tissues.Vitamin A and C supplements can be beneficial.",How to Lose Water Weight Fast1," Sodium, or salt, causes you to retain water and hold it in your tissues. Remove processed foods from your diet, which are more likely to contain high levels of sodium. This includes potato chips, canned foods, frozen foods, and fast food.Season your food with herbs and spices rather than table salt.


Avoid eating out. Restaurant food usually contains more sodium than a home-cooked meal.;
, Potassium helps to absorb and reduce sodium in your body.Add foods to your diet that contain a lot of potassium like sweet potatoes, beets, oranges, coconut water, apricots, figs, cantaloupe, raisins, and bananas.

, Experts recommend 25 to 35 grams of fiber daily, but many adults are only getting 10 to 15 grams.Fiber improves the efficiency of your digestive system, allowing you to shed both fluid and solid waste.Fresh fruits and vegetables are a main source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. You need both to have a healthy digestive system.


Replace refined carbohydrates with whole grains. Choose high fiber, whole grain breads and cereals instead of white bread. Make brown rice, quinoa, and other ancient grains to serve along with your protein and vegetables.
Introduce fiber into your diet in stages, since your digestive system may need time to adjust.

, Some sources suggest that this naturally-occurring compound can help you regulate fluid in the tissues.Limit your consumption of coumarin to small, healthy levels: Sprinkle cinnamon on your cereal or in your coffee, have a cup of chamomile tea in the morning or evening, and regularly add celery and parsley to your recipes.

, Make sure you are drinking at least 64 oz. (1.9L) of water each day. Although it may seem counter-intuitive to drink water when you are trying to lose water weight, increased water consumption can improve metabolism and the functions of your organs. Being properly hydrated will help to flush chemicals, sodium, and other causes of water retention out of your system.This is especially beneficial if your bloating is due to premenstrual syndrome (PMS). If your water retention is due to heart failure, kidney disease, or other medical conditions, speak with your doctor about how much water to drink every day.If you’re thirsting for something with a little more taste, try hot or iced herbal teas, or add lemon, lime, or cucumber slices to your water. Avoid sugary drinks, like soda, since your kidneys will need to process the sugar and it will reduce the benefits of the hydration.

, Although they can get rid of some water in the short term, they can dehydrate you and cause bloating in high or regular doses.However, natural diuretics like cranberry juice and cabbage can be beneficial in decreasing fluid retention.,


Oranges, chili peppers, red and green bell peppers, kale, broccoli, papaya, strawberries, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, pineapple, kiwi, and mango are good sources of vitamin C.Vitamin A shows up in sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, kale, swiss chard, winter squash, and the greens of mustard, collard, turnip and beets."

Cook together.",How to Lose Weight As a Couple," One of the first things you and your partner need to do is design a meal plan together. This is when you'll decide what you're eating, how often and choose recipes.


Studies have shown that more structured meal plans are more effective at helping people lose weight.Sit down together and write out a week's worth of meals. Make sure that both of you agree on what you're choosing — especially for the meals you're planning on eating together (like dinner).
Write out every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack meal that you will include over the next week. This can help give you structure and a blueprint of how to eat. Plus it can help you come up with your grocery list.;
, Another important task that both of you need to do is determine how much weight you need to lose. This will help both of you set your goals and pick a diet that can help you achieve this loss.


When you're trying to lose weight, you need to aim for a healthy weight for your gender, age and height. Use your BMI as a starting point to determine how much weight you want to lose.Use an online BMI calculator to calculate your BMI, which should tell you if you are underweight (BMI under 18.5), a healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 30), or obese (over 30).
You can also calculate your BMI yourself with these equations:
For English calculations, use BMI = ( Weight in Pounds / ( Height in inches x Height in inches ) ) x 703.
For metric calculations, use BMI = ( Weight in Kilograms / ( Height in Meters x Height in Meters ) )., One of the best parts about losing weight together as a couple is that you can set goals together, support each other, and see each other progress as you both lose weight and are successful.


When both of you begin setting your weight loss goals, make sure they're realistic for you. If you have a large amount of weight to lose or want to lose weight quickly, this might not be possible initially.For example, health professionals recommend only aiming to lose about 1 – 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg) per week. So if you need to lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg, aiming to lose that within three weeks is not realistic or safe.If you do have larger weight loss needs, considering setting multiple goals. Your first goal may be to lose 10 pounds (4.5 g) and then your second goal may be to lose the last 8 pounds (3.6 g).
Also set a goal ending point together. You might have different amounts of lose, but your goal ""check-in"" day is the same. You might want to lose 10 pounds (4.5 g) in two months and your partner might want to lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in that same time period.
Setting that goal point together can help both of you stay on track and push each other as you near your goal.

, A point where some dieters go awry with weight loss, is not staying accountable. However, when you have a partner to lose weight with, setting methods of accountability will help both of you stay successful overtime.


Measures of accountability are things you should do regularly, and usually for the rest of your life, to make sure you meet your weight loss goals and then keep the weight off long-term.Both of you should pick a day during the week where you both hop on the scale. Studies have shown that people who weigh in regularly are able to be more successful long-term.Consider keeping a food diary. This can help you stay accountable day to day. But if you're having trouble losing weight or are gaining a little bit, your partner can look over your food journal (or gently remind you) of times you've overeaten or snacked a little too often.
One trick is to save a pair of ""skinny"" jeans or pants. Pick out a pair for each other and keep these in your closet. Anytime you need a quick reminder pull those on.

, When you're trying to lose weight, alone or with a partner, portion sizes are a key part of making sure your diet helps support your desired weight loss. Both of you can help each other stick to proper portion sizes to help you lose weight.


If your portions are too big, even of more nutritious foods, it could still be too many calories for your body weight. Measuring portions regularly can help you stay on track.One great thing about losing weight with a partner is that you can measure out portions for each other. It's hard to stick to smaller portions and too easy to add a little bit too much to your plate.
However, if you have your partner measure your portions, they'll be able to give you the exact amount for you without being influenced by your thoughts. You should measure out the appropriate portion for your partner and vice versa.

, When both of you are coming up with your meal plan, you'll need to select protein sources to include in your meals. Protein is essential to weight loss, so both of you will need to focus on this nutrient in your diet.


Protein is not only an essential nutrient for your body, it's also important in the weight loss process. It helps support your lean muscle mass, metabolism and fuels your body through the day.Protein also takes a longer time to digest in your stomach. This leaves you feeling more satisfied longer compared to other nutrients like carbohydrates.
Work together to make sure both of you are eating protein at every meal. You should aim for at least one to two servings of protein at each meal. Measure out 3 – 4 oz (85 – 113 grams) of protein per serving.Stick to lower calorie lean protein sources like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, lean pork, legumes or tofu.

, Both of you will also need to focus on consuming adequate fruits and vegetables during the day. Like protein, these foods will really help your weight loss efforts.


Both fruits and vegetables should make up about half of your meals and snacks when you're trying to lose weight. This is because both of these foods are naturally lower in calories, which helps make half of your meal lower in calories.Fruits and vegetables also help keep you satisfied longer. They're bulky and full of fiber which helps bulk up the volume of your meals (without a lot of calories) and keeps you satisfied longer.
Measure out a serving of fruit or vegetables at each meal. Go for 1/2 cup (75 grams) of fruit, 1 cup (150 g) of vegetables or 2 cups (150 grams) of leafy greens per serving., During weight loss, cutting back slightly on your grain intake can make weight loss go a little faster and make it a little easier; however, when you're choosing to eat a grain, go for 100% whole grain items.


Studies have shown that when you limit carbohydrates, especially from carb-rich foods like grains, you lose weight a little more quickly compared to other types of diets (like low calorie only or low fat only).Grains are very high in carbs so moderate how much of these you eat when you're trying to lose weight.
Include a serving daily if you'd like. Measure it out so you keep your intake to a minimum. Serving sizes depend on the type of grain, so make sure you read the packaging on your foods. For instance, one slice of bread is usually one serving, and 1 cup (195 g) of cooked long grain brown rice is equivalent to two servings.Also, choose 100% whole grains since these are less processed and higher in fiber. Go for brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta or whole wheat English muffins.

, One of the downfalls of many dieters is snacking. Too many little slip ups throughout the day or after dinner can cause a weight plateau or even a weight gain.The occasional snack, especially when eaten appropriately, won't harm your weight loss; however, mindless snacking or grabbing higher calorie snacks can lead to weight gain.
Snack only if you're truly hungry and your next planned meal isn't for another hour or two. Also, keep snacks to about 150 calories total so they don't burst your calorie budget.If you see your partner going for a snack after dinner or more often than they should, gently remind them to stay on track with you.

, In addition to diet, including regular exercise will help support your weight loss and weight maintenance. Staying active with your partner makes exercise a little more easy to do.


Studies have shown there are many benefits to working out with your partner. First off, you're more likely to stick to your workout routine if you know someone else is counting on you.In addition, bringing your partner along may help you workout a little harder and a little longer as well.
Both of you should aim for 150 minutes of cardio exercises each week in addition to two to three days of strength training.Find days and times when you can go together and do an activity together.

, One of the most important things when tackling weight loss together as a couple is being patient with each other. You won't agree on everything as you begin your weight loss journey together, so try to stay patient with each other.


Whether or not you're trying to stay positive as your partner loses more weight than you or chooses a dinner recipe you're not a fan of, being patient can help you stay bonded during this time.
If you're constantly arguing or disagreeing about things, you'll forfeit all the benefits that come with losing weight together. Stay patient with each other so that you can continue to reap all those great weight loss benefits you can reach as a team.
On the same note, you'll need to make compromises when you're losing weight together. You'll have to alternate between the two of you who is holding the reigns.

, Although a little competition can be motivating and encouraging, it can also cause some negative side effects. Enjoy playful competition but keep it tame.


One thing with weight loss between two people that will always be true is that someone will lose more weight or lose it faster.Understand that if you don't lose as much weight or lost it as quickly as your partner, this doesn't mean you're not doing well or aren't successful. You're both different people and will have different results.
Be careful when trying to motivate your partner if you are ahead of them. This could backfire and make them feel like they aren't doing well. Try to be encouraging and motivating and don't tease them.

, The one great thing about losing weight together as a couple is that you have each other to hang out with and find healthy activities you can do together.


It can be hard to stick to a diet if your friends or family are always going out to dinner, skipping workouts or snacking. Having someone on your team can make it a lot easier to stick to your diet and healthy lifestyle.
If you normally do a lot of food-centered activities (like going out to dinner, going to get happy hour drinks or having popcorn at the movies), find other things that you can enjoy together that don't have anything to do with food.
For example, instead of going out to breakfast on Sunday morning, plan a morning hike. Or instead of ordering in pizza on Friday night, make your own healthier pizza at home.

, A fun part of losing weight together as a couple is that you can cook and come up with healthy recipes together. This helps you stay motivated but also shares the work of healthy food prep.


It's fun to come up with healthy recipes together. For example, if you're both cutting out excess amounts of grains, find alternatives to your favorites, like using cauliflower in place of rice.
Make sure you find recipes and foods that you'll both enjoy and feel comfortable cooking.
You can consider cooking together every night or alternating days when you cook so you can have some time out of the kitchen during the week.

However, on a raw foods diet you may end up eating more than this.
Aim for 1 cup of vegetables, 1/2 cup of fruit or 1 small piece and 2 cups of leafy greens per portion.There are a significant amount of foods limited on a raw foods diet, so the majority of your meals will be fruits and vegetables. This is great for weight loss because these foods are low in calories, but high in fiber and other essential nutrients.;
, Obviously raw food diets don't suggest eating raw chicken or beef. However, protein is an essential nutrient to your diet and still needs to be consumed at every meal.Protein in general is great for weight loss. It helps keep you feeling satisfied longer after your meals are completed.In addition, the proteins that are suggested on a raw foods diet are also higher in fiber and healthy fats which emphasize increased satiety.
Even though you're following a raw foods diet and protein options are limited, you should still include a serving at each meal or snack. Aim for a 3-4 oz serving or about 1/2 cup.Protein options typically included on raw foods diet are: raw seafood (sushi or sashimi), nuts, nut butters, seeds, beans, lentils and raw cheeses.
Since raw beans and lentils are inedible, these are allowed to be soaked so you can eat them., In addition to fruits, vegetables and some sources of protein, raw food diets also allow the consumption of some 100% whole grain foods.Note that raw food diets suggest only eating 100% whole grains and avoiding all refined grains.
Whole grains are minimally processed and contain all parts of the grain - germ, endosperm and bran. They are higher in protein (which can help meet protein needs), fiber and other essential nutrients.Like legumes, you'll need to soak whole grains.
Include a 1/2 cup or 1 oz serving of whole grains at your meals or snacks.Try: quinoa, millet, farro, or oats.

, Although there are certain types of fat to avoid on a raw foods diet, there are other types of fat that you should include on a raw foods diet.


Include regular servings of ""heart healthy"" fats throughout the week. These types of fat have been shown to support a healthy heart and cardiovascular system.These fats are found in a wide variety of foods like: avocados, olive oil, olives, nuts, seeds, nut butters, salmon, tuna and mackerel.
If you're eating seafood, stick to a 3-4 oz portion of these foods. If you're eating nuts or using olive oil, stick to 2 tbsp per serving., Staying properly hydrated with the right types of fluids is important for any diet - including a raw foods diet.


Most health professionals recommend consuming around 8-13 glasses of clear, sugar-free beverages each day. This amount will be dependent on your age, gender and activity level.Stick to items such as: water, flavored water, and homemade steeped waters.
Keep a water bottle with you at all times to help you reach your required fluid needs throughout the day.

, Raw foods diets are based on the principle that eating foods that are uncooked or very, very minimally cooked provide more nutrients to your body. However, finding enough foods that can fit into a raw foods diet can be difficult if you're used to preparing meals with your stove, oven or microwave.


The theory behind eating raw foods is that heat, especially high levels of heat and heating foods for extended periods of time, destroys vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in many foods (especially fruits and vegetables).
In addition, raw fruits and vegetables can provide a little more bulk and volume to your meals and snacks which can help you feel more satisfied with your meals.
Soaking whole grains and legumes and fermenting vegetables are great ways to replace cooked food in your diet.

, Certain types of cooking techniques are not recommended or used in ""raw food"" diets. Using a juicer or blender can help you incorporate a lot of nutritious foods without needing to cook them.


You can put in raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds into smoothies or homemade juices. These beverages will be nutrient packed and provide your body with a large quantity of the essential nutrients it needs each day.
All the nutrients from the fresh fruits or vegetables will also be present in the juice. However, if you only make a juice, not a smoothie, you do miss out on the essential fiber in the skins and flesh of fruits and vegetables.Juicers and blenders can be pricey (especially if you're considering the option to purchase both). Blenders are typically cheaper overall and can make ""juice"" if pureeing only fruits or vegetables. Note there will be fibrous parts in your juice since you're pureeing the entire fruit or vegetable.

, Changing the texture of foods or getting them ""cooked"" to an edible state can be difficult if you're not using a stove or an oven for cooking. Using a dehydrator can help you get around the need for an oven.


Dehydrators ""cook"" foods at very low temperatures for long periods of time. It slowly evaporates all the moisture from foods leaving them in a dehydrated state.You can also achieve the same effect in a low temperature oven.
Dehydrating foods does destroy some nutrients, but allows you to get different textures of foods instead of only eating raw fruits and vegetables.For example, you can put sliced sweet potatoes in a dehydrator or oven and in a few hours have crunchy dehydrated sweet potato chips.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, a good place to start your diet is by speaking to your doctor or a registered dietitian.


Talk to your doctor about why you want to lose weight, how much you want to lose and how you're thinking about losing weight. He or she will probably give you additional tips on safe weight loss.
Ask your doctor for a referral to a local dietitian or research one online. Many dietitians focus only on weight loss and can be of great help to you.
Talk to your dietitian about losing weight and following a raw foods diet. He or she should be able to provide you with a calorie goal and even a meal plan to help get you started.

, Regardless of what diet you follow, you'll need to cut out a few calories each day to result in weight loss.Most health professionals agree that cutting out about 500 calories daily (or burning 500 calories through exercise) will result in a 1-2 pound weight loss each week.Although this is more slow or gradual weight loss, it’s the safest and most sustainable long-term.
Trying to lose weight at a faster rate may result in you following an overly restricted diet or not eating an adequate amount of calories each day.

, In addition to diet, participating in regular physical activity is essential for weight loss.


Both cardio and weight lifting offer benefits towards weight loss. They will help support your raw foods diet and help burn additional calories throughout the week.Aim for 150 minutes of aerobic or cardio activities each week. Walking, jogging, swimming or dancing all count as aerobic activity.In addition to cardio, add in a few days of strength training each week. 1-2 days of weight lifting, yoga or pilates can help build lean muscle mass and support weight loss attempts."

Move around frequently throughout the day.,
Break a sweat for 30 minutes a day.,
Run errands to stay on the move.,
Walk, ride, and take the stairs.",How to Lose Water Weight Fast2," Fluid retention in the legs is very common among the elderly and inactive because when you sit still for long periods of time, you accumulate fluid in your legs.If you work at a desk or sit for extended lengths of time, take a break every 1-2 hours to get up and move around for several minutes.


Minimize the amount of time you sit or stand in one place. If you are suffering from fluid retention, walking or exercising in smaller amounts two or more times per day may help you lose fluid faster than a single workout.
Exercise your legs when you’re on a flight. Get up and walk up and down the aisles, or do calf raises at your seat. Your body is likely to retain fluid on the journey; however, you can reduce water weight by moving as frequently as possible.

, Exercise can help you to lose water weight quickly, as long as you work up a good sweat.Jog, use the elliptical, ride a bike, dance – work out to get your heart rate up for at least half an hour daily, if possible.


Consult your doctor before starting a new rigorous workout plan.
Always stay hydrated when exercising! You want to lose extra water from sweating, but not cause yourself harm from dehydration. Take a water break at least every 20 minutes.
Be aware that when you first start a new workout program, you might actually gain weight temporarily from storing water in your muscles. That’s why exercising regularly is helpful.Absolutely do not starve yourself – this can make water retention worse!

, You don’t necessarily need to hit the gym to be active. Make it a point to get out and about every day. Grocery shop at your local outdoor market instead of a supermarket, and take your time walking around. Carry your own bags in a store rather than using a shopping cart. Make it a point to be physical while accomplishing your daily tasks.


Make boring household cleaning an enjoyable workout by putting on some music and picking up the pace. Dance your way through daily chores for a fun and productive workout.

, Make yourself work harder to get around. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk or ride a bike whenever possible, rather than driving. Park as far away from your destination as you can, and walk the rest of the way. Small efforts at being active and in motion can help you drop the water weight you might develop when sitting for long periods of time.

Elevate your legs often.,
Use compression stockings if recommended by your doctor.,
Ask your doctor if your medications cause water retention.,
Talk to your doctor about taking water pills.,
Get a massage to improve circulation.,
Reduce your stress.,
Cool down in hot weather and dress warmly in cold weather.",How to Lose Water Weight Fast3," Fluid tends to pool in the feet, ankles and legs because of gravity. Try to counterbalance this force by elevating your legs whenever you get the chance.Prop your legs up on a chair and cushions at the end of the day, or lie in bed with your feet and legs elevated with pillows.


Ideally, raise your legs above the level of your heart. This helps to decrease fluid pooling and send blood back to your heart.

, Compression stockings are special, tight socks or stockings that squeeze your lower legs. This can improve circulation, and are often used if you are on your feet all day or have leg swelling.Discuss the use of compression stockings with your healthcare provider.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen, beta blockers like metoprolol, and estrogen therapies (including birth control pills) can cause you to retain fluids.If any of these are causing issues, you may be able to switch to a different medication. Talk to your doctor before reducing or stopping a medical prescriptions.


Say something like, ""I exercise and eat healthy, but still feel bloated. Do you think any medicine I take is causing a problem?""

, “Water pills,” or diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide, can be prescribed by your doctor to help you shed extra fluid. Remember that all medications may have side effects, and that these will only help if your water weight is due to certain conditions. For instance, diuretics will help edema, but should not be used for simple bloating associated with PMS., Massage therapy increases blood flow and can help to drain your lymphatic system, which holds a lot of fluid in your body.This relaxing activity can also reduce stress hormones that may be adding to weight problems. Discuss your concerns with your massage therapist so they can focus their work with appropriate techniques.

, Cortisone is a hormone that your body produces when you are feeling stressed, and it causes you to hold onto water weight.Minimize your stress level to feel healthier and lose extra water. Meditate, practice deep breathing, use aromatherapy, go for a walk – do whatever activities you enjoy and help you feel peaceful.

, Extreme changes in environmental temperature can send signals to your body to retain water. Try to self-regulate your body temperature as much as possible with the appropriate clothing, especially if you will be outside for long periods of time."

Exercise.,
Eat good foods.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat breakfast and lunch.,
Change daily habits.,
Share the burden.,
Reward yourself.,
Make sure that you are up for the challenge.",How to Lose Pounds and Stay That Way," See your health professional and work out an appropriate exercise regime together. It must suit the condition that you are currently in and your body shape. It can be something that changes over time, as in you may not be able to lift weights now but this might become your goal for a few months' time. Walking briskly, swimming, mild gym work might all be good starters. Find something that is fun for you, so you don't dread exercising. Yoga tones your body, helps you lose weight, and increases your mental state, and some poses are very simple, others more complex.;
, By eating fruits, veggies, whole-grain breads and pasta, and taking in limited portions of fats and sugars, you will be resetting your everyday food consumption toward a more healthy regime. Again, this should be worked out in careful consultation with a health professional, such as a nutritionist. If you are on a budget, there are still opportunities to see a nutritionist for little or no cost. Inquire at your doctor's. In fact, your local doctor can also assist you in planning a healthy eating regime. Look online for healthy eating charts to also get a good idea yourself.

, Water is really healthy and much needed by the body. Choose it over sugared drinks and even diet drinks. Diet drinks carry their own problems even if they are low on calories. They do not retrain you to eat more healthily. Water also assists in making you feel full. If you don't like water by itself, add a slice of lemon, try a flavored water (watch out for extra calories!) or unsweetened herbal teas.

, Both meals are very important and will help to stop cravings for unhealthy foods. Have a large breakfast and a medium lunch. Make dinner the smallest meal of the day. Good lunch ideas include fruits, veggies, and a veggie wrap or a sandwich and a small treat.

, Get out of the rut and rearrange things. Make the house look different, buy new clothes as you lose pounds and get out there and do things. Volunteer, walk to work or bike with the kids on the weekend. Do the things you have been neglecting and you will feel yourself more invigorated and wanting to change.

, Get a friend or spouse who wants to lose pounds to join you. It is a great source of motivation and you can help one another out when it gets crazy and praise one another when it's great!

, Set small goals and reward yourself with things other than food when you reach them, like a day at a spa, a movie night, taking classes in an interesting subject (like sewing, oriental dance, pottery, or yoga), shopping, or a mani-pedi. Ask your partner to make up rewards for you, like a subscription to a magazine you love but usually wouldn't buy, a coupon for a night of romance or a half-hour massage. It can work wonders in motivation and you will look better and feel more attractive with every goal you reach.

, If you are not willing you will quit sooner or later. But as it says before, make sure that there is someone to help you and share your burden.

Eliminate refined and processed foods.,
Limit your sugar intake.,
Increase your consumption of lean protein.,
Stock up on healthy snacks.,
Eat smaller meals more often.",How to Lose Weight As a Middle‐Aged Woman1," Processed food contains substances and chemicals that your body doesn't recognize as food, and that has no nutritional value. The more highly refined and processed foods you eat, the more likely you are to gain weight – particularly around your midsection.Most of these foods can be fairly easily replaced with their less-processed counterparts without adding too much to your grocery bill.
For example, you can replace highly refined white bread with whole wheat. It serves the same purpose but has fewer carbs and sugars and isn't as processed.
Look at ingredient labels on the foods you buy, and steer clear of foods that have long lists of chemicals. Replace these with products that list items you recognize as food as ingredients.
Keep in mind that fresh foods won't keep as long as more highly processed foods, which tend to be packed with preservatives. This means you may have to go to the grocery store more often, but the food that you're eating will be better for you and help you lose weight.;
, Sugar can cause you to gain weight, but limiting sugar isn't as simple as not eating candy, cupcakes, and other sweets. Various types of sugar, particularly high-fructose corn syrup, are lurking in some of the most unexpected places.Check the ingredients, even if the label proclaims that the product is low calorie or sugar free. Sugar substitutes can be just as bad as sugar itself if you're trying to lose weight.
If you have a sweet tooth, buy fresh fruits or dark chocolate to keep the sugar cravings at bay.
When you eat something sweet, try to eat it slowly and savor the taste, rather than scarfing it down.
Avoid sweet snacks or mindless munching, especially late at night.

, Protein helps build muscles. In middle age, your body naturally starts losing muscle mass. You can help slow this process by eating foods such as eggs, fish, and yogurt that are high in lean protein.Protein also gives you an energy boost. Adding high-protein foods such as eggs or yogurt to your breakfast can provide you with energy throughout the day.
Keep in mind that you need to consume about 10 percent more protein as a middle-aged woman than you did when you were younger.
Eating high-protein foods not only boosts your metabolism, but enables you to burn more calories during the eating and digestion process than you do when you're eating foods with high fat or carbohydrate content.

, You don't necessarily have to eliminate all snacking between meals to lose weight. However, you do need to be conscious about what you're eating and make sure snacking isn't piling on additional calories you don't need.Almonds can be good snacks, as well as vegetables such as carrot and celery sticks.
Many of these healthy snacks can be found in small packages that are easy to carry around with you or take to work.
However, if you buy a large bag and split it up into smaller portions yourself, you typically can save a little money.
If you decide to buy pre-packaged trail mix or energy bars to snack on, make sure you read the ingredient list carefully. Some of these so-called ""healthy"" snacks nevertheless have significant salt or sugar content that can set back your weight loss goals.

, As your body ages, you need fewer calories – but that doesn't mean you'll be less hungry. Adjusting your eating schedule so that you're eating five or six small meals a day can keep your body from storing excess fat.If you allow more than two or three hours to elapse between meals, your body may enter ""starvation mode"" (even though you're clearly not starving) and start storing excess calories as fat.
You can thwart this process by eating smaller meals periodically throughout the day.
In other words, if you normally eat three meals a day, transition to six meals a day, each of which is roughly half the size of any of the three meals you normally would eat.
Consume the bulk of your calories during daylight hours. Food you eat during the evening is more likely to go straight to your midsection.
If your schedule doesn't lend itself to six meals a day, you can still keep a similar schedule by having slightly larger meals along with smaller snacks in between.

The place that you store fat, may depend upon genetics; however, studies have shown a correlation between stomach fat and stress.;
, People who don't get at least 7 hours of sleep per night are more likely to store fat in their stomach, hips and thighs. Give yourself 1 hour to decompress before you want to start sleeping.

, Love handles may have appeared slowly, over the course of a decade or more. This slow weight gain can be caused by a sedentary lifestyle, so try the following things to get moving:


Buy a pedometer. Make sure you are walking 10,000 steps during the course of your daily routine.
Stand up while you talk on the phone, watch television or on the bus. You may think that sitting is unavoidable, but standing for just a few minutes can help with lower body weight loss.
Add in a 30 minute walk every day, in addition to exercise. This walk can be done on your lunch break, in the morning or after dinner. Any added exercise will start to give you skinnier hips.

, For fast weight loss, you should increase this to 1 hour 5 days per week.

, This exercise is the best way to reduce weight in your thighs, because it promotes quick body fat loss.

, Do 1 to 2 minute periods of sprinting every 5 minutes during your aerobic workout.

, Get in a push up position. Hold it for 30 seconds to 2 minutes while breathing deeply.

, Get into your side plank position. Lower your left hip 2 inches (5cm), then raise it 4 inches (10cm). Do 10 dips on each side.

, Get on your back with your feet straight up in the air. Raise your chest up, off your shoulders, using only your abdominals.


Raise your hands in the air. Reach your right arm toward your right foot, by twisting at the waist. It should be a small movement. Repeat 20 times on each side.

, Focus on cutting out sugary foods and processed grains.

, Most sugar-filled drinks are between 150 and 300 calories. These are considered ""empty"" calories, because they have few nutrients.

, The other half should be split between lean protein and whole grains.

, It is necessary to keep your metabolism from slowing down and storing more fat in your midsection.

, Reduce what you eat by between 100 and 500 calories, reducing less on the days when you have a long workout.


Most doctors agree that losing weight and keeping it off require small diet changes and reductions that you are committed to, rather than drastic diets.

This can prepare your body to exercise as well as stabilize your temperature and blood pressure.Warm up with a low-impact and light activity, such as walking, for five to 10 minutes.Cool down with a low-impact activity such as light jogging or walking for five to 10 minutes.Proper hydration is an important component of exercise. Consume at least 64 ounces of fluid a day to stay hydrated and add eight ounces of water for every hour of activity., Note that marathon runners and bicyclists have lean, strong legs. This is due to the type of muscle fibers worked during cardio activity. Doing moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular exercise can help you lose weight and sculpt your legs. Discuss your plan to do cardio training with your doctor and certified fitness professional before you start to ensure you are healthy enough for activity.Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity to help you lose weight.If you can’t do an activity for the whole time, split it up into more manageable parts.If you are already very active, you need to revamp your training with routines such as high intensity interval training to fire up your metabolism.If you are just beginning or need to do a lower impact activity, walking and swimming are excellent options.Any type of cardio training can help you shed pounds.

This can help you identify if you’re tired, need to hydrate, or are experiencing the signs of a more serious problem.


Rest if you feel like it. If you feel tired or don’t want to exercise one day, make it a rest day or even an active rest day on which you take an easy walk. Remember that rest is an integral part of losing weight, building muscle, and staying healthy.Stop exercising if you experience dizziness, headache, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, heart palpitations or uneven and rapid heartbeat., Doing exercises that target your legs can help you achieve long, lean gams. You can sign up for group classes that target the legs through cardiovascular exercises or strengthening classes such as TRX or spinning., Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and point your toes outward like a ballerina. Bend your knees and dip down until your knees are just above your toes, and then stand back up.

, Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands resting on your hips. Take a big step forward with your right foot and bend your left knee until it is almost touching the ground. Return to standing position and repeat the movement with your left foot. Walk from one end of the room to the other and then back.
Repeat 10–12 times for one set, working up to three sets.
Add some hand weights or dumbbells for an extra challenge.

, Having a regular diet of healthy and nutrient-rich meals can help you lose any weight and burn fat. Foods containing moderate amounts of fat, complex carbohydrates, and high nutrient content, for example, are best for your general health and weight loss.The amount of calories you consume every day should be commensurate with how much weight you want to lose.Remember that you want to lose weight gradually so that you don’t risk gaining it back quickly.Cut 500–1000 calories per day through diet and exercise to lose one to two pounds per week, which is the safest amount to lose.Fat on the legs can be due to an unbalanced diet or water retention from a diet that is high in carbohydrates. Consider lowering your carbohydrate intake.

, A key part of any healthy diet is getting enough vitamins and nutrients to bolster your overall health. You will consume sufficient nutrients if you eat foods from the five food groups every day. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.Aim to eat one to 1.5 cups of fruit per day. Whole fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries, or from drinking 100% fruit juice are good and nutrient-rich choices.Choose different fruits so that you get an array of nutrients. For example, one day you could have blueberries and raspberries, and another day you could have strawberries and bananas.
Try and eat 2.5 to three cups of vegetables per day. You can get this from eating whole vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, or peppers, or from drinking 100% vegetable juice.Make sure to vary the vegetables you choose so that you get a range of nutrients.
Fruits and vegetables are an excellent source of fiber, and can help you to lose weight.Eat around five to eight ounces of grains per day, of which at least half should be whole grains. Foods such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta or bread, oatmeal, or cereal are great sources of fiber.Grains offer Vitamin B, which can aid slowed digestion.Consume five to 6.5 ounces of protein per day.Protein is in lean meats such as beef, pork, or poultry; cooked beans; eggs; peanut butter; or nuts and seeds.Protein can also help you to build and maintain muscle, which may make your legs get and look even leaner.Drink or eat two to three cups, or 12 oz., of dairy per day.There is a wide variety of dairy products including cheese, yogurt, milk, soymilk, or even ice cream.Dairy can help you build and maintain strong bones and muscles, which may help develop your leg muscles., If you’re trying to lose weight, don’t eat unhealthy or junk foods, which are often loaded with fat and empty calories.Potato chips, pizza, cheeseburgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight.


Avoid starchy, refined carbohydrates including bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods from your diet may also help you lose weight overall.Look at food labels for hidden sugar. Too much sugar in your diet can cause you to gain weight. Look for words such as corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, or maltose, which are all forms of sugar.Stay away from too much sodium. While you need a bit of sodium, it is often too prevalent in mass-processed foods. Use alternative seasonings such as garlic or herbs to help you avoid excess sodium, which can cause you to retain water weight., You may be excited to completely change your diet to lose weight quickly, but it’s important to gradually make changes to your overall diet. This will help you stick to eating healthy and minimize your risk of gaining the weight back.For example, you can slowly replaced processed foods. If you eat white rice, try brown rice and then gradually add more vegetables and protein and less rice.
Let yourself to cheat once in a while so that you stay on track., Putting together a mean plan can help you not slide back into bad or “easy” eating habits that can make you gain weight. It can also help make sure that you’re getting sufficient nutrients.For example, figure out your breakfasts for the week. This helps start off your day on the right foot. If you don’t have lunch meetings, pack lunch and go for a walk. This can help you avoid buying unhealthy fast foods and gives you some exercise, too. At lunch meetings, order the least processed and most natural food on the menu, such as salads without cheese or heavy dressings.

, No one is perfect and sometimes you may just want a burger and fries. Allow yourself an occasional cheat day to enjoy junk food or foods you wouldn’t normally eat on your plan.


There is some evidence an occasional cheat day can help you maintain your diet because you’re not denying yourself anything.You may discover that you don’t crave junk and unhealthy foods as often when you’re eating a healthy and nutrient-rich diet.

, Eating out is a great social activity, but it can also cause major setbacks for many diets because of processed, high fat and calorie dishes. Consciously choosing your meal can help you reinforce your good eating habits and continue to lose weight.Stay away from unhealthy breadbaskets, fried foods, or dishes drowning in heavy sauces such as fettuccine Alfredo.Salads and steamed vegetables, or simple steaks are good choices of healthy foods that won’t break your diet.
Steer clear of buffets, which are often filled with unhealthy, calorie-laden, and processed food choices. Buffets can encourage you to overeat, too.Consider having fruit or low-calorie sorbet for dessert."

The third part is the way you view your body; the core beliefs you have about yourself.,
If you look in the mirror and don't love or accept what you see, you are in no place to improve it.,
In order to lose weight you need to be in a state of self-love.,
Visualisation is extremely powerful.,
Every morning and before you go to bed, meditate on the fact that you are beautiful, you are healthy, you appreciate yourself and your body.,
After this, visualise for five minutes what it will be like once you have your ideal body.,
After that, think of ten things that you are grateful for about your body and really FEEL the gratitude.,
If you have read or watched 'The Secret,' it can be misleading because sometimes it suggests that you do not have to do anything and that when you use the law of attraction, everything will just happen by magic.,
Your body wants to eat healthily, it makes you feel good.,
Before you are about to eat, assess and ask yourself if you are actually hungry.,
Your body wants to move.,
You don't have to go to the gym four times a week or go running every day, you just need to move when your body wants to.,
Listening to your body is essential if you want to release weight, or release resistance.",How to Lose Weight and Create Your Ideal Body,";
, Many people spend years of their lives trying to lose weight but fail because they have a bad body image of themselves. The reason is this: one of the laws of the universe, the law of sufficiency and abundance, states that if you do not believe that what you have at the moment is good enough, IT WILL NEVER be good enough. Once again you may find this strange or not understand this if you don't know or understand the law of attraction.

, You need to appreciate all the good things about yourself, and accept all the things that you might not like about yourself. For example, instead of looking in the mirror and thinking 'Argh! I'm so fat, I'm so unattractive' you need to say, well actually, i appreciate my body because its healthy today, its keeping me alive, its doing its job. There are countless reasons to appreciate our bodies. Think of all the fundamental things about them that we rely on that are working. Think to yourself, 'I have lungs! They're healthy, they're working, they take in my life force, the keep me alive!' Appreciate and be grateful for these things about yourself, and you will attract to you more things to be grateful for.

, When you visualize what you want and you feel good about it, you are literally drawing to yourself those things that you want from the unseen into the seen; the metaphysical into the physical. Visualization and meditation lead to ideas and inspired action, and when you have these inspired ideas, follow them.

, At first it might seem like you're making it up because you're not used to it, so don't beat yourself up about that either. It's just your ego trying to keep you exactly the same as you are-that's its job. But your soul knows better than that. What you have right now, and as you are now is good enough.

, Feel it from the inside. Imagine what it will feel like to have that toned, flat stomach; those defined arms and legs. Whatever it is that you want to create, visualise what it will feel like, and feel it.

, When we appreciate our body as it is right now, we give our subconscious messages that we love and accept our bodies right now, which attracts to us even more to love and accept, and so our subconscious starts to create our ideal body for us.

, There is no doubt that it feels magical, but you do have to actually do something. It must be both physical and metaphysical (this is part of the law of polarity). This is why you still need to eat healthily and do regular exercise.

, You must eat only when you are hungry, and when you do eat, don't stuff yourself. Imagine it as a fire: it has small amounts often to keep it burning, you don't throw a whole tree on it and then leave it. Its the same in this case. If you stuff your body with food that it does not need, it takes longer to burn, so when you are hungry and you do eat, eat only until you are moderately full.

, A lot of the time, especially with comfort eating or boredom eating, or any type of emotional eating, we have other needs that are unfulfilled. People often do not realize this, so they eat, because its the only thing they know to do in that moment when they have some sort of need. Stop and assess what it is that you really need.

, You may notice that if you have not exercised for a while and then you exercise, it feels great! It's a huge relief, it's like your body is saying thank you. Because it is. Being active is our natural state.

, Do the exercise that you're inspired to do.

, It is our minds that lead us to being unhealthy and unfit, our bodies want to be healthy.

Increase the intensity of your cardio workout.,
Use strength training to increase muscle mass.,
Incorporate exercise into your daily routine.,
Switch up your exercise routine regularly.,
Work with a personal trainer.",How to Lose Weight As a Middle‐Aged Woman2," You may have been able to maintain a healthy weight in your 20s with a brisk morning walk around the block. However, as you age, the same cardio routine will become less effective.Cardio can help you lose weight – especially around your middle – while at the same time slowing muscle loss and keeping you strong.
To promote weight loss, don't walk or run with the same intensity the whole time. Intervals can step up the calorie-burning power of your cardio exercise.
For example, if you're walking for exercise, walk at a brisk pace for five minutes, then break into a light jog for two minutes, then slow back down to brisk walking for another five minutes.
If you listen to music in headphones while you walk, you can design a playlist with varying beats that corresponds to your intervals and pushes you forward.

, In your 40s, you start losing muscle mass. Building stronger muscles means you burn more calories every day – even when you're sitting at your desk doing work.Many women avoid adding strength training to their workout routine because they are afraid of bulking up or looking like a body builder.
However, strength training really isn't going to do this. Building bulk muscles involves a different type of weight lifting than the work you will do with strength training.
Basically, you can strengthen your muscles simply by adding some resistance to the exercises you already do.
Even if your exercise routine consists of little more than a walk around your neighborhood after dinner, you can add a strength training component by using wrist and ankle weights for short periods of one minute at a time. Wearing wrist and ankle weights for too long can injure your joints.

, Doing little things to stay active, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can help you keep your body active and enable you to burn additional calories throughout the day.Look for opportunities to get a little exercise into your daily routine. For example, if you go to the grocery store or the mall, you might park further away instead of looking for the closest spot.
When you're shopping, carrying things in a basket or bag instead of pushing a cart is another way to sneak in a little exercise.
Even cleaning around the house can burn a few calories, while at the same time giving you a sense of satisfaction that you've made your home a neater and more comfortable place to live.

, If you stick to the same exercises day in and day out, you'll get bored after a while – and your body will too. Changing your routine doesn't just keep you mentally engaged and motivated, it keeps your muscles alert and active.If you have the time and the ability to do so, you might consider taking a fitness or exercise class to add a little variety to your exercise regimen.
Joining a community sports league is another way to add variety, and you don't need to be a skilled athlete to do so.
Many areas have adult leagues for sports such as kickball in which everybody can participate.
Your local YMCA or community center may offer inexpensive exercise classes if you don't want to join a gym just to take an exercise class.

, As you get older, your risk of injury while exercising increases. Even if you can't afford a personal trainer every day, consult an expert at least once every few months to go over your exercise routine with you.When you explain your goals to a personal trainer, they can assess your exercise routine and let you know if the exercises you've chosen will help you fulfill your goals.
A personal trainer also can suggest additional exercises or tweaks to your routine that will kick your fat-burning up a notch.
If you're stuck in a workout rut, a personal trainer can help motivate you and push you over the next hurdle to keep your weight loss on track.

Get sufficient sleep each night.,
Try meditation.,
Invest in yourself.,
Build your own support group.,
Attack problems head-on.",How to Lose Weight As a Middle‐Aged Woman3," As a middle-aged woman, you probably have a busy life trying to balance work and family life along with other commitments. However, a solid night's sleep is essential to decrease stress and battle weight gain.If you work during the day, try to start slowing down around 8 or 9 at night, rather than doing physically taxing or intense things later in the evening that will give you a burst of energy and make it difficult to go to sleep.
You also should avoid eating late at night – particularly sweets – and avoid caffeine in the evening or late in the afternoon.
When you work later hours, it can be more difficult to get the sleep that you need, especially if you have kids.
You can decrease the effects of sleep deprivation by trying to squeeze in a short 15- or 20-minute nap at some point during the day.

, Setting aside even as little as 10 minutes a day for meditation can provide substantial health benefits. Over time, meditation and deep-breathing exercises can make it easier to lose weight as a middle-aged woman by lessening the impact of daily stress.Cortisol, a stress hormone, bears much of the blame for ""middle age spread,"" particularly if you've noticed an increase in belly fat that seems resistant to diet and exercise.
Meditation has a calming effect on your body and can decrease your body's production of this hormone, helping you lose weight.
Using meditation to reduce stress also can help you fall asleep at night and get more restful sleep after you do fall asleep.
If meditation doesn't appeal to you or you find it difficult to clear your mind, take a few minutes to practice deep-breathing exercises, or carve a little time out of your day to do something you find relaxing, such as coloring in an adult coloring book or reading a light-hearted novel.

, As you age, self-care becomes all the more important. At the same time, spending time and effort on yourself and your own needs typically takes a backseat to other commitments.Pay attention to your body and recognize that your self-care needs also will change as you age.
When time is at a premium, you still can do little things for yourself that will ease your stress and brighten your day.
For example, you could buy a scented candle in a relaxing or calming fragrance such as lavender or vanilla and light it for a few minutes each evening as you wind down from work.

, Maintaining deep and fulfilling relationships with family and friends can decrease stress and anxiety. That lowered stress level will in turn make it easier for you to lose weight as a middle-aged woman.Make an effort to listen to and support the people in your life in positive ways, and they will likely return the favor.
Make time with your friends and loved ones, even if you don't have the time or energy to do the things together that you might have done when you were younger.
For example, if you and a friend both have dogs, find a time when you can meet each other at a local dog park. You can talk while your dogs get a little exercise.
If you and your friends or family members have kids, plan play dates that will give your kids time to bond while the adults catch up on each others' lives.

, Procrastinating or avoiding dealing with something you don't enjoy doing can turn a small nuisance into a huge problem. Taking a proactive approach to issues as they arise can help you keep stress in check.If you have a larger task ahead of you, break it down into smaller pieces so you can take care of it over time rather than trying to find a time to do it all at once.
When faced with a problem, ask yourself if you can do anything about it right then. If you can, do whatever you can do immediately.
If there's nothing you can do immediately, try to put it out of your mind. Worrying about something that's out of your control will only increase your stress level, making it much more difficult for you to lose weight.

Cut back on calories.,
Eat well balanced meals.,
Focus on lean protein.,
Eat your fruits and veggies!,
Go for whole grains.",How to Lose Back Fat (Women)1," If you want to tone your back and reduce back fat, you'll need to reduce your overall body fat. Cutting back on the calories you eat each day will help you lose that excess fat.


Take a few days to track your calories. Use an online food journal or smart phone app to help you. This will give you a starting point.
Subtract about 500 calories from your typical or average daily calorie intake. Cutting out this many calories is a good way to lose weight and excess body fat.
Restricting calories by about 500 calories each day generally results in a weight loss of one to two pounds per week.;
, Even you're losing weight or even just trying to tone up your body, eating a balanced diet is an important part of your plan. This will help ensure you're consuming most of the recommended nutrients each day.


A balanced diet is one that includes each food group most days. In addition, you should eat a wide variety of foods from each food group.
When you restrict certain food groups or completely avoid them, you're at risk for getting nutrient deficiencies.

, Protein is essential for weight loss. It helps keep you satisfied, supports your metabolism and can help support your lean muscle mass.


Including three to four ounces (or 80 to 120 grams) or a card deck sized portion of protein at each meal will help you reach your daily recommendations.
Lean protein sources are lower in fat and calories making them a great component of a weight loss or fat reduction plan.
Choose items like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, seafood, legumes and tofu.

, Vegetables are low-calorie, filling, and full of vitamins and minerals. Aim to make 1/2 of your meals and snacks a fruit or a vegetable.


It's typically suggested to eat about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Eating one to two servings at every meal and snack can help you meet this goal.
Both fruits and vegetables are great foods to include in your weight loss plan because they can help fill you up for very few calories.

, If you're going to eat a grain, try to choose 100% whole grains.


Whole grains are known to be higher in fiber, protein and other beneficial nutrients.
Health professionals recommend making at least 1/2 of your grain choices whole.
Choose items like: quinoa, brown rice, whole grain oats, 100% whole wheat pasta and bread.
Limit foods that are made with refined or processed white flours or processed grains.

Weigh yourself at least every week.",How to Lose Body Fat Fast," Many studies show that one of the best ways to lose excess body fat somewhat quickly is by limiting your total carb intake.To lose weight you can follow a variety of diets — low-calorie, low-fat or low-carb. Limiting carbs can help you lose excess fat more effectively than low-calorie or low-fat diets.Carbs are found in a wide variety of foods including: grains, fruit, dairy products, legumes and starchy vegetables.
Limit carbs from the grain group the most. The nutrients found in grains can also be found in other food groups. This allows you to continue to meet your nutrient needs.
You may also choose to limit starchy vegetables and fruits that are higher in sugar. Limiting these foods still allows you to consume plenty of vegetables and adequate servings of fruit daily.
Limit grains, potatoes, corn, peas, carrots, beans, lentils, bananas, mangos, pineapples and grapes. These foods are higher in carbohydrate compared to others.;
, In addition to following a lower carbohydrate diet, studies also show that eating higher amounts of protein can aid in weight loss.Protein helps support lean muscle mass and your metabolism during weight loss. In addition, it helps you stay satisfied longer throughout the day.Including at least one to two servings of lean protein at each meal can help you eat adequate amounts each day. One serving is about 4 oz.Choose leaner cuts of protein to help minimize calorie intake. Try: legumes (kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, nuts and pumpkin seeds); tofu; soy milk; poultry; fish, eggs; low-fat dairy; and lean beef.

, Both of these food groups offer you a large variety of essential vitamins, minerals and fiber. Fill up on these nutrient-rich foods to help balance your diet.


Non-starchy vegetables are much lower in carbohydrates and also low in calories. Include 1 cup of denser vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts or asparagus. Serve yourself 2 cups of leafy greens like kale or spinach.There are varying levels of sugar in fruit. Stick to 1/2 cup serving of lower sugar fruits like blackberries, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries., There is some evidence that shows excess intake of sugar and other refined carbs leads to more excess body fat, especially in your midsection. Minimize these foods to help you meet your goal.Processed foods and restaurant foods often leave out healthy fiber, protein and nutrients found in less processed, more whole foods.
Processed foods can include: sweetened beverages, TV or frozen dinners and meals, ice cream and other frozen treats, pastries, chips and crackers, canned soups and meals, and cakes or cookies.
Limit these foods as often as possible. If you do consume them, stick to smaller servings to minimize your intake.

, People who are trying to lose body fat may also want to avoid alcohol. Studies have also showed that alcohol can lead to increased body fat especially in the midsection.Minimize alcohol in your diet while you're trying to lose body fat. This will help you meet your goals faster.
Once you have lost body fat and you are on a maintenance diet, you can add in a small amount of alcohol consumption. Women should stick to one serving or less and men should consume two servings or less daily., Skipping meals is generally not recommended - even when you're trying to lose weight. This is especially true if you're pairing a weight loss diet with exercise.If you skip meals regularly, you're at risk for running low on nutrients throughout the day.Although you may notice increased weight loss when you skip meals, your weight loss may actually be coming from the loss of lean muscle mass, not excess body fat.Try to eat regular and consistent meals. Schedule in a meal or snack every three to five hours or as needed.

, Don't panic — most of this fast occurs while you sleep. Restricting your eating to 12 hours a day may help you lose weight, according to one study.You should still eat your recommended daily calories, but limit yourself to only eating during a 12 hour period. So you might eat breakfast at 7am and cut yourself off from eating after 7pm. Though it is not fully understood, this 12-hour fasting period may cause your body to switch from burning food to burning fat., High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to help burn more body fat compared to other types of workouts.Incorporate a few of these exercise routines to help you meet your goal.


HIIT workouts also help keep your metabolism elevated hours after you've completed the exercise.Start a HIIT workout by exercising at a moderate-intensity for two to three minutes. Then, change to a high-intensity rate for two minutes. Alternate between the intervals of moderate and high intensity.
You can do a HIIT workout on a treadmill or outside running. Alternate between sprinting and a moderate jog. You can also do this on a stationary bike. For example, many spin classes alternate between levels of high-intensity spinning with more moderate spinning levels.
Some workout machines have built-in interval workouts that can get you used to the process of interval training; however, you can also incorporate these workouts in walking, swimming, running and cycling. Buy a heart rate monitor to help you assess the intensity of your interval periods.

, In addition to HIIT workouts, it's important to still include some moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. This type of exercise comes with a variety of benefits including weight loss support.Do cardiovascular training at least 150 minutes each week — or five times per week for at least 30 minutes per session.Warm up for the first five minutes and cool down for the last five minutes of your exercise routine. This helps your body prepare and recover after your workout. Make sure you stretch after your warmup.
Vary your cardiovascular workouts. Choose two or three workouts that you like to do and mix them up. This is both mentally and physically beneficial to building different muscles and burning fat.
Some examples of moderate aerobic exercise include: walking, using an Elliptical, doing a dance or aerobics class, and cycling.

, Include weight training or resistance training to your exercise routine. Building lean muscle mass can help support your metabolism and desire to burn fat.Choose to lift weights or use weight machines on days when you don't do cardio, or do some strength training after a shorter cardio workout.
Strength training has a variety of benefits. It increases bone density, metabolism and muscle mass overtime.
Included in strength training are exercises that use your own body weight, such as squats, lunges, push ups and pull ups. Consider adding these exercises, TRX workouts or cardio burn classes to your regular workout routine.

, Taking a rest day allows your muscles 24 to 48 hours to recover and repair between weightlifting and cardio routines.It's an essential part to your overall workout routine.


Try to make your rest days active rest days. Avoid sitting all day or being overly sedentary.
Try doing more restorative exercises or activities like: yoga, walking or going for a leisurely bike ride.

, Reducing time in front of the computer screen and television will help to burn more calories throughout the day.


Studies have shown that lifestyle activities, or those things you do on a daily basis, can have similar benefits to aerobic exercises.Add walking sessions to your day. In addition to your cardio and strength training, take a walking lunch break or after dinner walk.
Also add more movement to your day. Pace while you talk on the phone, stand during TV commercial breaks or walk to more destinations instead of driving.

, Studies have shown that continuous chronic stress can lead to abdominal obesity or excess fat levels.Managing stress better may help you lose weight and decrease excess fat levels.


In addition, chronic stress can make it difficult to lose weight. You might feel hungrier and crave more ""comfort foods"" when you're stressed.
Try to engage in relaxing activities to help you relieve stress in your life. For example, try: meditating, going for a walk, listening to music, talking to a friend or doodling.
If you're having difficulty managing stress, consider seeing a behavior therapist for stress management. These health professionals can give you additional guidance and techniques to better manage your stress.

, Like stress, poor sleeping habits can also make weight loss and decreasing excess body fat more difficult.Studies have shown that those people who don't sleep well or sleep enough pack on more body fat and lose more lean muscle mass. In addition, your levels of ghrelin (your hunger hormone) increase which stimulates your appetite.Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night.This amount is recommended for adults.
Try going to bed earlier or sleeping in later to help you meet your nightly goal.
Also, try turning off cell phones, laptops and TVs prior to going to sleep. This helps you get a more sound sleep.

, Studies have shown that regular weigh-ins help you stick to your diet longer term.Help yourself stick to your diet plan by getting on the scale on a regular basis. Knowing that you have a regular weigh-in can help motivate you to stay on track with your diet and exercise routine.
Try to weigh yourself one to two times a week. This will give you the most accurate view of your weight loss trend.
Remember, although you want to lose body fat, you'll see the reduction of body fat reflected in your overall weight loss.

Typically, excess belly fat is associated with many chronic health conditions like diabetes or heart disease.This makes it even more important to inform your doctor of your plan and make sure it's safe for your specific health conditions.;
, Studies have shown that carbohydrate-rich foods can cause an increase in belly fat and waist circumference. Reduce the amount of these foods in your diet to help you lose weight and decrease the amount of belly fat.Your diet should consist of mostly lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy.


Limit your intake of empty carbohydrates like bread, rice, crackers or pasta. These foods aren't necessarily unhealthy, especially if they're whole grain foods, however they are not considered nutrient-dense foods.
If you're going to eat a carbohydrate-rich food, choose 100% whole grains. These foods are higher in fiber and some nutrients and are considered a healthier choice.Make sure, too, you pay attention to portions — one portion of pasta or rice should be half a cup or 125 ml.
Whole grain foods include: brown rice, 100% whole wheat bread and pasta, barley or quinoa.

, Protein-based foods can help men lose weight, reduce belly fat and maintain lean muscle mass.Consuming adequate amounts of protein will also help keep you feeling satisfied longer.


To lose fat, protein should make up about 20 to 25% of your daily calories. For instance, if you're eating 1,600 calories a day you need 80 to 100 grams of protein; if you're eating 1,200 calories a day, you need 60 to 75 grams of protein per day.Lean proteins include: lentils, skinless chicken, turkey, eggs, low-fat dairy, seafood, pork, lean beef and tofu. These provide you with the energy you need and help keep you full without piling on unnecessary calories.

, Lower your total daily calories to help you lose weight. You can do this in several ways. Try cutting down on portion sizes, burning more calories through physical activity, and changing the composition of your diet to higher protein, lower fat, lower carbohydrates.


Begin keeping track of the amount of calories you consume on a daily basis. Don't forget to include the calories in beverages, cooking oils, salad dressings, and sauces.
Begin a food journal so that you can track your intake. Online food journals or smartphone apps are designed to help people find the calorie content of the foods they eat, keep track of their intake, and even connect with other dieters.
The amount of calories you will need to eat in order to lose weight depends on your age, build, and level of physical activity. To lose one to two pounds a week, cut out about 500 calories per day. This rate of weight loss is safe and appropriate for most men., Studies have shown that consumption of sugar can lead to increased belly fat over time. Men who eat less sugar have a smaller waist circumference.Items to limit or discontinue eating include: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cakes and other sweets, and foods made with white flour (like white bread or plain pasta).
If you are craving sweets, try eating a piece of fruit or take a very small serving of your favorite sweet.

, There's a reason why they call it a ""beer belly."" But beer is not the only drink that causes increased belly fat. Studies have shown that all types of alcohol can lead to belly fat in males.It's recommended to have no more than two alcoholic beverages daily for men;however, if you want to reduce belly fat, it's recommended to discontinue drinking altogether.

, Exercise combined with a low-calorie diet will support and speed up weight loss by burning calories and increasing your metabolism.Including regular cardiovascular activity can help you lose weight and decrease your belly fat.


Running, hiking, biking, and swimming are all examples of calorie-burning cardio exercises. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five times a week for a modest benefit.If you don't want to exercise every day, then find ways to incorporate more movement into your daily routine. Get in the habit of taking the stairs rather than the elevator, parking farther away from your destination, and using a standing desk.
It is especially important to exercise if you work a sedentary desk job.

, As you age, it may be harder to reduce the amount of belly fat. This is partially due to the natural decrease in lean muscle mass as you age, but also because you begin to store more fat around your midsection.Maintaining lean muscle mass can help prevent this.


Include at least two days of 20 – 30 minutes of strength or resistance training each week.Strength training exercises include: free weights, weight classes, using weight machines, or doing yoga.

, ""Spot-training"" or focusing only on exercises like crunches and planks may help strengthen your core, but do not reduce belly fat. Toning and strength training exercises build lean muscle mass, but don't decrease fat stored around your midsection.Focus on overall weight loss. Modify your diet and include appropriate amounts of cardio. Then begin incorporating abdominal workouts into your routine to tone your midsection.

, Having somebody to accompany you on your workouts can make exercise feel more enjoyable. Studies have shown you're more likely to keep a scheduled workout and workout more often if you're going with a friend.If you are a competitive person, it may be fun to race with your weight-loss buddy to see who can reach their goal weight first.

, To get rid or reduce belly fat you'll need to reduce your weight. To help keep track of your weight loss, weigh yourself regularly.


It's best to weigh yourself about one to two times a week. In addition, try to weigh yourself on the same day of the week, at the same time and wearing the same clothes.Keep track of your weight in a journal. Seeing your progress can be motivating to help you stay on track. It can also show you any trends where you're gaining weight as well.

, In addition to weight loss, one of the best ways to measure your progress of losing belly fat to is track your waist circumference. This is the measurement around the smallest part of your waist. As you decrease belly fat, your waist circumference will decrease.Use a tape measurer to measure the circumference of your waist. Do this by finding the top of your hip bone and your lowest rib and wrapping the tape around your belly between these two points. Continue taking measurements as you diet to track your progress.A high waist circumference or a measurement over 37 inches (94 cm) indicates you have a large quantity of belly fat and are at risk for chronic diseases.Remember that muscle weighs more than fat, so if you are trying to lose weight while building muscle, the scale can be misleading. Your best bet is track your progress by measuring your waistline and weight together.

, Dieting can be hard, especially when you find yourself constantly thinking about food or eating out of boredom. The best way to curb your appetite is to stay busy and indulge in activities that you enjoy.Making a list of other activities to engage in can help decrease excess snacking or boredom eating.Have this list handy when the desire to eat strikes.
Ideas to try include: taking a walk, reading a book, cleaning out a junk drawer, talking to a friend or family member on the phone or doing household chores.
If you're feeling hungry and it's close to a planned meal or snack time, have your meal and then move on with other activities. Do not continue to eat or snack.

, When we have chronic stress in our lives, our bodies release the hormone cortisol, which causes the body to store extra fat in the midsection.In addition, chronically elevated cortisol levels can increase hunger levels.Try to eliminate and manage stressful things, people, and situations in your life. Learn how to better manage the stress associated with elements of your life that can't be changed (like your job, for example). Meeting with a life coach or therapist can provide additional ways to manage stress.
Remember that while you can't always control your circumstances, you can control the way you react. Mind/body practices like yoga and meditation help you learn how to relax your mind so that you can better cope with stress, anxiety, and depression.

Get your bra refitted.,
Avoid clothes that dig in at the waist or back.,
Purchase smoothing shapewear.",How to Lose Back Fat (Women)2," If it has been a while since you got your bra size measured, or you have gained or lost a significant amount of weight, it may be worth your while to get your bra resized.A band that is too tight will dig in and create unflattering bulges across your back. Your skin may also hurt or ache throughout the day if your bra is not fitted to your body.
Go to an undergarment store or undergarment department store and ask for help. Many stores offer free bra fittings for customers. They'll measure you and give you an idea of an appropriate size.
Also try different types of bras. Some are actually designed to hold in unwanted bulges and are more comfortable to wear throughout the day.

, Tight fitting tops, tops that show more skin or those that are made of sheer fabric may enhance the look of bulges around your back.Choose more flattering clothes to help disguise unwanted bulges on your back.


Unflattering clothing choices can include: tight waistbands, tight bras, jeans that cause muffin top, etc. These can call attention to your back fat.
Try to wear clothes that are flattering and that fit you well. By wearing more flattering clothing, people likely won’t even notice any back fat that you do have.
You can also wear clothes that will draw attention away from your back. For example, wear a loose top with a bright skirt to guide the eye down, or pair a simple shirt with dangly earrings for the opposite effect.

, You can purchase undergarments or bras that are designed to lift and smooth your entire upper body.These may be especially helpful if you want to decrease your back fat for a special occasion.


Look for shapewear that's designed as a bra and upper body shaper. This will provide you the support you need up top, but smooth out any bumps or bulges on your back and stomach.
These types of undergarments can also help clothes fit better and flow more naturally over your body.

Do cardio intervals.,
Incorporate T raises.,
Do a bent over row.,
Add in pull-ups.,
Try the plank with an arm raise.",How to Lose Back Fat (Women)3," Cardio interval exercises are an important part of any fat reduction plan.Even though these exercises will not target your back fat, adding these exercises may help you to feel better about yourself and the way you look.


By definition, cardiovascular interval exercise raises your heart rate, keeping it pumping fast during and after your cardio intervals.
Squeeze two-minute intervals of intense cardio in between sets of strength moves to help you burn calories fast. Try running, jumping jacks, elliptical work, biking around the block, and jump roping.
Try to do at least 30 minutes of cardio most days of the week.

, This exercise works the muscles in your upper back.To do this exercise:


Bend your knees slightly and lower torso until it's parallel to the floor. Engage your core and glutes to help stabilize your position.
Hold a set of light dumbbells in each hand. Bring the weights together down towards the floor with your palms facing each other.
Keeping your arms straight, slowly lift the weights up to shoulder height (parallel to the floor) then lower them back down slowly.
Do two or three sets of 15 repetitions.

, This exercise will also help you to tone the muscles in your upper back.To do this exercise:


Hold a set of dumbbells in each hand. Choose a pair of dumbbells heavy enough to make this challenging for you, but not so heavy that you can't lift them more than a few times. Keep feet hip-width apart with your knees slightly bent. Lower your upper body down at the hips until you're just about parallel to the floor.
Bend forward at the waist and extend your arms towards the floor.
Then, lift your elbows up and back, squeezing your shoulder blades slightly together.
Do two or three sets of 10 repetitions on each side. Gradually work up to three to five sets of 12 reps to really see change.

, Doing pull-ups or assisted pull-ups are another great way to help tone your upper back (and your arms).To do this exercise:


Place both hands on a stable wall bar with palms facing you.
Grip the bar tightly as you slowly lift your body until your chin is up and over the bar. Keep knees slightly bent. Lower back down slowly.
If you cannot do a regular pull-up, try using the assisted pull-up machine at your gym. You'll rest your knees on the bench and slowly pull yourself up.
Pull-ups are difficult, so try to do 10 repetitions, or just as many as you can. Do two or three sets if you can.

, This exercise is great for your entire back and core. The lateral arm raise also works muscles in the upper back area.To do this exercise:


Get into a straight-arm plank. Your hands should be below your shoulders and in straight line. Keep your feet about hip width apart.
Keep your hips and core as still as possible, lift one arm out to the side until it is in line with your shoulder.
Slowly lower your arm back down to your side and repeat with your other arm. You can use very light hand weights to increase the difficulty of this exercise.
Do two to three sets of 10 repetitions on each side.

Take it slowly.,
Consider the benefits of breastfeeding.,
Do light exercise after six weeks.",How to Lose Baby Weight1," For the first six weeks after giving birth, you shouldn't try to diet and exercises. Plan to take the weight off gradually over the course of the next year before you return to your pre-baby weight.Celebrities may seem to bounce back to their pre-baby weight after a couple of weeks, but this immediate change is not realistic. In fact, trying to lose the weight right away can be harmful for a number of reasons.


You may damage your muscles, which are still weak from giving birth.
If you're breastfeeding, restricting calories can affect your milk supply.
After giving birth, you need plenty of energy to keep up with your new baby's needs, and restricting calories or exercising too early will leave you weak and fatigued.;
, While studies are conflicting on whether breastfeeding actually helps women lose baby weight faster, it may help in your individual situation. If you're pumping instead of breastfeeding, you may still reap some of the metabolic benefits, but studies are not conclusive at this point.

, When you feel ready (and your doctor gives the OK), start taking walks with your baby and doing light exercises at home. Doing heavy workouts at the gym will still be hard on your body, so focus on exercises that feel manageable and don't wear you out too much.


Find some baby activities that double as amusement for the child and activity for you. This could include pushing the baby around the block in a stroller or dancing around with her in your arms.
The simple act of carrying your baby around in a sling or baby backpack can add some extra pounds, increasing the effort you put into walking and providing a novel experience for him.

You can calculate this by multiplying your weight by ten.If you weigh 150 pounds, then you burn about 1,500 calories per day just by going about your usual business. If you eat 1,000 calories, then you'll need to burn 3,000 additional calories each day to lose one pound.;
, To lose a pound a day, you should consume between 1,200 or 1,500 calories a day depending on your weight and how much you exercise. You can cut down on calories by both eating smaller portions and by eating healthier foods.


Eat low-calorie foods that fill you up. Your diet should consist primarily of vegetables and lean proteins. Eat lettuce, celery, broccoli, green beans, spinach, and other greens. For protein, eat chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu. Vegetables and proteins fill you up quickly and have very few calories.
Cut out sugar, fat, salt, and most carbohydrates. While a normal diet should contain these things in moderation, you should cut these foods out completely while trying to lose weight quickly.
Don't add salad dressings or cooking sauces to your food, as these are loaded with extra calories. Season your food with pepper, lime, vinegar, or hot sauce.
Cut down on calories by using a cooking spray rather than olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter.

, Studies have shown that people who keep track of what they eat by writing it down lose more weight than those who do not.Write down everything you eat in a journal, and be sure to include the calorie content of each food and add the numbers up as you go.


Include the calories you burned from exercising and subtract them from your total.
Try using an online food tracking service like My Fitness Pal or Calorie King to make things easier.

, No matter how little you eat, you will absolutely have to burn additional calories in order to lose a pound a day. The following is a list of top calorie-burning aerobic activities:

, Not only does drinking water keep your stomach full, it will help replenish your fluids and keep you energetic while exercising. Drink between 10-12 cups of water each day.


Add lemon, lime, or cucumber to your water to make it more appealing.

, Remember that your metabolism slows down dramatically while you are sleeping, so you will need to give your body ample time to digest everything you eat before going to bed. The earlier you finish eating for the day, the better. Be sure to eat a proper dinner, though, so that you don't wake up hungry in the middle of the night.

, Tea and other caffeinated beverages like coffee help suppress the appetite and boost your metabolism.Try not to drink more than two cups of coffee per day, as it can leave you feeling nervous and jittery.

, Many people overeat and smoke because of an oral fixation. Combat this by keeping your mouth busy with a stick of gum. Plus, chewing gum burns calories and strengthens the jawbone.

, Having a clean, fresh mouth will prevent you from snacking on foods, and as an added bonus, will keep your teeth and gums healthy!

, Ginger energizes the body and helps speed up digestion.Make ginger tea by boiling some ginger root in hot water, or cut up some ginger and add it to your salad or stir-fry.

, This will add some flavor to your meal while boosting your metabolism., Apples are a dieter's best friend; they help keep you full because they are rich in fiber, they help regulate glucose levels, and keep you feeling energetic even when you are cutting down on calories., The best way to eat less is to find something that you enjoy doing even more than (or just as much as) eating food. If you feel the urge to snack, then take a warm bubble bath, paint your nails, read a book, call a friend, go out for a walk, pop in your favorite movie, or go shopping.

Include moderate to vigorous intensity exercise a few times a week and focus on exercises that involve intervals to aid in fat burning. This will help burn calories from fat in addition to boosting your cardiovascular health.Aim to include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity (where you can say a short sentences fairly easily) activity each week. However, adding in vigorous activity (where you can't say more than one to two words at a time) burns more calories per minute.You don't have to force yourself to pound the pavement in a dead sprint. Swimming, cycling, boxing, and tennis all offer effective alternatives to running and elliptical machines.
If you're not quite ready for vigorous exercise, start walking briskly on a treadmill at an uphill climb, use a stationary bike, or get acquainted with an elliptical machine. You can do these at a level catered to your ability.
To lose the most amount of fat, a combination of weight training and cardio is the most effective exercise plan.;
, Although cardio burns more calories in the short-term, weight lifting or strength training helps build lean muscle mass that can increase how many calories you burn over the long-term.Include at least 20 minutes of strength training at least two times a week. However, the more time you spend doing strength training exercises, the more lean muscle mass you can build.Gaining lean muscle can work wonders for your metabolism. Studies have shown that increased muscle mass helps increase your metabolism and burn more calories even when your body is at rest., Exercise does increase your metabolism, but interval training does so even more. High-intensity interval training has been shown to be more effective at burning calories from fat than other forms of exercise.Interval training has also been shown to increase your metabolism and keep it raised for up to 24 hours after your work out.Interval training is a short workout that alternates between short bursts of very high intensity activity and moderate intensity activity. These workouts should last between 15-25 minutes and you should feel very, very out of breath at the end of the workout.Interval training can be difficult and may not be appropriate for all fitness levels. Always speak to your doctor and take your first interval training workout slowly until you feel comfortable with it.

, Lifestyle activity are activities and movement that you do in a typical day. Increasing how much you move throughout your daily routine can help burn more calories and fat.Lifestyle activity typically falls into low to moderate intensity exercise. That means, you're active, heart rate is raise slightly but you're not out of breath. Activities may include: walking to and from your car, walking while you grocery shop, taking the stairs to your office or household chores (like mopping or gardening).
These types of activities fall into a category known as the ""fat burning zone."" Although you burn less calories overall in this zone, the calories burned are primarily from fat stores.A combination of planned exercise (like a 30 minute jog) in addition to increase lifestyle activity (like parking your car farther from the door) can help you lose a significant amount of fat mass., If you find it difficult to get out and exercise or do not have a gym membership, there are a variety exercises that you can do at home with little or no equipment.


If you're a beginner, try walking in place, leg lifts from a chair, or wall push ups. These are low intensity, beginner exercises that can help burn calories, tone muscle and help you reduce fat mass.
If you are a intermediate exerciser, you can try more advanced exercises at home. Include activities like: push-ups, sit-ups, running in place, squats, or mountain climbers. These are activities that will get you sweating and help reduce fat mass.

, Excessive amounts of protein won't build muscle mass (the only way to build muscle is to work your muscles), but it will support your goal to lose weight and reduce excess fat.Lean protein can help support your weight loss and keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to carbohydrates.In general, women need 46 grams of protein daily and men need about 56 grams of protein daily.Including 1 serving of protein at each meal and snack can help you meet this goal.
A serving of meat, poultry, or fish, should be the size and thickness of the palm of your hand (which is about 3-4 oz).
Lean protein to include in your diet can be: eggs, poultry, low-fat dairy, lean beef, legumes, pork, seafood and tofu.

, Studies have shown that low-carb diets result in greater initial weight loss and greater fat reduction long-term compared to low-fat diets.Limiting the amount of carbohydrates you consume can help you lose weight, but specifically reduce the amount of excess fat you carry.


Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods including: fruit, dairy, legumes, grains and starchy vegetables. Because they are so wide spread, it's not ideal or safe to go on a very-low or no-carb diet as you would be limiting a large variety of foods. Aim to consume a moderate amount of carbohydrates, not avoid them.
Limit carbohydrates from grains like bread, rice, pasta or crackers as these foods are not as nutrient dense as other carbohydrates like starchy vegetables or fruit.It's also important to limit grains that are refined or made from white flour like white bread, plain pasta, or white rice.
If you're choosing to consume a grain-based food, choose 100% whole grains over refined grains. Whole grains are higher in fiber and other nutrients that are healthy for you.Choose foods like: 100% whole grain bread, brown rice, or whole grain oats.

, If your goal is to lose fat you may be focusing on lean protein and limiting carbs, but it's also important to make sure that you're still eating a fairly balanced diet. That means including fruits and vegetables as well.Fruits and vegetables are important parts of a balanced diet because they provide a host of nutrients including: fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. Aim to have one to two servings of fruit daily which is either 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup chopped fruit.Also have about three to four servings of vegetables daily which is about 1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens., Studies have shown that both sugar and alcohol can cause weight gain, but specifically increase the amount of excess fat.Cutting out or limiting these foods may help you lose weight and decrease the amount of excess fat you have.


Current recommendations say to limit alcohol to one glass daily for women and two glasses daily for men. However, limiting alcohol further is ideal for weight and fat loss.Limit or avoid foods that are high in sugar like: candy, cookies, cakes, sweetened beverages (regular soda or sweetened tea), sweetened coffee drinks, fruit juices, or sports/energy drinks.

, There are a variety of pills on the market that promise a host of dieting benefits — including quick weight and fat reduction. Diet pills are not regulated by the FDA and may have serious consequences. These fads are not only potentially dangerous, they are also not proven effective.


Some studies conducted by the FDA found that many of these over-the-counter diet pills have been tainted or contaminated with other harmful medications or are a combination of medications that is harmful to your body.Take great caution prior to consuming any diet pills.
Do not take any over-the-counter medications without consulting with your doctor first. These medications may interfere with your prescription medications or current health conditions.
Avoid pills or products that claim quick or easy weight fixes. For example ""lose 10 pounds in 1 week"" or ""drop 2 pant sizes in 2 days."" If it looks easy and too good to be true, it probably is. Err on the side of caution and avoid these.

, Jotting down notes about what you eat can help you stay on track with a diet or new eating habits long-term. These check-ins help you stay accountable and understand exactly what's being eaten everyday.Keeping a food journal can also help you become aware of any ""slip-ups"" or help you see where there are areas for change if needed.
Purchase a food journal notebook, use a few pieces of scrap paper, or download a journaling app on your smart phone or tablet.
Make sure you are being honest and accurate in your food journal. People have a tendency to under-estimate how much they eat.

, Studies have shown that increased stress levels can raise your cortisol levels. This is a hormone frequently referred to the ""fight or flight"" hormone. When it's raised from chronic stress it can increase fat stores in your body — especially in your midsection.Stress is hard to escape. But taking measures to become aware of what causes stress in your life and how to manage it will help reduce the risk of increasing fat mass.
Increased fat mass, especially in your midsection, has been associated with increased health risks including: obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.Try meeting with a life coach or behavioral therapist if you feel your stress is too hard to control or you need a little extra help getting it under control. These health professionals will be able to give you guidance on how to best manage stress.
Write a list of ideas or activities that are relaxing or soothing for you. When you feel stressed, try to engage in these activities to help calm you down. You can try: listening to music, going for a walk, reading a good book, or talking to a friend.

, As you continue to diet, exercise, and lose weight, a good way to measure your progress is to regularly weigh yourself or take your measurements. This can be a motivator for you to keep on going.Weigh yourself about one to two times a week. Aim for the same day of the week and at the same time for the most reliable results.
Also try taking a variety of body measurements. For example, measure your waist, hips or thighs. As you lose weight and decrease fat, you'll notice your whole body shrinking.

Skipping meals or following fad diet plans won't be effective for long-term maintenance of a trim belly.
Ultimately, you'll need to find a healthy diet that you can stick to.;
, If you eat meat, stick to lean meat options such as skinless chicken or turkey. Most fish is a good source of lean protein, and also includes Omega-3 fatty acids which are good for your heart. If you eat beef or pork, make sure you stick to lean cuts of meat, and keep your portions small. Trim away all visible fat.Beans lentils, barley, seeds and nuts and other legumes are a great source of lean protein. Adding beans and peas to your soups, salads, and casseroles adds protein without adding the saturated fats that contribute to belly fat.
Non-meat sources of protein include prepared meat-substitutes such as tofu, seitan, tempeh, veggie burgers, or tofu-dogs.

, Saturated fats to avoid are found in meats and high-fat dairy products such as cheese, milk (and cream), and butter. Some plant-based oils, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil, also contain high levels of saturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats are a better alternative. Polyunsaturated fats are found in many nuts, seeds, avocados, and some fish.The over-consumption of saturated fats is directly linked to increase in belly fat, as well as difficulties with insulin regulation.
Any type of overconsumption leads to weight gain. Aim for a moderate fat intake and try to replace animal fats with plant of fish oils whenever possible.

, A thick midsection is commonly referred to as a ""beer belly"" for good reason! Overconsumption of sugar in the form of alcohol is a primary culprit in developing belly fat. Sugars found in processed foods, sugary sodas, energy drinks, as well as alcoholic beverages, are a common source of belly fat. To lose your belly fat, stay away from these culprits.


Drink water instead of sodas. Carbonated water can make a good substitute. Try squeezing a lemon or lime in your drink for flavor.
Fruit juices are loaded with sugar, and don't carry the benefit of fiber that comes with eating the fruit itself. If you're trying to lose belly fat, keep your consumption of fruit juice to a minimum.
Switch to plain, unsweetened coffee and teas. A single café mocha (medium sized) contains 11 grams of saturated fat, or 55% of the daily allotment recommended by the ADA., Even healthy choices can become unhealthy if you're eating too much. If you're trying to lose belly fat, stick to smaller portion sizes. Try measuring your portions to make sure you're being consistent.Be especially careful of empty extra calories such as white breads and bread products, pasta and white rice.
Restaurants often serve large portions. Instead of cleaning your plate, get a take-away box to go.
Eating from smaller plates and bowls allows your portions to look larger, even if they're smaller.

, Drinking water throughout the day may help you from feeling hungry, which will help with weight control. A glass of water before meals has been shown to help people eat less. The exact amount of water you should consume depends on your own personal chemistry. The color of your urine will show you if you're dehydrated: if it's dark, you should be drinking more water.Water is also found in plenty of foods, particularly melons and other moist fruits.
Flavor your water with fruits, such as watermelon, strawberry or lime. Or fill an ice tray with coconut water, freeze it, and then pop a coconut ice cube or two into your fresh water glass for some extra flavor.

, Eating more slowly encourages smaller portion sizes, and allows you to feel fuller faster. Because your brain takes about 20 minutes longer than your stomach to recognize that it's full, eating slowly allows you to recognize when you're full. You'll eat less, and feel more satisfied at the end of your meal.When you eat too quickly, you don't allow the complex communication between your brain and your belly to connect, and are more likely to overeat.
If you're trying to lose weight, simply taking more time to chew each bite, and allow your mouth to be completely empty between bites, may help.

, Moderate aerobic activity, paired with weight training to increase muscle mass, has been shown effective to reduce belly fat even if overall weight remains the same.Different kinds of aerobic activity include brisk walking, running, aerobics dance classes, swimming, or hiking.


Because you're making a lifestyle change, make sure you find an exercise program that works for you.
Moderate exercise works best. To know if your exercise rate is moderate, see if you can talk while exercising. If you can talk, you're exercising at a moderate rate. If you can loudly sing a favorite song, you should move more quickly.

, Strength training, which includes weight lifting, stomach crunches, etc. builds lean muscle mass. Because muscles burn more calories than fat does, your body will use calories more efficiently. Doing strength training at least three days per week, paired with moderate aerobic exercise, has been connected to losing belly fat.Exercises that firm and tone the stomach muscles will not eliminate belly fat by themselves. In fact, stomach crunches have little effect on the fat that's carried around the belly.
You don't have to belong to a gym to do strength training or weight lifting. You can follow a video at home.
Simple body weight exercises like the plank, push ups, lunges, the bridge, squats, calf raises, and arm circles all build muscle.

, Stress triggers release of the hormone cortisol, and cortisol both reduces muscle mass and increases the accumulation of belly fat. You'll likely decrease your belly fat by engaging in meditation, because you'll lower your stress level. Doing guided meditations, mindfulness meditations, or yoga serve to decrease your stress levels.You should never feel sharp, stabbing pain when doing yoga. Stretch only as it feels good to you.
Consider taking a meditation or yoga class to help you learn the basics of yoga postures.

, Having enough sleep has benefits for your overall well-being: your mood will be better, your stress level lower, and your attention will improve.Most people need between 7 to 9 hours of good sleep per night, but some people may need more. Teens need at least 9 hours of sleep per night, and younger children need 10 hours.Try to go to sleep at the same time every night, and get good quality sleep so that you feel rested when you wake up.
Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages in the evening, as this lowers the quality of your sleep.

, Losing visceral fat depends on changing lifestyle factors, including diet and exercise. This is a long-term process. The most effective weight-loss programs aren't quick, but rather take place over time.Don't worry so much about the scales when you're trying to lose belly fat. The changes you're making will replace fat with muscle, which weighs more, so you're likely to notice changes in the way your clothes fit before you notice changes on the scale.
You'll feel better as a result of making lifestyle changes, which won't necessarily show up on your scales.

, Gaining weight when you're pregnant is natural. For the first six weeks following childbirth, take it easy. Don't attempt to lose weight right away. If you lose weight too soon, it can take longer for your body to recover from childbirth.If you're breastfeeding, give yourself at least 8 weeks, or 2 months, to recover.
Your body may naturally shed the extra pounds when it's ready. Breastfeeding helps with this natural weight-loss process.

, When you're ready to start losing weight, take it slowly. You can easily reduce your daily food intake by 500 calories through eating smaller portions, swapping high-calorie foods for lower-calorie options, or skipping high-calorie food choices altogether. Switching from high-fat sweet coffee drinks, such as caramel lattes, to plain coffee or espresso, or substituting water for sugary sodas, will help make the weight loss easier.If you're breastfeeding, losing weight too quickly can interfere with milk production.
Talk to your medical care provider to find out her recommendations before starting any weight loss or exercise program.

, Lay on the floor or a firm mattress, either on your side or your back. Bend your knees, so that your thighs are perpendicular to your torso. Take a deep breath in, then as you breathe out tighten your pelvic floor muscles. Then, gently pull your belly button in and up. Hold this pose for 10 seconds, then slowly relax. Wait for 5 seconds, then repeat the exercise. Make sure you continue to breathe throughout.If you've had a caesarian section, you may feel some gentle pulling in your muscles.
You shouldn't feel any pain while doing this exercise. If you feel any twinges, sharp stabbing pains, or other discomfort, release any tension in your muscles and relax your body.

, Postnatal yoga classes can be a great way to learn new poses that will strengthen your pelvic floor and your abdominal muscles. In addition, yoga classes will help you expand your breathing which will help with the fatigue often experienced by new mothers.Make sure you strengthen your pelvic floor before working on your abdominal muscles.
The company of other women experiencing postpartum weight gain may also be a helpful support to you during this time.

, Pushing a stroller is a great exercise, and your baby will enjoy it too. Remember to keep your back straight as you walk, which will firm your belly muscles.Remember that your joints and ligaments are looser than they were prior to your childbirth, so be careful of straining them.
Women who combine exercise with lower-calorie diets had the most success of losing belly fat during research studies., After your lochia (postnatal bleeding) has stopped, you can return to the pool. If you've not been including swimming or water aerobics classes in your exercise routine, this might be a good time to try it. Swimming and water classes are good for your whole body, and don't stress your joints the way weight-bearing exercise does.Many water classes have options for including your young child. Check with your local gym or pool for more information.
If the gym doesn't have a class that includes your child, it might offer child care.

, Some health care providers recommend waiting as long as 5 months before engaging in high-intensity aerobics or running. This will allow your pelvic muscles to heal from childbirth.Check with your medical care provider about what your own health situation is like before starting to do more strenuous exercise.
Walking, swimming, and yoga are all examples of exercise that may be better options for your body during this time.

, Some women are able to return to pre-baby weight and shape, but many women find their bodies different after childbirth. You may find that you have wider hips, a softer belly, and a larger waistline.Get to know your new, post-childbirth, body, and allow yourself time to adjust.
Having a new shape doesn't mean you're unhealthy. Make the choices that fit into a new, healthy lifestyle for yourself and your new child.

, Fat carried throughout the body beneath the skin is called subcutaneous fat, and its hazards are largely cosmetic. The fat found deeper within your body, called visceral fat, is associated with belly fat. Visceral fat surrounds your internal organs, and results in some serious health risks.Visceral fat wraps itself around internal organs, such as the intestine, kidney and liver.
This kind of belly fat is unrelated to the fat cells that are found as subcutaneous fat.

, Some of the conditions associated with visceral fat include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Patients with high levels of belly fat were three times more likely to develop dementia.Research indicates a connection between high levels of belly fat and premature death - no matter what the person's overall weight might be. This means even if your Body Mass Index (BMI) is within normal levels, you might still be carrying a dangerous amount of belly fat.
Another hazard is developing insulin resistance, or ""metabolic syndrome"".

, Wrap the tape measure around your stomach, just above your hipbone. Pull the tape tight, but not so tight that it pinches you. It should fit snugly and be even all the way around. When you've got the tape measure in place, exhale and relax. Pinch your thumb and forefinger together at the measuring tape, in order to see what your measurement is.For women, a waist measurement of more than 35 inches (or 89 centimeters) is associated with high levels of belly fat.
Make sure you're not sucking your stomach in, or your information won't be accurate.
Remember that this measurement is not about cosmetic concern, but good health.

To calculate your BMI using the metric system: Divide your weight (kg) ÷ height (m)^2.

Example if you are 1.70 meters (5.6 ft) and weight 61.235 kg then you would calculate your BMI as follows: 61.235 ÷ 1.70^2 = 21.188.


To calculate your BMI using the English system: Divide your X 703.

Example if you are 5'7"" and weight 135 pounds then you would calculate your BMI as follows: X 703 = 21.188.

;
, A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is considered normal. A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30.0 and above considered obese.


You should aim for an ideal weight that results in your BMI getting or staying within the 18.5-24.9.

, Brainstorm why you want to lose weight. Is it for health, vanity? Think about what your final goal is, write it down. Put this goal somewhere were you can see it regularly, such as on the frig, your bathroom mirror, or your desktop.

, Despite what advertisers like to tell you, you cannot perform targeted weight loss (except with liposuction). Instead in order to lose weight in your ""problem"" areas (hips, thighs or stomach) you must lose weight everywhere. And the only way to do this is by consuming less calories than you burn. Continue to the below section ""Plan Your Diet"" to learn how to do this.

, Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories you body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, etc. This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs.


To calculate your BMR using the following formula : 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)

Example: A 5'7"", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5.



, If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3-1.4. If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4-1.5. This resulting number is an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day.


Example: If you, like the above women, had a BMR of 1408.5 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 1972 calories per day.

, A reasonable calorie goal would be to consume 15-30% less calories than you currently burn per day. To perform this calculation multiply how many calories you burn per day (as calculated in the the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) by 0.70 - 0.85.


Example: If you, like the above women, burned approximately 1972 calories per day then you would want to eat between 1380 (2695 x 0.70) and 1676 (2695 x 0.85) calories per day.
The larger your deficit, closer to 30% (1380 calories/day), the quicker your diet will be but the harder it will be to maintain. The smaller your deficit, closer to 15% (1676 calories/day), the easier your diet will be to maintain but your weight loss will be slower.

, In general you want to consume between 0.5-0.77 grams of protein per pound of body weight . The more active you are, especially if you do strenuous exercise, the more protein you should eat. Protein is needed to repair your muscles as you age and after workouts.


If you do not eat enough protein when dieting you will lose muscle mass as well as fat. Therefore, if you want be smaller and toned, not smaller and saggy, make sure to eat enough protein while in a calorie deficit.
To calculate how many grams of protein you need a day, multiply your weight by 0.5-0.77.

Example: If you weigh 135 pounds, you would need to multiply your weight by 0.5 to calculate your lowest protein need as 68 grams of protein/day. To calculate your highest protein need, multiple 135 pounds by 0.77 to find you need up to 104 grams of protein per day.


To convert protein grams to protein calories, know that there are 4 calories per gram of protein. Therefore to convert grams to calories, simply multiply by 4.

Example: If you are 135 pounds you should eat between 68 x 4 = 272 calories and 104 x 4 = 419 calories of protein per day.



, When dieting it is often tempting to cut all, or nearly all, fat from your diet. But fat is necessary for your long term health. Fat is a necessary building block of healthy tissues and is needed for proper hormone production. Not eating enough fat can actually hamper weight loss, not to mention make you really hungry. So plan on 20-35% of your calorie intake being from fat .


To calculate how many calories of fat you should eat in a day, multiple 0.20 and 0.35 by your calories goal.

Example: If you are planning a 1676 calorie diet multiply 1676 x 0.20 to get 335 calories, and 1676 x 0.35 to get 587 calories. From this you now know that if you are planning a 1676 calories per day diet, you should get between 335-587 of these calories from fat.


To calculate how many grams of fat you should consume, know that there are 9 calories in a gram of fat. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 9.

Example: From the example above, you now know that if you are planning a 1676 calorie per day diet, you should get between 339-593 of these calories from fat. 335 calories ÷ 9 = 37 grams, 587 calories ÷ 9 = 65 grams. So if you are planning a 1676 calories per day diet you should eat between 37-65 grams of fat per day.



, Unlike protein and fat, which are both needed to build structures in your body, carbohydrates are not needed for structural components. Carbohydrates are just used for energy. Therefore your body does not have strict carbohydrate needs. Instead the amount of carbohydrates your body will need is calculated from the calories left over in your diet after you meet your daily fat and protein needs.


Example: If you are a 135 pound, 30-year-old active woman who is planning 1676 calories per day. From the ""Calculate how much protein you need in a day"" step you know that you need 272-419 of your calories from protein in a day. From the ""Calculate how much fat you need in a day"" step you know you need 335-587 calories from fat in a day. Therefore the remaining calories up to 1676 will be from carbohydrates.

To calculate the minimum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your highest protein and fat needs, 419 calories from protein and 587 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1676 calorie per day (1676 - 419 - 587) to get 670 carbohydrate calories per day.
To calculate the maximum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your lowest protein and fat needs, 272 calories from protein and 335 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1676 calorie per day (1676 - 272 - 335) to get 1069 carbohydrate calories per day.


To change carbohydrate calories to grams, know that there are 4 calories per carbohydrate gram. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 4.

Example: If you are having a low carb day (higher fat, protein day) and are allowed 670 calories of carbohydrates per day, you would be allowed 670 ÷ 4 = 167.5 grams of carbohydrates in a day.

Cut down on calories.,
Eat a protein and fiber-filled breakfast every day.,
Include a serving of protein at each meal.,
Fill up on fruits and vegetables.,
Include whole grains.,
Replace your liquid calories with water.,
Limit processed foods, sugar and refined carbohydrates from your diet.,
Do 30 minutes of interval-based cardiovascular activity every day.,
Weight train every other day.,
Add a 30 minute walk into your day.,
Increase your sleep.",How to Lose 5 Pounds Fast," In order to lose weight, you'll need to cut down on some extra calories in your diet. Lower-calorie diets can help you lose 5 pounds in an appropriate amount of time.


Cutting out about 500 calories a day will help you lose about 1–2 pounds per week. You may also choose to cut out 750 calories daily to help you lose weight slightly faster.Although cutting calories helps induce weight loss, eating too few calories or eating under 1200 calories daily is not safe or considered healthy weight loss. You'll be at increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, fatigue, loss of lean muscle mass and slow weight loss long-term.Use a food journal or food journal app to calculate how many calories you typically consume. Subtract 500–750 calories from this number to get a new upper limit that might help you lose weight.
If you subtract 500 calories and you get a value less than 1,200, use 1,200 calories as your limit. You can burn additional calories through exercise.;
, Protein and fiber help to boost metabolism and keep you feeling satisfied longer.


Studies have shown that higher protein diets (and higher protein meals) can help you stay satisfied, reduce your appetite and help fuel weight loss.Start your day with a higher protein breakfast to help keep grazing and snacking to a minimum.
Like protein, fiber also helps you feel more satisfied longer. In addition, it helps to provide bulk to your meals so you may be able to feel satisfied with less foods.Examples of higher protein, high fiber breakfasts include: 2 egg omelet with low-fat cheese and sauteed vegetables or 1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup (28g) of raspberries.

, In addition to filling up on protein at breakfast, include a serving of lean protein at each meal.


Protein is a great nutrient for weight loss. When eaten regularly throughout the day, it can help decrease appetite, fuel your metabolism and manage your overall energy levels.One serving of protein is about 3–4 oz (21-28g). This is also about the size of a deck of cards.Including a serving at each meal and snack can help you meet your minimum daily needs.
Lean protein foods are not only high in protein, but also low in calories which can help support weight loss. Try: seafood, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef or legumes.

, To help keep you feeling satisfied and add volume to your meals, fill up on five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.


Both fruits and vegetables are lower in calories, but high in a variety of essential nutrients. They can add a significant amount of bulk and volume to your meals to help you feel more satisfied with fewer calories.Try to eat one serving of fruit plus one or two servings of vegetables at each meal. This will help you meet the recommended five to nine servings daily.
Also track your portions. Aim for 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens or 1/2 cup of fruit (or one small piece)., 100% whole grains are a nutritious addition to your diet. They provide fiber, vitamins and minerals to your diet.Although whole grains are healthy, moderating how much you eat during the day and over the course of the week can help you lose weight. Studies have shown that those people who eat fewer carbohydrates (especially from carb rich foods like pasta, white rice, bread and baked goods) can lose more weight faster.
Include only one to two servings of grains daily. This can allow you to enjoy these nutritious foods but also still lose weight.
Measure out appropriate servings of these foods. Aim for 1 oz or 1/2 cup of whole grains per serving.Try oatmeal or quinoa.

, Liquid calories can pack on weight quickly. Studies have shown that sweetened beverages add a significant amount of excess calories to your diet and can lead to weight gain long-term.Cutting out lattes, smoothies, sugary coffee drinks, sports drinks, soda and alcoholic beverages will significantly reduce your calorie intake. Many health professionals consider these types of beverages as ""empty calories,"" that give no nutritional benefit.Increase your water or clear fluid (like flavored water or decaf unsweetened tea) intake to replace calorie-containing liquids.
Aim for about eight to 13 8-oz glasses (2–2.5 litres) of these types of no calorie beverages each day to help you maintain proper hydration., These low-nutrient foods can make you pack on extra pounds or prevent you from losing weight. Limiting these foods can help you lose 5 pounds more quickly.Limit or cut out highly processed foods like: frozen TV dinners, canned soups, processed meats, canned pastas, chips, crackers and pretzels.
Also limit or cut out processed sweets and sugars like those found in ice cream, candy, cookies, pastries and sweetened beverages. Instead, grab a piece of fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth.

, This should include a warm up and cool down, then periods of medium intensity interspersed with periods of high-intensity, such as sprints.


There are more weight-loss and metabolism-boosting benefits with interval training than working out at the same intensity for 45 minutes. You have increased fat burn and increased metabolism long after the workout has been completed.If you can oversee your own intervals, then use a treadmill, gym cycle, stair stepper, elliptical, rowing machine or go swimming. Do one to two minutes sprinting and spend two to four minutes recovering. Try downloading an app that will alert you when to switch from high- to low-intensity.
If you are unsure how to begin interval training, sign up for a cardiovascular gym class. Good choices for losing weight quickly are boot camp, cardio burn, and spinning.

, Make sure you do at least 30 minutes of weight training at one time to boost your metabolism and gain lean muscle.Seek out professional advice from an exercise specialist, personal trainer, kinesiologist, or physiotherapist before engaging in a serious weight training regime.


Do 30 minutes of squats, lunges, push ups, pull ups, planks, or other body weight exercises. You can choose to do this at home, at the gym on machines or as part of a class that uses hand weights and body weight exercises.
Research alternative methods through personal training videos online or sign up for several sessions with a personal trainer to start losing weight.
Always include a day off in between weight lifting. This allows your muscles to rest and recovery from being worked with weights.

, You can burn 100-200 or more extra calories with a walk on your lunch break, after work, after dinner or right when you wake up. This can aid in supporting quicker weight loss.Buy a pedometer and ensure you are taking at least 10,000 steps per day. Doctors recommend an activity level of 10,000 to 12,000 steps to remain healthy. An increase in steps may also help you shed a few extra lbs (or kilos).
If you don't have time for a 30 minute walk, trying walking three times a day for 10 minutes a session.

, If you aren't getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night, then your sleep habits may actually be working against your goal to lose weight.


Increasing sleep may help balance hormones, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.In addition, adequate sleep helps to regulate your appetite. When you're sleep deprived you might feel more hungry and be more susceptible to making poor choices.
Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep nightly.Go to bed earlier or wake up later if you can.

Watch your snack intake.,
Sleep when you need to.,
Do heavier workouts.,
Locate a support group for new moms.",How to Lose Baby Weight2," If you're tired, it can be easy to just grab whatever is handy. Instead of reaching for a bag of chips or a pint of ice cream, try something a little more healthy but equally filling. Keep your pantry and refrigerator stocked with nutritious foods so you don't reach for something that can set you back.


Fruits, carrot sticks, granola and cereal bars, nuts, wheat crackers, low-fat cheese and yogurt are all relatively easy to prepare but will leave you satisfied.
If you take some time to split bulk foods into individual portions ahead of time, that will help when you don't have the energy to prepare something.

, It may be hard to find time to nap, but this will help reset your body to give you more energy in the daytime and give your body the rest it needs to repair itself, which includes losing pregnancy weight. In addition, sleeping when you're tired helps decrease the amount of cortisol in your blood; this is the stress hormone that can make it harder for you to lose weight.

, After the first few months, you can go back to your previous workout routine. You may find at first that you've lost fitness; be patient with yourself while you work back up to your pre-baby fitness level.


Try cardio exercises like running, swimming, biking or hiking several times per week for half an hour at a time.
Do light weight training to gain muscle strength.
Take an aerobics class designed specifically for new moms. The instructor will focus on ""trouble"" areas to help you get back to your pre-pregnancy body.
Take a post-pregnancy yoga class to improve your muscle tone., This could be a ""mommy and me"" type class or just a fun group of ladies in your town who lean on each other for support. These women can help you stay motivated and focused on your goal of losing baby weight.

"

Do the right abdominal exercises.,
Avoid foods that make you bloated.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Lose Baby Weight3," During pregnancy, the outer muscles in your abdomen stretch to make room for the growing baby. After the baby is born, those muscles can stay stretched and separated, giving your stomach a pouched appearance. To get the muscles back into shape, use the following techniques:


Brace your stomach. Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders back and focus on tightening your stomach muscles and sucking your stomach in. Repeating this exercise throughout the day helps tighten the muscles over time.
Make the exercise harder by using a weight. Hold a dumbbell outstretched in front of you while you tighten your stomach muscles. You can even use your baby as a weight.Don't do crunches. Doing crunches can actually cause the muscles to stay separated, since it puts pressure in the wrong place., You can make your stomach look slimmer by avoiding foods and drinks that cause bloating and make your stomach look distended. Limit the following substances while you're trying to lose baby weight:


Salty foods. Salt causes water retention, so stay away from salty snacks like chips and pretzels.
Carbonated beverages. Sodas, even plain soda water, causes gas, and can make your belly look bloated.

, Drinking water will help you lose water weight and flush toxins from your system. You'll look slimmer, and you'll feel more healthy and energetic. If drinking 8 glasses of water a day is tough for you, try getting water by drinking herbal tea and eating whole fruits and vegetables.

Record your current eating patterns.,
Determine your current average calorie intake.,
Determine your current average daily macronutrient intake.,
Plan your diet.",How to Lose Body Fat (Women)2," Take the first week to analyze your current diet habits. To do this, start a food diary. Record everything that you eat and drink for a week, be sure to include snacks and portion sizes.


As you record your food and drink intake, also record your mood. You will be looking for patterns. Do you eat when sad, bored, stressed?

If you find that you do eat when emotional, keep this in mind when starting your diet. You do not want to mindlessly fall back into old emotional habits.



, After a week of recording everything you eat, analyze your weekly food intake. Use a free online nutrition site like to determine how many calories you consume. Add up the calories you consumed for the entire week. Then divide this number by 7 to find your daily average intake of calories.

, Macronutrients refers to how much fat, carbohydrates and protein is in the foods you eat. Use a free online nutrition site to determine the macronutrient content of your food. Determine your daily average by adding up your macronutrient intake for the entire week and dividing by 7. Do this for your daily fat, carbohydrate and protein intake.


It is important to know your macronutrient intake because you want to restrict the right kind of calories to stay healthy on a diet.

, Now that you have your target calorie and macronutrient ranges and have analyzed your old eating habits, figure out what you need to cut or change in order to meet your new goals.


This takes some time, play around with menu ideas and calculate the calorie and macronutrient content. Find a diet that fits your taste and lifestyle but is within the nutrition guidelines.

Incorporate good foods into your diet.,
Cut out highly processed foods.,
Enlist family/roommates.,
Clean your kitchen.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Eat frequent, small meals.,
Drink water.,
Record everything.",How to Lose Body Fat (Women)3," Good foods you may want to consider adding or substituting into your diet are as follow:


Good protein sources include skinless chicken breast, ground turkey, bison, egg whites, Greek yogurt, and tofu.
Good fat sources include almonds, peanuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, fish, egg yolks, and olive oil.
Good carbohydrate sources include unprocessed carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, fruit, oatmeal, bran, wheat germ, Bulgarian wheat, beans, and vegetables.

, Highly processed foods include bread, pastries, pasta, fast food, and frozen prepared meals. The reason for avoiding processed food is threefold:


First, processed food is usually high in calories and low in nutrients.
Second, processed carbohydrates usually have high glycemic indexes, which means they cause insulin spikes that can promote weight gain - not what you want when trying to lose body fat.
Third, processed food usually does not contain much fiber, which can leave you feeling hungry.

, It helps to diet with the people you live with. It is easier to eat clean if you are not surrounded by temptation and bad influences. Try to enlist family and roommates to join your diet.

, Do yourself a favor and throw out any junk food in your house. It is easier to stay on your diet if tempting junk food is not in easy reach.

, Go to the store and stock up on the food you need for your diet, lean proteins, vegetables and complex carbohydrates.

, Spread your calories out throughout the day. Consider eating 5-6 small meals a day instead of just three. Also make sure to eat breakfast when you first wake up.

, Drink water with and between meals. This will help you feel fuller while dieting.

, The only way to make this diet work is to follow it. The only way you know you are following this diet, is if you record everything you eat or drink. This includes recording accurate portion sizes.


Do not estimate portion sizes, use measuring cups/spoons, or better yet weight everything.

Strength train.,
Do a little cardiovascular exercise.",How to Lose Body Fat (Women)4," When in a caloric deficit, your body will burn its reserves for energy, fat as well as muscle. You want to burn fat, but you do not want to burn muscle. To help maintain your muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, consider taking up weight training.


Do not be afraid of ""bulking up"" by weight training. Women have up to 40X less testosterone than men . The bulky women seen in bodybuilding competitions take hormone replacements and train for years to get that way. Instead weight training for normal women (not taking supplements) will result not in lots of mass, but in a toned shapely figure. So do not be afraid to lift heavy!
To maximize your weight training focus on compound movements, deadlifts, squats, bench press, military press and pull ups. As you get more advanced start incorporating isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, glut bridges, etc.
If you have not weight trained before, be prepared to be very sore the first week. Like all new exercise, introduce it slowly to let your body adapt and avoid injury.

, Cardiovascular exercise is good for overall health. Therefore if you don't do any, consider incorporating a half-hour of cardiovascular exercise into your routine a few days a week.


Do not get caught in the vicious cardio/diet cycle. The cardio/diet cycle is when you exercise to burn off calories, but this makes you hungrier, which makes you eat more, forcing you to exercise more, making you even hungrier, etc. Keep cardiovascular exercise to under 2-3 hours a week unless actively training for a fitness goal. Doing more cardiovascular exercise than this can actually inhibit fat loss by raising cortisol levels . To avoid this problem, control your calorie deficit in the kitchen, not on the treadmill.
Some cardiovascular exercise you might consider including are:

A light 2 mile (3.2 km) job before breakfast a few days a week.
20 minutes on the stairmill after weightlifting.
High intensity interval training a few days a week.

Understand how to set a reasonable diet timeline.,
Calculate your daily caloric deficit.,
Calculate your rate of fat loss.",How to Lose Body Fat (Women)5," Often it is tempting to set a diet timeline first, then figure out your calorie goals. However, this often leads to unrealistic dieting expectations, crash dieting and yo-yo dieting. To avoid this, figure out a healthy calorie deficit first in the ""Calculate your calorie goal"" step, then use this section to calculate fast you will lose weight on this diet.

, To calculate how fast you will lose weight, subtract your calorie goal (from the ""Calculate your calorie goal"" step) from how many calories you burn per day (from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step). This will give you how many calories you should be burning per day.


Example #1: If you burn 1972 calories a day (as calculated from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) and decided on a 15% deficit for a caloric goal of 1676 (from step ""Calculate your calorie goal"") then you would have a deficit of 1972 - 1676 = 296 calories per day.
Example #2: If you burn 1972 calories a day (as calculated from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) and decided on a 30% deficit for a caloric goal of 1380 (from step ""Calculate your calorie goal"") then you would have a deficit of 1972 - 1380 = 592 calories per day.

, There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat . Therefore in order to burn one pound of fat you would need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume.


To calculate your rate of fat loss, multiple your daily caloric deficit (from step ""Calculate your daily caloric deficit"") by 7. Then divide the resulting number by 3,500. This will tell you how many pounds of fat you can expect to lose per week.

Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 296 calories you would need to multiply 296 by 7 to get 2,072. Now divide 2,072 by 3,500 to calculate how much fat you will lose per week, 0.59 or a little over a half pound per week.
Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 592 calories you would need to multiply 592 by 7 to get 4,144. Now divide 4,144 by 3,500 to calculate how much fat you will lose per week, 1.182 or a little over a pound per week.
From these above examples you can see that a larger deficit results in more fat loss per week. However, keep in mind that a larger deficit is harder to maintain and may lead to binging.

Consider other weight loss methods.",How to Lose 50 Pounds," When you're trying to lose 50 pounds, you're aiming for a long-term goal. This will take several months and seeing a Registered Dietitian can make sure you choose a diet plan that is safe and effective for you long-term.


Registered Dietitians are weight loss and nutrition experts. They can help design a diet and a meal plan that will help you lose weight over time.
In addition, a dietitian can act as a accountability method for you over the months you're following the diet. Plus, if you hit a stall or slip up, the dietitian can help get you through.
Search online or ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a local dietitian that focuses on weight loss.
In addition, when you have 50 pounds or more of weight to loss you may also have obesity-related health conditions (like diabetes or high blood pressure). Working with a dietitian who is a medical professional can make sure that these health conditions are monitored as well.;
, Many studies show that keeping a detailed food journal is beneficial to long-term weight loss and weight maintenance.Start a food journal to help you keep track of your meals and provide you with a method of accountability.


Start your food journal prior to changing your diet. This can help you see where in your diet you can make changes. Take notes on your food diary about things that you should stop, things you should start or other trouble areas in your diet.
Once you start your diet, track all meals, snacks and beverages. Review your journal most days to make sure you're stick to your plan.

, Losing weight will require you to eat less everyday. Cutting out calories is an easy way to monitor how much you're eating and result in weight loss.


To lose 1-2 pounds per week, most health professionals recommend cutting out about 500 calories from your current intake each day.If you plan to exercise for an hour or more per day, try a more conservative number, such as 300 or 400 calories, allowing exercise to account for an equal amount of the change.
Never eat less than 1200 calories daily. Even if you want to lose large quantities of weight, it's never advisable to eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. You'll increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies, loss of lean muscle mass and over time you weight loss may actually slow., When you're trying to lose weight and are cutting calories, you want to make sure that you're eating enough protein each day. Protein is an essential nutrient for successful weight loss.


Many times when you're cutting calories and are increasing your physical activity, you may feel more hungry throughout the day. Ensuring you're eating adequate amounts of protein can help minimize bothersome hunger pangs throughout the day.In addition, protein helps fuel weight loss. It keeps you feeling satisfied with your meals and helps support your metabolism.To meet your protein needs daily, include 1-2 servings of protein at every meal and snack. Each serving of protein should be about 3-4 oz.Also choose lean protein. Leaner proteins are lower in fat and calories and can help you stay within your calorie limit.
Choose lean proteins like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu.

, Fruits and vegetables are key food groups to include in your diet when you're trying to lose weight. Aim to have either a fruit, vegetable or both at each meal.


Fruits and vegetables can support weight loss because they are low in calories and high in fiber. They provide bulk to your meals which can help you feel satisfied with less in addition to keeping you satisfied longer.These foods are also very nutrient dense. They contain very high amounts of vitamins and minerals which are key to overall health.
Measure the portions of fruits and vegetables to 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and 1/2 cup of fruit., Include regular servings of whole grains in your diet as well. These foods can also help you with weight loss.


Whole grains are very nutritious and help with weight loss by adding more fiber to your diet. Fiber helps you feel full longer and can keep your appetite suppressed longer.Refined grains, like white bread, white rice or other baked goods made with white flour, are typically very low in fiber and other nutrients. These are considered empty calories and should be avoided or eaten only on a special occasion.
Make sure to measure grains. A serving is 1 oz or 1/2 cup total.Although lower carb diets do result in somewhat quicker weight loss, remember you're trying to make a lifestyle change and not follow a diet.If you truly enjoy eating carbs like bread, rice or pasta, eliminating might not be a realistic lifestyle change for you.

, While there are many foods that will support and fuel your weight loss, there are a few that should be strictly limited.


High fat foods like fried foods or fast foods should be limited or restricted. They are high in fat and calories and can lead to a weight plateau or weight gain if eaten frequently.Avoid foods like fast foods, fried foods, fatty cuts of meat and processed meats.
In addition to fatty foods, try to avoid foods that are high in added sugars. Like fat, lots of added sugar comes with a significant amount of extra calories as well. Eating many of these foods can increase weight.Avoid foods like: sweetened beverages, breakfast pastries, candy, cookies, cakes or pies, ice creams or frozen yogurts, yogurts with candy and jellies/jams.

, Joint problems and excess weight can determine how much you exercise and what types of activities you can do.


Workout 30 to 60 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week. Always do your cardio workouts for at least 20 minutes at a time.For faster weight loss, do cardio for 45 minutes 5 to 6 times per week.Do low-impact exercise, like swimming, water aerobics, walking, elliptical training and/or cycling, if you have joint problems. If walking is painful because of your weight, then choose water workouts until you have lost 20 lbs.
Do high-impact exercise, if you don’t have joint problems. High-impact running, jumping and boot camps will burn fat the fastest, making it easier to obtain your goals.

, Like cardio, strength training exercises can help you lose weight and keep it off long-term.Weight lifting or strength training exercises do not burn as many calories as cardio. However, they do help to increase lean muscle mass and decrease your risk of osteoporosis.Also, with increased muscle mass, your body will burn more calories at rest. Your metabolism will be higher and it'll be easier to maintain your weight.
Sign up for a training class if you have never used weights before. You can learn how to use weights or weight machines correctly.
You can start with free weights of 2 to 5 lbs. (0.9 to 2.3 kg) or opt for heavier free weights and weight machines after a month of strength training.

, Find someone who is looking to make a lifestyle change. Working out with a friend makes exercise more fun and it'll help you stick to your goal long-term.Sign up for fitness classes, personal training classes or simply go for walks together.
Many personal trainers offer reduced rates to partners or groups of people.
If you can’t find someone to make a goal with you, join a group like Weight Watchers. Weekly weigh-ins are mostly important for moral support.

, Try something new each month. This may help you stay interested in physical activity and help prevent getting into an exercise rut.


If you notice you're getting bored with your workout or it's becoming too easy, try something new. Try group classes, trying exercising outdoors or even switching the time of day.
Also try doing exercise that is more fun. You can play a sport, go for a hike or even go kayaking as more nontraditional forms of exercise.

, In general, following a diet typically refers to a more short-term program. However, losing large quantities of weight will take much more than a diet. It'll take life long changes to lifestyle.


Focus on making changes to your lifestyle instead of following a diet. Keeping your weight off long term will require lifestyle changes over a diet.If there are changes you've made to your lifestyle that are hard to keep or don't fit with who you are, make changes or try new things until you find a plan that works for you.

, Having a support group while you aim to lose 50 pounds will be just as important as following a nutritious diet and exercising regularly.


Those people who had a support group while they were trying to lose weight lost more weight and kept it off longer compared to those without a support group.Talk to friends or family members about being your support group. Tell them you want to lose 50 pounds and need them for support and encouragement as you embark on your weight loss journey.
A support group will also give you more accountability. Ask your friends or family members to track your weight loss with you or be present for your weekly weigh-in.

, Watching your progress each week or month can be a very motivating factor when you're losing weight.


Consider weighing yourself on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Not only is seeing weight loss exciting, studies have shown that those who weigh-in regularly see more weight loss and are able to maintain their weight loss better than those who do not weigh-in regularly.Keep track of your progress on a weight loss timeline, calendar or journal. If you notice you're not losing weight or are gaining weight back, revisit your diet and exercise routine to make any necessary changes.

, Losing 50 pounds is a large weight goal and will take time. To help you stay motivated over that time period, consider setting up small and large rewards for your successes.


Schedule in certain times when you will reward yourself. Maybe you plan a little treat for when you've lost the first 10 pounds, but a larger reward when you've lost 25 pounds.
When you're losing weight, do not reward yourself with food, dinners out or an extra glass of wine. These items can work against your great progress.
Instead, try rewarding yourself with things that will support continued weight loss and progress. For example: buy a new exercise outfit, download 10 new songs to your exercise playlist, purchase a new pair of jeans or a new pair of shoes.
You can also reward yourself for sticking to your diet for a certain amount of time. It's hard following a diet or weight loss plan long-term, set up a fun event or a shopping trip after 6 months of dieting.

, After a few months of better eating and more regular physical activity, you might not have noticed a lot of progress or may be having difficulty staying motivated long-term. Consider other methods of weight loss.


Following a diet or lifestyle change for long periods of time can be difficult. In addition, it can be frustrating to wait months and months to lose large quantities of weight.
You may want to consider speaking to a weight loss doctor or medical weight loss program. They may offer meal replacements, meal planning and even weight loss medications to help you continue with your goal.
You may also want to consider surgical intervention. This is only reserved for those who are obese or morbidly obese, but is another method to lose weight more easily if you have continuously struggled in the past.

Reduce water retention.",How to Lose 3 Pounds a Week," Although many sources use 2,000 as a general amount, your estimated energy (calorie) requirements depend upon sex, age and activity.


Go to http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/usda_food_patterns/EstimatedCalorieNeedsPerDayTable.pdf to see a chart of calorie allowances.
For example, a 30-year-old man who is sedentary should eat 2,400 calories, while a moderately active man would eat 2,800 and an active man would eat 3,000.
For a 30-year-old woman, the calorie recommendations would be 1,800 (sedentary), 2,000 (moderately active) and 2,200 (active).;

People who cut their food intake drastically can feel dizzy, nauseous and have health complications. You may lose 3 lbs. a week simply by reducing the amount you eat and increasing your activity.

,


This means that for a 30-year-old moderately active man, you will go from eating 2,400 calories to eating 1,800 calories during the week.
For a 30-year-old moderately active woman, you will go from eating 2,000 calories to eating 1,500 calories per day.
Subtract the 2 numbers to calculate the number of calories you are cutting. For example, 600 for a 30-year-old man and 500 for a 30-year-old woman.
Multiply that number by 7 to see how many calories can be totaled just with your diet. For example, 4,200 for the man and 3,500 for a woman.

There are two methods to figuring out how much weight you should lose: BMI or body mass index and ideal body weight. Both are equations easily found online that can give you an idea of exactly how much weight you need to lose.
There are a few different BMI categories. If your BMI falls into the range of 25.24.9 you're considered over weight and typically have 40-60 pounds of excess weight. If you're BMI falls into the range of 30-34.9 you're considered obese and have 60-80 pounds of excess weight. If you're BMI is over 35.0 you're considered morbidly obese and have over 80 pounds of excess weight to lose.Also figure out your ideal body weight. This is dependent on your height and gender. Subtract your ideal body weight from your current weight to get an idea of how much excess weight you're carrying.Compare the amount of weight you need to lose from both equations. You can average the two, or choose one or the other to follow.;
, Even if you have a lot of weight to lose, you don't want to try any risky diets or aim to lose your weight quickly. Slow, gradual weight loss is safe and sustainable.


Most health professionals only recommend losing about 1-2 pounds a week.Although slow, this rate of weight loss is sustainable and you'll be able to have an easier time maintaining this weight loss long-term.
Take your desired weight loss goal or total excess weight and figure out how many weeks it'll take you to lose that amount of weight. For example, if you want to lose 50 pounds and are aiming to lose 2 pounds per week, it'll take you roughly 25 weeks or about 6 months.
You may lose weight quicker the first few months of your diet. This is normal when you have larger quantities of weight to lose. However, this shouldn't be your target weight loss rate long-term.

, Knowing how much weight you need to lose and about the time you'll need to give yourself to lose it will help you define specific goals for yourself.


Realistic and well-planned weight loss goals can keep you focused and motivated. This is especially true if you'll be losing weight for a long time.When setting your goals, aim to be very specific and realistic. That means, following the guideline of losing 1-2 pounds per week maximum.
Also note in your goals how you plan on losing the weight. Are you going to follow a specific diet plan? Are you going to create your own diet? Are you going to be exercising to help you lose weight?
Also plan for some weeks where your weight loss may stall or you may have a few slip-ups. Both weight plateaus and a week or two of ""falling off the band wagon"" are normal and expected. Plan for this in your goal timeline.

, Whenever you want to lose weight, especially extreme amounts of weight, it's very important to talk your doctor about the safety of your weight loss.


Your doctor will be able to tell you whether or not weight loss is safe and appropriate for you. Generally, if you have large quantities of weight to lose, weight loss will be especially beneficial to your overall health.
Also, if you're overweight or obese, you may have some chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. These conditions can complicate weight loss or make it more difficult.
You may also want to consider speaking to your doctor about appetite suppressant medications. These are reserved for very overweight people and can only be prescribed by your physician.

, Seeing a dietitian may be extremely helpful if you're trying to lose a lot of weight. These weight loss and nutrition professionals will be able to guide you along your weight loss journey.


Ask your doctor or search online for a local dietitian that focuses in weight loss. Set up a consult to talk about your weight and desire to lose weight.
Ask your dietitian to help prescribe a diet that will work for your personal lifestyle and abilities. They may be able to provide you a calorie range, meal plans and other suggestions to get you on a good weight loss track.
You can also meet with them weekly or monthly to keep yourself accountable with your weight loss diet.

, If you're designing your own diet, you'll need to come up with a calorie limit to help induce weight loss. Managing your calories is the backbone to your weight loss plan.


To stick to your safe plan of losing 1-2 pounds per week, aim to cut out about 500-750 calories daily from your diet.To figure out what a 500 calorie deficit looks like, start by counting the amount of calories you consume on a typical day. Keep a food diary or track your calorie intake in a food journal app for a few days to get an average intake.
Take your average caloric intake and subtract either 500-750 calories from this number. This will give you an estimate of a calorie limit that will help you lose about 1-2 pounds per week.
Unfortunately you can't keep cutting out calories to help you lose more weight. It's never recommended to eat less than 1200 calories a day.If you do, you're weight loss will typically slow or stop and you're at risk for nutrient deficiencies because you're not eating enough.If you subtract 500 or 750 calories from your typical day and get a number less than 1200, then you'll need to use 1200 calories daily as your minimum and target goal.

, There are many studies that show the benefit of a higher protein diet and weight loss.Following this type of diet will be especially helpful if you're aiming to lose large quantities of weight.


Protein works great for weight loss for a few reasons. First, it helps maintain your lean muscle mass and metabolism or your body's ability to burn calories. It also helps you feel more satisfied at meals and keeps you satisfied longer after your meal is over.When following a weight loss, high protein diet, choose lean sources of protein. These foods are lower in calories and fat and will fit into a restricted calorie diet.Instead of trying to hit a certain amount of protein each day, focus on having 1-2 servings of protein at each meal. This takes the guess work out of a high protein diet.
Each serving of protein should be 3-4 oz or about 1/2 cup.Try foods like: seafood, legumes, low-fat dairy, lean beef, eggs, poultry and tofu.

, In addition to following a higher protein diet, consider eating fewer carbohydrates to help you lose weight.


Like higher protein diets, studies have also shown that lower carb diets result in quicker and easier weight loss compared to just low calorie diets.Although carbohydrates are found in many foods, it's not realistic to cut out carbohydrates completely from your diet. Plus, it doesn't leave you with a well-balanced diet either.Limit carbohydrates from the grain group. These foods do provide nutrients, but these vitamins and minerals are present in many other foods as well.
If you do choose to have a grain like bread, rice or pasta, consider choosing only 100% whole grain foods. These foods are high in fiber, vitamins and minerals compared to refined grains like white bread or white rice.Also, if you do choose to have a serving of grains, stick to the appropriate portion size. Measure out 1 oz or 1/2 cup per serving., When you're following a lower calorie diet, its easy to think you're not eating a lot of food or you're not eating enough to fill you up. Eating 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables can help prevent this.


Both fruits and vegetables are low in calorie, but very high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.Filling up half your plate with a fruit or a vegetable can help provide bulk and volume to your meals without going over your calorie limit.
In addition, these high fiber foods can help make you feel more full with less and keep you feeling full longer after your meal has been over.Measure out your portions of your fruits and vegetables. Stick to 1 cup of dense vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens and 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., In addition to foods, you can use water to help you lose weight and stay satisfied on your diet.


Although water alone doesn't cause weight loss, it can definitely help. Stay adequate hydrated each day to help support your weight loss.
When you're dehydrated, even a little bit, you may have feelings of hunger instead of thirst.This may cause you to eat or snack which can make weight loss more difficult.
To prevent dehydration, drink adequate fluids each day. Aim for 8-13 glasses daily or so that you do not feel thirsty during the day., If you have a lot of weight to lose, adding in some activity to your day will help you reach your goal.If you're not currently active or haven't been active in awhile, consider starting your exercise routine by increasing your lifestyle activities.
These are exercises you do on a regular basis. Anything from walking around during the day, taking the stairs or doing household chores can count as lifestyle activity.
Some studies show that increased lifestyle activity throughout the day can have similar results in regards to weight loss as planned and structured activities (like a 20 minute jog).Think about your current day and how active you are. Plan ways that you can move more and take more steps in the day to increase your lifestyle activity. Try parking farther away, skipping the elevator and taking the stairs, going for a walk on your lunch break or doing standing squats during commercial breaks.

, In addition to lifestyle activity, it's important to work on including planned aerobic or radio exercises. These are the ""calorie burning"" exercises that have a significant effect on your weight.If you have a significant amount of weight to lose, medium to higher intensity exercises may be too difficult or uncomfortable to perform. Stick to low-impact aerobic exercises until you feel more comfortable with higher impact exercises.
Low impact exercises to try include: water aerobics or water walking, using the elliptical or recumbent bike.
The typical amount of activity recommended is about 2 1/2 hours a week.If you're unable to do this amount initially, thats OK. Pick an amount of time that you're able to do and start there. Slowly advance to increased time per session or increased frequency over the week as you're able.

, Another type of exercise to include is strength or resistance training. Unlike cardio, these exercises help increase lean muscle mass and your metabolism.If you're not currently active, start your exercise plan with lifestyle activity and cardio. Once you're able to do these comfortably, start incorporating strength training. It may be too much to include all 3 types of activity at once.
However, the benefits of strength training are great. It can help increase your metabolism and help your body burn more calories at rest.Aim for 1-2 days of strength training each week. You only have to do about 20 minutes and work every major muscle group., Something that could be helpful is speaking to a personal trainer or exercise specialist. This will be especially true if you're not familiar with exercise.


If you haven't exercised before or not in a long time, it might be beneficial to meet with someone who is a professional. Tell them about your weight loss goals and ask how they can help you meet them.
A personal trainer can give you an exercise plan to help you lose weight. In addition, they'll be able to show you how to use the machines properly so you do not injury yourself.
Many local gyms have personal trainers on staff. In addition they may give you a deal on personal training sessions when you first sign up for a gym membership.

, Creating a vision board can be a fun and creative way to keep yourself motivated during a longer period of weight loss.


A vision board is an actual board - either a cork board, white erase board or pin board - that you use to put up things that inspire you. Looking at your vision board regularly should be fun, inspiring and motivating.
You can put anything you want on your vision board. Common items include: inspiring quotes, pictures of clothes you want to fit into, pictures of activities you want to be able to do or pictures of you at a healthier weight.
Place your vision board somewhere you'll see it on a regular basis. Also, feel free to change or add things to it as you make progress on your goal.

, Nothing is more inspiring or motivating than monitoring your progress as you lose weight. Track this so you can stay inspired and be aware of your progress.


Many studies show that if you track your weight over time, this accountability helps you stick to your weight loss plan and maintain your weight loss long-term.Weigh yourself 1-2 times a week maximum. Also, make sure to weigh yourself on the same day of the week in the same clothes so you see an accurate trend in your weight loss.
Another thing you can consider tracking is your measurements. Measure your waist, hips, arms and thighs and track these measurements each month.

, Social support is extremely important when you're trying to lose weight. Without it, you may not be as successful.


Studies have repeatedly shown that those people who had a support group during and after weight loss were more likely to stick to their diet program and were able to maintain their weight loss easier long-term.Talk to your friends, family members or even co-workers about your weight loss goal. As them to be your support group. You never know, they may even want to join you.
If you can't get anyone to be your support group, try going to weight loss support groups in person or even online.

, Keeping a journal is a great way to track your progress and keep you motivated through a longer weight loss period.


You can include a variety of things in your journal. You can track your food, calories, exercise or progress.
Studies show that those people who track their food and note their weight loss progress are able to lose more weight compared to those that don't.It's a great form of accountability.

Plan a weekly cheat meal.,
Get enough sleep.,
Don't be wooed by diet fads.,
Make it a lifestyle.",How to Lose Body Fat (Women)6," Few people have the willpower to be perfect for the weeks or months it takes to lose the needed weight. Therefore it is advisable that you build into your diet a ""cheat meal"" once a week.


A cheat meal does not mean that you get to eat an entire pizza and a carton of ice cream in one sitting. But it is an opportunity to eat something that is not on your diet. So have two slices of pizza and a reasonable bowl of ice cream.
Have your cheat meal guilt free, after all it is a planned part of your diet, then immediately get back on your diet for the next meal. A regular and reasonable cheat meal may even help boost your metabolism .

, Not enough sleep can hamper your weight loss efforts. Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night.

, Low-fat, non-fat, the grapefruit diet, the cabbage diet, the cleansing diet. Fad diets may help you lose a few quick pounds, but for serious weight loss and sustained weight loss don't look for the next fad. This plan instead focuses on simple sustainable changes: eating less than you burn, eating high quality nutrient dense foods with plenty of protein and healthy fats in your diet.

, Log your food intake throughout your diet. If you eat as prescribed and maintain your current activity level or more, you should be able to successfully lose fat.


Keep in mind that as you lose weight you may want to recalculate your macronutrient and caloric needs.
Do not be afraid of incorporating new meals into your diet, as long as you still follow you calories and macronutrient guidelines for the day.
If you are not losing weight on a 15-30% deficit, look to your food logging. Be careful to measure, or better yet weigh, everything and record the correct portion sizes when calculating calories and macronutrients consumed.

Lower the number of calories you consume.,
Cut out junk food.,
Pile on the good stuff.,
Avoid adding extra calories while preparing your food.,
Eat fat-burning foods.,
Drink away the weight.,
Snack away.",How to Lose 20 Pounds in a Month1," Make an effort to eat less than you’re currently eating. Reduce your daily calorie intake gradually for the first week or so, then stick with an approximate amount that will allow you to lose weight without leaving you feeling totally wiped out. Counting calories isn’t a lot of fun, and it definitely requires discipline in the long run, but it’s a surefire way to achieve a leaner physique.The most elementary rule of dieting is that if you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight.
Consult with a nutritionist, keep a food journal or use a calorie-counting app like MyFitnessPal to track the nutritional value of the food you eat and calculate how many calories you need to keep making progress.;
, In order to keep your calorie intake low, the first things you should eliminate from your diet are salty, sugary, overly-processed foods and snacks. Say goodbye to French fries, pizza, cake and candy. Sweets and fatty foods contain more concentrated doses of calories per serving size, which means you can eat them in the same portions as other healthier foods and still gain weight. Junk food is a death trap for those seeking to lower their body fat percentage.The food you eat should be grilled, baked, broiled or steamed. Stay away from fatty additives like butter and oil.
One simple way to drastically reduce the number of calories you’re getting is to stop eating fast food and drinking soda. This allows most people to lose an additional 2-3 pounds a week., Low-calorie, filling food are key to your success. 400 calories of vegetables will fill you to the brim while 400 calories of oil or fried chicken will leave you wanting more. Know what to eat to trick your body into telling you it's finished.


Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats are all low-calorie dense foods that will help you lose weight. Fruits and veggies are mostly water-based and contain very few calories and very little fat--on the other hand, 1 g of fat is nine calories in itself. So stay away from processed goods and go green. And red, orange, blue, and yellow.

Fiber is great for you, too, and only has 1.5-2.5 calories per gram. Most legumes, nuts, and seeds are excellent sources of this.



, 4 oz of lean chicken is good for you...until you slather it with butter and Colby-Jack.


When preparing meat, take the skin off and trim the fat. And don't coat it in bread crumbs or other unnecessary additives.
Don’t deep fry any food. Even if it's a vegetable; it loses its nutritional value when fried.

Steam your food instead and add lots of spice. Steaming your food instead of frying it will cut down on fat and calories, and spices will spike your metabolism.



, Starving yourself is not the key to losing fat -- it's choosing the right foods that will burn the fat for you. Throw out the junk in your pantry and stock up on the good stuff:


Fatty fish high in omega-3s help reduce the levels of leptin in your body. And that guy keeps hunger at bay and ups your metabolism. If you're not a seafood fan, talk to your doctor about taking fish oil supplements. Not as good as the natural thing, but still beneficial.An apple a day keeps the fat at bay. Apples are full of pectin, which reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs. They're also fiber-full and calorie-low, so they're really the perfect snack. Did we mention delicious?
Add ginger and garlic to your meals. Ginger widens your blood vessels, garlic lowers your insulin levels, and both increase your metabolic rate.
Use olive oil as your primary cooking oil. Even though oil is fat, olive oil is full of the good kind (monounsaturated) that helps lower cholesterol levels, and has many other health benefits, too., Water is the breath of life and of weight loss. Minimize your appetite (and clear your skin!) by drinking morning, noon, and night.


Drink two glasses of water before every meal. You will feel fuller faster (say that three times fast) and not have room for more calories.
While each person's hydration needs are different, the Institute of Medicine advises that men and women try to consume about 3.7 and 2.7 liters of water a day, respectively, including water found in food and other beverages .

Green tea is a good idea, too. It's loaded with antioxidants and may help increase your metabolic rate.Whatever you do, cut out the sodas and alcohol. They're just empty calories that pack on the pounds silently without even making you feel full.



, Eating 5 to 7 small meals a day leads to quicker weight loss than any other meal routine. You will feel fuller all day, removing the urge to overeat.


Keep your snacks healthy. Measure out portions of your favorite healthy snacks (carrots, grapes, nuts, or yogurt) and package them for easy access throughout the week. Instead of working all day, you'll be working and snacking, keeping your metabolism up.
Don't skip breakfast! Your body needs that kick in the morning to get reminded to get going. Not only will you be more likely to lose weight, you'll probably keep it off too .

If you think you need to lose 15 pounds, give your doctor a call. He or she will be able to help you determine whether or not 15 pounds is appropriate for you.
Ask your doctor if they have any diet or exercise suggestions or limitations for you. This way you will be sure that what you're following will be beneficial and not harmful to your health.
If you're having difficulty losing weight, get back in touch with your doctor. Ask if they are aware of any medically supervised diets or a local dietitian that you could work with.;
, With any diet, it's important to set very realistic expectations and goals. If you want to lose 15 pounds and keep it off long-term, you need to set yourself up for success.In general, it's never recommended to lose more than 1 to 2 pounds per week.
Although this might sound slow or tedious to you, this type of weight loss has been proven to be the most sustainable long-term.
If you want to lose 15 pounds, you need to plan to follow your diet and lifestyle plan for about 2 months. Set up a calendar and goals for that timeline.
Also, talk further with your doctor. He or she can recommend an appropriate rate and amount of weight loss for you.

, Diets that promise quick weight loss or a lot of weight loss in a short period of time are generally not considered safe or sustainable. Much of the weight lost during crash or fad diets is regained quickly after they end.You can tell a fad diet if you see claims like ""lose 10 pounds in 10 days"" or ""drop 2 pants sizes in a week.""
Fad or crash diets usually rely on exceptionally low-calorie diets that are lacking a large variety of vitamins and minerals.
They are not considered safe and they are never a recommended method for losing weight.

, A helpful tool that can keep you on track with your diet and lead to better success is a food journal. It's easy to keep and will help you meet your weight loss goals.


Studies have shown that those people who track their foods more regularly are able to lose more weight and have an easier time keeping it off.Having to track the foods you eat helps keep you accountable and honest. Try to track your foods as many days of the week as you can.
To help you, consider downloading a food journaling app or purchase a pen and paper journal.
Track everything you eat - every breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and beverage. The more you track, the more accurate your journal will be.

, Another great tool to use for your diet is a meal and exercise plan. Both of these items can serve as a guide and a schedule for what you're supposed to be eating or what exercise you're supposed to be doing each day.


A meal plan is a document that you create that will outline every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack during a week's time period.
Spend a few minutes to write down what you're planning to have for the upcoming week. Use this as a guide. It'll help keep you on track and prevent you from going out to eat or eating something too high calorie.
An exercise plan is almost identical. However, you need to schedule in when you're going to exercise, for how long and what type of exercise you're going to do.
When your exercise is pre-scheduled, you know that you have the time to do it, making it more likely you'll stick to your exercise plan.

, One fun thing about losing weight or meeting any other type of goal are the rewards. Set up some fun rewards or treats for yourself as you meet your goals.


When you've created your outline, also create a timeline for rewards. For example, you might want to plan a fun treat for when you lose your first 10 pounds. Or plan a bigger reward once you lose 15 pounds.
Rewards shouldn't be food related for weight loss goals. This can get you sidetracked from your diet.
Stick to rewards like buying a new shirt, treating yourself to a spa day, going on a weekend vacation or buying new athletic clothing.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, one of the most important changes you need to make is to your total calorie intake. Carefully cutting out calories will help you lose weight.


If you want to lose 15 pounds, you'll need to cut out some calories from your daily total. In general, you can cut about 500 to 750 calories a day to result in a 1 to 2 pound weight loss each week.Do not cut more than this out. If your calorie level goes too low (below 1200 calories for example), your weight loss will slow, your energy levels will dip and you put yourself at higher risk for nutrient deficiencies.
Always talk to your doctor about how many calories you can cut from your diet and the minimum level you should eat each day.

, To help you more accurately cut out calories, start measuring your portions. This will help you stay on track and be more aware of how much you're eating.


To help manage your total calories, use a food scale or measuring cups to track portion sizes.
Protein foods should be portioned at a 1/2 cup or 4 oz, which is about the size of your palm. Fruits should be portioned to 1/2 cup or 1 small piece, vegetables should be 1 cup chopped or 2 cups of leafy greens, and grains such as oats, rice, and quinoa should be measured to 1/2 cup or 2 oz per serving.
Try to not to estimate portion sizes. You may be wrong and have a bigger chance for inaccuracies.

, One of the best combinations for weight loss is eating mostly lean protein, fruits and vegetables. This low calorie and lower carb combination can help keep you satisfied and help fuel your weight loss.Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet - especially when it comes to weight loss. Protein takes a while to digest which keeps you feeling satisfied longer. In addition, it helps fuel your metabolism.Include at least one serving of lean protein at every meal. Try: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, pork, nuts, beans and seafood.
Fruits and vegetables are also naturally low calorie. In addition, they're very high in fiber. Like protein, fiber takes a while to digest and keeps you feeling satisfied longer. Together with protein, this combination helps you feel satisfied with less food and over a longer period of time.
Include a serving of a fruit or vegetable with every meal. You can choose any type of fruit or vegetable that you'd like.

, One food group to limit is the grain group. Although filled with some nutritious foods, limit how many servings you include in your diet.


Many studies have shown that lower carb diets help people lose more weight more quickly compared to low calorie or low-fat diets alone.
The most carb-rich food group is the grain group. Limiting how many servings of these foods you have each day can help you reach your weight goal quicker.If you do choose to have a grain, follow the appropriate portion size and make sure to choose a 100% whole grain option.
Whole grains are less processed and higher in fiber and protein (both great for weight loss). Choose whole grain foods like quinoa, oatmeal, brown rice, whole wheat bread and whole wheat pasta.

, As with any type of weight loss plan, it's important to limit the foods that can make weight loss difficult or even cause weight gain. Foods that are higher in fat and sugar should be limited in your diet.


High fat and high sugar foods are typically higher in calories. If eaten on a regular basis or in larger portions, this can make meeting your weight goal more difficult.
Limit foods like fried foods, fast foods, fatty cuts of meat, sugary cereals, cookies, cakes/pies, pastries, chips, crackers, candy and ice cream. Instead satisfy your sweet craving with a low-fat yogurt, whole grain cereal or some fruit. You can also have carrots and hummus or a cheese stick for a salty or savory craving.
If you do choose to have these foods, do so very occasionally and make sure to follow the recommended portion size.

, Like higher fat foods, liquid calories can also be a problem. Reduce how many calories you're drinking each day to help with your weight loss.


Liquid calories can easily get out of hand. Studies show that many times, sweetened beverages can cause more damage to your diet because they don't fill you up or signal your brain that you've eaten.Strictly limit or avoid sweetened beverages like sodas, fruit juices, fruit drinks, sweetened coffee drinks, milkshakes, smoothies, sweet tea, alcohol, lemonade or chocolate milk.
Instead, drink about 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids. These are hydrating and can help manage your appetite. Try: water, flavored water, sparkling water or unsweetened and decaf coffee or tea.
Drinking an adequate amount of clear fluids daily can help keep your appetite in control, help you feel more satisfied and help keep you more alert.

, In addition to diet, including regular physical activity is an essential component to weight loss. Get in the habit of exercising regularly to help support weight loss and long-term weight maintenance.


Health professionals recommend that you do both aerobic and strength training every week.
Include about 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week in addition to 1 to 2 days of strength training.Aerobic exercises you can try include walking, jogging, swimming, dancing, cycling and hiking. Lift weights, do pilates or yoga for your strength training activities.

, Although diet and exercise are key for weight loss, there are other behaviors that can also affect weight loss. Getting enough sleep is essential for your body's health but also to weight loss.


People who don't sleep well or do not sleep enough are more likely to be overweight or obese.
Studies have shown that lack of sleep causes an increase in your appetite and your desire for higher calorie foods (like high fat, high sugar or carb-rich items).To help support your weight loss, get in at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night. That might mean going to bed earlier or waking up later if you can.

, Stress is another life obstacle that can stand in the way of successful weight loss. It's essential that you learn to manage your everyday stress to help reach your weight goals.


Chronic stress is something many people deal with. This stress increases your appetite and can trigger more emotional or stress eating.In addition, many people deal with stress in inappropriate ways - like sleeping later and skipping their workouts or engaging in more destructive eating behaviors.
Try to manage your stress by talking to your friends, listening to music, going for a walk, meditating, reading a good book or watching a movie.
If you're having difficulty managing your stress or it continues to affect your weight, consider seeking extra help from a psychologist or behavioral therapist.

, Like structured activities and exercise, making it a point to be more active during the day can also help support your weight loss. Try to move more or take more steps during your day.


Lifestyle activities are those types of exercises that are part of your normal daily routine. They may include doing household chores, walking to your destinations or gardening.These activities do not burn many calories all by themselves. However, if you do many of them during the day, they can add up to be a significant amount.
It's important to try to stay active during your entire day. These activities have been shown to have similar benefits to your health and weight as more structured exercises (like going for a 30-minute jog).
Think about your typical day and how you can take more steps or move more in general. You can take the stairs more often, park farther away, stand during TV commercial breaks or schedule in a walking session to your lunch break.

Write up a meal plan.",How to Know if You're Ready to Lose Weight," If you feel like you want to lose weight, try journaling your thoughts and feelings. This can help you see where you are mentally with weight loss.


Weight loss requires you to be in the right mindset. You need to be ready to change, motivated and determined if you want to lose weight.Start a journal and write down how you feel about weight loss. How badly do you want to lose weight? Are you willing to give up some favorite foods to lose weight? Are you willing to start exercising to help you lose weight?
Also think about what type of diet you're willing to follow. If you're considering a crash diet or fad diet, that may mean you're not truly ready to put in the hard work it takes to lose weight safely.
For example, weight loss pills and other supplements don't require you to work hard at changing your diet and lifestyle. If you're only interested in this type of ""diet"", it doesn't seem like you're ready to change what you eat, reduce your portion sizes or begin to exercise.;
, Keeping track of each one in your journal will give you an idea of the extent of lifestyle changes you'll need to commit to. This will help you see a clear picture and give you direction when preparing for weight loss when you're ready.


Start making notes about your diet. What needs to change? Do you need to eat smaller portions? Do you need to give up your evening desserts? Do you need to cut down on soda or alcohol?
Also consider your lifestyle. Do you need to add in more physical activity? Do you need to purchase a scale to help you stay accountable? Do you need to find a support group to help encourage you during weight loss?
Knowing what needs to change will help you decide whether or not you're truly ready for safe weight loss.If you look at your list of things that need to change, but don't feel motivated to change them, you may not be ready for weight loss.

, Another exercise you can do is writing out a list of pros and cons of weight loss. This is a great way to see if weight loss is something you can do at this moment.


You may think there are only pros and advantages to weight loss. Although there are a lot, there may be plenty of disadvantages as well.
Pros to weight loss may include: fitting into smaller clothes, feeling more confident in yourself, reducing your risk of chronic disease, helping manage a chronic disease more easily, decreasing pain in your joints and back, being able to be more physically active, or joining your family on more outings and gatherings.
Cons to weight loss may include: having to limit a favorite food, having to be more active when your joints ache or you don't enjoy physical activity, having to be more consistent with your diet or dealing with the occasional set backs or slip ups during your diet. In addition, you might have to purchase new clothes or you live with a partner who doesn't want to lose weight and doesn't want to make healthy changes.
If your list of advantages to weight loss is bigger than the cons, you're probably ready for weight loss and have good motivation to support you.

, Even if you feel completely ready for weight loss, there may be some barriers in your life that could prevent you from being successful.Barriers to change are things in your life that can stop, stall or prevent you from realizing a goal (in this case, weight loss).
In general, everyone has some barriers. Some may be small and easily dealt with, while others may be large and very hard to overcome.
Small barriers may be: you don't have a scale to weigh yourself, you don't have measuring cups or a food scale to track portions, you don't belong to a gym or you don't enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables.
Small barriers may be frustrating, but with planning and determination, you can overcome these. For example, you can purchase a scale or measuring cups to help you stay accountable. Or if you can't afford a gym membership, maybe you can drive to a local park to exercise or borrow some exercise DVDs from your local library.
Larger barriers that may be more difficult to overcome include: significant financial stress, you live in a household with others who have bad eating habits and do not want to change or you are home-bound or disabled and cannot be physically active.

, After giving weight loss some serious thought, rate your overall readiness to change. This can help you sum up your work and see if you should go ahead and attempt weight loss.Use a number scale to rate yourself. It goes from 1 to 10. One is ""not ready to change at all"" and 10 is ""very ready to change and confident.""
Start by rating your individual changes. For example, are you ready to make your portions smaller? Rate this from 1 to 10. Go through and rate everything to see where you're confident and where you're not.
Look at your overall ratings. Are they mostly low numbers or are they mostly high numbers? If your ratings are typically higher - like in the 6 to 10 range - you're ready for weight loss.

, When you've decided you're ready to make changes for weight loss, decide how much weight you need to lose. Consider talking to your doctor so he or she can help you determine what a healthy weight range is for you.


Make an appointment with your doctor or give them a call. Talk about your plan for weight loss and need for guidance on what a healthy weight range is for you.
Make sure to discuss how much weight you think you need to lose, how you're going to lose it and what diet plans (if any), you're choosing to follow.
Also ask if weight loss is safe and appropriate for you. You may not need to lose weight or your doctor may suggest only losing a minimal amount.

, One method of determining how much weight you should lose is figuring out your BMI. It's easiest to do this online and can quickly give you an idea of your excess body weight.


BMI or body mass index is a measure of body fat based on your height and weight.The higher the BMI, the more body fat you have and the more overweight you are.
The easiest method of determining your BMI is by using an online calculator. You input your weight and height and a value is determined for you.
If your BMI is between 19.9 to 24.9 you're at a healthy weight and do not necessarily need to lose weight.If your BMI is between 25 to 29.9 you're considered overweight and will generally be about 15 to 20 pounds overweight.
If your BMI is between 30.0 to 34.9 you're considered obese and will generally be about 40 to 50 pounds overweight.
If your BMI is over 35 you're considered morbidly obese and will need to lose a minimum of 50 pounds.

, Similar to BMI, your ideal body weight can also help determine how much weight you need to lose. You can also do this online, but the calculation is fairly easy to do on your own.


Your ideal body weight takes into consideration your gender and height. It produces a result that is generally accurate for most people.For women, follow this equation: 100 + 5 lb for every inch over 60 in
For men, follow this equation: 106 + 6 lb for every inch over 60 in
Once you've calculated your ideal body weight, subtract it from your current weight. This is the approximate amount of excess body weight you have.

, Regardless of how much weight you need to lose overall, its important to focus on losing it slowly and safely. This is the most sustainable type of weight loss.


Most health professionals do not recommend losing more than about one to two pounds total per week.This rate of weight loss may seem slow, but is the most realistic and easy to keep off in the long-term.
For example, if you determine that you need to lose 15 pounds, plan to spend about two to three months following a diet or structured meal plan.
If you don't feel like this rate is quick enough for you or are interested in trying a crash diet to lose weight faster, go back to square one and reassess your readiness to change.

, When you've decided you're ready to lose weight, you need to set realistic goals for yourself. This will help set you up for success long-term.


Your goals first need to be realistic for you.You need to be realistic about the amount of weight you want to lose, how fast you can lose it and your motivation to stay on track.
As mentioned, do not set a goal for more than one to two pounds per week. If you want to lose 10 pounds, losing that within two weeks is not a realistic goal.
Also make sure your goal is attainable. This might seem self explanatory, but if you're not truly ready for weight loss, setting a goal to lose a large amount of weight is most likely not attainable.

, To keep you motivated and encouraged the whole way, consider setting rewards for yourself.Each time you meet a goal, treat yourself to something fun.


Start by writing down all your goals - both big and small. There is no weight loss goal too small for a reward.
Do not choose food related rewards. You don't want to treat yourself to a dessert after losing your first 10 pounds. This can lead you astray.
Instead, pick non-food related rewards like: treating yourself to a manicure or massage, buying new workout clothes, downloading a new workout playlist, getting a new hair cut or buying a new pair of shoes.

, One important thing to do regardless of what type of diet you follow, is to start a food journal. This can not only help prepare you for weight loss, but help keep you accountable long-term.


Studies have shown that those who track their food regularly lose a significant amount more weight compared to those who don't. In addition, they're able to keep it off better long term.Download a food journaling app or keep a pen and paper version yourself. Either will work well. Track every meal, snack and beverage you consume each day.
Try starting your food journal before your actual diet starts. This is a good tool to help you see what changes you may need to make to your diet. If you're not truly ready to lose weight, making changes to your diet will seem too difficult.

, When you prepare to lose weight, it'll be helpful to write yourself or find a meal plan to follow. This gives you the blueprint of exactly what you're eating each and everyday.If you're not following a specific diet, write your own meal plan. Document what you're planning on having for each meal - breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.
Make sure your meals either fit into a specified calorie or carbohydrate range depending on your diet of choice.
If you are following a specific type of diet (like Atkins or Weight Watchers), these diets generally come with meal plans. Download or print these out to follow during the week.

In addition to speaking with your doctor, making an appointment to visit a registered dietitian may be a good idea. These nutrition and weight loss experts will be able to guide and teach you about safe and healthy weight loss.
If you have 100 pounds of excess weight to lose, you may also be suffering from chronic diseases that are associated with being overweight or obese. Therefore, it's even more important to speak with your doctor about what type of weight loss is appropriate for you.;
, Losing 100 pounds is a big goal and will require you to commit to a weight loss program for an extended period of time. Setting realistic goals is important, especially when you want to lose larger amounts of weight.In general, it's safe to lose about 1–2 pounds a week. Losing 100 pounds will most likely take you about a year or more to lose.Losing weight at a faster rate may be unhealthy and unsafe. In addition, it's generally not sustainable long-term and may put you at risk for gaining the weight back.Setting a large, long-term goal is great, but it may be helpful to set smaller goals along the way to help motivate you on your weight loss journey. For example: lose 10 pounds in four to six weeks or lose the first 25 pounds in three months., This is perhaps the most effective change you can make immediately that will help get you started on the road to losing weight. The more tempting food you have lying the house, the more likely it is that you will give in and eat those unhealthy items. Creating a healthy environment at home can help support your weight loss.


Toss out any sweets (like cookies, cupcakes or ice cream), chips, crackers and sugary beverages (like soda or fruit juice cocktail).
You can also donate unopened items to a local food bank instead of throwing items in the garbage.
Think, ""out of sight, out of mind."" Having these foods out of your house will help you stick to your plan and eat healthier.

, Getting started on a weight loss plan to lose 100 pounds will require you to re-think your meals. Spending a few hours reworking your weekly meal plan can help give you the framework for a healthy diet.


Consult with a registered dietitian to ensure that your meal plan is also safe in regards to your medical history.
Start with one week of meals. Include all breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and sugar-free beverages.
If you're following a particular calorie range, be sure to add in the calories for each meal and snack to make sure you're staying within your predetermined range.
After a few weeks, you may be able to be less detailed with your meal plan — especially if you get into the groove of healthy, easy meals that you enjoy.
If you notice yourself getting bored with your meals, revisit your meal plan and change it up. Don't fall off track out of boredom. Find new, healthy recipes to keep you on track.

, Losing weight will require you to cut back on calories to help induce weight loss. Following a moderate calorie diet over time will help you reach your weight loss goals.


In general, cutting out about 500 calories daily will yield a weight loss of about 1–2 pounds a week. This is considered safe and healthy weight loss.Cutting out larger amounts of calories or eating less than 1,200 calories daily is not considered safe, healthy, or appropriate. You're putting yourself at risk for nutrient deficiencies as it is hard to consume all the nutrients you need on a very low calorie diet. In addition, these types of diets are generally not sustainable long-term.If you're interested in following a particular calorie limit, you can plug in your height, weight, and activity level into an online calculator to help determine what's an appropriate calorie level to follow when attempting to lose weight.
You may also talk to your registered dietitian about what calorie level is appropriate for you based on your weight loss goals.

, Eating foods that are high in lean protein is essential to weight loss. Protein helps keep you feeling satisfied and helps fuel your weight loss.Eat a source of lean protein at every meal and snack. This will help you meet the minimum requirements each day.
In general, women should consume 46 g of protein daily and men should consume 56 g of protein daily.Foods that are high in lean protein include: poultry, lean beef, eggs, pork, seafood, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy products.
Minimize higher fat protein foods as these contain more calories and could slow weight loss. Items like fatty cuts of beef, sausage, bacon, full-fat dairy, or poultry with skin should be eaten only occasionally., These foods will help support your weight loss as they are very low calorie and can help provide bulk to your meals and keep you feeling satisfied longer.


Include a variety of fruits each day or week. Ideally eat about one to two servings of fruit each day. A serving counts as 1/2 cup cut fruit, one small piece of fruit, or 1/4 cup of dried fruit.Eat a variety of vegetables each day or week. Aim for at least three to five servings of vegetables each day. A serving counts as 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.Starchy vegetables like carrots, peas, or potatoes are appropriate to include on a weight loss plan. They do contain slightly more calories, but are acceptable to eat when you're trying to lose weight.

, When you're choosing to eat grains, go for 100% whole grains as often as you can. Whole grains are high in fiber, vitamins and other essential nutrients.Whole grains to include are: quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat bread or pasta and brown rice.
One serving of whole grains is 1 oz or 1/2 cup. Include one to two servings daily.Monitor the amounts of whole grains you consume while trying to lose weight. Although a part of a healthy diet, whole grains contain more calories and less nutrients compared to lean protein, fruits, and vegetables.

, When you're cutting down on calories and increasing exercise, you may find yourself more hungry throughout the day. Snacking may help manage your hunger while continuing to support your weight loss.Snacks should be included when appropriate. For example, if there's more than five hours between meals or as fuel before or after a workout.
Snacks should also be monitored closely. If you're not hungry or it's close to a meal time, pass on your snack. Eating extra calories when not necessary may slow or hinder your weight loss. Be smart when you're snacking.
Snacks should be around 100-200 calories when you're trying to lose weight.Healthy snacks that can support your weight loss include: an individual greek yogurt, a hard boiled egg, carrots and hummus, or 1/2 cup of edamame.
Make healthy swaps for your favorite snacks. If you find yourself missing your old comfort foods, try swapping out healthier foods for those higher calorie snack foods. For example, instead of cookies after dinner, have a 1/2 cup of pineapple to cut your sweet craving.

, Although dieting requires you to follow a program for an extended period of time, it's also important to indulge occasionally. Completing avoid certain foods long-term may trigger a binge.Schedule in the occasional indulgence into your meal plan. It can be anything, for example: going out to dinner or eating a small sweet. Scheduling this into your meal plan can help you see how you can compensate. You may consider spending 10 more minutes on the treadmill or having lighter meals throughout the day.
Be honest about your indulgences. They should be occasional — this will be different for everyone, but these things shouldn't be popping up daily.

, Adequate fluids helps you stay hydrated which will support your weight loss. When you're dehydrated you may feel hungry and tired which could trigger you to eat. Extra calories may result in slow weight loss or a weight stall.Aim for at least 64 oz or about 2 L of clear, sugar-free fluids each day. This is a good rule of thumb to remember, but you may need more fluids.Sugar-free fluids to sip on include: water, flavored waters, tea and coffee, or no-calorie sports drinks.

, Try setting up a consultation with a personal trainer to help get you started with an exercise program. These fitness professionals will help you find a workout that can help you lose weight and keep your weight loss off permanently.


Tell your trainer about your weight loss goal and diet and they'll be able to work with you to meet those goals. In addition, ask them about exercises that may be more comfortable for you. If your excess weight is causing joint pain, they may be able to teach or show you exercises that lessen your pain.
Many times you can get a free or promotional consultation with a trainer when you sign up for a gym membership.
Also, try using a trainer just a few times or until you get the hang of the workout. You don't necessarily need a personal trainer long-term if you don't want one.

, Aerobic training is a great exercise to burn calories. This will not only help support your weight loss, but you'll also notice a variety of other benefits like increased energy and improved moved.It's recommended to incorporate 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week. However, the more exercise you do, the more calories you can burn, which may help increase your weight loss.If you have a significant amount of excess weight, start slowly with exercise. If you cannot do 150 minutes per week, that's OK. Start with just 10 minutes per day.
Include cardio exercises like: fast walking, biking, using the elliptical or swimming/water aerobics.

, Strength training is another form of exercise that will help support your weight loss. Include 1–2 days of strength training each week.Strength training helps build lean muscle mass which, over time, burns more calories compared to fat mass in the body. Increasing your muscle mass will help you burn more calories all day long.Strength training can also help tone and contour your body to help you achieve a more lean and toned look.
Strength training activities include: weight lifting, yoga, or resistance bands/tubes.

, It's important that you find a type of activity that you genuinely enjoy; that way you will be more likely to stick with it and do it on a regular basis.


Try a variety of exercises that you think you may enjoy. This will give you a good idea of what exercises you'll most likely keep doing long-term.
Think outside the box. Hiking, dance classes, kayaking, or team sports are all fun and exciting forms of exercise.
Switch up your routine. After a while, an exercise routine may get boring or old. Switching up your routine every once in a while can help keep it fresh and fun.
Exercise with a friend for a social and motivating workout. You're more likely to keep going if you're working out with a friend.

, Studies have shown that journaling while trying to lose weight makes it more likely that you'll reach your goal and keep your weight off long-term.


Journaling provides an emotional outlet allowing you to get out frustrations or disappointments or set backs. It can also be a way to motivate yourself. Writing down positive mantras or tracking your successes can keep you on track.
Purchase a journal, download a journaling app, or find an online journaling site to check in with on a regular basis. You don't need to journal each day if you don't want to — even a few times a week counts.
Jot down notes about your meals, progress, measurements and how you're feeling throughout your diet program.

, Having a support group is essential to weight loss — especially when you're trying to large amounts of weight. It will take time to reach your goal of losing 100 pounds and it may be a long journey, and having a person or group of people to encourage and motivate you will be helpful.Find friends or family members and tell them about your goal. Ask them to help you stay accountable and encourage you until you reach your goal.
Also try finding support groups in person or online. Having people to talk to who are also struggling with weight or attempting to lose large amounts of weight will also help encourage and motivate you., The more weight you lose, the more motivated you will feel to keep going. But the only way to know whether you are making progress is to take regular measurements.Weigh yourself once or twice a week. Be sure to do this at the same time each week. Mornings before you have eaten anything are best.
Remember that clothes and shoes weigh something, too. For the most accurate results, weigh yourself naked or in just your underwear. Try to always be undressed or wearing the same thing when you weigh yourself for consistency.
Take measurements. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your waist, thighs, arms, and neck. As you lose weight and are working out regularly, you'll see your body shape changes as well.

, The occasional weight plateau is normal and should be expected when you're trying to lose large amounts of weight. As you shed more and more weight and you continue to exercise, your body readjusts. This sometimes results in a few days or weeks where your weight doesn't budge on the scale.Track your weight stalls. This is important because if you don't resume losing weight, you'll need to reevaluate your diet, exercise program and other lifestyle behaviors to make sure they're still conducive to weight loss.
If you notice a weight stall and you're still on track with diet and exercise, don't stress. Trust yourself and continue with your plan. Remember, weight plateaus are normal and are to be expected. Do not give up or try new fad diets to make yourself lose weight. Stick to your plan.

, Keeping a food journal doesn't just help you stay on track and support your weight loss, it's also a good tool to help reevaluate your progress or overcome a weight stall.


Keep an eye out for extra snacks or indulgences. Even though you might not be doing this everyday, even a few times a week of an extra snack or treat could slow your weight loss or cause a plateau.
Watch your recorded portions. Portion sizes that slowly get a little too big — maybe from guessing — can also cause your weight to plateau.
Also make sure you're eating enough. Skimping too much on calories or portions may also be slowing your weight loss. A diet that's too low in calories and nutrients is not a good support to weight loss and may be displayed as a stall., If a weight plateau is driving you nuts or making you nervous, try switching up your routine. Try adding in more or different types of exercise to help jumpstart your weight loss again.


Try different cardio programs like HIIT or circuit training which burn a lot of calories. You can also increase or start strength training to help increase your baseline metabolism.

Plan to include regular physical activity.",How to List Your Weight Loss Motivators," Although there are a variety of great weight loss motivators, not all are positive or should be put on your list.


There are some types of motivators that are not truly your own. These external motivators, many times, are imposed on you by someone else.For example, your spouse wants you to lose weight because they think you'd look better. Another could be that your doctor wants you to lose weight to improve your diabetes.
While these may not necessarily be negative or hurtful requests, these reasons are not your own personal motivations.
The most successful type of motivation is internal motivation - the personal reasons you want to lose weight, not because someone else asked you too. Aim to lose weight for yourself, not others.;
, Use a journal or notepad as a place to write your list of weight loss motivators. This is where you can take notes, write down ideas and finally create your ultimate list of weight loss motivators.


When you're going to create a list of weight loss motivators, you want it to be something you can refer to multiple times. Purchasing a journal can help keep this list nearby, but also provide you a place to journal your thoughts about weight loss and can be a place where you track your foods or exercise as well.
Purchase a journal that's appealing to you. Make it exciting for you to curl up with your journal and jot down notes.
When starting your list of motivators, start by taking notes about weight loss and your thoughts about weight loss. You may see some motivators come out of these ideas. You can combine this with other weight loss motivators that you're aware of.

, One area of your life that you might want to review is your health. Many people find a lot of motivation from this area. Whether they have a chronic disease or are at risk for one, better health can be a great source of weight loss motivation.


Think about your health. Do you have any health problems? Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes or sleep apnea? Did your doctor tell you you're at risk for a chronic disease?
Many chronic diseases (like high blood pressure or diabetes) are worsened by additional weight. In addition, if you're overweight, you're at higher risk for developing these diseases.If you do have these health problems or know you're at risk, listing your health is a great weight loss motivator.
For example, after speaking with your doctor, you might set a goal for yourself to ""Improve your diabetes by getting your hemoglobin A1c to below 6.7%.” Or, you might decide you want to ""Improve your lipid panels by getting your cholesterol level below 200 mg/dL.""

, Another common weight loss motivator for people are activities and events. Many people are prohibited by their weight and cannot participate in certain things.


Whether it's traveling in an airplane, riding a roller coaster or walking with your grandchildren, your weight can prohibit you from living a fun and active life.
Think about things that you've always wanted to do, but feel like your weight keeps you from doing. Have you wanted to travel to another country but feel too heavy for a tight airplane seat? Does your weight prohibit you from riding a roller coaster? Or does your weight keep you from getting down on the floor to play with your grandchildren?
If you feel like there are activities that you want to be able to do, these are great things to list as your weight loss motivators.
For example, a weight loss motivator could be to ""reduce your weight enough so you don't need a seatbelt extender on an airplane.""

, Many people that are overweight are also self-conscious about their bodies. If you want to improve how you look, take a look in the mirror and see if you can come up with additional weight loss motivators.Looking in the mirror can be difficult. But consider standing in front of a full length mirror and looking at your whole body.
You can do this fully clothed, wearing a swimsuit or underwear or even naked. Look at your body and think about how you feel about what you see.
Your weight loss motivator could be to reduce the size of your waist so that it is smaller than your next widest measurement, such as your hips or shoulders.

, Another great source of motivation can be clothes. Many people still have that old pair of ""skinny jeans"" or an outfit they're hoping to get back into. Use this as a source of motivation.Instead of keeping that one outfit in the back of your closet, bring it out. Try on those ""skinny jeans"" and see how they fit.
If they're too tight, this is your motivation. List ""getting back into my skinny jeans"" as a weight loss motivator.
Consider leaving those skinny jeans hanging in front of your mirror or in front of your closet. Looking at them every day can be a great source of motivation and encouragement.

, In addition to intrinsic motivation (the type of motivation that's internal), there are some other sources of motivation to consider as well.


Studies show that those people who are overweight or obese have shorter life spans than those that are at a healthier weight.This can be a great source of motivation.
For example, many people want to lose weight for someone else (like their spouse or children). This isn't because that ""someone else"" is asking them to lose weight. But because they want to lose weight so that they can spend more time with close friends and family.
Consider your spouse, parents, siblings, children or grandchildren. You want to lose weight so you'll be around longer to be with them, but also be healthy so you can stay active with them as well.
For example, your weight loss motivator could be ""to lose weight so that I can carry my grandchild.""

, Another area you might want to consider is your self-esteem and confidence. It's important to consider this because this will also affect your ability to lose weight.


Studies have shown that people who are overweight and obese, especially children, have a harder time with positive self-esteem. They're not as confident or proud of themselves as others.Think about how you truly feel. Do you feel uncomfortable in front of others? Are you shy to go out due to your weight? Are you unhappy with how you look in clothes?
These are all reasons that can be used as weight loss motivators. For example, you could list ""I want to feel more confident in my body and improve my self-image by losing weight.""

, A very fun and crafty way to use your list of motivators is to create a vision board. These fun boards can turn your motivators and goals into images that can inspire and encourage you.A vision board will be deeply personal to you. You'll stick on personal quotes, pictures and even your list of weight loss motivators.
To make your vision board, start by purchasing a cork board, white board or even grab a piece of cardboard. It can be as big as you'd like it to be.
Using your list of motivators, go through magazines, newspapers or books and cut out pictures, quotes, and sayings that match up with your list of motivators.
For example, you can cut out a picture of a roller coaster so it reminds you that one of your motivators is to lose enough weight to ride a roller coaster safely. Or you could put up a doctor’s note of where your blood sugar target should be.
Hang your vision board in your room or office so that you can look at it each day and contemplate all the reasons you want to stick to your diet.

, Another way that you can use those weight loss motivators is by turning them into positive sayings or thoughts. You can post these up so that you see them every day.


Like a vision board, little sticky notes or messages can be a daily reminder of what your weight loss motivators are. Seeing them regularly can help you get a little boost of motivation or encouragement throughout your day.Think about your weight loss motivators and write up positive sayings or thoughts. Write them out on little sticky notes and put them anywhere you know you'll see them.
For example, you can stick them: on the refrigerator, on the bathroom mirror, on the dashboard of your car, on your laptop or computer screen or on your nightstand.
Write out positive sayings like: ""I feel more energetic, happy and confident when I stick to my diet plan."" Or, ""strive for progress, not perfection.""

, Setting up and creating a rewards system is another way to stay motivated with weight loss. You can use your motivators to help you set up rewards for yourself as you get closer to your weight loss goals.


Studies have shown that if dieters set non-food related rewards at small and large weight loss milestones, they're more likely to stay on track with their diet.Use your weight loss motivators to help you set up your reward system. Plan a fun reward every 5, 10 or 15 pounds. Whatever works best for you.
For example, if one of your motivators to lose weight is to be able to ride a roller coaster, your reward could be tickets to an amusement park. Or if one of your motivators is to feel more confident naked or in a bathing suit, a reward could be a purchase of a really nice new bathing suit.

, Writing out your list of weight loss motivators is important and helpful. But if that's all you do, these key list will not be very useful to you.


When you first create your list of weight loss motivators, you may feel inspired, encouraged and ready to tackle any diet. Over time, these feelings can fade.
Once that happens, you need to review that list of motivators. Read your list over a few times and really ponder each and every one of them.
You might want to review your list often - maybe once a week or a few times a month. Think about what you've accomplished and what still motivates you. You may even find that after a while, your motivations change or there are additional ones.

, One part of weight loss that can be difficult to manage is accountability. If you don't stay accountable, you're not as likely to be successful with your weight loss.


Accountability can come in many forms for you. Decide what forms and how you'll stay accountable as you lose weight and then as you maintain your goal weight.
One of the best and simplest ways to stay accountable is using your scale. Hop on at least once a week. Studies have shown this is one of the best ways to maintain your weight loss.Also, go back and look at some of your weight loss motivators. You can also use these to stay accountable.
For example, those old skinny jeans. Try them on and wear them regularly. If they start getting tight, you know it’s time to make some changes. Or if you are diabetic and one goal is to control blood sugar levels, and you notice your blood sugar is going back up, you'll also know that it’s time to reevaluate your diet plan.

, After you've created and reviewed your list of weight loss motivators, get ready to start a weight loss plan. Get on the right track by creating your weight loss goals.


Setting realistic and attainable goals is an equally important part of healthy and successful weight loss.
Even if you're truly motivated by a variety of factors, if you set unrealistic goals you can easily feel like you're failing with your weight loss plan.To start, you should plan to lose 1 to 2 pounds total per week. Losing more than that can be incredibly difficult and may lead to unhealthy or unsafe weight loss techniques.For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds, it'll take you about 5 to 10 weeks to meet that goal.

, Regardless of what weight loss plan you choose to follow, you'll need to cut out some calories. The reduction in calories is what will fuel your weight loss.


In general, most health professionals recommend to cut out about 500 to 750 calories from your entire day.This correlates to losing that safe and sustainable weight loss rate of 1 to 2 pounds per week.
Cutting out more calories than this can lead to you feeling more hungry, increasing your risk of nutrient deficiencies and feeling fatigued. To stay safe, never eat less than 1,200 calories daily.
You may want to consider using a food journal to track your calories. That way, you're staying accountable and know exactly how much you're eating throughout the day.

, Listing out your weight loss motivators and creating a diet plan is a great start to successful weight loss. But don't forget about another important key - exercise.


Health professionals note that if you want to lose weight successfully and keep it off long-term, you'll need to include regular physical activity.Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, helps your body burn more calories. When combined with a modified calorie diet, weight loss will be more successful.
Include 150 minutes of aerobic activity (like walking, jogging or cycling) every week. In addition, include one or two days of strength training activities that work each major muscle group (like yoga, weight lifting or pilates)."

Calculate your recommended daily caloric intake.,
Measure servings before eating.,
Calculate the amount of food you usually eat.,
Compare how much you eat to your recommended daily intake.",How to Know when You Are Overeating1," Your recommended daily calories depend on your age, size, and activity level. They also depend on whether you’re trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain your current weight.Use an online calculator to determine how many calories you should consume each day or read this wikiHow article, How to Calculate Your Total Daily Calorie Needs.
You can also see a personal trainer or a nutritionist for an in-person consultation about how much you should be eating.
Heart rate monitors can be worn to determine exactly how many calories you burn each day.;
, Even if you don’t have a food scale or measuring cup, you can estimate your portions. A cup is about the size of the average person’s fist. A tablespoon is a little bigger than your thumb tip.Some things come packed in single servings. For example, you can buy single servings of yogurt, juice, or even frozen dinners. These items should have nutritional information per serving on the package.
Remember to measure the amount you would normally eat. If you measure less than that, you won’t know whether you’re usually overeating or not.

, Choose a day and eat as you normally would; however, write down everything you’ve eaten that day and how much of each item. Add up the calories and compare them to your recommended daily intake.Many online databases offer free calorie estimates for thousands of foods.
Do your best to estimate. If you eat at restaurants, or if someone else does your cooking, you may need to guess at the calories; however, you can also ask the chef about ingredients and cooking methods. At a restaurant, you can say, “Do you know if this was sautéed in butter?” or “Was this fried?” if you’re not sure.

, This will tell you if you are overeating. For example, if your recommended caloric intake is 1,800 calories per day, but you’re eating 2,200, you’re overeating by 400 calories.


You may want to calculate how much you eat for a few days and take an average. Only calculating for one day might not give you the most accurate results.
Exercise will affect your results. For example, if one day you burn 500 calories exercising, you will be able to eat 500 extra calories without overeating.

Start the cardio.,
Begin weight-training.,
Exercise more often.,
Be realistic about exercise.,
Perform fasted cardio.,
Give Tabatas a shot.",How to Lose 20 Pounds in a Month2," The quickest way to burn fat and, in turn, burn calories is cardio. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Luckily, cardio comes in a number of forms.


Running, biking, swimming, boxing, tennis, dancing, and myriad other activities count as cardio. So if your knees aren't too thrilled about pounding the pavement, turn to other options.

Running, tae kwon do, aerobics, and rope jumping are some of the highest calorie-burning activities out there.
Look into high-intensity-interval-training. The Journal of Physiology released a new study that stated ""HIT means doing a number of short bursts of intense exercise with short recovery breaks in between. The authors have already shown with young healthy college students that this produces the same physical benefits as conventional long duration endurance training despite taking much less time (and amazingly, actually doing less exercise!)"" Not only will you burn more calories, but you'll do it in a shorter amount of time.



, Cardio is great, yes. You definitely need it to lose weight. However, in order to get the best results, you need to do cardio and weight-train.


Cardio can be done every day while weight-training cannot. Your muscles need time to heal. Aim for a cardio workout as often as possible, but limit your weight-training to a few times per week.

, Nothing burns calories faster than brisk exercise. If you’re not already working out at least 3-4 times a week, get started. Your training sessions should be around an hour each and should balance cardiovascular activity with strength and conditioning. Get your heart rate up and your muscles burning. The more you move, you the more you’ll lose, period.Take a couple days off to rest throughout the week. You’ll be in a reduced calorie state, so your recovery time will be even more important than usual.
You’re much more likely to exercise consistently if you can make things fun for yourself. If you’re not the treadmill type, try yoga, swimming, kickboxing, mountain biking, climbing or Crossfit. Anything that keeps you active will benefit your weight loss efforts., If you are rather out of shape (by your own doing or because of a physical problem), you may think that you can't work out. But you can -- you'll just have to work out for longer periods of time. Whether it's low intensity or high, it's still calorie burning and muscle strengthening.


Even adding short walks, taking the stairs, and washing the car count towards your calorie expenditure. If you can't run a 5k right now, relax. Be a little stricter on your diet and walk that 5k in the morning. Every little bit adds up.

, Fasted cardio involves engaging in some type of cardiovascular exercise, such as jogging, swimming or rowing, while on an empty stomach. The idea is that without glycogen (sugars that enter your bloodstream when you eat) from food, your body will begin drawing on its fat stores to convert to ready-to-use energy. Fasted cardio has been shown to help athletes and dieters burn fat at a much faster rate than traditional forms of exercise.The best time to get in a fasted cardio session is after you first wake up, before you’ve eaten breakfast. Your blood sugar will already be sufficiently low from not having eaten overnight.For fasted workouts, keep the intensity low and the duration short. A 20-30 minute jog at a moderate pace or even a brisk walk will be more than enough to reap the benefits.

, Workouts based on the Tabata Protocol, named after the scientist who invented it, are simple yet infinitely challenging: all you have to do is pick a single or compound movement and do it for 20 seconds at a time, with a 10 second rest break in between, for a total of four minutes (8 rounds). Sounds easy, right? Guess again. They’re excruciating and typically leave you heaving in a puddle of your own sweat, but Tabatas are an extremely metabolically-dense method of training, meaning they’ll cause fat to practically melt away.Choose simple movements, like lunges or squat thrusts, that can be repeated multiple times per round.To simplify things when you’re first starting out, only do each round for 10 seconds, with a 20 second rest. Switch to full rounds when you’re ready.
Don’t push yourself too hard. Tabatas are one of the most intense forms of exercise there is and should only be attempted by those who are fit enough to handle it."

Determine your basic metabolic rate.,
Determine your physical activity level.,
Figure out your needed daily calorie burn.,
Sweat the pounds away.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Lose 20 Pounds in a Month3," No matter what you're doing, your body is using energy at a certain rate. The BMR Calculator will calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), that is, the number of calories your body burns if you were to do absolutely nothing all day. This will tell you how fast you're burning calories and therefore how much activity you must do and how many calories you need to cut to meet your weight loss goals. And yes, it does take into account your age, gender, and activity level.



BMR calculation formula for women: 655 + (4.35 x your current weight in pounds) + (4.7 x your height in inches) minus (4.7 x your current age in years).

BMR calculation formula for men: 66 + (6.23 x your weight in pounds) + (12.7 x your height in inches) minus (6.8 x your age in years).

, A number is assigned to each tier of activity. It is taken into consideration when calculating your daily calorie burn.


Little or no exercise = 1.2
Light exercise (up to 3 days per week) = 1.375
Moderate exercise (3 to 5 days per week) = 1.55
Heavy exercise (6 to 7 days per week) = 1.725
Very heavy exercise (intense workouts daily) = 1.9

, To determine this caloric rate, multiply your BMR x your physical activity rate.


This is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). It may seem like a high number; don't forget: You burn calories even while sleeping.
For example, if your BMR is 3,500 and you currently get moderate exercise, all you have to do is multiply 3,500 by 1.55 to get 5425 -- aka the number of calories burned to maintain your weight. For a goal of 20 pounds in a single month, you'll have to cut at least 2,000 calories a day using both diet and exercise. A steep goal, indeed.

, Since water comprises so much of the human body, our cells have a tendency to stash it away for future use. This can result in bloating and accumulation of water weight, tipping the scale higher and higher. Get rid of excess fluids by releasing water from the body in the form of sweat. An hour of continuous cardiovascular exercise or a twenty minute soak in the sauna can help you dump 1-2 pounds of water weight.Make sure you’re drinking a moderate amount of water to cycle fresh fluids into your system and prevent dehydration.Sweating has long been used by boxers, wrestlers and other combat athletes to make weight at pre-bout weigh-ins.

, In order to improve your overall feeling of wellbeing and run at top capacity, you need to make sure you’re well rested. Aim to get at least six hours of deep, uninterrupted sleep every night, though eight is preferable. While you rest, your body will repair damaged cells and tissues, allocate calories for internal use and restore fallen energy levels. When you wake up, you’ll be recharged and ready to redouble your efforts.Due to overwork, insomnia, stress and other issues, many people don’t get adequate sleep and find it impossible to lose weight as a result.
If you can’t find the time to sleep in one long block at night, try taking a couple short naps (10-15 minutes) throughout the day."
"
Drink a glass of water.,
Sit down to eat.,
Put down your utensil between bites.,
Eat before you get too hungry.,
Eat in phases or courses.,
Stop eating when you’re almost full.",How to Know when You Are Overeating2," It takes 20 minutes for the brain to register that the stomach has become full. When our stomachs fill with water, the stomach begins to send those messages to the brain. This will help you eat more slowly, because the brain will register fullness earlier. Many people mistake feelings of thirst for feelings of hunger.
Staying hydrated throughout the day can also prevent you from feeling ravenous at mealtimes. Drink at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) of water daily.

, If you’re walking around or distracted while you eat, chances are that you’re eating quickly and without thinking. When you sit down, you’re carving out a time that is only for eating.Avoid distractions even when sitting down. Turn off the TV or computer.

, This is a great trick to help you eat more slowly. After taking a bite, put down your utensil while you chew. Only pick the utensil back up once you’ve swallowed.If you’re dining with a friend, you can chat between bites, too. Put your utensil down while you engage in conversation. Then, pick it up when you’re ready for another bite.

, If you let yourself get too hungry during the day, you’re likely to overeat later. You’re also more likely to eat very quickly to make the hunger go away, which may result in you ""stuffing"" yourself.If you’re so busy that you forget to eat or don’t have time, plan ahead. Pack a snack in your car or backpack.
If snacking between meals is not an option, you can still try to slow down at mealtime. Remind yourself that eating faster won’t actually make you feel full faster.

, Rather than putting all of your food on your plate, serve yourself a little bit at a time. This has been proven to slow down the eating process.Divide meals into different courses. For example, serve yourself salad before you have your main course, rather than putting both courses on your plate at the same time.
You can divide a meal into smaller servings and eat one serving at a time. Keep additional servings off your plate so you have to physically get up and walk over to have another serving.

, This can be difficult if you aren’t used to stopping before you’re full. Aim to stop eating when you’re 80% full. This may mean eating less than you usually do.After you’ve eaten to 80% fullness, ask yourself if you still feel like eating. You may be used to eating more. If you feel the urge to eat more, even though you’re not hungry, this could be a sign that you usually overeat.

Determine whether you practice emotional eating.,
Check your fullness level halfway through a meal.,
Check again.,
Avoid eating out of boredom.,
Learn to listen to your body’s fullness signals.,
Listen to your clothing.",How to Know when You Are Overeating3," Many people eat out of boredom, or because they feel stressed, tired, or anxious. If you eat when you’re not hungry, you may be an emotional eater. Emotional eating is often related to overeating, because emotional eaters are not eating for nutrition or because they are hungry.Learn to handle stress in positive ways. When you are stressed out you crave high fat, high sugar and processed foods that can lead to overeating by triggering release of insulin. Utilize deep breathing techniques, meditation, or journaling to manage stress.
Try taking notes on what you eat and how you are feeling emotionally. If you notice a correlation between feelings and eating, you may be an emotional eater.
Check your fullness level. When you notice yourself reaching for a snack, stop and ask yourself if you’re actually hungry. If the answer is often “no,” you are probably engaging in emotional eating.

, Before you scarf down your entire sandwich, stop for a moment. Put down your food and take a breath. Ask yourself if you’re still hungry. If so, how hungry are you? If you’re surprised to find that you’re actually satisfied but had planned to finish your meal, you may be used to overeating.You can rate your hunger level on a scale of one to 10. Let one be ravenously hungry and 10 be sick from overeating.
Remember your number rating for this meal. If you notice that halfway through most meals you’re rating your hunger level at a seven or higher, you may be used to overeating.

, Once you’ve checked in halfway through your meal, check in again a bit later. If you’ve eaten half of the food on your plate at your first check-in, but are still hungry, eat half of what is left. Once you’ve eaten that half, check in again.If you now feel satisfied, stop eating. Notice if you still have the urge to finish your food, even though you’re not hungry. If you do, you may be used to overeating.

, Eating due to boredom is another form of emotional eating. When we eat because of boredom, we rarely notice what or how much we’re eating. For example, you may open a bag of chips and not even notice how many you’re eating until you’ve finished the bag.It’s perfectly okay to snack, but stay aware of what you’re eating and how much. Put a specific number of chips on a plate and eat them consciously.
If you have the urge to eat because you’re bored, stop yourself. Think of something else you could do instead. You could do the dishes, take a walk, brush your teeth, read a book, or chat with a friend. Many activities can take the place of eating simply because you’re bored.

, This can be difficult to learn if you’re not used to it. If you don’t know when you’re full, ask yourself a series of questions to determine what your body needs.Has your hunger subsided?
Does the food still taste good? Is the taste the only reason you’re still eating?
Will you be able to get up from your meal and comfortably walk around?
Do you feel tired from how much you’ve eaten?
Have you eaten enough to last until your last meal?

, If you’re not sure what your body is telling you, try listening to your waistband. If the waistband of your pants begins to feel tight or uncomfortable, you are most likely full or even overly full."

Exercise.,
Eat high protein, low-glycemic index foods.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Manage depression or other psychiatric disorders.,
Take nutritional supplements.",How to Know when You Are Overeating4," When you exercise or are regularly physically active your body not only burns more calories but it also alters your sense of satiety. Physically active people have decreased hunger sensation at least in the short run., It is long has been known that filling up on high-quality protein foods such as legumes, chicken, fish, and almond butter, combined with low-glycemic index foods such as cucumbers, carrots, celery, yellow squash and sprouted bread keeps you feeling full and prevents overeating.

, Having supportive friends and role models in your life will make you want to imitate them and strive to be better every day. This can help motivate you to reach your goals, which may include putting a stop to overeating.

, While depression can lead to under eating, it also can lead to overeating. Managing your depression with exercise, food, counseling and possibly medication can help with overeating.

, Fish oil, chromium, conjugated linoleic acid are examples of some supplements that can help with feeling of satiety and prevent overeating. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist before taking supplements, as they can react with other medications you may be taking.

You may have plenty of leptin in your body, but if it can't be picked up and identified, it won't do you any good. So cut out the fructose -- namely, high fructose corn syrup -- to let your body do its job.



Many processed foods contain fructose. The simplest way to reduce your intake is to avoid anything prepackaged.
;
, It's about time we get used to this idea, huh? The fact of the matter is that simple carbs (refined, sugary, and generally white) spike your insulin levels, which in turn leads to resistance and messes with your leptin production. So white bread, white rice, and all those delicious baked goods that are calling your name are now on the no-no list (that's the technical term).



Browner, darker grains such as whole oats, quinoa, and some whole wheat pastas tend to have more nutrients. Whiter foods have usually been stripped of them during processing.


, Some people will tell you to cut out carbs pretty much entirely. You can do this if you so choose, but be sure not to send your body signals that it's starving. If you're not getting enough nutrients, your body will start shutting down and your hormones will get all sorts of out of whack. And to top it off, you'll need massive amounts of will power because you'll be so hungry. Not a good setup for success.


Yes, losing weight is good for leptin production. When you're at a healthy weight, your hormones regularize (in a normal situation, of course). If you're overweight or obese, it's a good idea to get on a diet plan -- just make sure it's healthy, balanced, and something you can maintain for the long-term.

, If you decided to make the leap to the Atkins/raw/paleo diet and you have pretty much nothing in the realm of carbs day in and day out, have a refeed day. Your body needs the carbs to fuel up and to realign itself and give your metabolism that awakening jolt it's been craving. Aim for 100 -150% more than normal on that one day and then resume your diet as normal.


This is good for motivation, too. It's pretty impossible to avoid pizza for the rest of your life, but when you know you can have it on Saturday, it's easier to say no on Wednesday. There's a reason some people call this a ""cheat"" day!

, Seriously. Don't do it. It just messes with your metabolism and messes with your hormones, leaving a permanent mark. And you wind up gaining the weight back and then some! So pick a diet that is sustainable and healthy. Plenty of research points in the direction that diet is what makes or breaks you -- your body can't afford to have bouts of starvation between bouts of junk. It just can't keep up.Crash dieting is another mistake that hurts you in the long run. Without the increase in leptin, you'll easily gain the weight back.


, This gets your leptin levels going right outta the gate. Your body will be fueled up for the entire day, keeping you feeling fuller, longer. So skip the doughnut (four cream puffs later and you're still asking what's for lunch) and go for eggs and lean meats.When it comes to leptin, cereals have gotten a bad rap. They're full of lectin, which actually binds to your leptin receptors, keeping leptin from being able to do its job. It's like when your roommate is in the bathroom, only they never, ever leave.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are super good for increasing your body's sensitivity to leptin, making it more receptive. And they're great for your heart and cholesterol levels, too.So load up on salmon, mackerel, herring, and all that delicious, flaky sea fare.


Grassfed meats and chia seeds are good for Omega-3s, too. What you don't want are Omega-6s -- vegetable oils, conventional meats, and grains. These lead to inflammation and reduce leptin levels overall., Fruits and veggies (especially ones like spinach, kale, and broccoli) are jam packed with nutrients and yet have few calories -- that means you can eat a ton, fill up fast, and not see it on your waistline. Since leptin has a lot to do with weight control, having a diet high in these foods means you're doing your part, taking care of your body yourself.


Fiber is also great for leptin levels, mainly because it keeps you feeling full -- and generally fiber-rich foods are natural and good for you in other ways, too. Peas, beans, lentils, almonds, raspberries, broccoli, and oats are all great sources., As for the sweeteners, those are just an extra artificial flavor zing that you don't really need. In fact, some people go as far as to say don't use commercial soaps and deodorants to avoid putting toxins in your body.How far do you want to take it?


As for the snacking part, it's generally believed that your body needs to reset itself; if you're snacking constantly, it can't really do that. But if the snacking bug hits and you can't resist, aim for a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts to curb the craving.

, Studies have shown that those with leptin deficiencies also usually have zinc deficiencies -- and strangely enough, obese people generally have them, too.So combat this phenomenon by loading up on spinach, beef, lamb, seafood, nuts, cocoa, beans, mushrooms, and pumpkin., When we're anxious and strung out, our body ups our production of cortisol. That cortisol then messes up the rest of our hormones, including leptin. If you've heard of stress eating, you'll understand the connection. So if relaxing is something you don't remember how to do, make it a point to relearn. Your leptin levels depend on it!


If it's not already part of your routine, experiment with yoga or meditation. They've both been shown to have relaxing effects, leading to better sleep and lower cortisol levels. Don't knock 'em till you've tried 'em!

, This gets straight to the source: sleep regulates your leptin and ghrelin levels (ghrelin is the hormone that tells your body you're hungry). Not enough rest and your body starts producing ghrelin and not producing leptin. So hit the hay in time to get about 8 hours every night.


To make it easier to do, cut out using electronics a couple hours before bedtime. The light tells our brains that it's important to stay awake and thus we feel more alert. Cut them out earlier and your brain will know it's time to go to bed.

, Crazy. Never thought you'd hear that, huh? But yep -- there's such a thing as cardio burnout when it comes to leptin. Too much cardio (the endurance, long-lasting kind) raises cortisol levels, increases oxidative damage, systemic inflammation, depresses the immune system and decreases fat metabolism. None of these things is good for you! So take this as an excuse to skip the gym once in a while -- indeed, too much of a good thing is bad.For the record, some cardio is fine. Interval training (especially high-intensity interval training) is great for you, as long as you don't overdo it.


, On the other hand, leading a sedentary lifestyle isn't good for you, either. So when you do hit the gym, stick to cardio interval training (running for a minute, walking for a minute in 10 or so cycles, for example) and some weightlifting. You want to be healthy and relatively fit -- not a skinny couch potato.


Make it a point to be active naturally. Instead of forcing yourself to go to the gym, go for a hike, go to the swimming pool, or initiate a basketball game with friends. Exercise doesn't have to be ""exercise,"" you know? At least it doesn't have to feel like it!

, There are currently two medications on the market right now that can deal with leptin: Symlin and Byetta.For the record, they're actually on the market to fight Type II diabetes, but leptin is a part of that. If you think you're a candidate, talk to your doctor. Only he or she can point you in the right direction.


Your doctor can test your leptin levels. If something's off, they'll be able to see right away. However, the first thing they'll tell you is to work on your diet and your lifestyle; there is no easy way out (like a medication) when it comes to this hormone regulation.

, People who sit for too long without movement may open themselves up to a host of illnesses including obesity and heart disease. Even those who sit all day and go directly to the gym are at risk.Schedule regular breaks during the day to go for a walk, do some light stretching, or even going to the restroom to increase your NEAT.Schedule time every 30 – 60 minutes to get up and get a glass of water, stretch, or go for a walk around your yard, office, or campus.
